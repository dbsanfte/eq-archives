<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is a Greatstaff of the Four Winds with an Anger III augment on it enough to keep aggro in Hard LDoN / Elemental planes XP groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no idea about elementals, seeing as I still lack VZ, RZ, and Agnarr for that.  But in hard LDoN, I use a GSot4W with only anger II and have no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I usually suggest putting anger 3 on a weapon that already has a good amount of hate off the innate proc. I used GSoT4W with anger 3 for a while and loved it, so I would recommend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still don't get why people want to ruin a perfectly good DPS weapon by putting Anger on it. You would get WAY better agro if you put A3 on your BoC. If you are really worried about riposte, keep your shield offhand, you will still get better agro our of your BoC. Put a lifetap aug on the GSot4W so you can use it for DPS when you don't want agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">put anger3 on your BoC and a yak aug on your GSoFW.  the yak aug will add dps but wont draw aggro off a tank that needs to have it when youre not supposed to have it.  you get the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
<br />
duel wield is not suicide in hard ldon or GoD.  anyone who tells you that if full of it and needs to go try it out.  either that or they lack the hps/ac/aa's to effectively tank them and shouldnt be ther ein the first place.<br />
<br />
you will be helping yourself in the long run by anger3'ing your BoC.  its mega aggro paired with any other proccing weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't go through his magelo, didn't relize you had a BoC. I would aug that with anger 3 for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">on a side note ... though its not that good for a warrior i'm impressed that you have the 8th shawl.  you have to be one of the only warriors on any server to sink so much time into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You got a boc, a chsd and a gsot4w. I would aug the boc with anger3, throw a yak procs on the chsd and use that for tanking. Throw a poison proc or permafrost on the gtot4w for dps. <br />
<br />
But to answer your question, a gsot4w is a nice weapon, but even with anger3 there will be situations when where you will fall short. Although normal groups I could see it being plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To answer wandor's question, that would assume you could get your hands on a BoC.  The Idol/AoW is farmed on my server.  And the BoC costs 200K+ on a lucky day.  Therefore on the idea of you make due with what you can get your hands on, it's easier to get a GSot4W than a BoC.  I just use a WMBS for DPS.  Call it the poor warriors choice of weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have to agree with wandor .. why waste an aggro proc on a weapon that isnt built for aggro?  you can buy better aggro in the bazaar (greatstaff of thunder) and aggro aug it.  in the end you will be much better off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And you say it's not that you don't like me.  You did say in another thread &quot;i've got a yak auged gsofw&quot;.  Somehow in light of what you've posted here, that seems, how did you put it another one of your posts, &quot;deceitful&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have never had the opportunity to get a GBoS, every time my guild has done Eindride he has dropped the mantle (more often than not) or the ornate BP mold.  Therefore my comment of making due with what you can get your hands on still stands, especially in reference to the BoC.  You can always unaug the weapon and the  510 point anger or yak aug isn't that painful to unaug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Therefore my comment of making due with what you can get your hands on still stands, <br />
<br />
Yeah well, make due with Droga weapons for aggro then.  You don't need a Blade of Carnage to hold aggro.  Keep the 41/31 your DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree<br />
<br />
The Droga weapons are more easily attained than the others in question and better aggro than gso4w.Also, you can drop them to offhand when you upgrade.<br />
<br />
Aug the BOC with a3 and offhand the chsd.I'd prolly only move the BOC from mainhand for a BF,Hategiver,or BOW/SEWS pre time.With the first 2 you can still benefit greatly with the BOC offhand and not lose the aug investment.<br />
<br />
Any decent weapon with a3 will prolly work in most ep xp groups.But why weaken your potential aggro it doesn't make sense.Get the most aggro you can it'll make everything easier and more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can respect what you and Gunner are saying Haas, but those weapons are like my old GSoT; I want to burn them once I can finally get rid of them :(  How do you deal with the perception surrounding them?

The sa in my guild prefers form to function to some degree and makes it work  for himself.He's been wielding a double edged stormblade and a SBOD both auged with anger 3 for awhile now and does well when he's tanking even though they're not normally respected tanking weapons.So if you're having fun and able to do the job when you have to that's what counts for most people.<br />
<br />
However,this board does a great job of helping warriors become more proficient tanks.So advice is given with an eye to helping warriors better themselves over the short and long term, to maximize their potential.With augs and other aggro improvements warriors can now do their job without the traditional tanking weapons.However, the more aggro you produce the better for your groups and raids.Aggro should be any tanks primary concern and I don't believe you can have too much,at least not in my experience so far.So settle for what makes you happy,but, expect serious considerations about performance on this board.<br />
<br />
If you have an auged gsot4w already and it's working I'd probably stick with it  until you win a BOC,GBOS or better.No way would I use it over a BOC/CHSD combo.It just feels wrong hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/boggle<br />
<br />
mvr .. i just dont understand you   :rolleyes: ... dont get your panties in a wad because you were ousted bullshitting ... i wasnt the only one who brought up the fact there was something fishy about your claim.<br />
<br />
Heh how am i being deceitful again?  i have a yak augment on my stick because it lets me:<br />
<br />
1. use it as a dps weapon without peeling from my MT (when i'm not MT) <br />
while at the same time<br />
2. keeping my aggro decently high should the MT fall and i need to step up to the plate.<br />
<br />
for 510pts at 100dd component ... its a relatively cheap augment that serves 2 purposes.  A single yak proc will not ever draw unwanted aggro from a competent MT, therefore i will yak aug my dps weapons, unless my dps weapons have an innate hate proc.  510 points for a 100dd is not that expensive (a whopping 2 adventures more than a 100 cold dd).  The question here had to do with an anger3 augment ... which ...<br />
<br />
is a waste on a GSoFW.  youre trying to turn the thing into something it was never intended to be. anything with an anger3 is going to be decent aggro.  putting an anger3 on something with an aggro proc built in (whether it be droga 1handers or a cheap GSoT), will turn it into an aggro magnet.<br />
<br />
in the end who the hell cares what people think of you?  there is a reason why every warriors without better on all servers has a droga combo ... its because IT WORKS.  Greatstaffs of thunder used to cost 50-100k on my server when BoT was just opening up, and carrying one around was a status symbol, as it was (and still is) great aggro.  now that they are dirt common and cost 100p in the bazaar, though, people consider them rubbish, which i find ridiculous.  before i got my duel wield setup, i used a GSoT ... and if i were to lose my setup for some reason, i would go back to it.<br />
<br />
EB &gt; droga duelwield = GSoT &gt; GSoFW<br />
<br />
if youre looking for strong aggro, with low ripostes, yak aug or anger 2 augment a Greatstaff of thunder.  your aggro with that will be much stronger than a greatstaff of four winds with anger3.  i know this for a fact because my dinky anger2-GSoT used to peel aggro off a warrior i used to group with who had a GSoFW + anger3 practically every fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting. Lemme touch on a few points for you here.<br />
<br />
First of all, how do I deal with the perception?  Simple, I don't give a shit what anyone else thinks (everyone here should already know that).  Second of all, if people are skeptical about your tanking ability because you're using weapons that do the job, then their PERCEPTIONS ARE WRONG.<br />
<br />
They're wrong, that's all there is to it.  When droga was revamped, this place was a buzz for weeks...these were the weapons that the common warriors could FINALLY get ahold of in order to do their job.  Now they're not good enough?  Fine, whatever, go back to the windblade or the Frostbringer and Snare whip.  See how they like the aggro then. <br />
<br />
It's simple...if you're raiding with people who don't understand how powerful the 2 droga weapons are in relation to the weapons available to the majority of warriors, then you don't want to be raiding with those people.   They're wrong.  And no matter how much they think they know because they've lead XX raids on Ubermob01, they're still wrong, and will always be wrong.<br />
<br />
THEY'RE WRONG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I remember when seeing a warrior with 2 fleshgrinder was cool, but fleshgrinder are no where near the agro of sotbs and chos. Personally I prefered gsot for agro, but i think getting pb3 early on, helped my 2hander agro alot.<br />
<br />
But hell, if you auged the chos with 125d yak, and the sotbs with with the 100d yak, you would have some great weapons that would do wonders when tanking. I bet a gsot4w even with anger 3 couldn;t pull agro from you. anger3 is 1150 points, both yak procs 1270 total points<br />
<br />
droga combo and gsot are cheap as shit, but they work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Anger3 on a GSo4W is good aggro.  I'd use it over droga weapons any day.<br />
<br />
With the advent of anger3, a weapon need not have a kick-ass innate hate proc to make it a good tanking choice.  Look at how many people are wielding VDD or SEWS.  They donot have innate hate procs, but with anger3 they are all of a sudden worth wielding.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because people are learning that it isnt just procs that build your hate, but a combination of procs AND DPS.  And, frankly, I'd rather rely on my DPS weapon (who's aggro does not rely as much on the RNG) than one that relies on Procs (like the droga weapons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Aggro is generated by dps? When did that change?<br />
Do you mean ratio?<br />
<br />
 Getting teh points for a Anger3 seems to me to be a fairly substantial investment of time; whatever you put it on should last you a while as your first choice for an aggro weapon. I'd put it on a 1-hand primary weapon that already had an innate hate proc before I put it on a 2-hander, especially if I figured the 1-hand was not going to be replaced any time soon.<br />
In the case of the original post: What Haass and Wandor said.<br />
If I figured my primary 1-hander was going to be replaced soon, I think I'd still save the Anger 3 for the replacement weapon before I put it on a non-proc'ing 2-hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Aggro is generated by dps? When did that change?<br />
Do you mean ratio?<br />
<br />
In the long run, they mean the same thing.<br />
<br />
In the short run, though, it's not exactly DPS per se, its more potential damage.  Mathematically, the terms are interchangable when looking at a large subset, so I just use &quot;DPS&quot; instead of &quot;number of swings&quot; because DPS is a lot faster to type :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">When I got my BOW I used it unauged with no offensive aa except wa-5.When I auged it with anger 3 the differance was huge.With the offensive AA's Ive done since auging the bow(I still had no offensive AA's when I auged it) I've noticed a reasonable improvement in aggro.One A3 aug is much greater than all the offensive aa i've done for aggro imo.Procs are of much greater weight than dps for aggro generation so consider seriously what you're investing in.<br />
<br />
SEWS and VDD were considered good aggro weapons before we had augs.So if you aug them you get great aggro weapons.Gsot4w was not considered a good aggro weapon from what i've read here so auging it with a3 results in an ok aggro weapon.You can do the job with a no proc weapon auged with a3.You do it better with an auged high aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">And, frankly, I'd rather rely on my DPS weapon (who's aggro does not rely as much on the RNG) than one that relies on Procs (like the droga weapons). <br />
<br />
Man, you guys are seriously overrating this whole DPS thing in the Arena.  I mean SERIOUSLY.<br />
<br />
Yes, your DPS will have an effect upon your aggro, and yes the weapon's ratio will be a factor in that equation, but you can not successfully hold aggro with DPS alone....not over real DPS classes.  <br />
<br />
I thought my windblade was fucking awesome when I got it, it replaced 2 fleshgrinders.  I could actually hold aggro with it.  The truth is that it just held aggro better than dual wielding 2 shitty DD procs.  It doesn't even hold a candle to anything that is designed for aggro, and never will.  The windblade will fall so far behind the droga combo after a short time that you might as well be swearing and throwing the keyboard out the window for all the good it will be doing to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
Your potential damage will have an impact on your aggro capabilities, but if you compare it to Anger, Force Shock, Anarchy, Enraging blow...anything like that, and it's insignificant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;at how many people are wielding VDD or SEWS. They donot have innate hate procs&quot;<br />
<br />
unless i'm seriously mistaken, VDD proc is pretty large .. what with its ac debuff i believe?  its not EB .. but its enough so that it + ratio makes it stronger aggro than a BoWar.  SEWS proc has some aggro (altho not a lot) ... and it does add up over time.   these weapons outclass GSoFW, though.  and i could bet my ass that a droga combo + duel anger3 is better sustainable longterm aggro then a SEWS + anger3 ... even moreso now with WA5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Getting back to the original question....<br />
<br />
I used to DW a CHSD and GBoS.  It works well but my normal group consists of a druid, shammy, bard, mage, and wiz.  We primarly do hard Ldons, GoD Trials or Sol Ro.  The group decided as a whole that I should get the GS4W and an ang III aug.  I love using it and have swapped from DW part of the time (Guild raids) to using the GS4W/ang 3 full time.  In my groups it allows everyone to let loose and on raids it allows me to hold aggro when I'm MT.   If I'm not MT/SA I just swap to something fun and either work throwing or bash.  I've tanked MM, Jiva and other planer progression mobs to name a few.     Basically, if this is the best that is available to you, it will be worth it to aug it as it serves well as an aggro weapon.  It will be dependent on whats available to you, your normal groups and the zones you normally exp in.  Personally its been a great weapon for me and I would recommend it.  If you have something better, you may want to consider auging that weapon instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings Tarnia, but you auged the wrong weapon. You have 2 very good agro weapons. Put A3 on which ever you use mainhand and it would far surpass the agro of a GSot4w+A3. Even moreso when you get WA5. Yes, big DPS weapon do generate more agro than smaller DPS weapons, that is not being disputed. But there is no 2h weapon in the game that can generate the amount of agro you will get from 2x A3 + 2x Stun procs. If you have better than 2x stun for innate procs, the gap gets even wider.<br />
<br />
It's been said a thousand times. You can put A3 on a wet noodle and it will be &quot;enough&quot; to hold agro. But you will get much better agro if you put A3 on a wet noodle with a stun/EB innate proc. How hard is that to understand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wandor, I have to disagree.  If she's using the A3+GSot4W and has no complaints, then who are you to tell her she augged the wrong weapon?  She has the aggro she wants and the dps she wants.  She builds more aggro using furious than dual droga weapons ever will, and she is less at the whim of a bad RNG to hurt her aggro per minute.<br />
<br />
Sure, I could argue for or against using a SEWS vs Droga weapons, and each have their pros and cons.  Some are in one camp, some are in the other (just like some people like VDD more and some like SEWS more).<br />
<br />
If she's happy, how can you say she made the wrong decision?</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have come here saying they augged shit like the splitblade and do fine with it before, so yes, actually you can get away with augging garbage weapons.  The question is, why would you want to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Do not compare sews or vdd to gsot4w. The proc from  gsot4w is a nuke, and poor nuke at that. 70 damage, so 1 proc from the staff generates about as much as 1 swing from the weapons. Sews and VDD have procs that generate an above average amount of agro. SEWS procs rune3, which I would estimate at 300+ agro per proc, maybe more. VDD is a nuke and AC debuff, simmiliar to frost bite from frostbringer except better, that procs is probably3-400 agro. They are fair weapons to make into an agro weapon. They aren't quite as good as stuns or hate, but they are a huge jump from pure nuke. Useing anger3 to make VDD or SEWS into your tnaking weapon is very efficient. Not quite as good as hate weapons, but still good.</div></div><hr />

If she's happy, how can you say she made the wrong decision?Plenty of people put A3 on a no proc weapon and are happy with the agro. A wet noodle+A3 would be similar to an unaug'd BoC and certainly better than the plethora of stun weapons available.<br />

She's happy now because she doesn't know what she is missing. Put A3 on the 2 1hers and see what kind of agro she gets. You don't mean to tell me that GSot4W+A3 would even come close to comparing to CHSD+A3 paired with GBoS+A3? The difference would be huge going from 1dd+1A3 proc to 2stun+2A3 procs. Not even in the same ball park. The difference in DPS is not that huge and would certainly not come even close to making up the proc agro she is missing. That is why I can say she auged the wrong weapon, because she gimped herself by settling for less agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">&quot;Going back to the origional question&quot;...<br />
<br />
Yeh, people have tanked with less of a proc in ep's than a3 so any decent weapon with a3 will work.Though it will work much less well than a weapon with a good innate aggro proc and a3 togeather.He has a BOC hehe.Tarnia ,I'd bet that if you had auged the gbos with a3(or the chsd for that matter) your aggro would be much better than with the gsto4w with a3.<br />
<br />
2 strong aggro procs &gt; 1 especially concerning timing.For people coming here for answers that is the point.<br />
<br />
Now when my BOW didnt proc it sucked for aggro early in the fight enough I switched back to my Bf/BOC for xpin before I auged it.No way was the extra dps compensating for the missing a3 proc I had on my Bf at the time.Since I've auged the BOW it draws close enough in comparison with the Bf/BOC setup that it's a wash to the rng imo.<br />
<br />
So Daabu I'm a lil confused...are you saying that unauged a gsot4w is better aggro than:<br />
<br />
                1) BOC/CHSD (the setup comparison origionally brought up in this thread).<br />
                2) GBOS/CHSD (Tarnia's old setup).<br />
<br />
                3) CHOS/SOTB (Droga weapons-a godsend when i got them).<br />
  all unauged.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point is people read these threads to learn and misinformation is bad for Steelwarrior.Yeh a3 any number of no- proc weapons and you're not far from BOC aggro.However,you would still be far behind BOC + a3.Of course ratio counts.How many people are going to toss an a3 aug on a fs weapon, get real.<br />
<br />
No one here is suggesting you can't have fun playing your warrior wielding a windblade auged with a3,or ,that it definately won't be enough aggro for the people you play with.They're giving advice to help you tank better.That's at least part of the reason you come here right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">To Wandor and the others suggesting that I should have augged the 1 handers, a big part of my decision to go to the GS4w with ang 3 over the DW combo was my normal group.  I have a shammy and druid for healing and we found that it was much more efficient as a group for me to weild a 2h over DW in the zones we hunt.  My aggro is not an issue with this group.  Sure, I could have put an ang 3 on the CHSD but I don't use that weapon for my normal play style so it did not make sense to do so.  I'm happy with the results as are my group mates.  Since the original question is whether or not its a good idea, I can say that for my situation it works great and I enjoy it.  I also advocated that if he has something better, the Ang 3 aug would be better served going on that weapon.  <br />
<br />
Weapon choices are individual things based on what is available to them, play style and normal hunting grounds.  Not everyone has access to a BOC, BF or BOW; that means that you are going to find something that works for you and go with it.  <br />
<br />
I don't play enough to just aug everything I want to.  I'm saving up my points right now for my next big upgrade.  Bottom line, I'm extremely happy with my weapon set up as are my group mates which is all that matters.</div></div><hr />
