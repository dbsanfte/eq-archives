<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currenly using the windblade.  My 1hs weps BotS and SboL just dont seem to do for me like the 2hs weap.  I am not in a raiding guild nor want to be any remote time soon.  We are a pretty casual guild doing lots of Ldons and small flags.  <br />
<br />
Do you suggest the Anger aug or a more DD aug?  I dont MT all the time (in fact, I usually do not now since I am not 65) so I am more of a DSP tank.  In the future, I will probably be doing a lot more MT.  What is your thoughts on the 2hs?<br />
<br />
I intend to eventually aug the SboT with an anger aug and maybe get the 1hs weapon out of Guk but that will take a bit since I am not an everday player.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy a GSoT and augment it with either stun or anger. Use that for aggro. You can add a straight DPS proc onto the windblade if you'd like, there are some really cheap ones that couldn't hurt. It's really not worth it to augment a non-proc weapon with aggro, because it'll be subpar aggro always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">depends on what you like.  if you like duel wielding, sell some stuff and save up for a CHoS and slap an anger2, yak, or even anger3 on it.<br />
<br />
if you like 2handers, get a GSoT and aggro augment it.  <br />
<br />
the GSoT will provide more aggro unless you have a good aggro proccer in the offhand as well.  with a cookie cutter combo CHoS and SoBS, with anger2 on CHoS, aggro will be about even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Isnt the GSoT no drop off the named in BoT?  Im not real up to date on changes so if not, Im on it!<br />

Thanks again all for the response!</div></div><hr />

I think you are mistaken by the GBoS (Great Blade of Storms), which is NODROP, and drops on BoT Tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and/or GSo4W ( greatstaff of the four winds ) <br />
<br />
but yeah, keep the windblade for pure DPS; get a cheap Greatstaff of Thunder ( GSoT ), augment that sucker with AngerII or III; go to town.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In your situation Ykesha is better than Anger3 for the DPS.  Anger2 is mostly pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have anger 2 on both my weapons and it definitely is not pointless.  My dual wield setup (see my magelo) will outagro an unauged BoW easily.  Anger 3 would be better of course but if you don't do a lot of LDoN then anger 2 is a good compromise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Erm... 400hate for 510 points.... 600hate for 1150... which is pointless again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Erm... 400hate for 510 points.... 600hate for 1150... which is pointless again?<br />
<br />
If you don't live in LDoN 1150 points is kind of a lot.  I happened to have 1200 points to spend when I bought my augs but only had 550 in EF at the time.  So basically I had a choice of doing a lot of adventures with no extra agro procs until I could afford anger 3 and then doing it again for the off hand or getting 2 agro procs and then being able to use those until I could aug both weapons with anger 3.   With 2 anger 2 procs going off all the time, I get very good agro.<br />
<br />
It was a compromise based on me not doing a lot of LDoN adventures because I prefer to raid with my guild instead.  I still think two anger 2 procs is going to be a good improvement over no anger procs for people who don't spend a lot of time in LDoN so anger 2 is an ok choice for them.  I am still saving up points for anger 3 but all this time I have been using the anger 2 procs has been made much easier for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's what I tried to point out Bonequest :)<br />
<br />
That Anger II is not pointless, that for the same amount of points, you can get 2 Anger II procs and augment your DW set up, and for someone that cant do Hard LDoN and gets 51 points per adventure like me, Anger II surely isnt pointless, I count every point I have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">point arff was trying to make was that anger2 is 510 points<br />
<br />
you can get a yak aug which has more hate and adds a small bit of dps for that cost.  just do guk instead of ef.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Seriously GET ANGER 3 , <br />
<br />
i slapped anger 3 on a BOC (and had to give it away , gods but it hurt to strip that aug ,when i got a Bloodfrenzy ) and anger three procs twice a minute , Boc procs the same , that works out to 2600 hate in procs per minute , <br />
<br />
the Stun on CHoS works out to about 300 hate i'm told and same for SoTBs even with anger two on both ( 400 hate ) procs in off hand are half the procs in main <br />
<br />
so CHoS with anger two = 1400 off handed Sotbs = 700 that still works out to only 2100 hate per minute <br />
<br />
if you take same weapon with anger three in main , its own proc equalling 300 and anger 3 = 600 thats 1800 hate off just your mainhand  this is why anger three costs more BUT the anger three in main is same as anger 2 in both main and offhand in the case of CHoS and SotBs<br />
this frees up a slot for another aug , altho in a perfect world anger three in both hands with that combo wouls work out to 2700 hate in one minute , which is nice <br />
<br />
all figures are assuming Dex maxed btw there is a thread somewhere on this site giving proc values and timing <br />
<br />
personally ? me ? well i got anger three on a bloodfrenzy with weapon affinity 4 , works out as huge hate of 7 procs a minute <br />
4 EB 3 Anger three , thats 4600 hate a minute without offhand <br />
<br />
if you ever get the chance to get a bloodfrnzy it procs 3 times a minute without any augs at all   <br />
<br />
in short , yntil you get a BoW or similar forget about agro woth the windblade , if you got good clerics use dual weild until you're killing mobs that riposte LOTS  then a GSoT with anger three is EXCELLENT <br />

<br />
No. Never.<br />
I think I can say I have better aggro Weaps than you, and no, I don't out-aggro an unauged BoW.<br />
So I don't see how you could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jziad MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think yak is supposed to be more hate than anger 2 and less than anger 3.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt call anger 2 useless though, i use it and like it, got it with spare points i had from other places while working points in EF for anger 3. Takes long enough to get the points as it is, without having to open up points in guk first too, so yeah I auged with anger 2 first, thinking I might off hand it when i get anger 3, however if i get a good 2h first i may anger 3 aug that, so banking an auger2 auged wep is less painful that an anger 3 or yak one. *shrug*<br />
<br />
However I'm not sure I would anger 2 a 2h straight off if i planned to get anger 3. Not unless the 2h was a stop gap and i planned to upgrade but needed something in the mean time.</div></div><hr />

I gotta Agree with this. <br />
<br />
I get owned by BoW and I have everything from SOD with Anger III and CHoS with Ykesha as well as SotB with Anger II to a GBOS.<br />
<br />
There is no combo in there that EASILY pulls agro off an un-aug'd blade of war.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">could a GSoT with anger3 outaggro a BoW or not a chance in hell?<br />
<br />
BoW = 1400hate per min w/ procs<br />
A3,GSoT= 2200 hate per min<br />
<br />
BoW does a hell of a lot more dps, and the stats are a hell of a lot better, but for straight aggro purposes would it hold up in a lengthy fight once procs starting rolling in and building up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jziad MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">agro per swing is much greater with the BoW and its only a little slower, procs aside the BoW is far greater agro. A string of procs might pull agro if nothing else was used I guess.<br />
<br />
Not sure why you'd want to try and out agro a BoW if you had a gsot mind. If you're supposed to have agro they shouldnt be fighting you for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">was only curious if you could turn baz trash (albeit tasty trash) into aggro superior to an unauged BoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
before ldon came out, BoW as the endall for aggro as far as warriors were concerned (until DBoTW).  with no ldon procs available, it was the best possible arguably, and warriors who had one always bragged that nobody could touch them once they got movin along.<br />
<br />
just curious if you could take baz trash and turn it into aggro comparable to &quot;the best&quot; pre ldon aggro setup.</div></div><hr />

Lighten up, and use your melon.  He's not talking about going raiding with his guild and trying to steal agro from the BoW-equipped MT.  He's asking about building an agro weapon, for a non-guilded player, or one who's in a very casual, non-raiding guild.  Ya know, it's the same deal all of us non-oobar players have gone through at least once, looking at what gear is available to the high end player, and saying to one's self &quot;ya know, I bet I could have a set-up that good some day too !&quot;  It's like people who still drool over gear such as a BoC, or HoRZ, even tho that gear is approx. 3 years, and 4?? expansions old.  It's the same deal here.  Many people see gear like a BoW, and realize that they aren't likely to have one themselves for some time, if ever.  But, if you know that you can obtain something else that does a comparable job, it gives you something to shoot for.<br />
<br />
So lighten up, and answer the question if ya can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">On the surface, it would seem that an augmented GSoT would have better long term agro than a BoW, with substancially less DPS. I guess it would depend on just how much less DPS because it just might be enough to overcome the difference in proc agro. Of course, the point is moot because you can always put A3 on the BoW.</div></div><hr />
