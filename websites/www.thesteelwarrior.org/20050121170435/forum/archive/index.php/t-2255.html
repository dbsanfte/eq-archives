In designing Lost Dungeons of Norrath, we haven't forgotten about those who enjoy raiding. In addition to the multitude of rewarding single-group adventures, LDoN also includes exciting and challenging events targeted at six groups or less. <br />
<br />
For the first time, raids take place in truly private zones, where your groups can test their mettle and focus solely on the task at hand. Instead of limiting the availability of content by who can get there first, this new system only limits participation based on whether or not you have recently succeeded or failed at each event within a given period. This allows us to place a heavy emphasis on skill, while remaining in control of the influx of new items into the game. <br />
<br />
While our primary focus for LDoN is the single group experience, we are working diligently to ensure that these new raids are centered around the principles of organizational tactics, individual skill, and most importantly - fun. <br />
<br />
We feel that the core content and rewards in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will entertain and benefit even the most experienced players. We are aware of the desire for high-end raid content and will continue to address and meet those needs over time. <br />
<br />
- The EverQuest Team &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll take the obvious and say bad here. I'll credit them for actually getting some sense and realize they're gonna lose their high-end gamers if they didn't do something, so they added raiding content. However, you can't follow planes of power with this kind of response. I mean, in 3+ years of EQ, I don't recall ANY expansion where 36 has been the average raid side for the very high-end raids in each expansion. I mean, NToV used to be at least 50+, VP too from what I can recall, VT was 50s, even 60s. <br />
<br />
This change is especially redundant after PoP, when 60+ was nearly required, and forced guilds to recruit heavy. What's gonna happend now, especially for members who log on late &quot;sorry, we've filled up our raid cap, we're full.&quot; Anyone envision roster cuts in the future?<br />
<br />
Next, this problem extends to people who are considered the #3 or below spot in their guild at their respective position. This problem really stems to warriors. I don't envision these encounters asking for more than a pair of warriors. The others are gonna feel some huge stinging when raid-time rolls around. Hell, I feel sorry for anyone who isn't a cleric or a massive DPS class. With raid restrictions, I see monks, warriors, hybrids (rangers, beastlords maybe not because their damage is significant). <br />
<br />
If you want to discourage &quot;zerging,&quot; there are other methods of doing so. Encounters that become progressively more difficult with additional members, or if you're gonna put a &quot;cap&quot; on encounters, design a 50-man encounter with a cap of 60, giving guilds at least some form of breathing room and not forcing them to start roster cuts.<br />
<br />
Look, this isn't the NFL. We don't have training camps, nor mandatory cuts. Why start enforcing them on raiding guilds with another expansion. The foundations of Everquest are too enrooted to change on a 1-week whim. Especially not under this &quot;perform or lose your high-end gamers&quot; circumstances. Add a zone, create something for raids, create the fucking &quot;40 new zones&quot; we've been promised. But, after creating an expansion where you forced guilds to add their numbers, this isn't how you follow the expansion up.<br />
<br />
Final verdict is, this desperate ploy to create raiding environment is piss-poor at best. You wanna create raiding enviromnents, fine. Plane of War, Plane of Underfoot featuring Brell, hell you can use the zones you already have as long as it's planned right. After all, SoL high-end featured a grand total of 4 zones really; TD, Ssra, AC, and VT. Surely you can crap out four zones again right, shouldn't be too difficult. Hell, putting a 60 or even 54 person cap on raid encounters will call for guilds to stop mass-recruiting and having 100+ rosters without forcing them to start roster cuts. Hell, if you need to, cut out the 36-person raid shit and release them later as a bonus add-on; do something, but this is unacceptable<br />
<br />
While I'm on the subject, for the love of god, stop rushing these expansions. Stop eleasing utterly worthless expansions (yes, I'm talking about LoY, yes, I'm proably talking about LDoN too). Rathe encounter aside, high required numbers for raiding and early flag issues (expected with an entirely new season), Planes of POwer was a fucking incredible and seriously underated expansion. SoL was a crock of shit in comparison. Conclusion, Sony can still produce good expansions, if they stop rushing this bullshit and actually sit down and make one. <br />
<br />
Sure, LoY can give a quick bang for the buck, but continued rushed expansions WILL be counter-productive, as you're giving players less reasons to not leave for WoW when time comes. By know, you the Devs. should already know that no EQ gamer in their right mind will switch over to EQ-2, especially not those at the high-end, and your best hope is to keep doing what has made EQ the undisputed champion of MMORPG for over 4 years; content, especially at the high-end. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, stop the emphasis on newbie quests, mid-level content and tradeskills. From all respects, EQ-2 is designed to draw the casual consumer anyways. For shit's sake, Everquest is close to 5 years old. No matter what you do, you can't restore the &quot;old, fun days of Everquest back when it was relatively new.&quot; The casual-gamer complaints, in my opinion have been smoothed out with the opening of tier-3 zones for XPing, and the natural trickling down effect of high-end content from past expansions being available to not-so-high-end guilds (i.e., Kael bosses, NToV, ST, ssra, etc). Eventually, the same will happend for VT and maybe even PoP. So, cut the sherades, sit down, and release a quality fucking complete expansion. You've got time until the release of WoW to do so. And while you're at it, get some people to deal with class balancing,</div></div><hr />

I think the fact that ppl think its ok to have zerg guild who have over 72 ppl on raids is bad. NToV was done with 40 ppl just fine. There was no need to have more then 40 ever till pop came out. Then it moved to about 50 some say time you need 60+ for Time which sucks(althought I am sure once ppl gear up it will be back down to 40-50). Moving it to 36 sounds great to me. I hate feeling on raids that whatever I do makes very lil difference when there are way too many ppl. I think this is a step in right direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they did, they'd think twice about all the crap they pump out, and instead put out a TRULY noteworthy expansion again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it will come in handy a few days of the year...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just their sad attempt at convicing EP+ players to buy it I guess. They dont make any real promises either, so for all we know it could just be 1 or 2 events, hardly worth buying an expansion over.<br />
<br />
I still feel kinda ripped off from buying LoY.. the bankslots were nice, but still havent set foot there, since there is no worthwhile content/gear for those in Ele planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I know the true ubers won't get much use out of this expansion, but my small casual guild sure will. 6 man group dungeons are perfect for my friends, as we don't have the time or time schedule to move up the ranks of EQ. A raid for my guild = taking out some epic mobs with 12-24 ppl, doing some HoT, and getting owned by RumbleCrush, but he will die soon. Small encounters are good for where we are at, although most large guilds will find very little use for this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think is sucks ass and is a blantant attmept to appease those players that were bitching about not having any high end content. My guild normally fields anywhere between 55-70 players depending on who logs on at any given time. It was bad enough that people got left behind due to not being flagged for plane of time, we could usually find players for them to bot, usually only 4-5 people and new applicants who we've not back flagged yet. But now we're talking about 20-30 people being left behind and not being able to discover new content on their own.<br />
<br />
Also since you can only try a given dungeon every so often based on the character you cant even go in again the next day with the people who missed out because no one who did the dungeon before can zone into it again for a few days.<br />
<br />
Oh and they neglect to mention that there are only a limited number of instanced dungeons per server. So you can still get your raid together and then have to wait around for a dungeon to open up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
36 person raid.. Oh you have 72 people? Do two raids.. because each raid creates its OWN Seperate Zone when it enters...<br />
<br />
At least that is the plan...<br />
<br />
You have 108 people? make 3 raids...<br />
<br />
The zones are supposed to be pocket zones, created specifically for that group/raid, with items and challenges tailored to the same...<br />
<br />
If it works that way, will be the best thing to ever happen to EQ.<br />
<br />
Imagine this, you zone in...<br />
<br />
The map is random created different... <br />
<br />
The mobs are randomly generated..<br />
<br />
and you ALWAYS have a boss to raid, of course you dont know what that mob is until you encounter him...<br />
<br />
Part of the thrill of EQ is gone, knowing exactly where to stand, what to do on a fight when you never even seen the mob before.<br />
<br />
I know I would have loved to been on the Very first Cursed Raid, when the AoE FD proc'd... I bet half the casters gated, LOL... Or when Half the mob became charmed... <br />
<br />
the excitement and discovery are gone with EQ, everyone waits for the 2-3 uberguilds to pave the way and then follows along, imagine if the fights were different everytime.. if, GASP, there were chances for failure ? And succeeding everytime wasnt expected. <br />
<br />
But I guess I always thought that winning every time in a fantasy setting takes away some of the fun of winning...</div></div><hr />

That way you can take out TWO raid targets at once and get MORE STUFF!<br />

I guess it would take half a brain to figure that out.</div></div><hr />

About 100+ peps for all mobs.  They merged about bertox lvl mobs then got into EP and Fire.  About 20 of em left becasue those 72 on the first raid go the RZTW flag and didnt wanna wait to kill him again for the other members of the guild.  So the 72 got uber xp groups in Earth which is about 7%aa/ kill iirc and the other were stuck with Tactics/BoT which is about 3%aa/kill iirc.  I still get a kick to see peps bitch about not being in raid #1 for EP kills.  It was also fun to see them try and *gasp* not zerg RZTW after the nerf.  Took them about 4 time post nerf till they got the event down.  <br />
<br />
This is a sad state of EQ for sure =/<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Forgot to comment about LDoN.  Sony is stuck with makeing it fun for noobs they have kinda forgoten about high end stuff.  I rember trying to get through hell lvls back in the day. OMG talk about working to lvl.  Now my friend got his fairly twinked monk to 60 in 2 weeks. Lvl 45 solo then his friend let him use a druid to PL himself.  <br />
<br />
I guess the only thing EQ and RL have in common is the divorce rate is about the same =p!</div></div><hr />

There is plenty of content for large raids.  It's the smaller guilds who have a hard time finding reasonable raid targets.  Besides, it's much better to have one or two items drop for a raid of 36 than for a raid of 76.  If your guild is so big that 36 isn't enough, pick another target or do multiple raids.  It seems they're intending to allow several itterations of the same dungeon, so you may be able to even do the same raid at the same time with two groups of 36.  Who knows?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, what is that 'sweet spot' of a raid number that would make you happy?  I'm sure all the big raid guilds are shitting their pants that SoE hasn't alluded to anything requiring 72 people in the next expansion, especially considering how easy it is to get 72 on every night, nowadays.  Really, though... if they'd said the next expansion was gonna be chock full of encounters requiring nothing short of full 72-person raids, people would still be bitching about the heavy recruiting their guilds would have to do to progress thru the expansion.  I'm not a big fan of SoE, and haven't been for a long, long time, but it really seems that SoE can't win, no matter what they do these days.  And it isn't so much that they're not trying - hell, they haven't tried to make a good expansion in a long time - it's just that people will always bitch about the game, regardless of what SoE does to it.<br />
<br />
They could give people the items they want, and folks would bitch about itemazation and mudflation.  If something is entering the world too quickly, you bitch about mudflation.  When items enter the world too slow to suit your guilds' needs, you bitch about having to bottom-feed in order to gear up.  Seriously, at this point in the game, what exactly is it you want??  Where is the happy medium between mudflation and bottom-feeding that will make everyone happy?  There is no such thing.  EQ is on its way out.  There is no question about that, now.<br />
<br />
An expansion that touts 36-person raids should appeal to raid guilds who simply cannot field the 50+ people consistently every night.  Guilds who have members logging in less and less frequently, this will be (should be?) the &quot;retirement home&quot; of expansions.  If you're one of the upper raid guilds (hell, any guild, for that matter - this shouldn't apply solely to the upper echelon of guilds) who can still get 60+ people on every night, shut the fuck up and make 2 raids of it.  I know, it means potentially more loot across more people, and we all know how getting more loot for more people just plain sucks, but I guess those are the sacrifices you make when you can field two raids instead of just one.  And in the wee hours of raiding when some folks want to stick around and raid, while others have to log, you'd be forced to  *gasp!* consolidate your two raid forces into one functional unit, and keep raiding with those that want to!  Oh, the fucking horror!!  Sucks, I know.  Yeah, yeah... I know... but you want all 80 of your active members to be able to &quot;play together&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hardcore raid guilds who know EQ is on its last leg - and has been on its way out for a few expansions now - should welcome this expansion with open arms.  No more begging people to log on.  No more mass recruiting.  No more banging your head against XXX encounter with XXX people and trying to make it work with fewer than it really needs.   Just fucking get together with the 30-40 who still play consistently out of boredom, shoot the shit about 'the old days', and just accept the next expansion for what it is - 'retirement phase'.  Something to pass the time until you and your guild get into the beta for the next big thing - or if you're not that lucky - something to keep you busy until the next big thing arrives (WoW, for those who haven't heard).<br />
<br />
Additionally, never has SoE given a clearer message that  meeting your needs - the needs of the raiding contingent of the game - doesn't rank high on their list of priorities.  Mudflation sucks for the upper tier of guilds, but it is the thing that keeps their 'bread and butter' players logging in every night.  Putting Windblades and Ornate Armor into the hands of the general population is far more beneficial to SoE at this point, from a financial standpoint, than giving the raid guilds the itemization the game really needs.<br />
<br />
Some of you act like SoE might (just might!!) have pulled their head out of their ass and decided they owe it to their playerbase to give us an expansion that will knock our socks off!  Sweet, gentle Jesus - where have you people been the last two years??  Your guildpage updates would indicate you still play, and at a high level, but have you learned nothing over the past couple of years?  Give me a fucking break.  Show me one single shred of evidence that you've seen in the past couple of years that would indicate SoE is at all interested in what the upper end playerbase wants, in terms of where the game should head next, and what proper itemazation is, in terms of risk vs reward.  Guess what - the very same corporate entity that brought you the last three expansions is *surprise!* bringing you the next expansion.  It's a hard pill to swallow when you're at the top of your EQ game, but if you haven't figured out that SoE is systematically dismantling EQ in preparation of EQ2, you haven't been paying attention.  SoE does not care about the high end gamer in EQ; their only concern is in keeping the mass majority of their playerbase  logging in and thinking things are just dandy, with poor itemization and mudflation, which allows people to get items they have not earned, and most likely, never would earn otherwise, on their own.<br />
<br />
Wake up, people.  I loved EQ as much as any of you, and I shared the pain in let-down after painful (but somehow, expected) let-down.  I'll probably play the next expansion, simply because convincing members that its worth their time to log on and play EQ each night, won't be such a pain in the ass, since I have to convince far fewer people that EQ is worth the time away from their real life these days.<br />
<br />
Fuck it - three cheers for this piece of shit expansion, I say.  Less stress on raid leaders to get people on and make shit happen, and one more very clear indication from SoE that they are, indeed, tired of feeding us content on this outdated game, and are ready to invest their time and energy into the next big money-maker.<br />

Varaho is right.  If you've only got 45 on, and don't have the utility to do two raids, you won't exactly be hanging out in Time wiping your ass with one of Quarm's heads, either, now will you?  Recruit more!  It's the hip thing to do!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you learn how to use all of every class’s powers? Use druids to heal; split up your enchanters from your shaman to slow mobs; find out there are forms of blue regen other than the kei line and tell people to manage mana; use beastlords for buffing: create a pull team using bards, necros, and rogues; in short improvise! The game can be done with less than the absolute optimum setups; you just have to look at problems another way sometimes.<br />
<br />
And if you still don't have enough people online at once, well that happens, recruit more if you want to have a constant raid force online.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah cos every single guild in EQ breaks down into neat 36man pocket sizaed mini guilds for easy stacking. Its really shouldnt be too hard to understand, even for people like Varaho, that the game doesnt work like this. Cliques will form, people will get excluded. This leads to guild strife in an environment already far too rife with it anyway. Too bad for the guilds who regually raid with 45-60 people, half the time half the guild gets to sit around pulling their dicks rather then actually playing.<br />
<br />
People join a guild (well a middle to top end one anyway) to hang out with the people in that guild and kill stuff. Not to be segregated up and shoved into mini raids all over the place. Forcing people to increase roster sizes, then telling these same people 3 months later that you cant play together anymore is retarded. Its going to be a fertile bed for guild drama and nothing more.</div></div><hr />

There is no way SoE can expect to be making money if they don't accomodate high-end gamers. <br />
Newbies buy and account, play once or twice a week, find something more interesting, and delete their account. It's players like us who spend 60+ dollars a month so that we can have 5 different accounts. (Maybe not you, but that's how i get around. Most my good friends too) <br />
How can SoE tailor this game to newbies who own 1 account rather than the high-end players who own 2 or 3 or 4? They're paying SoE fractions of what i am yet they get all the cool shit. <br />
Fuck newbies, balance Pure-Melee, i want a damn 72 person raid encounter. :D</div></div><hr />

How many guilds out there can field ~72 nightly, as opposed to the number of guilds who can only field 30-40 nightly?<br />
<br />
The next expansion isn't about the high-end or raid progression.  It is about keeping the 'average joe' happy.  If it means dumping Vengeance V, 150hp items on the average player, and putting ridiculously unimpressive loot on Quarm, so be it.  The high end raiding contingent is a very small faction within the scope of the EQ playerbase, and keeping the minority happy 4+ yrs into the game isn't nearly as important (nor as easy) as keeping the larger &quot;average&quot; playerbase happy, and content with the game.<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way:<br />

Let's say the top end raiding crowd (heck, let's say Bertox-ish, and up) constitutes 20% of your EQ playerbase (and this percentage is very, very liberal).<br />
You've got a new subscription-based game coming out soon (an extension of a very popular predecessor (yeah, EQ)).<br />
Is it better for you to please that 20% of hardcore players (Bertox+), or open up Ornate Armor and Windblades (and such itemization) to the 80% crowd of average jimmy's who play your game?  This doesn't only include all those level 65's who have still never seen Grummus, or the inside of Tactics, but also those players who get all giddy every time they create a new character once they've hit level 35 (with their latest class-endeavor) and are completely oblivious to high-end itemization / class balance?  You're going to please the people who line your pockets every month, regardless of what changes you make to the game, and unfortunately, the hardcore, high-end raiding community just doesn't fall into that category.<br />

At it's essence, SoE is out to make money (Oh Noz!!), like the vast majority of publicly traded companies in the world.</div></div><hr />

I think this is the best news yet to come from VI. I actually think they are actually starting to do something that makes sense for a change. XP group modifiers was a definate welcome. Now this will breathe life and new fun into family type guilds who are fucking sick and tired doing fear and hate for last 2 years since nothing else is ever up.<br />
<br />
Nyllith summed it nicley must be troll blood or somethin. Althought I dont really agree about this whole retirment expansion thing. Seriousley. If you think about for just a minute, you too can realize this is a welcome change that acomodaits almost every god damn guild there is. Zerg guild will have to learn something new thought /gasp and get more raid leaders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyllith</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Casai to a point, in that those casual raiding guilds (i.e. - those who have been doing Vindi / Statue / NToV / etc for 2 yrs now and calling it a &quot;raid&quot;) are SoE's target audience for the next expansion.  The larger portion of EQ players tend to be casual players, or raid causally, at best.<br />
<br />
Instanced, 36-man raid zones absolutely cater to casual guilds who wish they had a little more content to raid, or that wish there was less competition over raid targets.  They can go raid something whenever they have the numbers, uncontested, and without the standard mob-tracking many guilds rely on.  It caters to the &quot;come on in and kill something for loot when it suits you, without having to race to a spawn&quot; crowd, which encompasses the majority of EQ subscribers.<br />
<br />
As far as multiple accounts go, heck, what raider wasn't running 2 accounts back in Kunark? (lots of us dodged the big bad &quot;ban&quot; for using multiple accounts back in the day)<br />
<br />
There was a time when you'd get banned for such things.<br />
However, it didn't take long for SoE to pick up on the cash potential in multiple accounts.  In fact, over the past couple of years, I've been received spam mail every couple months from SoE, offering to give me a free account, and all I have to do is pay the monthly fee (don't incur the retail expense of purchasing the game).<br />
<br />
As far as the next expansion being &quot;retirement phase&quot; for high-end raiding guilds, I'm not sure you fall into that category, Casai, so I doubt you'd agree.  Nothing personal, mind you - it's all relative to what level of the game you're in, and what you're getting out of the game, in terms of time(risk) vs reward...</div></div><hr />

It's boring... every encounter in EQ can be beaten by simply adding more healing or DPS to your raid. Or in the case of RZ lately, people actualliy have TWO raids.. one for RZ and one for the pit adds.<br />
<br />
 Limiting the number of people who can join a mini-raid might actually make some things a challenge that you can't simply zerg to death.  Mass scale raiding is not all that fun, but it's the only way to get the uber gear.  Those are the only reasons these guilds became so large in the first place, not because people enjoy guilds filled with people they don't know.<br />
<br />
I'm actually looking forward to this, if the loot available is on par with something single groups can obtain in pofire/water or better then it will succeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick clue - there is no high end raid content in LDoN.  Want to know why?  Because after essentially breaking the game by making Elemental/Time gear so stupidly powerful SoE has absolutely nowhere to go for high end players.  VT was bad but Ele/Time are absurd.  There simply is nowhere else they can go.  Certainly not another monster increase in power as PoP introduced.<br />
<br />
EQ has become a two-tiered society.  The big raidguilds who field 60+ people every night, can get to the Elementals (yet still deny content to lesser guilds to either gear up alts or just do it because they can) and have gear of mind-blowing quality.  Everyone else, who for whatever reason is not in one of those guilds and generally has to make do with 2 or 3 expansion old content and gear.<br />
<br />
Hard-capping raids makes a lot of sense.  If SoE designs an encounter for 40 people, up until now, there has been nothing stopping people from bringing in 50.  Will limiting raids to 36 suck?  Yes, absolutely.  Will there be problems with people being excluded?  Certainly.  Will this destroy the big raiding guilds?  Maybe.  Will the lesser guilds who are often denied content by those guilds lose any sleep over that?  I doubt it.  If 50% of the top 5% of EQ's players leave, let me assure you, the game will go on and the remaining 95% of the player base either won't notice or won't care.<br />
<br />
After 3 straight expansions that catered to the high-end players, LoY and LDoN are addressing the wishes of the vast majority of EQs players, not the vocal minority.  If this offends or angers the top 1-5% of EQ's players, well that is obviously a risk SoE feels they can take.  Whether you leave or not is your choice, but somehow I bet that EQ will go on without you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look, I have no issue with how many people the content is &quot;designed&quot; for.  That's fine that it's designed for 36.  I have problems with the hard coded, no bullshit limits that are being put in place as a result of idiots zerging RZ with 200 people.<br />
<br />
Saying that I can only bring one group to here or there pisses me off.  Turning people away because content says that I can't bring more is bullshit.<br />
<br />
You just wait and see what bullshit they implement for this.  I guarantee that there's going to be threads here with people complaining that they're person number 37 and there's nothing they can fuckin do about it.  In addition to that fact, while most people don't LIKE raiding with 72 people, when you put shit like that gay ass rathe encounter in place and FORCE people to use 70 people, and then cut it back to HALF of that, you're not doing the right thing.   Next time you're online, take a good hard look at your guild roster and think about what would happen if only half of you could be grouped together EVERY NITE.<br />
<br />
Well, hey, not sure why i'm bothering to dissent anyway.  I know goddamned well this expansion is going to be utter shit, and I'm not buying it anyway because i've got plenty of content left to do.  I've only got LoY on my main account for the guild tool...I've never even zoned into that expansion.  Prior to that was the &quot;Outdoor&quot; expansion that made every retard on the server level 65 with their class title in a matter of weeks.   It's quite obvious that whoever is running this game at this point has zero clue what's going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">let me explain:<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, it seems to me that 36 players is about right. There is plenty of content for large raids. It's the smaller guilds who have a hard time finding reasonable raid targets. Besides, it's much better to have one or two items drop for a raid of 36 than for a raid of 76. If your guild is so big that 36 isn't enough, pick another target or do multiple raids. It seems they're intending to allow several itterations of the same dungeon, so you may be able to even do the same raid at the same time with two groups of 36. Who knows?&quot;<br />
<br />
I beg to differ. with each high-end expansion, high-end guilds move on, and leave more content available to other guilds. NToV used to be a zone exclusively for high-end guilds. Now, I can venture to say tha 20% of the people on any server can or have killed there. Designing expansions with &quot;mid-level&quot; content is a problem because it has weak loot, people may do it for some time but will quickly get bored and move onto places with more attractive items. If however it has good loot, then high-end people will become interested and simply monopolize it (example; the 1 or 2-groupable burrower in AC). As for the lack of content for casual smaller guilds, I beg to differ again, as all of NToV, all of Kael, hell all of ssra minus emp and maybe HP (although I doubt it) can be done with under 36. <br />
<br />
&quot;If. You. Have. More. People. Than. Needed. For. One. Raid. Do. Two. Raids.<br />
<br />
That way you can take out TWO raid targets at once and get MORE STUFF!&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone already said this bet. What happends if you have 55 on and only 4 clerics. all 4 are needed for the encounter. What then, oh holy wize one?<br />
<br />
&quot;People bitch when encounters / progression require more that 50 people logging on every night, and people bitch when encounters can be done with 36 people...<br />
<br />
Seriously, what is that 'sweet spot' of a raid number that would make you happy? I'm sure all the big raid guilds are shitting their pants that SoE hasn't alluded to anything requiring 72 people in the next expansion, especially considering how easy it is to get 72 on every night, nowadays. Really, though... if they'd said the next expansion was gonna be chock full of encounters requiring nothing short of full 72-person raids, people would still be bitching about the heavy recruiting their guilds would have to do to progress thru the expansion. I'm not a big fan of SoE, and haven't been for a long, long time, but it really seems that SoE can't win, no matter what they do these days. And it isn't so much that they're not trying - hell, they haven't tried to make a good expansion in a long time - it's just that people will always bitch about the game, regardless of what SoE does to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You've entirely missed the point. Hell, you're not even in the ball-park. The REASON people at the high-end are pissed is because Planes of Power required high numbers, required 70+ for PoTime, and even some elementals at first. With these changes, guilds would have to start roster cuts, and turning many people away. As for the &quot;ideal&quot; raid size, if you read my post, I said it; design a 54-man encounter with a cap at 60 or maybe 66. I'm fine with 36-max encounters, but those encounters shouldn't be designed for the high-end guilds who've already been forced to inflate their rosters because of a previous expansion.<br />
<br />
&quot;They could give people the items they want, and folks would bitch about itemazation and mudflation. If something is entering the world too quickly, you bitch about mudflation. When items enter the world too slow to suit your guilds' needs, you bitch about having to bottom-feed in order to gear up. Seriously, at this point in the game, what exactly is it you want?? Where is the happy medium between mudflation and bottom-feeding that will make everyone happy? There is no such thing. EQ is on its way out. There is no question about that, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Risk vs. Reward. Put loots that are better than Quarm's table on a mob that required no efforts in flagging and shit like that, and of course people will bitch. Do they not have a right to? Loots per mob; yes, it's hard. But this discussion has nothing to do with loot/mob<br />
<br />
&quot;An expansion that touts 36-person raids should appeal to raid guilds who simply cannot field the 50+ people consistently every night. Guilds who have members logging in less and less frequently, this will be (should be?) the &quot;retirement home&quot; of expansions. If you're one of the upper raid guilds (hell, any guild, for that matter - this shouldn't apply solely to the upper echelon of guilds) who can still get 60+ people on every night, shut the fuck up and make 2 raids of it. I know, it means potentially more loot across more people, and we all know how getting more loot for more people just plain sucks, but I guess those are the sacrifices you make when you can field two raids instead of just one. And in the wee hours of raiding when some folks want to stick around and raid, while others have to log, you'd be forced to *gasp!* consolidate your two raid forces into one functional unit, and keep raiding with those that want to! Oh, the fucking horror!! Sucks, I know. Yeah, yeah... I know... but you want all 80 of your active members to be able to &quot;play together&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
What part of &quot;utility classes&quot; don't you understand. A &quot;raid-guild&quot; with 30-40 people logging on nightly is probably long stripped of any semblance of clerics, wizards and bards. There's a very likely chance that those 30-40 won't form a good raid, because you still can't raid shit with 1 cleric. What you don't understand is, EQ has been structured around utility classes for 5 fucking years. Thats why making 2 raids, is oftne difficult, it's not all about numbers but about utility. Why the hell do you think most &quot;uber&quot; guild rosters have at least twice as many clerics as warriors or virtually any other class for that matter. <br />
<br />
If all you're saying is &quot;recruit more&quot; than youi're just propagating the same notions of PoP in having 100+ rosters, thereby making you a hypocrite. You;re not even taking into account competition for these encounters at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardcore raid guilds who know EQ is on its last leg - and has been on its way out for a few expansions now - should welcome this expansion with open arms. No more begging people to log on. No more mass recruiting. No more banging your head against XXX encounter with XXX people and trying to make it work with fewer than it really needs. Just fucking get together with the 30-40 who still play consistently out of boredom, shoot the shit about 'the old days', and just accept the next expansion for what it is - 'retirement phase'. Something to pass the time until you and your guild get into the beta for the next big thing - or if you're not that lucky - something to keep you busy until the next big thing arrives (WoW, for those who haven't heard).&quot;<br />
<br />
You do realize that when high-end guilds leave games, usually others follow? High-end people are the most vocal about this kind of shit. Want proof; read FoH and DAoC saga. <br />
<br />
How much farther do you have to look than DAoC. Are you really ignorant enough to think that when the raiding uber-jerks leave, that EQ will become the perfect game for the casual types to wallow in. If you think that, then tell me, why would casual people, who don't care as much about content as others would, stay in a game with worse graphics, worse game-play, worse mechanics than other games out there....<br />
<br />
&quot;Additionally, never has SoE given a clearer message that meeting your needs - the needs of the raiding contingent of the game - doesn't rank high on their list of priorities. Mudflation sucks for the upper tier of guilds, but it is the thing that keeps their 'bread and butter' players logging in every night. Putting Windblades and Ornate Armor into the hands of the general population is far more beneficial to SoE at this point, from a financial standpoint, than giving the raid guilds the itemization the game really needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
See above. When you add some items going into more casual player stream, thats one thing. When you dedicate an entire expansion to it, that's another story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of you act like SoE might (just might!!) have pulled their head out of their ass and decided they owe it to their playerbase to give us an expansion that will knock our socks off! Sweet, gentle Jesus - where have you people been the last two years?? Your guildpage updates would indicate you still play, and at a high level, but have you learned nothing over the past couple of years? Give me a fucking break. Show me one single shred of evidence that you've seen in the past couple of years that would indicate SoE is at all interested in what the upper end playerbase wants, in terms of where the game should head next, and what proper itemazation is, in terms of risk vs reward. Guess what - the very same corporate entity that brought you the last three expansions is *surprise!* bringing you the next expansion. It's a hard pill to swallow when you're at the top of your EQ game, but if you haven't figured out that SoE is systematically dismantling EQ in preparation of EQ2, you haven't been paying attention. SoE does not care about the high end gamer in EQ; their only concern is in keeping the mass majority of their playerbase logging in and thinking things are just dandy, with poor itemization and mudflation, which allows people to get items they have not earned, and most likely, never would earn otherwise, on their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. Utterly wrong. SoE may not have listened entirely, and created expansions with bad mechanics, and unfinished zones, and all that shit, but each expansion had CONTENT. If you haven't realized it yet, thats the only reason Everquest is still afloat; high-end content that eventually filters down to more casual high-level guilds. SoL and PoP had many problems, especially SoL, but they had the content that kept raiding guilds playing. Once you stop producing that, there is no longer a reason to stay in EQ.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you learn how to use all of every class’s powers? Use druids to heal; split up your enchanters from your shaman to slow mobs; find out there are forms of blue regen other than the kei line and tell people to manage mana; use beastlords for buffing: create a pull team using bards, necros, and rogues; in short improvise! The game can be done with less than the absolute optimum setups; you just have to look at problems another way sometimes.<br />
<br />
And if you still don't have enough people online at once, well that happens, recruit more if you want to have a constant raid force online.&quot;<br />
<br />
Recruit more; well by god why didn't anyone else think of that. Oh yes, it causes the same problems, that it's either you have 36 on, or 72 on, not to mention the right classes. As warriors, you guys really should realize this means every warrior who isn't a top-3 top-4 tank is pretty much useless now to a guild, because chances are you're the last person they need on a raid..<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, 36-man raids are much more likely than 72-man raids. How many guilds out there can field ~72 nightly, as opposed to the number of guilds who can only field 30-40 nightly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. God, you are utterly clueless about how high-end guilds work. The raiding guilds getting 30-40 a night have probably been long-stripped of their utility classes, and still can't muster a raid together without recruiting more. Which will ultimantely still lead to the same problem of getting 50 on per night, which will lead to a necessity for more recruitment,and their just aren't enough utility classes out there to fill all these quotas.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next expansion isn't about the high-end or raid progression. It is about keeping the 'average joe' happy. If it means dumping Vengeance V, 150hp items on the average player, and putting ridiculously unimpressive loot on Quarm, so be it. The high end raiding contingent is a very small faction within the scope of the EQ playerbase, and keeping the minority happy 4+ yrs into the game isn't nearly as important (nor as easy) as keeping the larger &quot;average&quot; playerbase happy, and content with the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow. Your cluelessness is truly mind-boggling. Tell me, where the hell have you been for the last 4 years. Why the fuck do you think EQ has survived this long? Are you really stupid enough to believe that if 150hp, Veng-6 items were available on encounters doable by &quot;Average JOe&quot; that Average Joe would ever see this shit? HELL NO. <br />
<br />
Let me rent you a clue. These 36-man encounters won't suit average Joe's needs at all unless htey have utterly shitty items, which in turn is also useless. If they are designed for a 36-man casual average raid and have good loot, high-end guilds will just monopolize these encounters with 24 people, and you'll be bitching about lack of content. If they are designed in difficulty for a 36-man uber guild raid, then you'll still be bitching because it will be too hard. Average Joe isn't gonna see a Vengeance 6 150hp item unless you physically have game designers shove it into their inventory. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, if these encounters are instant and remove the need for competition, this would still be a problem beause these items will be too available. You'll be again cutting content because no one will ever touch the other expansions (again, more complaints about content). <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's say the top end raiding crowd (heck, let's say Bertox-ish, and up) constitutes 20% of your EQ playerbase (and this percentage is very, very liberal).<br />
You've got a new subscription-based game coming out soon (an extension of a very popular predecessor (yeah, EQ)).<br />
Is it better for you to please that 20% of hardcore players (Bertox+), or open up Ornate Armor and Windblades (and such itemization) to the 80% crowd of average jimmy's who play your game? This doesn't only include all those level 65's who have still never seen Grummus, or the inside of Tactics, but also those players who get all giddy every time they create a new character once they've hit level 35 (with their latest class-endeavor) and are completely oblivious to high-end itemization / class balance? You're going to please the people who line your pockets every month, regardless of what changes you make to the game, and unfortunately, the hardcore, high-end raiding community just doesn't fall into that category.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or, what you could do is follow the model that has carried you through 4 or 5 years; design an expansion filled with high-end content. Guilds will move on, leaving areas like VT, and Ssra open for the taking, which will in-turn put loot in the hand of the same casual gamers who would be getting the ornate armor and windblades. Oh, and by the way, flooding ornate armor onto casual gamers actaully cuts out content, because it means there is no longer a purpose for doing HoT raids, or Kael raids, or WToW raids, which will in turn leave casual gamers still complaining about lack of content.</div></div><hr />

The dungeons are going to be created according to your group makeup. I havn't found where they have said the same for raid-makeup, but I'm pretty confident that it will be the same.<br />
<br />
The dungeon will be created to give your group/raid a challenge. You don't have a cleric? Well then the mobs might not hit as hard. No mezzer? Maybe the mobs will be easier to single pull, but you iwll have to work with an occasional add. You have a lot of DPS in your group? The mobs may have more HP then in a group that has little DPS.&quot;<br />

Do you actually believe that after 5 years of encounters being centered around healing and DPS, that anything will change? Can you imagine the type of coding and adjustments that would have to be made to accomodate what you're talking about above?

Unrelated to your post directly, but on the whole (saw it mentioned a couple times earlier in this thread), I also think the common assumption that the more serious raiding player (levels, AA, raiding multiple times per week) makes up ~5% of the EQ population is a misconception.  I think that percentage is considerably higher.</div></div><hr />

There will be a limited number of instanced dungeons, I would imagine due to hardware restrictions. There will not be an unlimited amount of times that a dungeon can be done simultaniously. <br />

If these encounters were instanced, they would just be an endless amount of mudflation, and would effectively remove the necessity and desire to venture into any previous expansion if the loot was any good.</div></div><hr />

While I agree that new content is needed for Power gamers and Uber Guilds I do not feel that any content that is added that is not beyond PoT has a negative impact on them. If you are raiding Time and you feel that you will not benefit from LDoN then simply do not buy it and or play it. If you are done with Time then I would be stunned if SOE does not have new content for you by the time that happens. I have not heard of anyone chewing through Time in it's entirety and I do not think LDoN is the final expansion for EQ. Sony is catering to the larger % of its player base and another Top End expansion would not do that. Your time will come be patient and by the time you are through with Time I would wager there will be new content. If not then start complaining.</div></div><hr />

For the first time, raids take place in truly private zones, where your groups can test their mettle and focus solely on the task at hand. Instead of limiting the availability of content by who can get there first, this new system only limits participation based on whether or not you have recently succeeded or failed at each event within a given period. <br />

Instanced with a limit on how frequently they can be done by a given group of raiders. Next objection?</div></div><hr />

EQ isnt dead. It isnt dying. WoW is not going to kill it. It's still the biggest and best online game around. Raise your hand if you're still playing EQ. /raise &lt;--- two accounts for me, over 4 years now<br />

It doesnt matter what Sony does with the next expansion, or the one after that, or all the ones that came before - people are going to complain. Damned if you do, damned if you dont. <br />

If you think Lost Dungeons is going to suck - fine, stay out. Myself and my guild are looking forward to it. But, guess what, that isnt going to happen. All you uberguilders who piss and moan about how this new content is lame and you need more high-end content - you are going to be right there hogging all the instances when this expansion comes out. I guarantee it.</div></div><hr />

While I agree that new content is needed for Power gamers and Uber Guilds I do not feel that any content that is added that is not beyond PoT has a negative impact on them. If you are raiding Time and you feel that you will not benefit from LDoN then simply do not buy it and or play it. If you are done with Time then I would be stunned if SOE does not have new content for you by the time that happens. I have not heard of anyone chewing through Time in it's entirety and I do not think LDoN is the final expansion for EQ. Sony is catering to the larger % of its player base and another Top End expansion would not do that. Your time will come be patient and by the time you are through with Time I would wager there will be new content. If not then start complaining.&quot;<br />

Time has been chewed through already. Quarm, the tier 6 &quot;boss&quot; of time has already been defeated on at least 6 servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyllith</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pleasing the high end raid crowd is of no particular importance to the devs at SoE.<br />
<br />
Proper itemization / controlling mudflation is of no particular importance to the devs at SoE.<br />
<br />
You and I see mudflation as the work of the devil.  SoE sees it as a viable tool for holding player interest.  Mudflation is the &quot;carrot&quot; that SoE dangles in front of the casual players.  Think about it.  If a casual player feels like he can't progress past a certain point, what does he lose if he stops playing?  Those people represent the larger portion of the EQ playerbase, so it makes sense to keep them interested in the game and logging on for their nightly raid on the pinnacle of mudflated zones - the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Raid guilds, on the other hand, have much more to lose when their members stop playing, because it cripples their ability to do the one thing they log in to do - raid.  Many people in raid guilds will continue to log in and fight their way thru the EP and Time out of a sense of duty or obligation to their guild, even when they'd rather not.  They know if they just up and quit, it hurts the guild.  Their &quot;carrot&quot; has always been moving thru new game content each expansion.  How many raid guilds say &quot;fuck it&quot; and throw in the towel because itemization and mudflation suck, and they can't stand it that Jimmy Newb the level 54 Paladin just got a shiny new Windblade, or some nice armor upgrade from the Bazaar?  Zero.  Mudflation gives the casual players a sense of progression while remaining casual, and the more they invest in their characters, the more likely they are to keep logging on.  Mudflation pisses off the high end raiders, but not to the point of turning them away from the game.<br />
<br />
Now take SoE's propensity for mudflation, and apply it to a system that supports instanced dungeons.  If you thought it's been bad up to this point, you'd better brace yourself for more disappointment.  Instanced dungeons introduce more opportunity for loot to drop.  Sure, some of it will be No Drop, and a lot of it will be shit items, but if you think for one second they aren't going to have easily-obtainable items ('carrots') for casual players, you're crazy.  The very existence of instanced dungeons is to provide less content, but make it accessable to more people.  Whether it is intended or not, instanced dungeons break down a guild's ability to monopolize that content.  The only ones that will be monopolized are those that won't occur inside an instanced dungeon.  Instanced dungeons are the perfect opportunity to make sure those casual players have a few nice items they can get to without having to move out of their comfort zone.<br />
<br />
Steering back on topic...<br />
I absolutely agree 100% that it sucks really bad that they forced guilds to ramp up their rosters to reach the end encounters of PoP, and are now introducing an expansion that works against what they forced guilds into in PoP.  You can complain about it all you want, but it is coming, and like I said before, it's a very clear message from SoE that they don't particularly care if it pisses you off that you're going to have to struggle to get all 72 people working functionally in two raids.  The line-up on your guild's roster isn't SoE's problem, and the logistics of getting all of those people into some raid capacity in the next expansion is also not their problem.  They forced guilds to ramp up, but what can you do about it?  The number of guilds who were forced into this predicament pale in comparison to the number of guilds and players who are completely unaffected by anything involving the ramp up in numbers for Rathe / Time.<br />
<br />
Lots of high end raiding people have been looking for a good reason to stop logging on after putting up with SoE's bullshit for so long, that's why I think this expansion will be the retirement expansion.  Aside from splitting up guild numbers that the last expansion forced onto them, there is no evidence that the new expansion will provide any high end content to progress thru.  The 'carrot' that keeps high end raid guilds playing is no longer there.  The high end contingent is the minority, and pleasing the majority makes more sense for retaining more of their playerbase, filtering them right into EQ2 with gimmicks like character lineage from your EQ characters.  SoE has alienated a large portion of their high end raid community with their bullshit from expansion to expansion, and SoE knows that trying to convince those players that EQ2 will be a worthwhile time and money investment is a wasted effort.  People who hate EQ, but have been logging in for the sake of finishing out the expansion because their guild simply cannot progress thru Time without that person bot'ing 4 raid clerics can now put some closure on the game, and do so without sinking their guild further into the recruitment hole for the next expansion.  Guilds were forced to swell their rosters to get past the Rathe encounter, yet many of them still find they have to continually recruit just to stabalize the raid numbers to progress in Time.<br />
<br />
And yes, some of the casual players / lower tier raiders hang on every word that gets tossed around by the top guilds on sites like FoH's message board.  The day FoH and AL officially retire from EQ, I have no doubt that there will be plenty of people who will see it, and be tempted to retire, as well, even though they are completely unaffected by the problems that plagued those guilds.  And mudflation via instanced zones will be the hook that brings those casual players back into the game again a few days later when they're scratching their head, trying to remember exactly why it was they stopped playing.<br />
<br />
And regarding my comments to EQ being dead, it is dead from a development standpoint.  They will continue to put less and less resources into each expansion, but the cash cow is far from dry.  It will go on for years to come (look at UO, still kicking after all these years), but it won't see much more in terms of dynamic content, or end-game content that it has provided up to this point.  It's development is virtually dead, with EQ2 on the horizon.  They'll just let the tap run on EQ, eventually consolidating servers as the playerbase shrinks.</div></div><hr />

If Time is the end, and this expansion provides no high-end content, the guilds that have beaten Quarm will have no reason to go on. The people close to time may feel the same way. Hell, guilds in elemental planes may even start considering it considering there's little reason to stick around.<br />

I'm more in agreement with your latest post than previous ones. Perhaps this is just bad judgement on my part, but I've always thought that at the very least, SoE knew how to think in terms of economics, and the backlash of what would happend if you stop giving high-end gamers a reason to log on. Seems like they will soon find out.</div></div><hr />

For example, you're saying that if a raid is tuned for 36 mid tier players and it drops anything of comparable value to top end PoP loot then it will be dominated by a lower number of high tier players.  I grant you that may be so, but I also believe that if the loot is decent enough it would be dominated by high tier players regardless of whether it took 36 or 106 players.  The high end guilds already dominate most anything they have an interest in.  And they even go back and whack stuff that's supposedly beyond them when they don't find another target up and available.<br />
<br />
If it's worth having, they'll go get it.  That's pretty much the story.  Now with this process, once they get everything they want they'll get bored and move on and maybe the mid tier people will actually have a whack at it, rather than being put in a place where just to take a try they're going to have to recruit another 20 players.<br />
<br />
And the loot doesn't have to be equal to or surpass Time loot.  There is plenty of room between NToV caliber loot and Time loot that these items can fall into and still be considered upgrades by a lot of people.  Maybe not the top end guilds, but then that's a shame but really not a huge crisis.  The top end guilds already have plenty of content to dominate, so if they showed no interest in LDoN raids, more the better.</div></div><hr />

dude... think a little. Velious was not even defeated when SoL came out (AoW anyone). By the time RoK was beating, SoL was already announced and being designed as an expansion with high-end raiding content. When SoL was beaten, Planes of Power was already announced as an expansion featuring high-end raiding content. PoP is beaten, no plans announced for expansion with raid content... Think, the reason guilds didn't quit before was they had something to look forward to. Nothing to look forward to now.<br />

Again, I'm just not seeing the problem of mid-tier content being lacking. There is content out there that is doable with a raid force of 36 or under easily.<br />

The point is, high-end guilds DON'T have plenty of content. When you've beaten Time, what's next? If there was at least an expansion envisioned, some promise of actual raiding content in the future, people would be optimistic.</div></div><hr />

Which people?  Apparently the high end guild raiders are the ones you're concerned about.  The rest of the EQ world isn't disheartened because the PoT has been beaten.  Hell, many of us haven't seen sleeper's tomb or vex thal.   Top end guilds might have a hard time finding new challenges.  Okay, I admit that is true.  So top end guilds may find it hard to keep up the momentum.  Well, such is the nature of the beast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and please...  don't make us grind more AA...<br />
<br />
I feel lucky right now, my guild is still only part way through elementals, we've got a bit more before Time, and even moreso before Quarm. theres still room for us to progress together, and its acutally fun sometimes. but that progression is just about the only thing keeping me in this game anymore. unless SoE manages to pull off some fugging miracle of an expansion after LDoN, i think i shall hang up my eq hat after Quarm falls for us. i don't feel like watching my guild get divided just so we can do some silly LDoN raid dungeon, most likely with worse loot and sense of progression than we could get in eles or Time. i also don't feel like farming about in Time like it's some sort of neo-VT while we wait for some savior of an expansion to save us from the monotony. i'm not confident enough in SoEs abilities to create really well thought out and well tuned encounters anymore. PoP was far better than luclin, yes, but it was still plagued with inconsistencies, screw-ups, and crappy background lore. i'm almost scared to see what kind of wild shit they'll come up with for LDoN and beyond. i agree that LDoN won't be the destruction of EQ. i'm sure even with WoW and these other MMOs coming out, EQ will still be running strong. but for me, with some of the BS i've seen the past 2 1/2 years i've been playing this game, i'm not too optimistic for the future of the part of the game that really matters to me. i'm sure theres more than a few other people who feel the same way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and i don't think anyones even mentioned the clusterfuck Time will become when more than 1 or 2 guilds make it in there on various servers. theres already more than 1 on a few servers. so those guilds are going to be relegated to either competing for farming Time over and over, or splitting themselves up and farming the 1 or 2 LDoN &quot;raid&quot; dungeons (and you just know that's probably all there will be) over and over again for sub-par loot until the next expansion with post-Time raid content comes out. i'm sure there will be one eventually. will it be good? probably not. <br />
<br />
yes, i know i'm pessimistic. for me right now, it's not all bad. i still enjoy logging in and raiding sometimes. i'm not looking foreward to the future at all though. and if by some act of god, SoE proves me wrong and turns out a really good expansion after LDoN with well thought out, well designed content, minimal bugs and inconsistancies, i will happily eat my words. but judging by their track record though, the chance of that is almost infinitesimally small. its unfortunate... but thems the breaks :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a dramatic change from prior content design.<br />
<br />
IF they ever get gear itemization correct.. Think the charm from Flagging... <br />
<br />
If they can get the zones to be created dynamically..<br />
<br />
If they can actually set challenge ratings close..<br />
<br />
If they can get the timers to work right..<br />
<br />
Lot of If.. but the potential is very nice<br />
<br />
Imagine no racing for content, If you can kill AoW with 30 people, and you have 90? Well hell, kill him 3 times! <br />
<br />
The concept is a new step forward for EQ, I personally like this idea. I think static spawn times so that people can monopolize spawns because of timing is frickin' stupid.</div></div><hr />

VT was great the first time I went through it, evreything was new and exciting. come the 2nd time, i was already starting to feel like &quot;not this 6 hour snooze-fest again....&quot;. <br />
<br />
you're right, no one likes 60+ person zerg fests. i know i don't. the problem is, and people have said this already like 10 times in this same thread, is that SoE made that almost NECESSARY in high-end PoP. then they go and slash the raid size for the next expansion, forcing guilds to divide up. that's kinda crappy design, as those guilds have a right to enjoy this game just as much as everyone else. guilds are usually pretty tight knit groups... you cant just drop people immediatly to get under 36 people nightly. you cant always split up into neat smaller cookie cutter raids either cause you're not always going to have the right classes at the right time, or whatever. people are going to get left out and that's going to suck. <br />
<br />
if you find enjoyment in LDoN, and i'm sure many will, i'll be very happy for you. i'll be glad you're still able to have fun in this game. as for me, i'm losing hope really fast...</div></div><hr />

Uber guilds have dominated this game since Velious, hell maybe even before.  If a guild is already done with time and feels like they have nothing new ahead of them, what is SoE supposed to do?  PoP was the gods for pities sake.  What new challenges are they supposed to come up with for 70+ players at level 65 with gobs of AAXP and the best gear the game has to offer?  Get real, just because a guild shoots through content doesn't mean that they have to provide content for those exact players every single expansion.  There are plenty of other people who'd like to see some content too, content that hasn't been beaten down and taken apart by the uber players nine ways from Sunday and then maybe people might get to see it, if they're lucky and the ubers aren't bored and whacking it just for giggles.<br />

Sorry, no sympathy.  If you've already beaten the planes and feel there is no where else to go, maybe it's time for a new game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
never said it wasn't time for a new game, glatius. unfortunatly... what game? WoW's still a ways off, EQ2 i dont have any faith in, AO and Shadowbane were both incredibly dissapointing in my opinion. Horizons has potential but its still in beta... maybe DAoC? i dunno...<br />
<br />
most of your top-end guilds have put an obscene amount of time into this game and their characters. it's not going to be easy for alot of them to just drop all of that right away. they don't WANT to quit becuase there are parts about this game they still do enjoy, and they'd like to keep enjoying them. what's so wrong with that? <br />
<br />
theres plenty of content they can create beyond the gods... since the gods are destroyed... lets WATCH the world fall into the Age of Chaos or whatever it is when EQ2 starts. revamp old zones to show the changes... lets have massive battles, heros, strange new monsters, demons, whatever... let the uber guilds slay the Arch Overlord of the Neriak Legion or somthing, while the lower levels can grind in the new improved east or west commons... or kithicor... or whatever. Take another look at the Seru vs. Katta relationship in luclin, and develop that. hell, the frogloks took over Grobb... lets see MORE of stuff like that. more frequent changes, like once a week maybe... lets see the balance of power shift as the days, weeks, months pass. lets see some REAL WELL THOUGHT OUT LORE that's INTERESTING to read and be involved in. take all these old zones that people don't grind in anymore and give them a new reason to experience them... the world doesn't need to keep expanding, just change what's already there!<br />
<br />
unfortunatly... all this takes time, money, and skill. and it can all be done without charging 1000 dollars for 20 stupid expansions too. they've done it with Veksar and ChardokB and whatever.. but that stuff is so few and far between. and with EQ2, Lords of Everquest, Everquest: Reloaded, Crack Dealers of Everquest, Live Nude Wood Elves, and whatever other games they're developing, i dont foresee something that massive and different happening... at least not complete and well done. oh well... i'll be sure to not let the door hit me in the ass on the way out.</div></div><hr />

I can't wait for this expansion.  PoP (xp areas) are filled to brimming over with retards that don't know how to play their class or manage aggro, and have never even heard of half the dungeons in the game, let alone been to them.  It sounds like this is going to be more like an old school D&amp;D kind of dungeon, where you crawl through and dismantle it a little at a time, and dont just get to a good spot to camp and wait for repop. :)  This expansion just wasnt designed with raiding in mind; I'm sure the raid portions will be lacking, but since that's not what it's for I really dont mind much.</div></div><hr />

I'm concerned enough about wether they'll manage to decently balance the single group stuff, let alone a raid. I really think whatever the do about high level encounters in EQ they need to get away from the Uber Boss mob vs raid mentality. Need more 'event's' similar to (and hopefully better than) say the coldain ring war so that everyone has a role and featuring  multiple skirmishes requiring orderly and fast reactions (note I don't mean bog standard 'wave' events in a small area). Make clear thinking, discipline and planning (tactics is probably a little much to ask :) )figure more highly in success than wether your MT is geared well enough. <br />

Funny enough, instancing of zones might be one way to allow this sort of implementation to be more common /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. If by stopping at 36 people, do you CHALLENGE those 36 people who feel good about the results?   <br />
<br />
2. If the reward makes it worth doing.     <br />
<br />
SOE has had a terrible track record in this regard.... and it's becoming more and more apparent.   There's lots and lots and lots of gear at the middle end.  Sandwiching more gear in the middle will produce no reasonable desire to make lateral movements for similar reward, no matter how &quot;cool&quot; the zones are, coolness wears off fast.<br />
<br />
I have, sitting in my bank a really really really gay warrior only piercer from the plane of torment.   It's 15/20 with craptacular stats, no proc, and it uses a warrior's worst skill, piercing.    I hold this in my bank as a trophy of idiocy.   It to me represents EXACTLY how loot decisions are blatantly screwed up beyond all comprehension.   Here we have a mob, who by itself isn't a big deal, AE rampages at like 40% health, but not for very much, it's pretty much the first AE ramp mob anyone will come up against, but a pretty easy kill, although at the time, getting there required a good deal of work (Hedge Maze/Terris/Stomach Event/Avatar camping just for the opportunity to engage the mob).  <br />
<br />
A few months later Droga gets revamped... two weapons come out there that put this pile of crap to shame with real aggro procs, similar delay, similar stats etc...  It's considerably easier to pop down to droga and get these two weapons ANY day than to get to and engage this particular mob and the mobs are easier by an order of magnitude.   Every time I go to my bank, I like to look at this thing and go &quot;Wow, the piercer of anal head insertion&quot; cause whoever thought this thing up had their head so far up their ass they haven't seen sunlight for months.<br />
<br />
I saw a link of an FT2 neck from Droga as well.   Pretty crappy stats overall, but the point remains, a lot of us have done a LOT to get flowing thought on our casters, and now it drops from any old exp mob.<br />
<br />
Is LDON going to take this route?   Is it going to obsolete things that were difficult to obtain?    Is there going to be another windblade or equivalent droppable overpowered weapon?   If not, then what will motivate people to go?  If so, then how does that motivate people to trudge through tiers 1-3 in PoP?   Will an EP/Time guild have any motivation to go?  If not, then what will they do while waiting on the next expansion?   If so, thn I suppose it'd be cool, although it's still gay to create a need for megaguilds and then remove that need through hardcapped raid sizes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back in the day, and I am sure you can remember this, you could walk into a dungeon join an exp group and get an upgrade for yourself. Now it wasn't the &quot;best&quot; stuff that you could get, but it was stuff you would gladly use. They are simply tiring to recreate that type of gaming environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As everyone who plays at the high end of the game knows, the requirements have crept up higher and higher to where it's just absurd.  I still remember when I first heard AOW was killed by FoH and LoS back the day before Luclin went live and when I heard FoH had 60 people, it absolutely blew my mind.<br />
<br />
Now, as a raid leader, I find myself actually looking around at how many people I have on a raid, and saying our numbers are 'less than stellar', when we have 50-55 people.<br />
<br />
Everyone at this stage of the game knows and would say that it is a problem, but few would clearly agree on the solution.<br />
<br />
The simplest idea would be to retune encounters so that they were in the 40-50 person range.  The issue here is that, there are a lot of guilds who just don't care and will raid with 70-100 people, just because they aren't really after the challenge, they are after the end result, be it flags or loot.  This is IMO a contributing factor to things getting out of hand.  Sony makes an event tuned for 40 people, and some random guild brings 60 and destroys it so then Sony raises the bar. <br />
<br />
The next solution is what Sony is doing with LDON, limiting the number of groups that can be used.  This is a solution but it has issues, namely you have all these guilds, many of which reluctantly grew huge, who now are restricted to 6 groups.  You can split up and huge guilds will be able to, but it isn't a silver bullet solution.<br />
<br />
What I was personally hoping for, was that they could use LDON like techniques to scale encounters and rewards for different numbers of players.  In this way, 6 groups of highly equipped, skilled players might face one encounter and get 2 drops, and 12 groups might face a different encounter and might get 3-4 drops.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is though, ANY raid content with LDON, is better than none, and it is sort of a step in the right direction.  Hopefully Sony addresses this issue more with whatever expansion is due out in April of next year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's as if Sony looked at my guild's roster and made an expansion.  So I can't complain.<br />
<br />
As a general rule, however, I gotta say that wanting Sony to lift number requirements is daft.  People who have 100 folks in their guild and would like to yawn their way through encounters are just going to have to flippin' work for their reward.  The point of this expansion was to bring the damn game back to the original concept of true AD&amp;D dungeon crawls.  Jesus God, and I sure hope there is a bar before each dungeon. <br />
<br />
Others have already said what I was going to suggest for these zerg guilds:  break into smaller, more challenging groups.  Don't have the utility classes to support multiple raids?  Get them, or get rid of some of the dead weight, or raid other things.   But don't come whine to me about the lack of raid content when we are going into the fourth year of EQ progressing with solely raid content in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-02-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Varaho,<br />
<br />
That's not at ALL what I'm saying.   I absolutely LOVE the concept of having stuff drop where people will equip it.  It encourages people to actually GO to those zones and hunt with the successful &quot;double reward&quot; (exp+usable loot) model.   <br />
<br />
Sebilis was like this, even Velk's and Siren's Grotto were like this.   Hell, Velious was a shining example of how to balance the two.  As was Kunark.<br />
<br />
Let me explain a little better... People want cloaks of flame and runebranded girdles and dragon scales and white dragonhides.   Because of this, people want to do Vox and Nagafen.    People ALSO want to do Vox and Nagafen because it's their first real experience in &quot;raiding&quot; so to speak.   People don't kill Vox to get 13/30 rogue piercers, or eyepatches because they can get better in experience groups.   This is wrong.    Raid level gear should exceed that which is available in a single experience group or which is so common that it is easily attainable by someone doing only experience groups.    The loot tables on Vox/Nagafen (as hell long as it's been since I've done them) should be looked at and kept relatively current.   The Rogue piercer should be in the 13/21ish range, the Eyepatch should have a focus effect and some AC put on it.   The druid 2hb should have something done with it etc.     Keeping the game current and refreshing and giving people something to look forward to is by nature a good thing.   <br />
<br />
Raid level gear being BETTER than exp group level gear is a GOOD thing, raid level gear being the only source for player upgrades is idiocy, or being SO much better that it places an insane gap between raiders/non raiders is a bad thing.    Copper Hammer/Sword of Bloodsworn aren't bad per se, as long as they don't exceed qualitatively that which drops from raid level mobs/encounters.     Currently, they do, which is as much idiocy as their non-existence.    Obsoleting raid level gear is insane, no matter what the target.<br />
<br />
Casai,<br />
<br />
Every encounter you mentioned offers something for people.   Tell me where a Manarobe replacement exists, or a cloak of thorns, hell even a mask of the sky, ring of the sky, galadrulek, twisted steel bastard sword, primal weapons, etc.     The only problem is that you now need to wade through absolute crapola to get to the gems, which still motivate people.    <br />
<br />
My position is simple... there should be enough quality gear dropping in dungeons to make them worthwhile to hunt at, yet raid level gear should by it's very nature be better, from slightly to a LOT depending on the raiding requirements, just not inferior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda off the topic, but in same train of thought..<br />
<br />
I am also of the opinion that they should dramatically increase the value merchants place on items, hehe 10pp for a Blade of Carbnage is kinda funny. This would help limit mudflation ALOT. Sure it would drive up pp price on some stuff, but a lot of twink gear would quickly disappear.<br />
<br />
I also think that any gear over 2 expansions old, should loose NoDROP tags. Exception to this is epics. This would make all velious and below tradeable. and you could sell to vendors for the above PP increase.<br />

A lot of the other mudflation I'm not so sure about. Neither would I neccessarily argue with frodlin that some of the PoP raid encounters are poorly itemised and need be reviewed to reflect the additional effort required. Mudflation is probably one reason POP was designed the way it is, the tuning was done much more toward uber player itemisation thus leaving more casual players with extreme difficulty in functioning and thus requiring further 'fixes' by addition of new inflated power items in exp zones - and thus invalidating more old content itemisation. AA points also played their part in increasing the gap between characters of the same level - i remember being concerned back before SoL about how they might unbalance things and i get the horrible feeling i was right.<br />
<br />
A vicious circle.<br />
<br />
Personally I think EQ is also messed up in the lack of hard limits on so many bits of equipment. It allows lower level characters to bring to bear far more power than the content is designed for. This kills challenge and encourages soloing (particularly detrimental to group dependant characters and in many ways less 'fun' )</div></div><hr />

Totally understand that, what I'm getting at is this:    Vox/Naggy for instance should drop gear that exceeds the quality of that which is generally available for the 46-52 crowd, NOT people who are exp hunting at 60-65.   That 15 damage piercer from fungus grove for instance being better than Vox rogue piercer is stupid, but I'm not opposed to a 15 damage piercer from Droga/Planes, etc.</div></div><hr />

As you know, I'm in an elemental guild... we've killed Rallos 6 times without a single BoW, there's 5 warriors in my guild, none of whom has a BoW.    The fact that something drops doesn't ensure that because you're of a class to equip somehting that you'll have access to it.<br />
<br />
I'm considering going down to Droga to get an UPGRADE... this is wrong in my view that I should need to go to a mid 50's exp zone to get an upgrade to aggro weapons instead of being able to from ALL the gods and bosses I've killed in ToV, Ssra, VT, and PoP, have more than one good aggro weapon that actually has some stats on it.  Timing is clearly part of it.    Having been in BoT early on in PoP when killing Eindride 29 times and getting only fungus clumps and 3 plate BP molds pissed me off but I'm not gonna go back.   It's wrong that I should take a camp which someone who doesn't have the luxury of being in an elemental raiding guild should rightly have without interference from me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. See, because thats what happend in PoP. Guilds could have &quot;worked&quot; for their reward with 40 people, but they instead of doing that, they brought 70 people per raid so they could breeze through and get free rewards while you low-numbers people had to suffer  and work for theirs. Step into fucking elemental planes for some of the minis. or the Rathe encounter, or Plane of Time. Go there, fight there, and then you can start talking about how the uber zergers didn't &quot;earn&quot; their rewards. Bitch. <br />
<br />
You think that Elementals nad TIme encoutners are designed for 40 people, but guilds just bring 70 to make it easier? Let merent you a fucking clue, Sony designed these encounters for large numbers. Do you think guilds wanted to inflate their numbers in the way? Answer is no; read teh FoH boards, 99% of raiding guilds share the opinion. Sony fucked up the enoucnters and forced this to happend. Now they're trying to undo it; and it's not cutting shit. <br />
<br />
Now, the last paragraph. See, with Planes of POwer, SoE basically said &quot;recruit, or you can't progress.&quot; Ask any raiding guild, they can verify this. Guilds that didn't recruit, didn't progress. But, were they quiet about it, hell no. Hell, you're complaining about it now &quot;oh, the uber raiding guilds don't earn their reward, oh, EQ was structured for raiding too much&quot; blah blah. But now, when SoE introduces an expansion that states &quot;cut your roster, or half your people can't raid,&quot; you believe that raiding guilds don't have a right to bitch like you did just one expansion ago. H-Y-P-O-C-R-I-T-E.<br />
<br />
Let me summarise. Some clueless nobody comes here to insult the efforts of at least 10,000 members currently residing in raiding guilds by claiming they never earned their reward, they just zerged everything, waah waah. Then, you claim they have no right to bitch, but you do. Shut the fuck up, crawl back into a fucking corner and go pretend to know something where similar morons will believe you. Here, your shit fucking stinks.<br />
<br />
Now, back to civilized discussion. The simplest solution is to design encounters that would stop forcing raiding guilds to recruit. Enough people will leave these guilds with the end of PoP, and just through natural progression, since PoP tends to burn people out. Encounters can be fine-tuned in a more gradual process to require less people, and impose better caps. PoP encounters at the high-end are designed for at least 60+ and higher in some cases and are capped at 72. New encounters can be designed for, say 48 and put a 60 cap. Basically, design an encounter for X amount of people and set the raid cap to say X + 6-12. <br />
<br />
But, lower the numbers GRADUALLY. Hell,I would be all for 2 typesof raiding encounters; ones with a 36 or lower cap or whatnot, and ones with a 60 or lower cap, to accomodate both smaller and larger guilds. Believe me, no one likes having massive rosters; it means more people to organize, more people to itemize, more people to regulate, etc. But, when you design an expansion requiring guilds to recruit or not progress, and follow it up with an expansion requiring guilds to cut rosters or have members left out, this is little more than a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Hell, if Sony would just come out and say &quot;This is another expansion designed for the non-raiders, sorry raiding guilds.&quot; That would at least show class, since then people can finally quit en-masse, instead of clinging to hopes as unfeasible as warrior balancing. But, if you notice in the developers quote, they specifically said the encouters were designed to accomodate the raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />

/nod.  I can see this as being perfectly reasonable.  Perhaps have the encounters themselves change depending on the number of raiders.  36 and less and you get raid type A, between 37 and 54 you get raid type B, and anything over 54 gets you raid type C.   I think my biggest complaint/point is that there needs to be new raid content that isn't just for the uberest of uber guilds or requires you zerg with a bunch of gimps and pray.  But I can also see the point that there needs to be content for those guilds forced to increase their rosters just to be competative in PoP.

Go there, fight there, and then you can start talking about how the uber zergers didn't &quot;earn&quot; their rewards. Bitch. <br />
<br />
An encounter that requires 60 people to succeed is not zerging.  That encounter is not pre-ele TT and its not RZ.  There is a difference between recruiting for an encounter and zerging.  You know it and I know it so quit picking on the straw man.  <br />
<br />
You think that Elementals nad TIme encoutners are designed for 40 people, but guilds just bring 70 to make it easier? Let merent you a fucking clue, Sony designed these encounters for large numbers. <br />
<br />
Examine my prior post with a magnifying glass and point to the text where I mentioned 40 people, or even 70 people, sir.  Again, straw man ... you ... read the memo.  You are arguing black and you mistakenly think I'm arguing white, when we both know there is gray.  Here is the truth of the matter, whether you care to acknowledge it or not:  PoP is a raid expansion, but many guilds have recruited far more people than is necessary to succeed in any given encounter.  They did this because they didn't want to go through a 4-hour event and then realize they lacked a cleric, or lose because an enchanter went LD.  They did this because even many of the hard-core players need to take vacations, and go see movies, and eat dinner with their spouses.  They did this because sometimes having 150 people on your roster still only yeilds 65 people on a good night.  And, yes, they also did this because some guilds don't care how many people they have and they don't care that they've trivialized an encounter - they only care that they win.  PoP encounters are tuned for too many people, but many raiding guilds have taken on even more than that. <br />
<br />
 Now, the last paragraph. See, with Planes of POwer, SoE basically said &quot;recruit, or you can't progress.&quot; Ask any raiding guild, they can verify this. Guilds that didn't recruit, didn't progress. But, were they quiet about it, hell no. Hell, you're complaining about it now &quot;oh, the uber raiding guilds don't earn their reward, oh, EQ was structured for raiding too much&quot; blah blah. But now, when SoE introduces an expansion that states &quot;cut your roster, or half your people can't raid,&quot; you believe that raiding guilds don't have a right to bitch like you did just one expansion ago. H-Y-P-O-C-R-I-T-E. <br />
<br />
And, yet, in my opinion its that some rage-filled slobbering troll bitched first about the PoP expansion requiring too many people and then came back here to bitch again when the LDoN expansion answers that complaint and requires less people.  Hm.  Or maybe its that he comes here to trivialize the progression of 100,000 members currently having fun grouping in small zones because he thinks Sony must tailor its game content to 40% of the playerbase.  SWF looking for warriors who can maturely talk about issues in game on this board.  Likes romantic walks on the beach, Ray Charles, and making ignorant little peices of shit eat their own words here.  Open up and say awwwwww, Wilhelmm, ooppps your foot is in your mouth, my bad. <br />
<br />
I see how comprehending my post was a challenge for you so let me explain it to you a little.  I enjoy the PoP expansion and I look forward to working my way through it, recruitment or no recruitment.  I have enjoyed every expansion Sony has released.  I am in a raiding guild and I appreciate raid expansions.  But I am also a player who came from a background of AD&amp;D and I will appreciate equally small group dungeon crawls and I think its high time an expansion of that sort was released, just for the flippin' novelty of it.  I appreciate all styles of game play.  I don't begrudge you your elemental planes (I will simply work hard to get there myself), and I suggest you not begrudge the smaller guilds their dungeon crawls (you can simply learn how to attack encounters with smaller numbers). <br />
<br />
Raiders can bitch, but I don't see why they ought to.  They did what they did in order to progress through raid content.  They have raid content and now they will also have smaller-group raid content.  I don't believe Sony requires that rosters be cut and I don't believe rosters will be cut.  Instead, raid guilds will break into sub-raids and attack the new dungeons in teams.  I suspect they might actually have more fun that way. <br />
<br />
Let me summarise. Some clueless nobody comes here to insult the efforts of at least 10,000 members currently residing in raiding guilds by claiming they never earned their reward, they just zerged everything, waah waah. Then, you claim they have no right to bitch, but you do. Shut the fuck up, crawl back into a fucking corner and go pretend to know something where similar morons will believe you. Here, your shit fucking stinks.<br />
<br />
/crapsherpants<br />
<br />
Now, can we both talk this out without waving our respective dicks all over the place?  It makes a mess.   You seem to think that Sony demanded guilds recruit to bursting and therefore has some moral obligation to fine tune future encounters to those raiding guilds, whether that be by releasing another raid expansion or releasing a bunch of progressively smaller raid expansions.  But Sony created a game that holds both the power gamer and the serious grouper and these two players may be mutually exclusive.  It owes nothing to the power gamer that it doesn't owe to the rest of its player base.  You wanna bitch, fine.  But recognize that your style of play perhaps accounts for less than half of the player base and Sony is running a for-profit corporation.  Moreover, while PoP could ONLY be consumed by the power gamer, the new expansion can be experienced by everyone.  Raiders will adapt, you've shown you know how.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lemme quote your previous post:<br />
<br />
&quot;People who have 100 folks in their guild and would like to yawn their way through encounters <br />
<br />
This is your exact line. Re-read it yourself. Yea, you didn't mention specific numbers. Your implication is clear however, you think large guilds yawn (meaning no effort required, and the mention of 100 folks indicates zerg). If you had alternate intentions in mind, fine, but learn to phrase correctly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And, yet, in my opinion its that some rage-filled slobbering troll bitched first about the PoP expansion requiring too many people and then came back here to bitch again when the LDoN expansion answers that complaint and requires less people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes. That is what happend. Except see, you're missing the entire point. Let me illustrate. Bob's basketball team has 12 players. They are a competitve but friendly bunch, and like to have fun together while defeating tough opponents in tournaments, while consistently improving their game. However, they have reached a point where every tournament available requires each team to have 20 players minimum. <br />
<br />
So, Bob's gets an additional 8 players, they become friends, win the tournaments. However, once their done, the only avaialable tournaments now require a team to have no more than 12 people. So, Bob's team is forced to cut 8 players, 8 of their friends just to progress further. But, it gets worse. Sure, the 8 players could start a team of their own, but there is only one good center in the 20-man group. So, the 8 people are now left without a team, and without the ability to start their own team due to lack of necessary positions.<br />
<br />
Now, translate that to LDoN. Same shit. Same problems. If Sony wants to scale down raid requirements, fine. But it has to be done gradually, not in a way forcing guilds to cut their rosters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm. Or maybe its that he comes here to trivialize the progression of 100,000 members currently having fun grouping in small zones because he thinks Sony must tailor its game content to 40% of the playerbase.

<br />
Oohh, yes. I forgot. See, because you're right, there's simply no content out there for non-raiders. Right, I forgot that every zone in Everquest has a label prior to entry; <br />
&quot;min level 65, min 60 raiders&quot;. Let me rent you a clue. There is content out there /gasp. NToV, Ssra, VT, hell VP for that matter, there are raid-zones out there that don't require numbers en-masse. Hell, you can do NToV probably with 18 non-uber people easy. <br />
<br />
So what is it you want? The content is out there. Yes, it's been done before. But you're not talking about wanting server-firsts, but content. You can't possibly tell me that a casual raiding guild finishing NToV, or a semi-serious raiding guild finishing VT has less available content that yields beneficial loot and progression than an uber guild in/finishing PoTime. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Wow. your inability to read astounts me. Look at my posts. I am all for smaller guilds getting new content. I'll argue that there's plenty of content already available, but thats not the point. Look at the original message, SoE stated that they &quot;have not forgotten about the raiding guilds, and the six-group or less raids were designed to accomodate them (as well).&quot; THAT's what I'm complaining about, this design does not accomodate these guilds because it forces them to either cut rosters, further recruit utility classes to form multiple raids (which will STILL invariably leave people high &amp; dry), or leave a lot of people high &amp; dry while their friends are raiding. <br />
<br />
If SoE came out and said &quot;this expansion is designed for smaller guilds, not large-sized raiding guilds,&quot; thats fine. Then peopel can just retire and be merry. But trying to pull this 36-cap as &quot;content for raiding guilds&quot; is bullshit.<br />
<br />
&quot;/crapsherpants<br />
<br />

<br />
See above. Wanna release an expansion catered to smaller guilds, fine. Just say it outright, and run the risk of losing your (usually) longest and most stable subcribers. Create an expansion to suit both small and large guilds, great, people will be happy, but it's gonna require careful planning, and still has to take into account what happend in previous expansions I.e, if the previous expansion had mobs that trip-flurry for 3k and AoE, and drop 190/190 loot, the end-boss of the next expansion can't hit for 1500, no Aoe and drop 100/100 loot. Well, it can, but you can't call this an expansion to suit raiding guilds. <br />
<br />
Thats the problem with LDoN. It's advertised as an expansion that caters to casual and power-gamers alike, but the fact is, it doesn't cater to power-gamers in any way based on the mechanics of the previous expansions. So, either add REAL raid content or stop falsely advertising.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you're gonna curse, don't be a whiny pussy and blank it out, just say it. Your claim to fame that EQ has no content for smaller guilds is utterly wrong. Simple as that. Let me break it down for you, in terms of encounters and # of  non-hardcore lvl 65's without uber gear.<br />
<br />
- NToV: all of it can be cleared with 3 groups easy.<br />
- Kael: Tormax is 3-group. Vindi 2-group. Statue about the same. AoW you'd need maybe 36 for.<br />
- The Deep: Burrower, 36. THO: 18<br />
- Akheva: IV, 18-20 people really. Shei, 36 probably, 40 tops<br />
- UP: All named, including RC and Doomshade can be done with 3-4 groups easy. <br />
- Ssra: Rhag 1: 1 group. Rhag 2: 1-2 groups. Arch-Lich: 36 people. XTC: 30 people. Cursed cycle, including cursed himself: 36 max. HP/Emp; 40 or less if you have the right classes.<br />
- VT: 40 with classes. <br />
- All RoK dragons are 1-group really. <br />
- SoV dragons: Kel'Dorek is 1-group. Zland is maybe 2 groups. Kland/Sont: 3-4 group once you learn it, esp. Sont. Yeli: 3-4 groups. Dain is 2-3 groups too but a pain to pull.<br />
<br />
&quot;god, sorry for the abusiveness but MAN am i tired of a few people in full elemental with their 600(counting alts) plus member guilds dictating what the games need to go on, because the raise the bar on the game for the rest of us that dont feel like treating this game like a buisness or buying PP from your enchanter mule just to keep up .i.. &gt;_&lt; ..i. you self-severing &quot;uber&quot; guilds&quot;<br />
<br />
Planes of Power is at the moment the only expansion in Everquest that really requires numbers anymore. There are plenty of named that can be done with smaller numbers. As for the 600 members quote, Fuck you and your clueless stereotyping<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;again i reiterate, if you dont like small raid set ups tough shit because the rest of us in small FUN guilds finally get something cool to try, why should everyone bow down and kiss YOUR ass each expantion? (directed twords uber guilds whining about small raid content)&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, you fucking idiot, if SoE wants to release content for smaller guilds, even though I will argue that such content already exists en-masse, fine. But, look at the fucking original quote before you come here to spew this bullshit. They claim this content is designed to suit raidng guilds, which it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wilhelmm, to some degree I do agree with what you are saying about SoE's statement.  From what I gather the expansion really isnt going to offer any content for powerful raiding guilds.  However, the fact that you think that all the stuff you listed is 1-3 groupable clearly illustrates that you have no idea where Gerick is coming from.  RoK dragons one groupable? Not any of the groups I've been in recently.  Not everyone has the time or the inclination to be level 65 with lots of AA.  I've been playing since 1999 and my warrior (my first character and by far the highest level) is 57 with 3 AA.  Admittedly I've taken several long breaks, and don't really spend that much time in game due to having a seriously busy RL, but still it clearly illustrates that a lot of players are nowhere near the level of the game you are.  Many of us look forward to both the xp and the small raid aspect of the upcoming expansion, the reasons for that have already been presented in detail in this thread.    And Gerick, calm down man.  No matter how valid your argument may be, telling someone to fuck off generally isnt a good way to win them over to your point of view.  I understand just how you feel, but if you take a deep breath and calm down before you post, you'll come much closer to making everyone understand where you're coming from.<br />

<br />
But Wilhelmm all this content you claim that is available for the small raiding guilds is also available for the uber guilds and the not-quite-uber-but-getting-close guilds.  You consider it beneath you because you've already moved past it.  Not every guild feels that way.  They're perfectly happy, or at least perfectly willing, to go back and whack mobs that they're way beyond because there is a chance a piece or two of useful loot might drop.<br />
<br />
I hear your desire to have new content for your large uber guild.  I also hear the desire for the small non-uber guilds to have new content and not just the uber guild left overs.  The large uber guilds got PoP, the expansion that for well over 6 months was vastly restricted to only those players who could find the time for long quests or who were members of a raiding guild that could take down the content.<br />
<br />
Now an expansion is being release that looks like it will accommodate those guilds that pretty much got left out in the cold with PoP.  Why is this a bad thing?  Why must every expansion focus on giving the uber guilds more content while denying said content to the bulk of the players?   My conclusion is that it doesn't.  This expansion, in particular, won't be primarily for the uber guilds.  Yes, it kind of sucks if you're an uber guild member.  You've gone through your content already and you're getting bored.  However, I don't see that as justification to kick all the non-uber guild people in the balls and tell them to go play in the old content because you don't want it any more.</div></div><hr />

Boo fucking hoo. If you're looking for sympathy for your real/fictitious &quot;disorder&quot; you're barking up the wrong tree. This is a message board, not a psych ward. Now, you wanna step up and try to sound macho, let's go Junior:<br />
<br />

<br />
Planes of Power was announced as almost exclusively high-end raiding expansion. That's what it was. Yes, it had little or no content for small raiding forces, but it was not marketed as such an expansion. Without question, it did offer something for non-raiders, especially after the opening of Tier 2/3 zones to the public; including more AA's, expanded level cap, a shit-load of recipees and items, including ornate, windblades, etc. Basically, PoP ful-filled it's marketing model exactly; a high-end raiding expansion that does offer something for non-raiders as well.<br />
<br />
Hell, even Legacy of Ykesha (which by the way, despite being designed for non-raiders, is an expansion that no-one seems to like in terms of zones and content), even this expansion fulfilled the market mold. This scenario is different. It's hard to tell exactly what LDoN is being marketed as, other than as a collection of dungeons. However, what bothers me is that it's marketed as an expansion catered to high-end raiding guilds and casuals alike, but there is no sign so far of this expansion catering in any way to raiding guilds. <br />
<br />
If you want to call SoL/SoV content old trash, it is your perogative to do so. I would disagree, since these are still interesting raiding areas with very decent loot (I have yet to see a real warrior replacement for the talisman of Vah, an SoL item). Why does it matter if other guilds have done this stuff before you exactly? <br />
<br />
Now, onto the rest of your shit-fling. If this collection of 30 &quot;knowledgeable&quot; people are anything like you, I will bet heavy amounts of money that I can find multiple times more insolent clueless maggots among your group than my own. News-flash, raiding guilds don't recruit ebayers. Your claim to fame that uber guilds just zerg everything down fits the &quot;I'm an uber guild rejectee who can't raid the shit they do, or have the items they have, so I'll be a supa-kool duud and call them zerglings.&quot; Weak jack-ass.

<br />
The numbers I posted, like I already stated, were designed around a CASUALLY-equipped level 65 player. I didn't indicate AA amounts becaue this will vary with class. NToV can be dropped EASILY by 3 groups of casual raiders without god-like gear and 200+ aa. As for the last statement, listen up you Worthless piece of shit, I've earned my way to where i am today. That's right, I didn't whine when I played casually about the mean uber guilds and how they're all just loser zergers. I never bought a copper from PA, and never will, so why don't you crawl the fuck back into oblivion and to whatever sorry fucks that will listen to your rambling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate to break it to you, but most small guilds cannot pull 18-36 level 65 people out of their pants on any given day of the week.<br />
<br />
I'm in a small guild, and at our peak (before PoP) we had about 2 groups of level 60's, and another 2 groups of 50-59 people. Casual players, however, generally arent online every day every minute they can spare. If you're lucky, you'll get maybe a good 2/3 of those people on the weekends, and probably only the higher level half during the week (thus why they are the higher levels).<br />
<br />
After PoP, we lost about one group of the level 65's to retirement or raid guilds. So now we are left with one group of level 60+ (only two 65 people), and a couple groups of 50-60. Yes, we can raid stuff and we do raid stuff - but we dont have the ability to just whip up 2 or 3 groups of 65s anytime we want to go raid NToV or Ssra. Your concept of small guilds is a little skewed, I think.</div></div><hr />

You are like a 60 year old man trying to remember what it was like to be 29.  Give it up.<br />
<br />
You no longer have any conception of what it is like to be in a mid-sized guild.  Mid-sized guilds cannot field 40 level 65's, period.  That used to be the roster for the biggest guilds on the server, when the biggest guilds on the server were taking down things like Emp.  On my server many of the mobs you list are on rotation - hello VT, Emp, Cursed, XTC, HP, NTOV, AoW every 7 weeks.   I know many LARGE guilds with well-equiped members on my server cannot take down the mobs on your list with the numbers you have listed.  Moreover, non-power gamers would never have the time to invest in Emp camping much less VT shard camping.  You just ignorantly made all the mid-sized guilds' point for us.  That list up there?  Yeah, that is why a new expansion targetted at mid-level raid guilds is necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Since you just conviniently forgot to quote the encounters I noted that required less than 30 people, and I listed quite a few. If you'll contest to the fact that at least Rhag 1/2, RoK dragons are feasible for a casual guild, I will contest to the fact that 30+ member encounters would be difficult. <br />
<br />
I will contest to the notion that casual guilds don't often have scores of level 65's on. However, having been in a small guild myself for close to 2 years, I remember those things called raiding alliances. A friend on mine on the Xegony server is in a small guild who actually dropped AoW recently with their raiding allied guild. Hell, on my own server, two guilds that were renown as being non-raiding casual guilds have allied and have already notched Agnarr, and Rydda, both rather notable accomplishments. <br />
<br />
Granted, not all guilds have raiding alliances. But, I've seen many alliances, on my server and outside of it. And, essentially, think about it this way. SoE has promisedto &quot;cater to raiding guilds&quot; in terms of encounters. They will likely put the best loot on the 36-man encounters. Since they are at least supposedly designed to cater to raiding guilds, they will liekly be of significant difficulty level, and require a significant number of people. You can bet on the fact that these 36-man and fewer encounters will require lvl 65 with a hefty amount of AA. If you have difficulty getting 36 lvl 65's for an AoW raid, what exactly will change with LDoN?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, add some more to those numbers and i agree with you, too bad higher up guilds will do this shit with 1-3 groups when they're bored cus it's off-raid hours, and they can't instantly pull together 50+ people for a raid.<br />
<br />
So add your list to Tier 3 Encounters + VT + Ele Planes and for some others Time, and you have your high end content.   PoP was tailored to the hardcore raiding guilds, let them make one for the casual player. Just because you don't get everything in every expansion is no reason to bitch and moan that SoE is fucking over high end raiding guilds. They're not...there's another expansion TBA after LDoN and i can almost guarentee it'll be mostly high-end content.<br />
<br />
If you can't wait (less than 6 months most likely)  then leave and go play WoW or Horizons or EQ2 or whatever you're moving to. EQ won't miss you, like someone said, it's 4 or 5% of the game that's in the high end right now. If you guys can't wait then quit and spaces open up for other guilds that will move in, that couldn't get in before because all the encounters were ganked out from under them by high-ends.<br />
<br />
Obviously most of you guys that are complaining aren't happy with the game, quit for a couple months until the next expansion comes out. or quit altogether.<br />

Emp/HP maybe, and even this is questionable. VT you can add more to make clearing faster but it's certainly possible with 40 and correct classes. Everything else there is about right. Rhag 1/2 were 1-2 group encounters when the level cap was 60. At 65, they are certainly 1-2 groupable. Lord Vyemm, the hardest dragon in NToV has been 2-grouped by an uber guilds on our server, but this was way before they had utterly spectacular gear. UP assessment is correct; again, RC was 3-4 groupable at lvl 60. RoK dragons could have been 1-grouped at level 60 cap. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of your post, I'll say this for a 5th and final time. If SoE wants to make a non-raiding expansion, fine, go ahead. But, do so and expect that much of your high-end gamers will leave. But, don't create a casual-gamers expansion and add some bullshit encounters clearly not suited for raiding guilds and say &quot;well, this expansion also caters to raiders.&quot; Either create raiding content or stop marketing this expansion as having it. <br />

<br />
Way more than 4-5% occupy the high-end game. I would venture to guess that at least 20,000 EQ players have elemental planar access. Not to mention these are the most stable accounts SoE has since they've been around the longest, and since they are least likely to close their accounts due to massive time investment in their respective character. Not to mention that high-end guilds who leave MMORPGS are the most vocal about it, and have a funny way of drawing more people away from the game. Want proof; check out what happend to DAoC when raiding guilds started leaving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelorm</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah but DAoC didn't have almost 5 years under it's belt with 400,000 subscriptions. There's enough people that if raiding guilds start leaving the smaller guild's progression will speed up, and they'll be in elementals/time by the time the next raiding expansion comes out. The 'uberguilds' may be vocal, but that won't hurt SoE that much. They've made their dues off EQ and i don't think they could care less if some people left. 13 x 400,000 (which doesn't take into account the legends subscribers) = 5.2 million a month, which is much more than enough to pay employees and maintain servers and all that crap that they's still be pulling a good 4 million bucks a month. Take off 100,000 subscribers if for some reason there was a mass cancellation by all uberguilds and some of the people affected by them...13 x 300,000 = 3.9 million, take off the very generous 1.2 from before and you're left with 2.7 million dollars profit a month off a game that's been going for 5 years. They're not hurting...so they'll go on advertising what they want.<br />
<br />
If you know it's bullshit don't buy it, if you think ranting on this board is going to make it to SoE's advertising department, lol...then all the power to you.<br />

If you look at EQ closely, it's a shitty game. Old graphics, poor game mechanics, shitty class balance, etc. It's lasted this long through a barrage of content. Once the raiders leave, the remaining gamers may (there's a good chance they will) care less about content and more about all the other elements associated with online RPG's. For people who don't care about massive amounts of content, there will be far less pull toward subcribing to EQ, especially with thousands of the longest-standing EQ sucribers preaching openly about how shitty EQ is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree with you that the older characters are the ones that care about content the most, since i've played since right after RoK was released.<br />
<br />
SoE is trying to make EQ last until the changeover to EQ2 is all done. When they get a good playerbase with a decent number of subscriptions they'll scrap EQ1. They'll probobly leave the servers up and have a gm per server, and whoever wants to volunteer as a guide and all that crap. But they'll quit working on it, doesn't matter what they say.<br />
<br />
They're trying to keep the largest number of subscribers until they can setup another good game with a lot of people. They know EQ is going to die, there were never as many balance issues and content issues before. They're satisfying the masses. Why are melees getting shafted? the majority of players are casters/hybrids...and why is there no end-game content coming out with LDoN (they said 36 person raid encounters, they never said end-game)? because the majority of characters are casual players, or semi-hardcore in a smaller guild.<br />
<br />
Keep the majority happy until they've soaked it for what it's worth and move on. Business is fun isn't it? :D<br />

I wouldnt necessarily say that. I've been playing for 4 years, and have over 250 days played on my main. Almost every person in my small guild has been playing since before Kunark. <br />
<br />
If you look at EQ closely, it's a shitty game.<br />
<br />
EQ isnt a shitty game. It's by far the best online RPG on the market. That's why it is #1 and all the predictions of it's doom have been nothing but hot air. Everquest is the granddaddy of all virtual fantasy games to come. In time there will be some mind-blowing other games out there - but every one of them will have some features borrowed from Everquest. And the people who make those games will have learned a great deal about what works from Everquest. And when you finally do move on to another game, you'll find yourself comparing it to Everquest.<br />
<br />
Now before you go there let me say, I'm not a guide or a gamemaster or employee of Sony or related to Everquest in any way other than paying for my two accounts. I'm just a longtime player who can remember all the amazing things about this game when I first started playing 4 years ago - and it was a much smaller and simpler game then. It's only grown since then. It still has all those amazing aspects that drew you into the game in the first place - just many of them are taken for granted as time has passed. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is - we're all still playing, right? When was the last time you played a game of CivIII for 4 years? Or Diablo? Or Madden 2003? I got about 40 other computer games collecting dust (including DAoC) on my shelves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's number 1 because of content. DAoC is designed far better. I would imagine the same holds true for other games as well. Eq has remained #1 because it's kept the player-base interested with a plethora of content. Thats what drove people from DAoC, it had none. Thats what will drive raiding guilds from EQ, lack of content. <br />
<br />
Yes, there are some casual gamers who have played for 2+ years and are in small guilds. But I will take a guess that at least as many of the older players if not more are in raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And as a corporation hungry for profits, Sony has generally put a lot of thought and effort into its game.  Wil, you may argue that 200,000 players have elemental flags.  That is a gross exaggeration.  I'd personally hypothesize that there are around 1000 players on Povar with elemental access, not including alts.  I can't speak for other servers, but I don't imagine a gap that wide when Povar is one of the oldest servers.  Regardless, such a statemenet overlooks the fact that at least 10x that many do not have access.  Sony recognized the mudflation and the concerns of the majority and responded by taking its next release of content down a notch.  Because it also wanted to provide content to raiders (and, like, six groups should be considered a large raid) it revised the content for larger groups as well. <br />
<br />
Sony has problems with some things.  IMO and without having seen the release yet, LDoN isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that the beta is out, I have heard there are a couple of pretty cool things, assuming they work right:<br />
<br />
1.  When you go to one of these instanced zones, it looks at your party's gear and modifies the drop tables to make sure what you get is an upgrade.  I assume this works on the 36 person raids as well as the single group encounters.<br />
<br />
2.  If you are well equiped, the difficulty scales up.  It also scales with party member level.  Basically high end players will see more risk and more reward.  I think you can actually set some kind of control that makes the difficulty and reward go up as well.<br />
<br />
Also, as a member of a medium level raiding guild, I think this could be an awesome expansion assuming it works right.  My guild currently is at the level of being just barely able to kill MB in PoI and we are not in Ssra or VT yet but are working on it.  Our biggest problem is we need to equip our players better and there is so much compettion for mobs like KT, Rhags, AL, AoW, etc. that it is almost impossible to actually raid them when 15 other guilds at our level or higher on our server are also wanting them.  LDoN might solve this problem for us since it eliminates the constant competition for upgrade mobs.<br />
<br />
For people in an elemental level guild, this expansion might be best considered a series of low stress adventures to do when in between big raids, not meant to replace PoP content but to supplement it and break up the monotony of constant raiding and AA grinds.  <br />
<br />
For everyone else, this expansion definitely has the potential to alleviate the pain cause by banging our heads against the brick wall that PoP represents for us.  I hope they have some nice upgrades for people at our level.</div></div><hr />
