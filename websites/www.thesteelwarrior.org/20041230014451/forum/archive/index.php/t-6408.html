I play an ogre warrior and a guild that I'm applying for has a requirement of Stawart Endurance for their warriors. Is this really necessary for ogres? Not much of my time is spent with my back turned towards the mob I'm fighting and as I understand it only applies to melee stuns and not to magic stuns. <br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know if we can be stunned if we are under an illusion (ie NDT)? I know I loose my innate smash when illusioned, but don't recall too much about stun resistance.</div></div><hr />

For Adds, SE is pretty damned nice :)<br />
<br />
If you want in that guild, my guess is SE is necssary for you.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't help on magic based stuns at all, and so it only gives a CHANCE of stopping stuns from behind. Illusions don't remove your innate stun resistance. Therefore, the only time it's really usefull for an ogre is when you're running away.<br />

  What? How often are you tanking adds anywhere with your back? You don't dodge, parry or riposte when a mob is hitting your backside, so the only time you should ever have a mob at your back is when something unexpected happens... and then only for the 1-2 seconds it takes for someone else to split the mob or for you to manuever the mob in front of you.</div></div><hr />

No. Remind them Ogres get frontal stun immunity.<br />

You keep it.<br />
Ogre Warrior here, lots of raiding, lots of illusions to be able to corner, i dont even remember the last time i got stunned with something else then a spell/proc.</div></div><hr />
