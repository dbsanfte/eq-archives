<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have these two weapons, and  I am curious how long in PoP they will last?  IE, are there anything between those 2 and RZtW or Time stuff for aggro?  My guild wont be doing any higher end Luclin mobs/zones, and will probably be eventually be doing AoW just to say we completed Velious.  I am getting close to being able to buy anger3 augments, and wanted some insight to the higher end too see if ill replace the CHSD or GBoS at any time before RZtW.  I have a GSot4W for 2hander action.  <br />
<br />
Only thing i dont like about the GBoS is the knockback, when 4 warriors on a raid are using em, mob positioning becomes a headache, so have to have em put away unless im tanking, which I is about 25% of the big mobs.<br />
<br />
Its a casual guild, so we wont be getting to RZ anytime soon.  Farming BoT Towers, TT and Grummus down, Getting ready to try  Behemoth again soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are planning on hitting Ssra then bloodfrenzy is too good to pass up.  Piss poor drop rate though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Put anger3 on your Gsto4W and bank the 1handers.<br />
<br />
I have them too, never use them. Even without added procs the Gso4W is better to use both for dps and aggro.. /w anger3 the staff simply rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are not doing Luclin, then getting a BoC is really the only upgrade you can expect before you guys make some headway in to PoP.<br />
<br />
As far as bagging the 1hers for a GSot4W, do same parsing before you do that. I have a Greater Poleaxe of Sorrow (35/24) and surprisingly does not do much more DPS than my 1hers. If they are close, then the 1hers will provide tons more agro than a GSot4W since the innate proc doesn't do much for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anger Aug your GBoS, it will do fine for what you need. Don't aug the CHSD, as it'd be a waste of an aug if you plan on doing AoW.<br />
<br />
Aug your GBoS, save up your adv points for when you knock down AoW and get a BoC. Aug the BoC.<br />
<br />
If you plan on skipping SSRA, then GBoS will prolly be the best 1 hander you see for agro purpouses, with the exception of BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EQLiquidslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would also recommend auging your GBoS with anger3, and waiting for a BoC to upgrade your CHSD. GBoS, you will find, rivals BoC for agro, and some even use it in mainhand with the combo. Personally I have BoC/GBoS combo and its awesome.. will last you into the elementals.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, we are skipping SSRA.  Reading posts on droprates of hategiver, doesnt look like its worth it just for the HGer.  Thanks for the info guys.  Ill prob add anger2 to GBoS, since its aggro is allready pretty good, ang2 for BoC if ever, then save up for other LDoN stuff.  I do have various controled logs of my weapons somewhere, so ill take a look at the parses as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would atleast Anger 3 one of your weps. I understand 2x 1150 points is alot, but its worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I put anger 2 on my GBoS and anger 2 on my flameforge hammer and I have extremely good agro and it is really all I need for experience groups.  I am still saving up for anger 3 for when I get a BoW but since I actually have a chance at one now I didn't want to spend all those points on GBoS if I was just going to bank it.   I think a GBoS with Anger 3 and a BoC with anger 3 would be incredible though if you have the time and points to do it and are not going to have a chance at a BoW or SEWS anytime soon.  Don't waste the points on a CHSD though, definitely not worth it unless you absolutely can not ever get a BoC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is is worth 300kpp to get a BoC over a CHSD for:<br />
<br />
1 dam/del,<br />
30ish hp<br />
and 300 to anger (400 vs 700)?<br />
<br />
I don't think so.  Especially if you have a GBoS and can double mod both.  (stun/taunting blow/anger3/anger3)<br />
<br />
It would seem that the cost/return isn't there for a purchased BoC upgrade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I Anger3'd my CHSD, works like a champ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Part of your question was concerning the usefulness of your weapons in PoP right ?<br />
<br />
dual wield in PoP = unhappy clerics.<br />
<br />
2hander in PoP = happy clerics. <br />
<br />
the GboS and the CHSD are really nice 1handers... I have used them , they're wondefull. They're not in the same league as the Gso4W. More dps, less incoming DPS, even before the anger augments Gso4W held aggro better then the dual wield combo, Nm the stun and hate-procs. (Now maybe Offensive AA's like PB3 and Fero play a role here..)<br />
<br />
1-2k ripostes will screw you up bigtime, or at least irritate you mightely :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">More dps, less incoming DPS, even before the anger augments Gso4W held aggro better then the dual wield combo, Nm the stun and hate-procs.I would like to know how you are getting stun and hate procs out of a GSot4W. The innate proc is 75dd only, hardly very good for agro. Also, the difference in DPS is not as much as you would think assuming you have similar 1h and 2h offensive AAs. GBoS+CHSD are far better agro weapons than a GSot4W. The only time ripostes really come in to play is when you are tanking heavy hitters, over 1k or so. For the majority of exp mobs, you are better off with better agro than the slight difference in ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">With Nm the stun and hate procs I meant the 1hander procs. Maybe I should have put it clearer.  For me the GSot4W simply worked a lot better then the 1handers.. I do have punishing blade3. I never had any problem keeping aggro on me, and the DPS output is a lot better.  Since then we have added tools like the anger augments and the incite tools. I am not stating that the 2 1handers /w anger3 procs are 'no good aggro' or 'no good use'. I am saying that *if* you have those 3 weapons and are gonna put an anger3 augment on any of the 3, your best bet IMO is the staff.<br />
<br />
Ripostes come into play all the time. You just notice the bigger numbers when you fight a big mob. Your cleric notices the difference against 'small mobs' like BoT or Tac trash. If I can avoid a X-amount of damage and thus save my cleric a X amount of mana, should I not do so just because of some preconception that I should dual wield ? <br />
<br />
I have all 3 weapons, I have had them for sometime now. I have an Anger3 augment on my staff. I have no aggro problems*. Not in xp groups, not in Ldon, not in Ldon HR missions, not on raids. I am not stating 2handing is always better then dualwielding, each has it's pro's and con's. However with the choices presented 2handing is the way to go.<br />
<br />
*Within reason ofcourse...I'm not saying a 100% aggro lock here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It would seem that the cost/return isn't there for a purchased BoC upgrade <br />
<br />
Considering the insanely high drop rate of BoCs from AoW I wouldn't buy one I would just kill the AoW for one.  AoW drops at least 1 BoC every 2-3 kills and a few times he has dropped 2 at once for us.<br />
<br />
Also I am sorta curious why your guild is skipping ssra.  I can understand not getting emp keys and VT keys for your guild, but if the other ssra bosses like cursed, creator, high priest are up they are easy loot.  Also despite what many people say I actually like ssra a lot :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can tank anything pre-elemental with dual wield easy.  That includes Rallos zek the Warlord.  Riposte damage is only going to make a huge difference when you go after mobs like general Reparm in plane of fire, etc.  Until you get there, don't stress on riposte damage, get your defensive AAs and you will be ok.</div></div><hr />
