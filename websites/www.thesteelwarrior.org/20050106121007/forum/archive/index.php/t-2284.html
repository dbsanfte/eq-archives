I twinked myself fairly good (first char was a 62 shaman) before I found this site.  I'm kind of worried that I may have goofed up in gear selection.  Any suggestions on things I did right, things I did wrong, things to go for?  I'm tapped out at this point, but can raise the capital if necessary.  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Just need to get a few more levels so you can upgrade SoZ/OSotG to Bloodsworn or Copper hammer and you will be set.</div></div><hr />

If they proc at your level I suggest getting a couple of Troll remanufactured Yaks for aggro. They're 12 Damage 22 Delay or so and not a big step down in DPS. Copper Hammer etc. would be fine too. Just not weapons that don't proc an aggro producing effect.<br />

Finally, when you can afford it, better haste.<br />

So I guess my armor isn't bad for now, but I need to start looking at aggro weapons like the new ToD sword and hammer.  Anything else that I should consider?  I'm open to anything really, I haven't been a warrior for a very long time and have a lot to learn.  Any suggestions as to when I should start upgrading my armor, and what are some logical choices?  As I said, funds are a bit tight right now, but I can eventually raise enough capital to buy anything reasonable, and maybe even a couple things that aren't.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Other weapons to look at include the smithed Ykesha weapons, frosty, GSoT.  You will probably want to make that upgrade sometime in your early 50's.  You might also look at upgrading your haste about that time as well.</div></div><hr />
