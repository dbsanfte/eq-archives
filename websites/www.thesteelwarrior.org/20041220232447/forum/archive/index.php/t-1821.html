<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay -- so you knights have your magics.  You can do some neat utility things that warriors cannot and basically tank like us except when we go defensive....<br />
<br />
We have some innate Magic Resistance... and it isn't much at all...  Verant's original idea was that since we don't use magic, we are more resistant to it as mighty warriors.<br />
<br />
Starting at level 21, permanent Spellshield that removes (-100+Level*5) damage from nukes, nasty procs, etc. BUT NOT DoTs would give the warrior some extra utility tanking.  <br />
<br />
So at level 20, that Sarnak nukes you for 143?  Nope, 143-(-100+(20*5))=138.  Paltry at this point.  <br />
<br />
But at level 40, got nuked for 213?  Nope, 213-(-100+(40*5))=213-100=113.  <br />
<br />
Get double procced on by General Reparm in Plane of Fire at level 65?  If a wizard cast Spellshield on you, that first 3000 proc is reduced by 700 from the spellshield and the remaining 2300 is reduced 2300-(-100+65*5)=2300-325=1975 on the first hit, and now that you don't have the wizards Spellshield, you still have your own on the second making the 3000, 2650... so instead of getting hit 2300+3000=5300, you get hit for 1975+2650=4625 a nice tidy reduction on a nasty mob.  <br />
<br />
It isn't a ton of damage reduction at the high end, but it is a reduction and it makes some sense.  It isn't unbalacing at the high end, and it would help warriors in the 20-64 range much more viable for groups, especially where casting mobs are involved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or they could make +mana on items for warriors = spell shield.   Wouldn't that piss off the hybrids when we started going after &quot;their&quot; +mana gear the way they go after +AC/hp stuff now... ;)<br />
<br />
Probably not realistic code-wise, but still fun to think about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be a huge benefit in zones like sebilis where every second mob is a shaman/wizard/chanter.   Being able to shrug off some of that ice comet would be nice.  Sadly, melee type mobs get EVERY ability that warriors get, so this would just make fighting them that much harder.   A case could be made that they should do this to effectively weaken casters (who by SOE's own admission are overpowered relative to melees), then upgrade melee's accordingly to compensate for the difference, but it'll never happen 'cause the casters would just whine.</div></div><hr />
