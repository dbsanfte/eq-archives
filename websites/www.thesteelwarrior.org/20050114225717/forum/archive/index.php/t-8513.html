My 65 war has BoC + Anger2 aug and shield with Furious bash2. I think he should be MT in guild raids soon. Then in engaging raid boss, i need to use Riposte disc first or just Def disc?<br />
<br />
I used to solo with my war, to 63, with nice stuffs and my earnt AAs so far went to &quot;Solo&quot; behavior. Then i really don't know how to be MT, started to learn about being MT at 58 only and earnt few more AAs in Def AAs. Don't flame me plz.<br />
<br />
Thx for answers</div></div><hr />

Your post is a little vague, so it's tough to say what to do.<br />
<br />
First off, do you have the following AAs:<br />
- AETaunt<br />
- Combat Stability 3<br />
- Combat Agility 3<br />
- Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
- Innate Defense 5<br />
- Stalwart Endurance (depending on your race)<br />
- Natural Durability<br />
<br />
Usually, for MTs, those above AAs are considered the essential ones to have.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if a BoC + A2 + Furious Bash Shield is enough to generate and hold aggro. I seriously doubt so, unless the rest of the guild has pittance for dps / aggro. If you have Weapon Affinity 5 AA, maybe, but I still doubt so.<br />
<br />
Try using another aggro weapon with the BoC, then, when you feel you have enough aggro, switch to BoC + Shield then.<br />
<br />
As for Defensive / Furious, it also depends on the mob, and your AC / HP level. Certain combinations mean Defensive is enough, and you can save Furious for other 'oh sh!t' instances. Other combinations make it imperative to open up with Furious first, then Defensive / Stonewall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to the Library forum on this site and read through those posts...there's lots of great tanking info there.  On the Skills forum here I think there's also a stickied post on AA's - although that might be in the library now.  The only changes I'd make from what Tiej suggested is getting Physical Enhancement after CS/CA and getting ND earlier - although ND really depends on how you are on HP for the mobs you plan to tank.<br />
<br />
Another good info source is Alla's - go to the page for the individual mobs and see what strategy guides people have posted.<br />
<br />
As to which discipline to use - it depends (and the 2 places listed above are great starting points to find out what's best.)  In most cases I lead off with Furious, then either Defensive or Evasive depending on the mobs DI and procs.  However, in some cases I lead with Fearless or Rage (forget the name...the agro increaser ability.)  The bottom line is you need to adjust your tactics depending on the mob.<br />
<br />
Also, I think there are more details in the Library, but make sure you know how to MT using multiple approaches (cornering, slow circle, flipping, etc.)  Note:  this is as much of a learning experience for everyone else in the guild as it is for the MT.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and don't hesitate to communicate - especially concerning raid discipline.  (i.e.;  yell at someone if they are screwing up)  It's much better to yell and get the problem solved than it is to wipe and get frustrated.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!</div></div><hr />
