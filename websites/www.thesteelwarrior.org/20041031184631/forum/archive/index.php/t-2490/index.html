<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It really depends on what you think you are going to be fighting from level 50 to level 60 and how long you think you are going to be doing it.<br />
<br />
Level 60 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for resists than gear, in general.<br />
<br />
In addition, if you are going to be tanking, you lose a lot of AC and hps to equip MR, CR and FR gear. Mostly situational anyway by mob (one or two of the three at a time at max)<br />
<br />
Add to this fact that new Bard Songs and better resist spells from Druids, Chanters, Shamans, etc...can Up your resists to about as high as will do you good for pre-PoP mobs, and you really are better off just cruising with the Velious Armors and MAYBE acquiring a few good items that have both resist stuff and good stam hps etc...<br />
<br />
That all being said, if you DONT level fast and you DONT have high level resist buffers in guild and you DONT have a strong bard and you DO plan on living in HOT and you DO plan on being a DPS warrior instead of the MA or SA, then by all means pick up the biggest bang for the buck items for resists...<br />
<br />
Remember replace the least hp items slots with the biggest resist gear items (Ears, Bracers, Range...Usually at level 50something)<br />
<br />
and thats all I have to say about that.<br />
<br />
Jakle<br />
<br />
EDIT - btw I just looked at your armor. <br />
<br />
Your armor is very strong. You need better ears and hands and feet. Get a clattering Bone Necklace for your neck slot. Idol of the thorned will give you good hps in range slot. <br />
<br />
Chuck the lodi shield for a Cloak of Greater Pernicity. That being said, even with the gear you have, you will have tons of hps and AC for your levels as you go through 50. <br />
<br />
You can exp in POJ and POD and POI until you get to 58-60 then go PoV all the way until BoT or whatever.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt even bother with resists atm. Just focus on levelling. When you get to level 65, you will be able to loot camp one or two items that will allow you to buy a full set of resist gear in one sitting if you so desire...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is right on bud :)<br />
<br />
You can take that stuff all the way to 65, and I dont mean as a gimpy 65 either :) Get that range slot item or a bow :)<br />
<br />
Let me know what stuff you is fighting, and I can suggest where the right upgrades might be that are non-droppable.<br />
<br />
But FH + Bloodmetal Ears + CoGP = a hell of a good start amigo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">since we seem to share the same deity, have a look at my magelo for some ideas. Ignore the &quot;goal&quot; alternate profiles, but checking Main and Resist profiles. I MA for my guild.<br />

(bloodmetal earring is a bit overrated and pricy imho, you can find something almost as good for about half the price)<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit, plz disregard my hat, i know it needs upgrading. I'm basically holding out for an SS hat, same with BP. We're hitting HoT frequently so i hope to get them both soon*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stone of morid is damn nice on raids when I max my sta easily, gives me my best resists, my range slot being my lowest raw hp slot(35hp) so best sacrifice for me compared to having to dump 8sta 65hp rings and such for extra resists or other big slots.</div></div><hr />
