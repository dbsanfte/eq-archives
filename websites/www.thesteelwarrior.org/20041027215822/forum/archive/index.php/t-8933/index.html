<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garthud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question for you.... normal setup for DPS with decent agro, has been:<br />
<br />
Mainhand, GBOS  ...  14 / 18   , 179 dd, and have augmented 125 dd Yak proc<br />
Offhand,  Ichorflow ...  14 / 20 ,  24 a tick dot, augmented with just 50 dd proc.<br />
<br />
Got a new 2 hander last night, <br />
<br />
44  /  34, with 100 dd, proc.   Catch is, it's one of the new autunable weapons, so I can't really take it for a test drive and see how it parses.  It looks good to me, and I'd think I'd do very well with it, but since I mostly dual wield I don't have a good 2 hander benchmark to have personally tested it.<br />
<br />
Which do you think would be the better DPS?  I could augment the 2 hander if it's in the running to be better easy enough.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any thoughts,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 hander should be better dps than your 1 handers, how about posting some stats on it since it's new and all and where it dropped also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garthud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Am at work, atm, so doing this off the top of my head, remeber it was 44 dmg / 34 delay, and among other stats, 20 ac, 135 hps.  I could find my way back there, but we were just running about exploring invis, and decided to jump a couple named we saw.  I remember after leaving the starting zone, we went though a zone that was like a long canyon, and it was a zone on the other side, that kinda had a feel like the old Overthere zone.<br />
<br />
I know that most critters there ran fast enough to splatter our bard puller several times    :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and edit - remember it was recommened level 66</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you got enough 2H oriented aa's it sounds like a pretty good deal of a weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like Wall of Slaughter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a couple of weeks when they nerf the drop rate, it's got a really good chance of being the next windblade.</div></div><hr />
