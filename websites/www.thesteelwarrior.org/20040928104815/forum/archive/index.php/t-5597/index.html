<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cabiwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, you can have it too! Instead of having yourself bound to one place, why not make it easier for traveling or farming, to have TWO bind points?<br />
<br />
Here is the quest - It's for The Worker's Sledgemallet and starts in The Overthere.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=741<br />
<br />
<br />
Basicly, It's a 2HB hammer that procs a Gate: Overthere, and Lands you inside of the boat that is being built on the shoreline.<br />
<br />
<br />
Worst part about this quest is the factioning. You must be amiable to Venril Sathir. Kill every Sarnak in the Overthere. <br />
Lots. <br />
Turn in the Berserker War Braids (3 each time) for the the Guard of the Marine quest, to NPC Rottgrime.<br />
When you have sufficient faction, simply give a Jade to the Undead Foreman, south of the boat. It's his favorite. In return, He'll give you back the Sledgemallet. It procs starting at level 50.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can also use puppet strings to charm the npc, and then hand in the jade. Have him debuffed and you won't get resisted.</div></div><hr />

In other late breaking news; another potential warrior usable &quot;gate&quot; item, the Vial of Velium Vapors:<br />
<br />
Vial of Velium Vapors (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5329)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cabiwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sure the Velium Vapors are aight, but then you'd have to zone into GD, and get to the book.<br />
<br />
With the Worker's Sledgemallet, it puts you 20 seconds away from the POK book, and less than a minute away from POK.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, I'd rather pull out a burly, two-handed Hammer and take a few swings thus performing a 'tactical regroup' in style, then have to pull out some vial of whatever and fade away like some damn Wizard.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing you have to do actively to maintain your VS faction enough, is NOT kill ogres in Tim Deep around 30ish. That would make it quite a bit easier to grab your hammer.</div></div><hr />

There's only 1 skeleton that aggros if you're KoS.  You can kill that and run past the foreman and not aggro if you run between him and the other skeleton.  Run north from there and swing around the OT outpost.  There's one golem that paths there so if you have no form of invis, you can wait on pathing or just run west then south to the PoK book.  If you're brave or have the hp to absorb some hits, just run through the OT outpost.</div></div><hr />

Heh.  Either way you are bailing out, just because you use a more reliable and easier to get method isn't anything bad.  I'd prefer the be the guy hitting fort and gating than the guy who got his ass kicked hoping for a proc and is now in the process of a CR.  And for the times when there are no mobs / pc's around?  Guildie got stuck in a place with no exits, no mobs, and no one else could get to him.. hammer is worthless for a situation like that.  Personally I keep both the hammer and thurg gate.<br />
<br />
Thurg gate is also very good for hitting fort and being more sure of gate going off.  It's extremely cheap to make, and building up pottery is fast and easy and can be done in Thurg.  You do have to keep up coldain faction though.<br />
<br />
You don't need VS faction either.  As Raaj mentioned, puppet strings is an easy way.  I'm max kos to VS and haven't died running to PoK.  If you are real worried about being attacked, you can swim out into the water to go around the mobs.  I just run out through the open gate type area and go around the main building, sometimes get aggro sometimes don't, but if you run fast enough shouldn't be a problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I frequently get agro in the outpost when I use my OT hammer.  If a dragoon is too close he agroes and then the whole place assists him since the dragoons seem to have a huge assist radius.  It don't matter though since I have trained a dozen or more of them to the book and easily survived.  Just give a few warnings in shout and ooc so people know you are coming.  <br />
<br />
On a side note: one time I had a train and I gave like 4 warnings that I was training the book and there must have been 15 outpost guys, including both cliff golems and the general when I zoned.  Unfortunately I zoned into PoK just in time to see some naked green con wood elf guy click down before I could say anything to warn him.  I felt bad but its always a good idea to be invis before you go down there since a lot of people train the book.</div></div><hr />

nm fear drop, if im not misstaken.. i guess its time to go slay some iksar after all</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hammer + holgresh elder beads (clicky eye of zomm) = free gate to OT btw, w/o risking beating on a mob or /dueling someone else.  Might take a few tries, which is why charged items like stalking probes/sol b spider drop don't work so well.  Since HEB's are once again obtainable via the casino, even folks that weren't lucky/smart enough to camp em way back when have a chance to get em now.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Peorth12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think OT hammer &gt; Thurg Gate potion in everyway. <br />
<br />
Then main problem w/ the Thurg gate potion is making it.  I think its a pain in the ass pharming/buying the compos...then going to the pottery wheel to make them.  Considering how often one would gate if they can, the hammer is perfect.  <br />
<br />
I can see though, that the OT hammer is not for everyone.  If u are KoS to the outpost, its quite easy to get killed if not high enough level.  (I have one on my 51 warrior, and he got owned by dragoon madness once i gated in :p)<br />
<br />
Lastly, this quest is very hard to do if your faction was killed early on.  I've killed Venril Sather numerous times, and leveled in KC for quite a bit back in the day.  Plus im a wood elf &gt;&lt;;;  (this is all on my rogue main)<br />
<br />
So far i've cleared VP about 7 times, (positive VS faction per named) killed Faydedar about 5-8 times (also positive VS faction per kill), turned in well over 300 braids, and im still scowling in DE form and after using that alliance necklace...   <br />
<br />
I want to buy puppet strings badly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think OT hammer &gt; Thurg Gate potion in everyway.  <br />
<br />
Lets say you are alone somewhere.  Now, if you are somewhere where you get good exp with a group, then the mobs should be able to own you pretty well.  So unless you proc very fast, you're dead.  Even with WA5, I wouldn't trust my hammer to get me out when against a decent mob.  As for why you would be alone, could be LD and come back too late so people are gone, rest of the people could LD and not come back before respawn, etc.<br />
<br />
Or if you find a nice bug.  On my mage, I once fell under the world and actually landed on some invisable ground.  Luckily he had gate.  A guildie of mine once zoned into PoI, and for some reason was placed in a room with no exit immediately upon zoning in.  There were no mobs.<br />
<br />
It really is best to carry both.  Hammer can't always save you, but it's nice for when it can.  If you go with 1, I'd definately say the potion.  It can get you out of almost anything (can use fortitude to cast during a fight).  Getting the skill took half an hour or so, components took an hour in Crystal Caverns, but I got a ton of them to stock up.  Remaking it takes just one or two minutes, since you are dropped in Thurg anyway.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I was seeing things, but I thought I saw someone auctioning gate potions that will return you to your bind point. I also think the potions were all/all. Can anyone confirm that?<br />

10 Dose Gate Potion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=65120) ... also in other sizes.   Shaman alchemy, spendy combine iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use the hammer and buy gate potions.<br />
<br />
One thing to know about gate potions is that they are not quite as expensive as they seem.  The 10 dose potions go for say 3k, but if you only use 9 charges you can sell the potion with one dose left to a vendor for about half what you bought it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>macarser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Has anyone thought about questing the Powered Clockwork Talisman?  It has 15 charges on it but the quest seems hard though with the relatively cheap cost of  gate potions and other means.<br />

Or has anyone killed Escort the Gnome in Cazic-Thule for his Nexus Gate powered gloves?  Is it a hard encounter?<br />

<br />
The nexus gate gloves are pretty bad ass, I'm trying to convince some guildies to farm CT but, that's like pulling teeth. I'm guessing this can be done with one group of 65's average 100 AA's with no problem, guess i'll find out soon. <br />
<br />
I also noticed that these gloves are tradeable, has anyone ever seen them for sale? I'm guessing there probably some obscene price, around 1,000,000 PP if you could find em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">done the cogboggle ring about 100 times, and have yet to see it drop =\ one of those rings where you either get one amazing item, or one shitty item... ring of slime we farmed every spawn for a month straight, sometimes we'd get total junk like the robe/breastplate/pauldrons/bracer.... and sometimes we'd get the 100hp bracer, FT4 gaunts, 15/20 poker etc.  All depends on how hellbent you are on getting the item.</div></div><hr />
