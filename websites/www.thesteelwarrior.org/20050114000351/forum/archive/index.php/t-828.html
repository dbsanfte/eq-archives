<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - If I were you I would sell that resist ring and get a 65 hp one, get a new mask (anything really), get a new earring - anything really, dunno why you got that wis one.<br />
<br />
Weapons - Frosty and Snare Whip lasted me to 60, I dunno - todays twinks woulda flat out owned me. You got a lammy in your bag - use that and get a Frosty.<br />
<br />
Just go to the bazaar and do some searches on items with hp and ac - but without knowing your budget its tough mate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huggin</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">like Truelove said a frosty would be your best bet. It's very good aggro for the price.. could also get a Black Blade of Tormenting, very cheap, goes for like 200pp. Frosty / BBoT is a good / cheap combo and great for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huggin</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the BP, you might try a Barbed Ringmail, dunno what cash you got, but it costs roughly like 2k, depending on server. Next step after that would prolly be Velious armor or some cultural, dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm assuming from your current gear that your cash flow probably is not significant. If that is the case, you're at the level now where you can begin to build a four to five digit bank account. Get your guild together and raid Lower Guk. Go to Velks. Go to Karnor's Castle and camp Cappy. Get your Sebilis key and tag along with a few high level friends. Hell, borrow some money from a rich pal and get a blacksmithing store started. I don't know the rules for agnostics who blacksmith, but I'm sure you can get a lucritive business off the ground (and you can make some good gear for yourself, while you're at it). <br />
<br />
E-bay 10k from Yantis. Keep a keen eye out in the Bazaar, buy low, sell high. Send tells to high level players relentlessly to &quot;spare some cash plz or weapons u dont need thx.&quot; <br />
<br />
TAG ALONG ON AS MANY NAGAFEN/VOX RAIDS AS YOU CAN. DO IT FOR MONTHS. IF YOU DON'T WIN ANYTHING, DON'T GIVE UP. <br />
<br />
However you do it, here is what to do with your new-found fortune: <br />
<br />
1. Earrings - Get rid of both of the ones you have and get two of the player-made +30 (or is it +35?) HP earrings. I don't know the name of these earrings, but check the bazaar search engine under &quot;ear&quot; and find them. They should be only a few hundred plat. <br />
<br />
2. Ring - Bank the ring with the saves, and purchase another 6 AC 65 HP ring. THIS WILL HELP BIG TIME. <br />
<br />
3. Neck - Clattering Bone Necklace. If you have to go cheap, get a Glimmering Mithril Torque. <br />
<br />
4. Face - Death Mask of the Elysians. Cheap: Spider Eyes. <br />
<br />
5. Wrists - Wrists are pretty much ass for low-budget warriors since Cobalt Bracers sell for 10k+. Camp some silver chitin wristbands, or do the Bracer of Benevolence quest (twice) when you're high enough. <br />
<br />
6. Vambraces - Player-made, like your shoulders. Cheap: Cobalt. <br />
<br />
7. Gloves - Most people complain about SCHW on warriors, but I disagree in your case. You lose 15 AC having these as compared to Cobalt Gloves (25 AC), but if you get a haste belt at your budget, you'll lose even more AC replacing your good belt. Keep SCHW until you get a Seblisian Berserker's Cloak, Runebraided Girdle, or better. <br />
<br />
8. Shoulders - fine for your budget. <br />
<br />
9. Breastplate - get a Barbed Ringmail Tunic, or save up about 8k and buy a smithed BP, which will boost both your AC and HP immensely. <br />
<br />
10. Cape - fine for your budget. Maybe a Dire Wolf cloak if you have some spare pp. <br />
<br />
11. Belt - Fine. Some may argue for a spider fur belt, but I personally feel that the extra AC would benefit you more. <br />
<br />
12. Legs - You ought to be able to pick up some Blood Runed Greaves fairly cheap, which would up your AC TREMENDOUSLY (39 AC) and give you a 25 HP boost. After replacing your jewelry, I recommend that this should be the next slot you work on. <br />
<br />
13. Shoes - slip on those Cobalt Boots that you have bagged. The extra AC will benefit you much more than the +4 STA and other stats. <br />
<br />
14. Range - fine. <br />
<br />
15 Weapons - Use the Weighty Polearm all the time; even though it will result in a slight decrease in DPS, the AC, AGI, and HP are important. Sell your Wind Lance and (if your server is like mine) pick up a Sebilite Croaking Dirk (10/18 with stats) for under 2k. Buy the 30/40 warrior only 2hb and a Jade Mace 1hb to work your skill - these should be cheap, especially the 30/40 which goes for under 50pp sometimes. Please, do not make the same mistake I did. UP ALL OF YOUR WEAPON SKILLS. When money permits, think about buying a Frostbringer for taunt. You may take the above suggestions and get a Black Blade of Tormenting now. If worse comes to worse, get two Short Swords of the Ykesha. <br />
<br />
Finally, check back on these boards often and read other's adice posts. Many people don't answer these posts because the same questions have already been asked ... you need only look for them. Listen to people here; most (if not all) of them know what they are talking about, and can more than likely give you more qualified advice than I have offered. Though I may have more experience than you in this game, I've only leveled to 53 with my warrior, and I also have much to learn.<br />

Edit: Horible grammur and speling be here, thx EQ for robbing muh sleep :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some ideas for cheap and nasty upgrades (and gonna repeat some of whats already been said):~<br />
<br />
Ring- bag the resist ring for a 6/65hp ring<br />
Ear- Get an orc fang to replace the wis earing (or Vah-shir claw or Solstice if you can afford it)<br />
Face- Horned beetle mask / antlered mask<br />
Legs- a good cheap option here would be Crusty greaves. You'd benefit from the extra stamina on these, otherwise some more expensive options have been listed above.<br />
Boots- put the cobalt on.<br />
Arms- Cobalt vambs are pretty cheap now, Crystal chitin would be another upgrade option in the same price bracket.<br />
<br />
Weapons- Frostbringer is pretty much the best option for not too much plat these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grobb Hide Mask<br />
ac7 sta 2 hp 30 svm 10 .....<br />
<br />
I saw one at 300pp and one at 1500pp, figured it was a new LoY item, and quickly grabbedthe 300pp one.<br />
<br />
Check up the bazaar and u may be lucky ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The is the worst advice I have ever personally seen on this board, and if it's serious, in my opinion, it should be instant ban.<br />
<br />
Don't EVER do this.  Level 60's get harassed incessantly.  This is not the way to make your money, or make a reputation for that matter.<br />
<br />
Save your pennies, solo hill giants, get in seb groups and win rolls on gems, don't beg for your money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read this and thought is has to be sarcasm, but the entire post is serious and sarcasm does not come across well in text.<br />
<br />
To answer the original poster, do not ever ever do this, ever.</div></div><hr />
