I am new to the augmenting thing and I am looking for a comprehensive list of the different types of augments for say a slot1 type 7 piece of gear...or slot1 type 4&lt;weapon proc i know this from all the sh..tuff i have been reading tongiht&gt; I think I am onto it though...say i wanted to upgrade http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23220 with a stamina or hp aug...I know I have to save so many points from a certain adventure type...but I can't find anything on the type 7 augs..other than they were type 1..does this mean I have to use type 1 augs in type 7 slots? I am very easily cofused because my brain doesn't process information fast enough...the love of the halflings leaf has clearly slowed your mind:p HELP! and Thank you!</div></div><hr />
