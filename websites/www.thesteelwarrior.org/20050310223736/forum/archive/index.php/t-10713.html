<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I just got back from Iraq this week and had a question.  I've been gone for 13 months and I was wondering whether the current state of the game warrents coming back.  <br />
<br />
I invested a lot of time in my warrior and was pretty decent for my tier although not exceptional, equipment-wise (we broke into the elementals the week I left) but my guild poofed while I was gone.  Has there been a mass migration to WoW/EQ2?<br />
<br />
Also, how hard would it be to catch back up?  I had the Fennin Flag from someone boxing me while I was gone but that's it.  I just dont want to hav to beg for a ton of backflags.  I dont know if they made any changes to PoP since I left or not.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my magelo is listed so that will give you an idea of where I stand.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Prytty<br />
<br />
Sidenote:  Since I'm now unguilded...and if I come back, where's the best place considering my equipment and AA's to start upgrading on my own?  Zones for both equipment/aug upgrades as well as zones with the best exp would be appreciated unless they're one and the same.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right after a couple of raiding guilds folded.<br />
<br />
However now, every raiding guild that stuck it out,  has moved on progressionwise., things have been getting alot better.  To me EQ is still alive, thriving and fun, worth the time invested still.<br />
<br />
For flags, there was a recent addition of a way to get flags for PoP.  When you kill an elemental god (like FR), when you hail PP, it will give you the flag to the zone.  Same thing with time now (which can be 85/15'd into).  So if you join a guild that is capable with current flags to kill the big mobs, it can backflag its members this way.<br />
<br />
You are lucky, did some of the grind from 65-70 already.<br />
<br />
As for your sidenote.  In Oow you have the option of doing WoS, MPG then RSS (after you ding 69) for exp and equipment.  My general rule for GoD + expansions, is if you want to get upgrades, go to the hardest lvl that you can handle.  <br />
<br />
With DoN, there is a guildlobby where guilds that are recruiting can post what classes / lvls / AAs they require, good way to find what guilds are open for you .. chances are most raiding guilds are reqruiting since population is abit down.<br />
<br />
GL, welcome back from iraq and hope you have fun in EQ</div></div><hr />

OoW was an awesome expansion and you should be able to have some fun and get some gear while looking for your new guild.  From the earring in your magelo it appears you have already been to MPG hehe.   RCoD, WoS, and MPG are your exp zones, go check them out and grind out your levels, I'm sure you won't have any trouble getting back in the swing of things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
besides that; EQ is still a ton of fun. if anything; the other mmog's took a bunch of the &quot;l33t k1dz&quot; out of the mix and left it to the longer-term playerbase.</div></div><hr />
