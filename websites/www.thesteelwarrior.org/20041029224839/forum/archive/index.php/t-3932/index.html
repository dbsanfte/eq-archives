<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in a very close stage of acquiring a BoC, either from spending the DKP on raid or my own plat of 300k.<br />
<br />
I have given lots of thought into this and I just can't come up with a very firm decision. Please help!!<br />
<br />
My current weapon set up is Cord Hilted Spike Driver and Red epic. <br />
<br />
While I have no major problem in holding aggro in exp groups and raids, I do feel the shaky aggro from time to time. I am thinking to aug an Anger III proc to Cord Hilted Spike Driver and keep this dual wielding combo. <br />
<br />
At the same time, save up DKP for a BoW/BBB/BF/H8giver.<br />
<br />
If you were me, would you bother with a BoC given the cost associated with it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A BoC is nice but with everfrost anger3 augments available I would probably augment a better weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The good thing about buying a BoC is that it hasn't really depreciated in value too horribly since they started becoming available to the general public. Use it for a little while and when you get an upgrade, sell it. I wouldn't recommend spending DKP on something you can buy in the bazaar. Save that for a Norge'tal.<br />
<br />
Norge'tal + Anger 3 = luv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BoC owns.  I mean even with anger 3 augs its pretty much the best 1 handed agro weapon besides hategiver / Bloodfrenzy and plane of time stuff.  If you can get one, get it.  Plus is has some decent stats +15 stamina +100 hps<br />
<br />
As for saving up DKP points BF or hategiver instead, well I wouldn't recommend that they are both stupidly rare. I think my guild is 1/25 on bloodfrenzies and 0/30 on hategivers.  BBB is a nice weapon (I love mine) but it isnt in the same league as any of those one handers for agro, BBB is a dps weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A BoC is nice but with everfrost anger3 augments available I would probably augment a better weapon. Unless you mean a BF or HG (Doesn't seem like you will have access to Time weapons just yet), any &quot;better&quot; weapon is still not going to be as good as a BoC with an A3 augment. You might get a slighly better ratio, but EB+A3 = teh win.<br />
<br />
I mean even with anger 3 augs its pretty much the best 1 handed agro weapon besides hategiver / Bloodfrenzy and plane of time stuff. Yup. BF has a better proc rate and better stats, hands down a better weapon, but stupid rare. HG has maginally better stats - really on the 25ac - and is also stupid rare, but it doesn't even have the advantage of an increased proc rate.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't spend DKP in an HG, just get a BoC, you can always sell it or pass it down when you get an upgrade. The only reason to pass on a BoC is if you already have a BF+HG or better, which you do not.<br />
<br />
There are certain items in the game that are so good that they will never lose their value. Until someone finds a 17/19 EB proc 125hp 1h weapon that is tradeable, BoC will remain one of these timeless items that will always be worth a lot. There is a reaon that a weapon 3 expansions old is still going for 300k on most servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the wonderful reply. I think I have made up my mind that I wont spend my dkp on a BoC but if I see one for sale, I will buy it.<br />
<br />
Raid wise, as there are a number of better geared warriors in my guild, they will get to tank all the nasty boss mobs in raid anyway. So, there is not a strong demand for me to upgrade my aggro weapon to BoC which I regard it as the mid-end aggro weapon compared to BoW/BF. <br />
<br />
Exp grp wise, I don't have much problem in maintaining aggro with my current weapons anyway.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with what Wandor said.<br />
<br />
alot of people make BoC out to be a terrible weapon when it's not. I've used one for a long, long time and still use it. I've tanked just about everything up to elementals with it and never had a problem with holding aggro. <br />
<br />
It's easy to get and will last you a long time. Even if you spend DKP for a BF, having dual EB is really nice. You can also sell it or pass it down. Augment it with Anger3 and it's ownage. <br />
<br />
Sure there are better weapons out there, but i've been waiting for a BoW, BF or SEWS for a while and i'm still without one. I'm glad i have a BoC and you won't regret getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Raid wise, as there are a number of better geared warriors in my guild, they will get to tank all the nasty boss mobs in raid anyway. I am just curious since I have seen people post similar statements before ... if you don't plan to tank boss mobs, why play a warrior? Sure you might not be the first choice due to gear/HP considerations, but your job as a warrior is first and foremost to tank. What happens when a lag spike kills the MT and you are the only warrior left alive? IMO any warrior on any raid better be ready to step in and take the tanking duties, why else would they be there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shirmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">goodluck on getting the BoC i have been sitting shouting out payen 300k for alittle while now and all i have gotten was &quot;what is a BoC&quot; lol i know on CT you dont see em for sale alot but it has been frustrating. I have just moved to another guild due to the fact that my old guild only had 4-5 people on at any given time and my new guild has atleast 6 wars so me getting a shot at one would be a long time so i have decided to buy one just cant find one for sale lol. I hope your luck getting one is better than mine has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you don't plan to tank boss mobs, why play a warrior?  <br />
<br />
Tanking boss is just one of the many factors I play my warrior.<br />
<br />
I like Split tanking, Setting Rampage and Tank switching when the previous tank die.<br />
<br />
I find the art of tanking is not mere being the MT of the guild and in fact I find MTing doesnt take as much skills as other jobs such as setting rampage, second tanking or etc...<br />
<br />
Also, I like tanking in Exp group. There are many little things I like to do which make me stood out from the majority of the warrior population such as<br />
<br />
- Shielding<br />
- Move/Sit to spread out mezzed and unmezzed mobs<br />
- Single pull by using proximity aggro instead of shooting arrow <br />
- Knowing when to hit AE taunt<br />
<br />
All in all, I love playing warrior except the boring down time of LFG /bog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">after wandor saw me main tanking rape drakes in ToVN he should be happy i no longer do MT work; thus saving thousands of lives on Terris Thule server :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BoC is dropable, so it's hard to go wrong in obtaining one.  I personally would make it my goal to get a GSo4winds or obsidian greatblade instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, lets be serious here for a minute, not every warrior will tank boss mobs.  Hell, the majority of them will probably never even tank Vindi.  The raid warriors are simply the vocal minority, which makes them sound a little more prevalant than I think they actually are.<br />
<br />
For your average joe six pack, who maybe raids 1 nite a week and doesn't do anything any more hardcore than an adventure or some shit, the BoC is NOT worth the price tag, period.  It's already above and beyond the aggro that average non raid warriors will need, and you can get that fine with a SoD, or even a copper hammer these days.<br />
<br />
If you're in a raiding guild, and high on the tanking list, then yes, a BoC is a wonderful weapon and it's probably in your best interest to try to get a hold of one because it will enable you to progress faster and easier than without one.  If you're not, then don't waste the plat.  A sceptre of destruction pumps out more spell based DPS (which isn't an issue since non raid warriors don't typically fight MR mobs), controls aggro in a very similar way, and is half the price to boot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slagfest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wandor..i used BoC main with Chsd offhand and now own a H8giver for the past month..and i find the h8 procs more then BoC.<br />
<br />
Compo..buy the BoC if u can..if u are hittin RZtw then save your dkp for BoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Originally posted by Slagfest <br />
and i find the h8 procs more then BoC. There is an entire thread devoted to proc rates (thread here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3506)), particularly BoC proc rates. I would like to see a 4+ hour Katta banker parse showing a Hategiver procs more than a BoC. I would be willing to bet that they have near the same proc rate, just like everything else (with the notable exceptions like BF). Even an SoD has been parsed as having a similar proc rate while people swore up and down that their SoD proc'd like a Hauwitzer while their BoC proc'd 4 times an hour.<br />
<br />
Yet again, I find myself agreeing with Haass. While the quality of the BoC is unmistakeable, you do have to quantify the recommendation with one prerequisite - BoC is way over kill if you are not raiding Vindi+. There are other weapons that are more than up to the task of holding agro if you are a casual player who may never tank anything harder than an LDoN assassination boss.<br />
<br />
In this case, the original poster is obviously involved in a raid guild so for him at least, getting a BoC is solid advice.<br />
<br />
BTW Haass, on my server SoDs go for 300k, BoC 250k. For a non raiding casual warrior, it's hard to justify getting anything other than a CHoS+SotB for dual weilding and a GSoT for 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Why buy a BoC if your guild is capable of killing him, or of obtaining ssra hate weapons?<br />
<br />
Waste of money IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd like to see a proc rate parse of HG vs BoC aswell, though my money is on it having a proc rate closer to BF than to the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok here's a different angle:<br />
<br />
If you are going to get anger 3 then you are going to break the 1150 level of the mir tree...if so why not get the 15/20 club....add anger 3 and then mod it with a +3 to get a 18/20 anger 3?  You lose the double hate proc but you save 300k and can always reverse mod off the anger 3 later if you get a better hate weapon (make it 18/20 with a nice DD mod instead for dps).<br />
<br />
Just a thought...as others have said odds are if you buy a BoC for 300k it should hold its value overtime...just trying to give you some additional ideas to think off of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slagfest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Paying 250k for a BoC is good because u can turn around in a few months and sell it for the same price. Cant do that with almost any armor. You invest in a big upgrade that can get u your money back later.</div></div><hr />
