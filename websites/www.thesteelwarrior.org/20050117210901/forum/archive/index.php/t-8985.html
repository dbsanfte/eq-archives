<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keranaa</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard MANY answers on this topic, but would like to see if there is any definate info out there. If I have 2 1h weapons of the same ratio (i.e. 0.5), but different delays, which would be the better primary for dps purposes? Faster or slower delay? From my parses I've not been able to see much difference but any real information would be welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the ratios are the same, you want the faster one in primary. If one ratio is vastly better than the other, it should be in primary regardless of the speed. If one has an aggro proc and the other doesn't, or one is augged with an aggro proc and the other isn't, it should be in primary.<br />

Edit: Reasoning...<br />
<br />
Faster weapons will have the damage bonus applied more. You have more db in primary, so you want faster weapons there.<br />
<br />
Primary weapons proc more, so you want your aggro / dps procs in primary.<br />
<br />
Primary weapons swing more, so if you have a way better ratio weapon, you want the most swings you can get out of it, so you want it in primary. The line between faster and better ratio is hard to know, but I guess you could parse it out or something.</div></div><hr />
