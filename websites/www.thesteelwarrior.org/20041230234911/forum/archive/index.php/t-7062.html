<br />
Most people said no...procrate is a predetermined rate, yadda yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
I said that it is possible, depending on exactly what formula is used for procrate (if its based simply on modified delay or not), and how ambidex affects dual wield (innate bonus?  Applied just at check time?).<br />
<br />
<br />
Without going into the formulaic semantics, I'm wondering --<br />
<br />
Can anybody show me conclusive evidence in one way or the other?<br />
<br />
Anybody out there who hasnt bought Ambidexterity able to run a parse, and then buy ambidex and run the same parse, and compare results?<br />
<br />
Inquiring minds (mine, mainly) wanna know!</div></div><hr />

I disagree .. if that was the case, haste would increase proc rates.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, Plumppoopsie.<br />
<br />
So...we know that being hasted/slowed will not change your procrate..so the formula has something to do with your modified delay.<br />
<br />
The analogy I used to argue my point is:<br />
<br />
Imagine having a Blade of Carnage in your main hand and nothing in your offhand.  Turn on autoattack for 2 minutes.  How much should you proc?  We all know that you'll proc an average of 4 times (assuming full dex, no AAs).<br />
<br />
Now, imagine a scenario where you turn on auto attack, swing for two rounds, then take off the sword and swing with your fist for 2 rounds, then put the sword back on for 2 rounds, take it off again, etc etc.  Do this for 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Will you proc 4 times?  I'm pretty certain you won't...it should be something like 2 procs a minute, because your really only swinging the sword a for 1 of the 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Now, change the number so that it's sword for 2 rounds, fist for 1 round, sword for 2 rounds...now you should proc 2.667 times.<br />
<br />
Isn't this how dual wield works?  If you fail your dual wield check, you dont swing.  If you don't swing, you may as well not have any type of proc weapon in your offhand.  When you get ambidexterity, you increase your chance to succeed your dual wield check -- but does the weapon proc function take ambidexterity into account while trying to maintain it's &quot;per minute procs&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste merely decreases the time between rounds of attacks, making you swing faster overall.  This doesn't increase proc rate as you're still swinging the same number of times per round, it's just the rounds take less time to cycle.<br />
<br />
Ambidexterity actually increases the chance you'll swing that offhand each time the delay recycles independant of haste, it makes your attacks per round higher.  This does increase proc rate, as overall you are swinging more often per round, not just more cycles within a certain amount of time (i.e., faster).  Punishing Blade does the same, not sure with Flurry, but possibly the same.<br />
<br />
Small difference, but it seems the proc rate is altered by the time between rounds, not how many swings you're doing per round (as there's no delay between the different attacks in the same round for each hand, they happen immediately).  Haste lowers this delay, so it therefor lowers the proc chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, I have a questiont then ...<br />
<br />
does: <br />
<br />
Ferocity<br />
Punishing Blade<br />
Flurry / Raging Flurry<br />
Tactical Mastery<br />
<br />
Increase proc rate then? they all give chance for an extra attack in a combat round.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not exactly true about Ambi being the only one to increase proc rate.<br />
  <br />
Ambidexterity will give the largest increase due to it causing the DW check to succeed more and therefor causing more rounds in combat from the offhand, but considering the others give more attacks per round, it can increase your proc rate by a small amount (by giving another chance to proc where it wouldn't have otherwise).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as we can tell, your chance to proc is checked each weapon round (which may be a single, double, triple, or quadruple attack), and is independant of the number of attacks performed per round.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand.  How does haste not give you more attack rounds.  Surely if I am swinging a 40 delay weapon with no haste I have an attack round every 4 seconds, or 15 attack rounds every minute.  With 100% haste and the same weapon I would have an attack round every 2 seconds / 30 attack rounds per minute.  While I would not be swinging more times per round, I would have more rounds per minute.<br />
<br />
We all know that haste doesnt effect proc rate - this has been proven.  So with this being true I think it needs to be accepted that flurry, ambidex, ferocity etc, none of these effect proc rate, until someone provides a parse to prove otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah... I noticed this guy (http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1083649076) doesnt have Ambidexterity if you would consider picking up an account to test with ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand. How does haste not give you more attack rounds.<br />
Well, it's fine that you don't understand, because the post you were responding to is explaining it incorrectly :)<br />
<br />
What appears to happen is this: For primary hand, every time the weapon's delay timer is up, a proc check is made. If the weapon proc passes the check, the weapon procs, if not, then the aug proc check is made (assuming you have a proc aug), if that fails, then the innate proc check is made( also assuming you have one). You can only have one proc per round (round being defined as the set up swings that occurs when a weapon's delay time expires), and the precedence is weapon, then aug, then innate, as mentioned above. The number of swings that occurs in the round is irrelevant, you have the same chance to proc on a quadruple round as on a single swing. The check is per round, not per swing.<br />
<br />
For the off hand, it is the same as above, except that first a DW check has to be made before the round occurs. Having Ambi increases the chance of making the DW check, hence increasing the number of &quot;rounds&quot; with the off hand, without decreasing the effective delay of the weapon. That is the key.You have a base chance to proc, dependant upon your dex. This is scaled to your effective weapon delay, so that regardless of your haste, your number of procs/min remains the same over time. Ambi increases the number of rounds without decreasing the effective delay, which means that you get additional chances to proc. Fero and PB only add swings to the round, but do not actually increase the number of rounds, and so doesn't affect proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you cannot proc more than once per round, that is news to me. Going way back to the old days, when Ykesha was the only proc anyone saw, it used to be gold to see the rare double-proc... or we thought it was a double-proc, anyway.<br />
 <br />
Can you proc on ripostes? I know that you cannot proc on furious-disc-ripostes.<br />
 <br />
Seems like it might be time for some parsing of my own...<br />
 <br />
Edit - Eoden, the sad thing is that I know the guy who is selling that warrior, and was his guildmate way back when, before he moved servers.  One of the nicest fellows you'll ever meet.  Definitely a sign of the state of the game that he is leaving for good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A round is defined by your primary hand OR your secondary hand.  If you have two weapons with the same delay, and you quad, you can proc twice in a delay cycle, because its actually two rounds (your primary hand and your secondary hand) acting independant of one another.<br />
<br />
That's how you got a double-proc ykesha -- a proc from your main hand, and a proc from your offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I've always heard it explained, and what seems to have worked for me, is this:<br />
<br />
Anything that increases your number of swings in a given amount of time, without changing your delay, will increase your proc rate. If you're using a BoC offhand, with no haste lets say, your delay is 20. This is your delay regardless of whether dualwield fires or not; your BoC has a 3.33% chance to proc on any given swing. (Once per minute proc rate offhand / 20 delay = 1/30= 3.33%) What ambidexterity does is make dual wield fire more often, thereby increasing your total number of offhand swings in any given time while maintaing the SAME delay. So ambidex increases procrate.<br />
<br />
Stuff like PB, flurry, etc etc should also increase your procrate, but very very slightly. You have a small percentage chance to proc on any given swing, and pb/flurry/etc only give you a few percent more swings per minute. These numbers are wrong, but let's say your primary weapon procs on 5% of your swings (30 delay weap, no haste) and your flurry AA gives you 10% more swings in a minute... your proc rate will only increase .05 X .1 = 00.5% more procs per minute. This increase is pretty small, small enough that with EQs RNG, it's pretty much insignificant.<br />
<br />
Any of you others who disagree, feel free to show me where/how i'm wrong, I promise you won't hurt my feelings.</div></div><hr />

Wish I still had a comp that could run EQ...Avatar makes the supposedly impossible look easy :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gimmel's link doesn't provide conclusive evidence one way or the other.  To prove number-of-procs-per-round we need a log with weapons of effective delay 20 or higher, so that timestamp uncertainty is eliminated.  I am thinking that a slow unhasted unaugmented 2 hander would be the ideal test, as that would give the highest chance of multiple identical procs per round (if they can happen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my memories of my lowbie ranger alt, I'm not so certain you have to succeed your duel wield check to succeed a proc check. I distinctly remember seeing my cheapy torch thing from the hole proc burn several times, without associated crush messages. Either way, this should be pretty easy to verify, take a char that's just learned dualwield, put a proccer in his offhand, and a non proccing weapon of a different skill in the other hand, put him up against a katta banker, and comb the log.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you need an earthshaker, Sassinak.</div></div><hr />
