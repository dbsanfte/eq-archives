<br />
Forced swing is a attack that works even if stunned, and is on the same timer as Wild swing. Has anyone compared the damage between the 2? I might do it tomorrow, but just wondering if anyone has done any testing on these 2 already. <br />
<br />
Also, those of you who have soldier's stance as well, do you use it alot? I mean, it's a small version of defensive that can be kept on at all times. Seems really nice for big stuff, but do you use it all the time during exp?<br />
<br />
I have yet to try using soldier's stance too, will test it out some tomorrow perhaps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know soldiers stance (only level 13 Fighter) but found that &quot;hunker down&quot; works really well (massively raises defensive ability while slowing you down).  Also shield bashing is *really* effective in this game.<br />
<br />
We did the first guild raid thnigie last night and was able to off tank 2 level 19 mobs pretty easily with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how useful is shield bashing?  i have heard this from someone else too, but they didnt say how much better it is as opposed to dual wielding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curdlex</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They &quot;nerfed&quot; dual wield since you can only use weapons that are duel wield to begin with.  So far all the weapons I have seen seem to do significantly less damage then regular 1 hand weapons.  I have level I shield Bash and it stuns for a second or two.  Not sure if it will be longer as you get more ranks in the skill as well as more levels.<br />
<br />
Not sure how agro works in the game since Knights and even monks get single and area taunt as fighters.  Unless Dual wield weapons have aggro type procs and augmental slots like EQ1 I would guess that it would be better to have 1hs and a shield for damage mitigation.  Again this is all speculation just using EQ1 as a modeland assuming that 1. Aggro will be easier to control and 2. Damage mitigation will be more of an adavatage at higher levels with Valor Armor.<br />
<br />
Of course this all speculation on what the end game will be like.  Right now most people can wear Medium Armor so damage mitigation is not as pronounced.  Hopefully EQ II will maintain the role of Warriors as the primary tank with crusader (knights) acting as adequate back ups in most situation.</div></div><hr />
