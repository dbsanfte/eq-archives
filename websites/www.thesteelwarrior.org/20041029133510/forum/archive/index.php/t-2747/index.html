<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all excuse me for barging into your sanctuary.<br />
But there is something I am very curious about,one of the reasons being that the guild I've been in for over 2 years disbanded mostly because of the new sizes in raidforce in POP.<br />
Now that most of you are probably raiding with large forces,how do you like it and what do you think the &quot;ideal&quot; raidorce should be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ideal raidforce in PoP is 72 players.  Problem is, its tough to have exactly 72 on, and operating with less can be tough on some encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ideal raidforce for PoP is 72 players, as stated above.  <br />
<br />
This causes a lot of problems with having to recruit constantly to get 72 players online every day.  Then you run into the problem of having all of your raids full, so people who don't log in early (EST) are stuck sitting around waiting for room in a raid (more of a problem in Time than anywhere else).  This also causes the problem that you have full raids all the time, but to keep raids full you need to constantly recruit, but to recruit you usually have to have apps raid with you, but that's hard when all your raids are full.  You can't really tell guild members to leave raids so that apps can come.  That's just a small sampling of the problems caused by 72 being the 'Ideal' raidforce via 'The Vision' and SoE.<br />

Ideal raidforce for what I would like to see in EQ, is ~36...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd rather have 65 or so than 72...But the problem is it seems to either be that only 48 login or 80 login.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the number of dual boxes around or normal way of handling more then 72 is to camp them out till there's enough slots to go around.  Since entering raid specific content zones we have never had a situation where more then 72 mains were around.  It sucks camping out a good alt cleric for a not so good main cleric but it happens :)</div></div><hr />

Sooo true. some days we have 40 on at 6pm then later we fill to 72 by like 8. Other times we have 60 on before 6pm and once (second rz ) we had over 100 ( although 10-15 were boxed) The problem is having everyone in a guild be a hardcore raider. Many a guild has fallen because they remove a not so hard raider that is well liked. This is more a problem for guilds that arnt say top 3 on there server. Top 3 guilds on every server basicly have a hardcore raidforce. sporatic play times are reallly annoying in ele were things take a while and are highly contested ( mind you vt on RN is basicly controlled by us and another guild, although more are coming in. so crowding in vt isnt something ive seen). <br />

 Basicly the whole limiting a raid although good in thoery forces you to have the most hardcore raidforce so you can have as close to 72 constantly and as early as possible ( rz event)</div></div><hr />
