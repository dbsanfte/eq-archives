<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was really wondering this question a while ago after Tacvi got partially revamped a bit, but I wanted to wait until a few guilds got their feet wet with the 3 loots, 5-day respawn kinda thing.  I've taken a look at a lot of the loot in there and some of it looks to be really nice.  The real question is though, is Tacvi worth all the effort getting there and farming it out?  My guild is currently at the MPG trial stage having Corruption and Foresight finished out already.  I guess you could call that a &quot;tier&quot;, but some trials are easier than others, so I dunno.  We defeated King Gelaqua (Watergel, wtf?) and Queen Pyrilonis quite easily and have basically gone on an OoW rampage farming out Feratha, Chailak, Volklana, Rhorious, Hulcror, King/Queen, etc whenever we can find them up.  As far as GoD progression goes though, we haven't even gotten to Noqufiel yet.  It's not that we couldn't probably do it, but we've only stepped foot into Inktu`ta a total of two times since defeating Barxt.  <br />
<br />
I guess the real question is this:  The goal, obviously, is Anguish, but would it be a strategically sound idea to open up Tacvi (and Txevu) as another source of loot?  Or should we just stick to the guns with what we're killing already and set a straight sail to Anguish?<br />
<br />
Any and all opinions are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

That said stuff in Tacvi aren't exactly pushovers even with an expansion of gear/level.</div></div><hr />

Yes Eri.. Tacvi is worth it. Plus, Just saying your there. Plus, Txevu is a fun zone(cept for trash clearing, umg boring)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, do tacvi, 1 night, 7 named, 3 loots of 265-285hp/mana per named.  yeah it's worth it.<br />
<br />
everyone loves the PoP comparisons, so i'll try to make it out like that.  Tacvi = Tier 1-4 of potime, Anguish = 5 - quarm.  slap em together over a 2 night clear, and your guild gets juiced up like giambi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">R27</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the tacvi loot might not be the absolute best anymore, but some of them like the bracers are. And most of the other stuff is pretty decent too. Once you've learned the encounters, you can clear the zone pretty fast. Full clearing -tunat in one day isnt all that hard, and will yield 21 quality items.</div></div><hr />

You'll be glad to have another place to go with great loot.</div></div><hr />

If you've got it down, its hella worth it, if you're wiping to xxeric, come back later.</div></div><hr />
