<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its a tad bit of aggro, procs often tho from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not great agro, but decent enough. Will be behind the +agro and dd/stun weapons. Ahead of Frostbringer etc stuff though. Resident runt guildmate(though he's 65 now, maybe can't call him that anymore) uses Scimmy + Whip of Unending Pain(Torment, basically Tunare whipe +1 dmg) and when grouped with me on my rogue he has absolutely zero agro problems. When I box shaman for slows/dots he generally doesn't have much trouble either. With your mainhand it should work perfectly until you get an EB weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
got kinda old having to ask fellow guildies on the raids &quot;hey can i borrow your BoC for the next 4 hours?&quot;<br />
<br />
and i had a bonechiller (non aggro weapon) in offhand, which didn't help much.<br />
<br />
100hp 15/19 is a good offhander tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was wondering how's the DPS for the OSoW?<br />
Honestly speaking, I would like to someday get it for a good offhand weapon, if it's good in the first place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want dps go 2h. Great Staff of 4 Winds would do more damage easily then vz scimmy and pretty much anything else you can obtain at that level to pair with it. Pretty easy to get as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not good enough for main hand - having said that I pulled aggro off a 65 warrior (i was 63)whilst mainhanding it in a DPS set up. He had an EB proc, within 5 seconds or so I got a double proc and the mob flipped to me, there have been a couple of occasions where I flipped a mob off an MA with this scimitar.<br />
<br />
Underrated imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">underrated? no. I can safely say that after several months using it and a bonechiller in VT/PoP.<br />
<br />
I had better aggro tanking bosses in VT with a TSBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm offhanding it with a BBotE mainhanded. The proc is plenty enough to get and keep aggro if you're pingponging with a monk or something, but unless it procs a few times it's nothing special. Even offhand, though, it procs quite a bit. It's not EB, but it's a step up from midrange aggro weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i see it pull agro all the time, just a matter of whether it or i proc first though.<br />
<br />
dunno why you dont like the looks, think it has one of the best graphics in game, would gladly take it over the warped looking bow.</div></div><hr />

Err.... i misread this :) Thought you asked for how the aggro is.</div></div><hr />
