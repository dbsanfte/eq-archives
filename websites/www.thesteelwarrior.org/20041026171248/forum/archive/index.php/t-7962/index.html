<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone point me to a nice walkthrough of Agnarr event?<br />
I have done it a few times but all the drugs i did in high school are coming back to haunt me now and i can't remember all the details.  I can't remember crap like which floors have portals that need to be bombed, which floors have two named that need offtanking, which floors have one etc.  I am lookin to lead the event and I like to be well prepared.  Its a little harder than just tankin it and having the raid leader tell you to get on named_01 when you hit Z/I.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All three floors have portals that need to be bombed.<br />
<br />
The first two floors each have 1 named mob.<br />
<br />
The third floor (Agnarr's floor) has 1 &quot;tower boss&quot; plus Agnarr at the start.<br />
<br />
It works well to have an SK kite Agnarr while the rest of the room is cleared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We always had Rangers kite Agnarr upstairs but whatever works.  Also remember on Agnarrs floor the portal in the back can't be destroyed because every 25% of his life a mini boss pops from there so have a tank ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First level, you have one boss, 2 adds w/ him, and 3 more guarding the portals, when you zone up u'll aggro the guard behind u, and named + his 2 adds.  The two on the left and right don't move.<br />
<br />
Second level, I believe theres 3 swirling rocks + boss, keep boss away from raid clear adds, then range him.  Make sure you get someone to keep RGC on main tank.<br />
<br />
Third when you zone up, you have Agnarr + water elemental + earth giant.  Get a high MR kiter with a brain to kite agnarr, kill the two names, then kill agnarr.<br />
<br />
All the portals can be malo'd tash'd then destoryed minus the single one in angarr's room.<br />
<br />
Hardest parts in the raid is floor 2, and the initial port up to agnarr's room, rest is cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure everyone is ready and knows how to port up to agnarrs floor.Going up piecemeal is the suck.I normally tank Agnarr while another ma grabs the earth giant and kills stuff with the dps.Dangerous part was splitting them i usually had both aggroin me a sec.We used to tank Agnarr by the bottem of the stairs before the wall bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The few times i've done it, best warrior tanks him throughout, while most of the healers keep him alive.<br />
<br />
The rest of the raid take out the portals and giants. In between giant spawns, raid uses range attacks (Agnarr's  AE's are fun, dont ya know, lol).<br />
<br />
When giants are all done, and Agnarr is low enough for relative raid safety (&lt;10% health usually) then move in for melee and beat him down.<br />
<br />
TH3 WIN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">tank him on the corner (or have your main tank) and have casters behind the wall to heal him so they dont get hit by his ae manatap. <br />
<br />
Treat the fight like you do Saryrn/Terris Thule - on agnaar til first named, then off agnaar, then on agnaar til 2nd named, then off agnaar. etc.. theres 4 named total. a few unmezzable adds come outta the portals. Really an easy fight if your guildies can cooperate well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Frog mentions the safest strat and it's probably the one to stick with (although I note that the first mini is popped already).  Kite Agnaar until first mini is dead, then on agnaar to 75, off and kill mini, blah blah.  We would stick him by the stairs to the side, with the casters in general hiding on the stairs in healing range.  Frankly, the phase before him was always more trouble than he ever was.  It's still cake but make sure the tank holds Emer facing away from the raid or things can get ugly in a hurry.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and it's a good encounter to make sure your wizzies aren't perma-afk.  Disintegrating the portals right off the bat speed things up well and frankly if they are awake there should never be any real adds pouring though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if your wizzies go afk without saying anything in this encounter they need to be docked dkp or removed~ Unless they have a good excuse like; My cat ate my dog, my dog ate my fish, my fish ate my homework and I had to afk to bring them to the vet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">casters behind the wall to heal him so they dont get hit by his ae manatap.  <br />
<br />
Actually, the wall doesnt block the AE at all. Its purely range based. Keep your healers out of range of the AE and max their MR to resist the other AE and they will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found the spinstun very hard to resist with 200+MR and no bard song. The other AE (mana tap? I dunno since I don't have mana :P) I resisted everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For this raid you need both a designated MT and a designated MA (not the same person).<br />
<br />
Upon clicking up into each room, the MT, named debuffers, and his respective clerics need to get on the named mob.  Everyone else follows the MA around in a preset direction destroying the portals.  Wizzies can disentigrate them, so be sure to bring the proper reagents.  After all portals are gone cycle through the now mezzed adds and kill them.  Once the floor is clear assist the MT on the named.<br />
<br />
The named on the second floor is a ranged dps fight only as he has some nasty little effects including a huge slow and some serious dmg nukes.<br />
<br />
When you get to agnarrs floor have a chanter quickly tash Agnarr .. shaman malo ... mage mala .. and have every ranger chain snare him till you land a snare.  Once he is snared a designate ranger will aggro kite him whereever you want him kited.  Same old same old on the room strat .. mez adds and cycle through the portals (all but one which you cant kill) and then kill the named.  Once you've cleared the room you have all day to set up for the agnarr kill.<br />
<br />
Most gulids kill agnarr upstairs in a corner because it is far from the named giant pops and cornering helps with the area effect mana drains etc.  Posistion healers and nukers at max range .. pull agnarr and heal your tank.  Heal the melee's in the ae now and then with an ae heal and you've toasted Agnarr.<br />
<br />
Now, there are 3 named spawns through the agnarr fight and 2 ways to deal with them.  You can either all assist and kill them when they pop, or you can kite them and burn down agnarr.  We usually use the latter strat, as it makes for a quicker, less confusing script.  We have a bard and 4 rangers downstairs all in the same group with a druid to patch heal as needed.  The bard keeps runspeed up on the rangers while they each kite 1 named each via snare aggro.  The extra ranger is backup in case one of them dies.  After agnarr is dead the rangers bring their giants up one by one and the raid consumes them.<br />
<br />
It's an easy event if you follow the order correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The hardest parts are pound into your shamans/druids that on the second floor you need RGC. Stonethunder is root and slow.  On the 3rd level remember you got a named giant, agnarr, the normals spawnsl, plus a hurricane to deal with. The hurricane is just about as bad ass as the named giants. Need to have a good tank and healer delegated to handle it aswell. Too many times the healer for hurricane goes into it thinking it is a normal mob.</div></div><hr />
