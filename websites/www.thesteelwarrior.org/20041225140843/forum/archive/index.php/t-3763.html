I initally thought the second, but someone brought up the point that hate is determined by hatebonus+ aggro, and that wizards who are 200 away froma mob ahve higher aggro but less hate, but since taunt is based off aggro, you might increase overall hate by pushing it even when the mob is turned on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt will only put you at the top of the list + 1 hate so um... there's no point in taunting when you have aggro, that 1 point isn't going to suddenly lock aggro for you.<br />
<br />
The only reason you should mash taunt button is when you solo or durring PvP because everybody knows taunt ups the warrior's dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, and hitting disarm will up your AC. :p <br />
<br />
But seriously, only use taunt when you lose aggro. Mashing the button will only mean that you will have to wait to taunt when you really may need it. <br />
<br />
So to sum up, taunt when you have aggro does nothing.<br />
<br />
Now the one time I do recommend mashing it is when you are at the beginning of a level and are trying to skill up on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also a good time for mashing it is when the mob is stunned a lot, or it casts a lot.<br />
You wont see for quite a few seconds wether you aggroed him or not... so might as well make sure :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if taunt is Top of list +1hate... then i have a question....<br />
<br />
senario: <br />
you hit taunt, it works, yer at top +1<br />
you proc EB +700 so yer somewhere around Top +701<br />
then you hit taunt again, it works...<br />
<br />
after then 2nd taunt are you brought DOWN  to Top +1 from Top +701?<br />
<br />
this would make taunt smashing actully hurt yer agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can tell, no, taunt will not worsen your position on the hate list.<br />
<br />
As a young warrior you never get taunt skillups when you are at the top of the hate list.  You only get taunt skillups when you are below the top spot.  (i.e. a young warrior who always solos will have a terrible taunt skill, no matter how much he mashes it.)<br />
<br />
I interpret this to mean that taunt does nothing at all if you are already at the top of the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys didnt address his question.<br />
<br />
Wizard is 200 feet away and has delivered some crushing blows.<br />
Has 400 hate.<br />
<br />
You have delivered some pain.<br />
You have 300 hate, plus 100 proximity agro.<br />
<br />
Will hitting taunt give you more hate, because someone else might be higher on the list, but not have current agro, due to distance.<br />
<br />
My own question.<br />
Pets, The AI now says that if the pet is at the top of the list, but a PC is nearer to the mob, then the mob will attack the PC.  So 2 pets might be at the top of the hate list, and you might be number 3 on the hate list, but still have agro.  Would hitting taunt in this situation give you hate, that you didnt have before you hit the taunt key?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Distance, sitting etc... is all directly calculated into the &quot;aggro&quot;.<br />
<br />
So even if you're very very far away, or standing or whatever... as long as the mob isn't targetting you, you're not on top of the aggro table.<br />
<br />
There seems to be only 2 exceptions,<br />
Blood aggro, and Divine Aura.<br />
<br />
But both don't help Mashing Taunt at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure about that Bunnie?  I seem to remember that at one time one of the many theories about taunt was that there are 2 hate lists, one being the actual hate list, and the other being a functional model of the other modified for things like proximity, sitting etc.  For example, the wizard in question could be at the top of the actual hate list, but not get aggro because his distance doesnt get him to the top of the modified hate list.  If that was the case, a successful taunt would put you at the top of the actual hate list, above the wizard, thereby adding to your overall hate.  Assuming that taunt works on the actual and not the modified list.  I haven't really looked at the taunt test sticky lately, has this theory been completely scrapped?  If so, that brings us back to &quot;mashing taunt when you already have aggro is pointless&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And for pets, it was SPECIFICALLY changed so that if any PC is in range of a mob when a pet has agro, the mob will change to the the PC in question that is close.  (which is why pets dont tank, even charmed ones with 300 dps).<br />
<br />
I dont think that the pet magically gets its hate lessened when a PC is in range.  Its just the the mob ignores the pet if the PC is closer.  Thus Warrior = 200 hate.  Pet = 500 hate.  Warrior still has agro because he is proximate.<br />
The question is, does taunting give you the extra hate, or just to the top of the PC hate list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only mash the taunt button repeatedly when Im taunting at mezzed mob that Im about to wake up.  ;) <br />
<br />
As far as hitting taunt after a wiz nukes the mob so that you can get on top of someone else in the list...Um sure, but I really dont see the point.  If you are in a big group I doubt you will be on top of all the messages flying around.<br />
<br />
Only hit it when you loose it.  Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That isn't actually true.  I have soloed with a twink warrior up to level 38 and his taunt was maxed many times getting multiple taunt skill ups per fight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HebbinSZ</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for your input.  The pet thing is really interesting, could put a new use to charmed pets on raids.</div></div><hr />
