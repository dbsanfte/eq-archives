<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FV was overrun by darkies and cliff golems last night on Innoruuk. There was a named in DL and a new named in FV (both red). The DL one was a Dracholiche and the one in FV was a named Cliffgolem.<br />
<br />
DL named had silence, and I tried him twice with about two groups and lost.<br />
DIdnt have a chance to try the FV named as it was around 1 AM and no one I knew was online, so I did the next best thing, I trained him to all the guards that were remaining in the zone but he killed them all and was still at 37%. Hit 2k and rampged.<br />
<br />
My question is this - Has anyone killed these mobs? And if so, what kind of  quality is the loot that they hold? I am guessing its pretty good because a 1 groupable named horseman dropped a 155hp leather tunic, 150 hp legs, and 145 hp bracer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharagor</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild Sojourners and a bunch of friends were at this event last night on Brell. We killed both of the Dark Horsemen and the Hatefilled Dracoliche. The Horsemen dropped some decent gear. The dracoliche dropped 4 items, two of which were artifacts. It was one of best events I have been a part of. The two artifacts were a 2h sword with a Sword of Truth graphic and the other was a range item with a graphic I had never seen before. Pretty cool stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittme</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This dropped from a trash mob in the event. Night-Forged Stiletto (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71726) <br />
I was curious if I would loose aggrogeneration compared to a CHoS if I use it in offhand,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This proc is pretty similar to frostbite.  Should be decent aggro but probably less than force shock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yagru</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Missed most of this stuff coz it was mainly done at our night time... Found my trader flooded wiht systemwide msg's in the morning :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, this was on test a couple weeks ago.  I missed it, but a few guildmates were *very* happy with the loot that they scored.  The breastplates especially were huge upgrades to people without Time BPs or similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:( I missed the named encounters, but managed to score a 45hp aug while the fight was still in DL. Man I truly wish I could have fought the named mobs, winning the loot is secondary, but being part of an event is a reward in itself.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Does anyone else think it odd that the HP aug has NO distiller listed to remove it? I stuffed in my Raex gloves since I know that piece of gear ain't moving anywhere soon and there's no LDON augs that can fit in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's even weirder is the 45 mana/end aug that dropped from similar Good side nameds is not even flagged as an Aug.  Its currently a 45 mana/end item that you can place on your character like armor.  :confused:   I've feedbacked it and hoping for a change.  I didn't even notice the 45 hp aug had no distiller  :(  I put it in my Terror Chain Ring because I didn't feel like doing a lot of aug swapping and that piece had room.  :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a great event. However, there were many zone bugs that fucked it. On solusek, the Dragon was stuck under DLs, and despawned eventually. The Golem seemingly never spawned, never could get a confirmation if someone killed him in the 2 hours I was absent at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caelidar</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a sweet back slot but....<br />

Recommended level of 60.<br />
Required level of 70.</div></div><hr />

Dmg/delay was roughly equivalent to the 2her dropped in the 1 group MPG trials.</div></div><hr />
