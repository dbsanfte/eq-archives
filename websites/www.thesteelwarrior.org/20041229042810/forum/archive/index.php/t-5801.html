<br />
At the moment my kick dmg seems capped at 52 (42 + 10 dmg from Runewarded Belt).<br />
<br />
I don't see it being worth the AA's if its not going to signicantly increase the damage to a point equal with bashing with a decent shield.<br />
<br />
I still believe that kick damage should be based of boots AC, similarily to how the bash is based of Shield AC, but I wouldn't so much mind spending the AA as long as it is a significant increase.</div></div><hr />

I dont know what the 2nd and 3rd train do, but the first basically gives you an extra 5 damage for kick.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter how a melee class does their DPS, as long as the ratios are correct.

I'll support the idea of giving warrior kick the same level of damage as Flying Kick ... when I see this entire message board advocate giving Paladins and Shadowknights a mini-defensive.<br />

Because it'd do the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How would it affect monks at all? Think about it. You'd still have all your monkly abilities, including doing more DPS. It wouldn't actually affect you at all! I'm not personally in favor of caring about warrior kick/bash, but why would this even be a monk issue? It would barely change warrior DPS, and certainly not change our role at all.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Do keep in mind that monks now get a version of flurry... Does that affect warriors at all? Not really. Just lost us the coolness factor of being the only ones to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;including doing more DPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's exactly how it would affect monks.<br />
<br />
Flying Kick is exactly what you're looking to do. That's how much damage Flying Kick does. That's one of the biggest DPS differences between monks and warriors. And it'd get rid of that difference.<br />
<br />
All that's left after that are:<br />
<br />
- Weapons. <br />
- Skill Cap disparity<br />
- Small Damage Table Difference<br />
<br />
Look at the overlord sanctuary thread. Notice the rather small difference between monk DPS and warrior DPS in plane of time weapons. Now make that gap smaller because warriors are suddenly doing Flying Kick damage.<br />
<br />
Also, consider the visual impact of taking one of the few UNIQUE monk things and making it completely pointless. Monk specials are SUPPOSED to be superior to regular kick.<br />
<br />
Seriously ... WHY do warriors not want knights to be able to go defensive?<br />
<br />
Answer that, and you'll understand why a monk wouldn't want you doing FLYING KICK levels of damage.<br />
<br />
It's a joke. You must be joking. You couldn't possibly be THAT GREEDY concerning your class in everquest in relation to other classes. Because this doesn't fall under the word &quot;balance.&quot; Not when you advocate getting RID of balance.</div></div><hr />

Sort of like monks getting rampage and flurry eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not saying I disagree with you Wu on warriors getting flying kick type damage out of kick/bash, but how much does the new flurry GoD AA monks get increase their DPS?  I'd be willing to bet it's not a trivial amount.  Especially when coupled with:<br />
<br />
- Weapons. <br />
- Skill Cap disparity<br />
- Small Damage Table Difference<br />
<br />
If the difference is approximately equal to the DPS increase that warriors would get from higher kick damage, you're argument stops being one of &quot;This would unbalance warrior and monk DPS&quot;, and becomes one of &quot;This is an ability that is unique to my class and I don't want anyone else to have it.&quot;  Well, flurry used to be warrior only (so did crits, but since they're eye candy nobody really cares much).  <br />
<br />
And honestly, comparing this to giving hybrids defensive is comparing apples and oranges.  Warriors are not a direct competitor to your primary role in a group.  If anything, I'd say you should reserve that argument for bards and memblur, which DID seriously marginalize your role as a puller.<br />
<br />
Again. Not saying I disagree with you, just saying that the basis for your argument is somewhat flawed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wubao: How much DPS is monk flying kick? Is it really the driving difference between monk and warrior DPS? The reason I couldn't care less about this one way or the other is that it seems to be a fairly unimportant thing. <br />
<br />
It's a joke. You must be joking. You couldn't possibly be THAT GREEDY concerning your class in everquest in relation to other classes. Because this doesn't fall under the word &quot;balance.&quot; Not when you advocate getting RID of balance<br />
<br />
Wtf? Are you serious? This would be such a vital, game breaking change that the entirety of class balance would be destroyed? You think something like this would challenge the spot of monks? I just don't see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, back to the original thread sidetrack, the assertion was that warriors doing more kick damage marginallizes monks.   And while the parses in the Overlords Sanctuary show flying kick to be a decent dps chunk, so far I haven't seen anything to show that Strengthened Strike actually is comparable to Flying Kick dps anyway.   Just comparing the max damage on a warrior's kick (and I'm not sure what figure people are using for this other that a guess) with the max of flying kick isn't really comparing anything, since flying kick still should have a greater minimum hit.   All of which is subsumed over the greater question, why are monks marginallized by warriors doing more damage anyway.  If it's a question of DPS, monks have already been &quot;marginallized&quot; by half a dozen other classes, and the debate is on monk marginallization in general, not in relation to warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm perfectly fine with the AA as it is. READ this thread however. Read it closely. It's not this AA that set me off. It's the person who asked for it to be changed to make kick damage be 120 to 200 points of damage.<br />
<br />
That's far too much.<br />
<br />
That's how much damage Flying Kick does. And as you state, flying kick is a &quot;decent dps chunk&quot;<br />
<br />
57 point kicks don't bug me at all. It's the people who say &quot;Well kick should be 200 points of damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then when confronted with how that would basically gimp monk special attacks, they shoot back with &quot;How would that possibly gimp monks?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not apples and oranges. It's apples and apples.<br />
<br />
If you all can agree with the paladins who  want a mini-defensive to tank Gates mobs as discussed in detail in THIS thread:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=5743<br />
<br />
Then I will AVIDLY support any movement to up kick damage to flying kick levels.<br />
<br />
Until then ... why don't we back off the kick damage, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wubao, I'm honestly confused on how this gimps monks. Warriors AREN'T monk competition. How does it gimp monk special attacks, other than flying kick no longer being the only 200ish damage special attack? Would it increase warrior DPS to the point where monks would no longer have a DPS advantage over warriors? How is it different than monks getting flurry and rampage AAs, previously only available to warriors? I'm not trying to flame, I'm just honestly confused on how some upgraded kick/bash is infringing on monk territory. And again, I'm NOT advocating any change to kick/bash, I just don't understand this defensiveness from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">edit: Not even worth the effort anymore.<br />
<br />
If you can't grasp how giving warriors a special attack that does almost the exact same amount of damage flying kick does would annoy, piss off and GIMP monks in general ... I don't think I can ever explain it properly.<br />
<br />
I re-iterate. If you can back up the paladins who want to have a disc defensive, I will GLADLY back up any warriors who want flying kick.<br />
<br />
So, once I see the thread in the overlord's sanctuary take a far different tone ... one of support for knights in their quest to tank better ... I will throw my support behind any and all ideas to up warrior special attacks to monk levels.<br />
<br />
Good luck in convincing your own community to gimp itself. I hope it expands your awareness of how monks feel regarding Flying Kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't see the context you were talking about about the 120-200 kick poster Wubao, so you're right, the actual damage of strengthened strike isn't relavent to the discussion, but I still don't see how that changes anything else I mentioned.  Is it something in particular about a kick doing that much damage?  Would it be ok if it was some other attack, say, a headbutt doing 200 damage?  In either case, I don't think monks would be &quot;completely marginalize&quot;d.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look, consider each class as having a DPS black box. Currently the warrior black box is less than the monk black box, as it should be. If the warrior box increased, does that threaten monks? Perhaps, depending on how much that increase is. Does it matter HOW that DPS is added? It shouldn't. A bigger kick is no different than getting a better ratio weapon, or more crits, or a better damage bonus. It's all just the DPS black box. If warriors start infringing on monks' DPS spot, it's definitely a balance issue.<br />
<br />
  You seem to be arguing is that a stronger warrior special attack would be removing the &quot;coolness factor&quot; of flying kick, AND/OR you're arguing that the warrior DPS black box is getting too close to the monk DPS black box. I'm just trying to figure out which one, or both, you're arguing. <br />
<br />
  If you're arguing that the coolness factor would be removed, I'd have to point out again that monks now get flurry AND rampage, which were warriors' coolness factor abilities. There is no balance issue at all here.<br />
<br />
  If you're arguing that increased warrior DPS would be infringing on monks' DPS spot, and that a change in kick damage of that magnitude would cut it too close, I'd certainly see your worry. That would indeed gimp monks if it raised warrior DPS that significantly. I just think a kick damage increase of 100-150 wouldn't increase warrior DPS that much... am I wrong?<br />
<br />
  Knight defensive disc would be infringing on warrior defensive abilities in exactly the same way too much of an increase in warrior DPS would be infringing on monks' DPS spot. As I think classes are pretty damn well balanced right now, I certainly wouldn't advocate any shifts right now.<br />
<br />
  Lastly, I really have no desire for a special attack like that at all. It just doesn't matter; it's all the DPS black box to me. If our DPS is where it should be, hurrah! Don't change anything. If monks' DPS is too low, then it should be increased, in my opinion by raising their own special attacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Warriors don't need to do more damage, we are on the receiving end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Equirs</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I think the proper way to answer this question is to ask how many times you press kick in a span of a battle... then change all those damages to 120-200 damage, then see what the dps in the end will be. <br />
<br />
I haven't done it, I couldn't be bothered doing it, its just a suggestion to see how much the dps would REALLY be effected if suddenly all your kicks with this aa ability became as strong as a monk's flying kick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As the AA stands its completely and totally fucking useless. Its like 20aa or some shit for maybe 1-2dps upgrade overall, how uber. Warriors are used to getting useless shit instead of usable AAs and this expansion is nothing new, but you can seriously go fuck yourself if you think 20aa for ~1-2dps upgrade is &quot;perfectly fine&quot;, and an upgrade to this useless shit isnt warranted. Of course 120-200 damage per kick is too much, but there is alot of middle ground between 1-57 and 120-200.</div></div><hr />

It just doesn't always land :P <br />
<br />
But back on the topic...I haven't gotten this AA yet, so I wouldn't know its actual increase, but 1-2 dps increase is shitty, maybe a 10-15 dps increase would be acceptable or even 5, but 1-2? :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Its like 20aa or some shit for maybe 1-2dps upgrade overall, how uber.&quot;<br />

Ferocity?<br />
<br />
Combat Fury 3?<br />
<br />
Flurry?<br />
<br />
I thought by now you'd all be USED to shelling out 12 or more points for marginal DPS improvements?<br />
<br />
Come on now. What AAs do you get that DO give you 15 to 20 DPS improvements? Cause I've sure been missing them in my AA queue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flurry, Ferocity, PB.. all scale with weapon upgrades, the better weapons you get the more they help. This AA doesnt scale at all, its apparently a flat upgrade no matter how good you are. Plus on reflection I believe I was quite overstating it as being 1-2dps increase because obviously kick and bash miss quite alot. It obviously wont get changed but dont try and kid yourself into thinking its worth training as is, its complete ass and probably more useless then warlords craptacity.<br />
<br />
Oh and Flurry 4-6, Ferocity, Ambidex were all meaningful and parseable upgrades to dps. Flurry 1-3 were pretty gay I agree, but they LEAD into something else. If there is another AA in the next expansion called Improved Strengthened Strike that makes your kick/bash never miss, and raises the damage by 20 for less then half the cost, then it will be comparable. This AA is neither meaningful or useful in any way except for someone who hits the 30aa cap with everything else trained except for improved air capacity.<br />
<br />
Come on now. What AAs do you get that DO give you 15 to 20 DPS improvements? Cause I've sure been missing them in my AA queue. <br />
<br />
Jesus, are you like Mr Overstates-shit or something? Yeah, because once again there is NO middle ground between 1dps and 15, no way. I know when I count I go 0, 1, 2, 15, 16, 20. I dont think that for 20 god-damn AA, a dps upgrade in the region of 4-5 would be asking too fucking much.<br />
<br />
I honestly dont give a shit about the AA, it wont get changed im sure, but your entire argument and knack for exaggerating everything said is getting pretty tired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Flurry, Ferocity, PB .. all scale with weapon upgrades, the better weapons you get the more they help.&quot;<br />

lol<br />
<br />
No. That's not how they work. But thanks for trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and Flurry 4-6, Ferocity, Ambidex were all meaningful and parseable upgrades to dps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaningful being the key word. You seem to think tiny 2 to 4 percent increases are meaningful for ONE AA, but meaningless when it's simply your kick that's being upgraded.<br />
<br />
Which is pretty damn stupid.<br />
<br />
&quot;This AA is neither meaningful or useful in any way except for someone who hits the 30aa cap with everything else trained except for improved air capacity.&quot;<br />
<br />
And you accuse me of overstating? Please. You're doing the same thing, except in your world it's OK, because it's YOU who's doing it.<br />
<br />
Whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, because once again there is NO middle ground between 1dps and 15, no way.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's annoying, whiny, greedy, gimme-a-cookie-gimme-a-cookie-gimme-a-cookie types of players like you that need to be talked to in this manner.<br />
<br />
You're NOT HAPPY with a 2 percent increase. Even though every other offensive AA you've ever spent any points on has been the same tiny, tiny incremental increase.<br />
<br />
So this time, you want a 15 to 20 DPS increase. I didn't state that. YOU DID. You said it. In YOUR post. You want a 15 to 20 DPS increase.<br />
<br />
And other morons in this thread want to kick for 120 to 200 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Wake up.<br />
<br />
If you want a 15 to 20 DPS increase ... ROLL A FUCKING ROGUE.<br />
<br />
If you want to kick for 200 points of damage ... ROLL A FUCKING MONK.<br />
<br />
It's what they do.<br />
<br />
If you want to TANK the dragon/giant/whatever ... play your warrior. And DEAL with the fact that AAs give TINY incremental increases. Whether it's FLURRY or STRENGHTENED STRIKES ... it's gonna be a tiny little increase.<br />
<br />
That's just EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since most offensive AAs scale with weapons, that means they're actually less useful for the joe average player that seems to having trouble meeting the cost of the GoD AAs since they have weaker weapon so they get less DPS for the same AA compare to uber_warrior_01.<br />
<br />
Kind of ironic how things work huh?<br />
<br />
Strengthened Strike/Sinister Strikes are better for people with lower gear despite their cost because the DPS they give is flat.  Not dependent on gear is a good thing when your gear sucks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this time, you want a 15 to 20 DPS increase. I didn't state that. YOU DID. You said it. In YOUR post. You want a 15 to 20 DPS increase.<br />
<br />
If you want a 15 to 20 DPS increase ... ROLL A FUCKING ROGUE.<br />
<br />
If you want to kick for 200 points of damage ... ROLL A FUCKING MONK.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Superchum, id like you to SHOW me where I ever once stated I thought warriors should get a 15-20dps upgrade from this skill. Please find it, im dying to know. When you CANT find it, how about you apologize to me for the rest of your post?<br />
<br />
My first post:<br />
<br />
As the AA stands its completely and totally fucking useless. Its like 20aa or some shit for maybe 1-2dps upgrade overall, how uber. Warriors are used to getting useless shit instead of usable AAs and this expansion is nothing new, but you can seriously go fuck yourself if you think 20aa for ~1-2dps upgrade is &quot;perfectly fine&quot;, and an upgrade to this useless shit isnt warranted. Of course 120-200 damage per kick is too much, but there is alot of middle ground between 1-57 and 120-200. <br />
<br />
Where the hell am I saying ANYWHERE ANYTHING about 20dps upgrade. Thats right nowhere. You are the one who cant seem to fathom that there is anything between a 1dps upgrade in total dps and wanting to do 15+ dps more. I even stated quite clearly that 120-200 damage per kick idea was way too much, and then you fucking attack me over it. Get a grip.<br />
<br />
Incase you missed, this is what I said in my 2nd post:<br />
<br />
a dps upgrade in the region of 4-5dps would be asking too fucking much. <br />
<br />
That would be 4-5dps not percent. And for a highend tank that would be in line with a 2-2.5% upgrade in dps. I certainly gained a LOT more overall dps from training flurry 4-6, or PB3 (when I used 2h) or from training ambidex even when I was using shittier weapons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flurry, Ferocity, PB .. all scale with weapon upgrades, the better weapons you get the more they help.&quot;<br />
<br />
No. That's not how they work. But thanks for trying.<br />
 <br />
<br />
How the fuck DO they work then brain box? Any weapon with any ratio is going to give EXACTLY the same changes in dps when training an offensive AA then? A 25/20 1hs is going to provide the same raw dps increase from training flurry as a 16/20 is?  <br />
<br />
You're NOT HAPPY with a 2 percent increase. Even though every other offensive AA you've ever spent any points on has been the same tiny, tiny incremental increase. <br />
<br />
If it was a 2% increase, I wouldnt have bothered replying to this stupid thread, however it isnt. Its a miniscule dps upgrade that doesnt scale at all based on the warrior. If a 1 dps upgrade is 2% then im doing ooh 50dps orso. This isnt Kunark anymore, are you perhaps living in the past? Are the warriors in your guild still using Yaks maybe?<br />
<br />
I also stated in both posts I dont even give a shit about the skill, I was only responding to your over-reaction to a badly balanced  suggestion about a complete shit AA. My suggestions were simply my opinion of what youd need to do to make the skill worth training. It would need to be slightly better then it is. Then you  respond with..<br />
<br />
It's annoying, whiny, greedy, gimme-a-cookie-gimme-a-cookie-gimme-a-cookie types of players like you that need to be talked to in this manner. <br />
<br />
..when I was half agreeing with you makes you look like a complete tool. Take a look again at what I posted and what you replied with, then you can reroll as a human being with half a brain, it will be a 50% intelligence upgrade for you. I dont want any fucking upgrades to the skill, its useless as it is but im more then used to getting completely worthless AAs, its what we put up with every expansion. I DO have a problem with you trying to put words in my mouth that I never said in order to try and win a stupid argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BINGO!<br />
A kick of even 200 damage would not do jack for me.<br />
However if it actually stunned high level caster mobs like it used to stun old world mobs I would actually get this AA.<br />
<br />
Those damn Jord Profets laugh at my kick.<br />
It would be nice to spend AA to retain the stun effect it used to have.</div></div><hr />

Leave kick to the monks.  Any warrior using kick while tanking in PoP or GoD deserves to die (potential 2.5k riposte for an additional what, 1.5 dps).  <br />
<br />
Nice to see monks and rogues making a comeback in GoD.  <br />

You just got your pulling skills back, give it a rest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juraveil</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What i find funny is that a damn monk is complaining so much about ONE person asking for it.  Most the people on this thread stated that it was too much OR didnt want it that high.  Was one person who said it and then he goes off on everyone else.  Tell ya what though since you dont want us geting a kick that does similar damage to flying kick since that is YOUR skill, how bout you give bards their lull back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot; how bout you give bards their lull back.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll do that when fading memories no longer works better than feign death.<br />
<br />
I'll do that when my lull actually works on more than one monster. <br />
<br />
I'll do that when bards are the ONLY class that can lull-pacify-harmony.<br />
<br />
I'll do that when WARRIORS give up INCITE and let SHADOWKNIGHTS have their role as targeted HATE inducing class.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, shut the fuck up? Yeah, don't think you can do that, but anyways ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Was one person who said it and then he goes off on everyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was more than one person. Just a bunch of greedy fucks who want more and more and more and more.<br />
<br />
Warcry: Warriors have too much free time on their hands, so they start threads here complaining about AAs that improve their DPS, even slightly. You just got your tanking skills back, so why not give it a rest? You don't NEED to do more kick damage, since it doesn't do jack shit for tanking.<br />
<br />
Zotha: It was Equirs that stated 10 -15 DPS. I don't care if it was you or Equirs, however, since the skill is FINE as it is. The DPS increase is balanced and in line with what warriors are all about, regarding their KICK skill. The price is certainly expensive. But you know what ... so is everything else in Gates of Discord. So I don't give a fuck that Raging Flurry or Ambidexterity are cheaper. They're also cheaper than PACKRAT. Big deal.<br />
<br />
Regarding offensive AAs and the weapon you have ... 2.5 percent increase in DPS is a 2.5 percent increase in DPS. Your weapons don't matter, since you get the exact same benefit from the skill no matter when you train it. So, no, your idea on weapons actually mattering when training AAs is wrong ... &quot;brain box.&quot;<br />
<br />
And your useless flames are just that ... useless. You can call me names, whatever. But you weren't agreeing with me. You were insulting and mocking me, in an effort to make yourself look &quot;cooler&quot; in a stupid argument. That doesn't put you above the rest of us in this idiotic thread. It puts you right there in the middle of the muck with the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is ... Monks have flying kick. They do the high amounts of kick damage. Warriors are tanks. They can certainly kick. But improving their kick skill any more than this AA already does can and does hamper one of the primary functions of the monk class. So yeah, the skill isn't that impressive. It isn't supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

No we dont, nor are we really asking for it as a whole.<br />
So what ye goin off about?</div></div><hr />

I didnt start this thread, I dont care how much I can kick for, nor do I think it needs improved, nor do I care how much it costs.  There is a decent chance I may never even practice this.<br />
<br />
My point was no one cares, fill up useless threads somewhere else...pretty please.<br />

We already know what warriors are off their rocker, we can handle our own thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Wu, I've been trying for a couple of days to stay out of this one but I just can't.  Let me break it down for you.  The vast majority of us don't think kicking for 120-200 is something a warrior should be able to do.  However, there IS A MIDDLE GROUND between 1-57 and 120-200, and it is a quite a large range.  Three things:<br />
<br />
1.  For such an expensive AA, the damage increase it provides is laughable, which is the primary point of this thread, even if the original poster did go a little overboard in his assessment of how much of an increase it should be.<br />
<br />
2.  Given that the tone of the arguments against giving warriors a kick upgrade have seemed, at least to me, to be alot less &quot;class balance issues&quot; and alot more &quot;this is something unique to my class and I don't want anyone else to have it&quot;, I submit to you that all melees can now get critical hits (they're worthless, but they can get them), and monks can now get flurry and rampage, which were previously warrior only abilities.  Not class defining ones, but neither is flying kick in my opinion.  For clarity I said, IN MY OPINION, I'm not stating that as fact.  Frankly, I've never played a monk past lvl 30, but I thought feign, mend, and higher damage tables and offensive skill caps were much more what made a monk than some eye candy that refreshes every 10 seconds, again, maybe that's just me.<br />
<br />
3.  The reason that I posted this reply in the first place is that both here and in a few other posts I've seen recently, you've been so far out of line that Haas probably thinks you're being an ass.  I understand there are reasons for that not related to EQ, but seriously man, take a deep breath and calm down before you post.  I know sometimes I'm not the calm voice of reason myself, but Jesus man, lighten up.</div></div><hr />
