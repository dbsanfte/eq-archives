<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok since i have decided i will get a Great blade of Storms (thanks for the great feedback~), does anyone here weild both that can tell me which procs more? The GBoS or Cord Hilted Spike Driver.<br />
Atm i have a willsapper primary (primary only) which i have pretty much perma equipped. since i got it agro control was much better and now that i have the willsapper/chsd combo i dont suffer much/any agro problems when i take up velius or teir1/2 bosses if the MA dies, the problem i have is with the lower stats/ratio and the fact that its a pericer. it procs heaps, sometimes 3-5 times almost in a row, and generates quite a bit of agro, but the hit on my atk for using a peircer primary and the fact that it has lower hps means i probably wont use it much in places like Ssraa or higher teir pop boss encounters. I'll probably keep it for xp groups though ;) I havnt played much with the CHSD in primary because i wanted the willsapper equipped.<br />
<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

The Driver is better agro in my opinion. I have a warrior friend in me guild who uses that exact combo and he always main hands the Spike driver.<br />
Love the look of that weapon on him too ( he is an Ogre ) it looks like a HUGE meat tenderizer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not familiar with greatblade of storms, but i'd bag the willsapper unless you don't have a slower.  The spiked driver is a lot better aggro (put it in primary hand).  I wouldn't take the spiked driver out of main hand unless you upgrade to a BoC or maybe a 17 20 type weapon, or better yet, a 2 hander.  :)<br />
<br />
*edit* looking at stats of the great blade, you might get enough aggro mainhanding it and offhanding driver.  It just depends on proc rate and how much the 0 second stun seems to aggro.  SoD has a similar effect I think, and I used to offhand it and main hand spiked driver, but then this GBoS has a better ratio.  Still bag the willsapper!  And either combo will still get you chewed up in PoP!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice observation Dobbo.  You do know that stun procs generate aggro too right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know I think that the GBoS proc might be more agro than the mini EB proc on the driver.  The GBoS is going to be better dps in mainhand for sure though</div></div><hr />

Nice observation Dobbo.  You do know that stun procs generate aggro too right?  <br />
<br />
Using the CHSD mainhand and Droga hammer offhand (same proc as GBOS), I get to see the effects of both Taunting Blow and Force Shock.  The two procs feel identical to me in terms of aggro value and proc rate, even when the mob resists or is immune to stun.  The Droga hammer only loses in melee damage aggro, which is one of GBOS's strengths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to main hand GBoS over the CHSD.  I found I kept agro much better with GBoS than CHSD.  The proc on the GBoS generates a comparable amount of hate to the CHSD, from what I've seen.  Add in the fact that the GBoS is faster and does more damage, and you can see where I was coming from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I mainhand GBoS and offhand CHSD.  I feel the hate generated from the two different procs is the same (whether that be because the stun generates as much hate or because the stun procs more - which is what I've found - the end is the same).  The damage generated from GBoS is slightly higher, but even that minimal increase is significant to me as I have Fero3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ayash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Used GBoS and CHSD. I used CHSD main for ages because i just 'assumed' it would have better aggro. Switched them round after a friend said he preferred GBoS in mainand i'm inclined to agree now.<br />
<br />
I'd say GBoS main/CHSD off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">thanks~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Balthizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I mainhand the GBoS and have the CHoS in offhand and have no problem keeping aggro. I would for sure tell you to put the CHSD in the offhand and GBoS mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GBoS pri and CHSD in off hand.<br />

Awsome agro.  Reverse, not so good.  Proc rate on GBoS &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CHSD<br />
<br />
Stun agro &gt;&gt; 450hate IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thats the problem with warriors in a nutshell.<br />
All verant would have to do to &quot;fix&quot; warriors is reduce the hate from stun. Instead, the give us a bunch of proc dependent stunning weapons and make us &quot;ghetto palllies&quot;</div></div><hr />
