   I recently got my hands on this weapon and havent really tested out.  I noticed that the proc rate is extremely low on the thing.  I was in a group for about an hour and it only procced for me once for all that time.  Is that the norm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After those two patches in a row, Ive noticed a significant decrease in proc rate of this thing.  It use to proc like it was possesed, but now it procs like a normal weapon it seems.  Also I might be dreaming but Im getting less aggro from it than from before. <br />
<br />
I decided to sell it for now and see if in fact it was a stealth nerf.  When I get back from my travel trip, I will see if I should buy it or if people say that it's been nerfed.  I hope not though, it was an amazing stick.<br />
<br />
Dont make me go back to my duel wield combo :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used mine last night in CT clearing slimes and then in PoV at the west castle wall camp. I only have problems getting agro once when the chanter tashed a little early then got low HP agro before I got a proc off. Other than that my 55 war had no problem holding agro with a 62 cleric and 65 rogue/sham/wiz/chanter in the group. Being 55 in PoV I had to absolutely depend on DPS and procs to hold agro because every mob in the zone save the token dire charm mobs is deep red.<br />
<br />
GSoT still procs like a bad dawg and still holds agro like a champ.</div></div><hr />

I bought me one last nite on the VZ server for 26k, my 2hb was like at 6 LOL, had a shammy friend max my dex and went out to POI to help some friends of mine bye the time my 2hb hit 101 i was procing like mad and got accused of using my TAUNT from a Pally that truely made my night. IMO great weapon 2 thumbs up here.</div></div><hr />

For me, it procs like a normal weapon, that's with DEX around 228.  Great for keeping aggro, though, our MT warrior at the last raid couldn't hold aggro while I was using it.</div></div><hr />
