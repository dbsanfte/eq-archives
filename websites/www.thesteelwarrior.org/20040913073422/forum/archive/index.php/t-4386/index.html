1) Although we haven't talked very much about it, the team has been working very hard on the Melee changes. Expect something in mid-December (we'll announce it and discuss it in the upcoming chat) that far exceeds what people are expecting. The bottom line is our major goal was to completely revise the way melee combat is done in EQ. You can look forward to the Melee types becoming much more interactive and able to do a whole lot more cool things during combat. <br />

Also found in the article are comments on Lord of Everquest, Collection Missions,  and why the Rallos Zek server got another shot at the Sleeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope their definition of &quot;far exceeding&quot; is about up to par with my definition of &quot;far exceeding&quot;<br />
<br />
kinda like buying a chevy caprice classic and getting a lamborghini countach  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saddorie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After receiving nothing from SoE, wouldnt anything &quot;far exceed&quot; our expectations from them? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With that statement, SOE had better realize that they are putting themselves pretty much on the firing line.<br />
<br />
If they botch up this so called &quot;melee change that far exceeds our expectations&quot;, not only to they add to the angst and animosity in us Warriors, they might very well just antagonise all melee classes as well (pure and hybrid).<br />
<br />
I guess this goes for us rather than against. If they do good on their proposition, we get what we want. If not, they're fq'ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">About time they give a date at least, lets hope they meet a mid December timeline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, if they hadn't said that it would 'far exceed' our expectations, then it probably would have far exceeded our expectations, since everyone's expectations were pretty low.<br />
<br />
But now that they've said it will 'far exceed' our expectations, it may not far exceed our expectations since now we're expecting it to far exceed our expectations and so our expectations are higher. <br />
<br />
Actually, just the fact that anyone from Sony said that it will 'far exceed' our expectations, far exceeded my expectations. <br />
<br />
Hope that's clear and have a nice day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I for one will hope for the best. I think that sony has shown they steal others ideas which is a good thing.<br />
