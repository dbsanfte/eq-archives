<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terminator24h</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I've returned to EQ after quitting for 2 years - I've been back for a couple days now.  I'm surprised to find so many changes, from all the uber items, to PoK porting, and Old Sebilis completely empty.  Fortunately I had some PP sitting in the bank and I upgraded my weapons.  I had a bunch of stuff waiting to be sold too - so I sold all that crap and scrounged together about 30k.<br />
<br />
I'd like some equipment advice as well as hunting advice.  I hear PoP is good for me, as well as LDoN adventures.  Apparently, I can also get some decent loot in these places.  For now, I'm just bazaaring and farming plat in Sol A until Platinum is released so I can grab all the expansions cheaper.  I'm currently set up to Luclin.<br />
<br />
The first things I bought were Copper Hammer of Striking, Sword of the Bloodsworn, and a Grimling Contraption to replace my Crystal Spider Eyes.  Now, I'm not sure what else to upgrade.  Here's my magelo - please have a look: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=340202<br />
<br />
I got back into my old guild - they're mostly raiding the mini-bosses on Luclin, about once a week or so.  We haven't done AoW before.  I probably can't expect much from my guild because I will be on probation for a few weeks and I want to upgrade my gear before that.  I was thinking that my Bracers, Ears, Fingers, Arms, Feet, and Chest need to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks to me, given that you've been gone for two years, that you're fairly intelligently geared. Yeah, gear has changed a bunch in the last two years, but you are not terribly undergeared at the moment.<br />
Once you get LDoN, I think you'll find several avenues of gear upgrades are available to you. I'd farm plat and keep an eye on bazaar prices for a while (prices as well as gear have changed since you've been gone, as you've probably discovered already). <br />
Looks like you know the weakest slots; your fingers are probably not the first thing I'd replace, but your list looks good to me.<br />
You might check the prices on certain tradeskill items: silks, leather padding, hides, acrylia, velium, and windstones. You could farm all of these things (well, not the leather padding, but the components for it), and, if you can run a trader in the bazaar, make some plat. Or, of course, check with your tradeskill guildmates to see who needs what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terminator24h</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright - I actually calculated that I'll be around 40k by the end of this week from selling stuff, plus whatever farming I do, so I could be around 45k to 50k.  What should I do with all this money though?  I read one thread where someone asked whether or not to upgrade haste from I think about 27% to 36%, and everyone unanimously agreed that he shouldn't.  So, that takes away one big money sink which is upgrading my haste.<br />
<br />
What, more specifically, should I look for to replace the slots I mentioned above?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kxorth</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you didn't ask specifically about this, but a great way to make money is farming rockhopper hides in Dawnshroud Peaks.  The hides sell for a ton on sol ro because they are one of the only ways for high end tailors to get their skill up.  It might be more lucrative thans sola (sola is nice also though, so I don't know).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terminator24h</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just realized that for the chest a Champion's Breastplate would be awesome - 47AC 10 Stamina and 90 HP... plus invig.  I think I'm going to look for an MQ of this for my chest slot.  Have ya'll got any other suggestions?  Architect's BP maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While a champions BP would be great for you I'd reccommend against buying an MQ.  Questing it for free is a fantastic upgrade but if you gonna shell out money its best to buy the something that you can resell when you outgrow it and architect BP's seem to hold their value decently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terminator24h</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, good thing you stopped me then.  I figured I'd keep it bagged anyways for the invig, though...  I'll look for a really cheap Architect's BP and try to find some solo exp, perhaps in Karnor's or grouped in Acrylia.<br />
<br />
Edit: What should I look for for my feet?  Steelslave Bladed Boots seem to be decent - for about 3k they are 27 AC 45 HP I believe.  Arms?  Here I have no idea really.  Earrings?  Mosquito Leg Earrings perhaps?  Bracers, once again I have no idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terminator24h</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just hunting in Karnor's and we saw that Venril Sathir was up, so we decided to take him down.  We called in a few reinforcements and slaughtered that pansy, and I took his pants - the zerker pants.  I ended up giving those to my guildmate.<br />
<br />
Some guildies made me a pair of Valorium Rings of Gallantry, so I replaced my Velium Fire Wedding Rings with those.  Besides that, I've made a little more plat and some progress toward 56.  I'm still confused as to what to buy.  My guildmate offered to trade me her Cloak of Flames for a Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt if I got the Belt - I'm tempted to take this trade just to make 30k because the CoF is worth so much more.  Any input on what to do?  And what to do with the money I make?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe not the best advice since I haven't been your level in awhile, but....<br />
<br />
Get an Archetect's BP, Crinose Cape of the Werewolf, that quest earring you need like 8 bazaar buyable items to get, and finally re-think purchasing some FH.<br />
<br />
Eventually you'll want Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance, Bloodmetal Earrings, and a pile of LDoN augments.<br />
