However, I am missing TT, KoS/Saryrn and MM (in addition to Sol Ro) for EP access.  Will these missing flags prevent me from getting into Sol Ro's chamber?  My guild is up on rotation for him tomorrow and I'd like to be able to participate.  Thanks for your time. =)</div></div><hr />

If you're guild knows what its doing and cooperates well, you can push quite a few people into Sol Ro's chamber</div></div><hr />

You can visa people in, but they have to log soon as they are in, the 85% rule now applies inside his lair, where it didnt used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naje</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was under the understanding that if you had killed all 5 minis, you were then flagged for the chamber. You would need to be gimped into solro itself, but could then help gimp into the chamber itself. This isn't the case?</div></div><hr />

Oh well.  I got MM flagged, so once I get TT and Saryrn, this won't be an issue anymore.  Thanks anyways, guys.</div></div><hr />

We had a guy in guild who did the Efreeti quest (you have to do this, not have the normal Sol Ro access done) to get the quest from the gnome at zone in.  Went around and picked up the 3 bits marked Sol Ro Chamber key, went to have a go at clicking into the chamber and he couldn't. <br />
<br />
Can also confimr that you can 85/15 (or one in 6 whatever it is now) people into his Chamber.</div></div><hr />

Two people go linkdead and the raid takes a collective breath as it tries to work out who's going to get kicked.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.  Fun.  I always enjoy adding at least a half hour of boring screwing around to the beginning of every raid.  <br />
<br />
At this point, they should change this so that its about killing two or three big mobs, not about how much patience you have dragging people in or dicking around figuring out quests that may or may not work.  PoP was badly designed (devisive within your own guild,  started the entire casual vs. uber thing, all because it really does force you to become a professional eq player if you want to see content) from the beginning, and all the various hacks SoE has done to try and make for that fact have just made it more and more about the hacks instead of the content.</div></div><hr />

You missed my sarcasm evidently.<br />

I thought Luclin did that, VT wasn't really casual friendly.</div></div><hr />

Getting a VT key is easy for the casual player...most of the drops required for the VT key are single groupable.  Sure, you gotta kill Emp but thats just one raid mob versus how many to progress anywhere in PoP?  (okay, two raid mobs if you count one for the orb but we were farming Luclin boss mobs anyway so the orbs came naturally).  I love the way the progression was designed in Luclin.  When our guild was ramping up to do VT, the key quest was great.  It gave everyone something to do on the nights when there wasn't any raiding to be had.  With PoP, every single point of progression required a raid force.  I guess &quot;casual&quot; can be a relative term too but we certainly had MUCH less grief and time commitment to progress in Luclin versus PoP.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't so much talking about getting the keys, but the length of the raids once you got into VT.</div></div><hr />
