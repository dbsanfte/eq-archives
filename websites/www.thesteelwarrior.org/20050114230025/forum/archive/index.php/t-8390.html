<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other day while goofing around in Vxed I found something out about Chaos Claws that I didnt already know: it is not a proc, it is just an innate ability that was given to some mobs.  <br />
<br />
Have someone with snare go fetch a noc in Vxed, you stand way away from the mob on the pull.  Have your group debuff the crap out of it and root it.  Now since you havent done anything to it you can walk right up to it and it will completely ignore you, it'll just point at the person it hates the most.  Now watch the Chaos Claws spam fly by (It wont hit your group members in this situation because it's range 20).<br />
<br />
The frequency of Chaos Claws seems to be tweeked depending on what zone you are in.  In Ferubi or Barindu for example, the mobs that have it dont seem to spam it like Vxed or Tipt.  I'm assuming it was put in the game as a counter to the slow line, slow doesnt affect how often a mob hits you with claws.  And I'm guessing that Cripple doesnt affect it since it is not a proc.<br />
<br />
And yes, I already know that you uber warriors could care less about it, but for us non ubers it can hurt a lot.  Chromatic plus -150 resist adjust  means that i have never once resisted it (resist buffed or not).  Spam 650 in Vxed can really add up.  I'm already getting torn up pretty badly by trash Vxed/Tipt mobs, not being able to resist spam claws is icing on the blood cake.<br />
<br />
Not that any of this makes any difference, I was just mildy amused to see it was being spammed when the mob was rooted way away from the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure its a proc. Crippling/slowing mobs in Barindu makes it almost never go off. Are you sure you weren't seeing the bellow being spammed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not a proc.   There's two ways to check this:<br />
<br />
1. It lands on misses:   Now this in itself isn't enough to state that it's not a proc because the current understanding of inherent procs only landing on successful hits *could* be wrong, although it's not ever been proven a single time in six years of EQ.<br />
<br />
2. It lands out of melee range:  This seals it.  You can be outside of melee range and take a chaos claw.    It's simply a single target effect without a cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a Noc in Vxed that pretty much does Chaos Claw nonstop.  That Noc seems to be different from other mobs that use Chaos Claw because it's the only one I've seen that 'casts' Chaos Claw while you're running.  I pull mobs quite a bit and I've never been hit by a Chaos Claw being 'cast' anywhere else.  <br />
<br />
I don't log Chaos Claw enough to verify what you said but aside from that Noc in question, everything else at least appears to have a Chaos Claw proc rate comparable to how fast they're hitting.  Offhand I don't remember ever seeing Chaos Claw while the mob isn't swinging.  <br />
<br />
And yes Chaos Claw sucks, but it's there to add another dimension to tanking, i.e. resists + spellshield.  Bulwark of Alendar helps a lot too.  I think it's a good way to reward people who play smartly.  It's well worth the time to get an extra resist up versus Chaos Claw happy enemies.  Instead of just adding another 300 damage to mob's max hit you end up having more variation that can be countered by good gear and more careful planning.<br />
<br />
Trample is worse than Chaos Claw IMO, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, never thought about only one mob acting this way, I just assumed if one did it, they all did.   The next time I'm in there I'll check out multiple mobs just because I'm curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frodlin, can mob innate procs happen on misses?  I thought it's only weapon procs that require a hit.<br />
<br />
I think Phantron's on the right track when he points out that a small number of mobs cast Chaos Claws, while the rest of the mobs proc it.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it was put in the game as a counter to the slow line, slow doesnt affect how often a mob hits you with claws.<br />
Slow should not need to be &quot;countered&quot; by this, because as we all know from the Arena and Bunker, haste/slow doesn't change proc rate per minute.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen, Cripple has a huge effect on the rate of the proc of Chaos Claws.</div></div><hr />

Its probably the #1 thing I dont like about GoD (but there are alot of things to like such is life).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other way around Sass.  Think of the snake.  He's gotta bite you to poison you, can't poison you if he misses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sass, mob innate procs are the only procs that require a hit to process. All other procs can fire on a miss, including mob-wielded proccing weapons. <br />
<br />
Chaos claws just blows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can't, thats why evasive used to own tanking Sont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even on a spell with a recast of 0 (like Primal Insect AE before it was changed to a proc), it doesn't go off at arbitrarily fast speed.  I suspect this is because the server only looks at every mob in a discrete interval.  The Noc in question's frequency of Chaos Claw seems to be comparable to how often Primal Insect AEd so I'd think this is one of the few mob that does cast Chaos Claws.  Realistically, I think someone just accidentally put Chaos Claw as innate instead of a proc when coding the Noc in question in Vxed, like how Primal Insect's AE was coded to be innate instead of a proc.</div></div><hr />

Yah wish ALL nocs were like that one tho.....as a spell he spends 100% of this time just casting that spell and not beating on ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty sure it's instant cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think mobs have to stop to cast even if it's instant cast.  For example Ukun Chains and Mastruq Bellow are all instant cast too but from what I can tell Ukun/Mastruq types always lag behind on a pull because they stop for a moment to cast an instant cast spell.  It could be just the animation playing a trick on my mind though.</div></div><hr />
