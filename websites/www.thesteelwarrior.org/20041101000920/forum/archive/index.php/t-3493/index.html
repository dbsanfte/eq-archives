<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>muskratt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Starting a warrior and have about 15k want to get some good gear that will last a very long time. He will be an orge and RZ deity. Thanks for help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Is Guts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Startin aint the same as playin .... <br />

Was a question before about why people play a warrior ... I honesty couldnt answer it. <br />
<br />
But check my Magelo for ideas.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Amazingly, 15k doesn't twink a warrior very far, especially if you're looking for gear that will last a very long time (ie post 50).  Therefore, you should separate your gearing into pre-50 and post-50 twinkage.<br />
<br />
Pre-50, stuff like Crustacean Shell, Acrylia Plate, and Cobalt are all very viable.  Add inexpensive weapons like a Lamentation, Centi SS, and others with a low delay and a ratio around 2, and you're set.  SCHW is a popular haste item, and would easily last you to 50.  And of course, more stuff you can get with both HP and no level restrictions, the better.<br />
<br />
Post 50, your 15k won't even begin to make a dent in what you could buy.  Fierce Heraldric is of course a good option, but you will only be able to afford a few pieces before your twink fund is exhausted.  But worry about post 50 gear once you're there.</div></div><hr />
