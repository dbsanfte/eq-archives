<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you want to play all determins what you want from the game.<br />
<br />
If you want a class that main's utility is to tank and be beat on then warriors has it made.  We have been given a lot of upgrades recently and IMO our class has been improved tremendously.<br />
<br />
However, If you want to play a class with snare/dmg spells etc then a warrior class would not be something I suggest for you.<br />
<br />
It is really hard for a character to be assigned to you as you are the only one who knows what you want out of EQ.<br />
<br />
I personally have played my warrior for 4 1/2 years and I love her now and I love her when I made her.  The game changes over time but the basic principle stays the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jablek</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i first started the game as a druid. then moved over to a shaman. so im getting kinda tired of the priest class so i thought id try out some melee class so i can get up and start doing some damage in teh face :). i have a 13 ROG that i might play and a 16-17 SK fully geared that i could give the gear to a new warrior and try him out and see how he is. seems like warriors finally got some loving so im gonna try it out and have some fun with him, :)...btw ive been reading up on past race threads and ive decided on either a gnome or halfling....either one will be RZ. i just dont know which one. any suggestions on the shorties please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the race really doesn't matter in the higher end game as I have found out.  I made a Wood Elf warrior and at this point having no problem keeping up with those in my radius.  So in the question on which you should play I always say you should play what you enjoy.  I personally love gnomes but halflings are great as well.<br />
<br />
Warriors really have been balanced compared to how we were when PoP first came out.  We have been given alot of tools to help us with the factors we really need. But as this game changes a differant classes will be hit with the nerf stick.  You just play the best you can with what you are given.   But overall we are all here or atleast came here to have fun =) <br />
<br />
All the tools you need to become a great warrior you can find in search tools on the boards.  Good Luck and I hope you enjoy your warrior!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jablek</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the quick replies :). well i did want to make a human, but the being blind thing kinda sucks and i dont know if i want to buy an item just to have infravision though i think humans look pretty dark cool in armor. but i do like the halflings and gnomes or the fact that they wont need shrink and they have infravision already :). but thanks again for the replies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since they fixed the gamma problems, lack of night vision isn't that big a deal anymore.  I used to absolutely have to wear an infravision ring to be able to see at all in the dark (sundown=pitch black). Now it's not so bad.  It's still noticeable, but it's nowhere near the crippling problem it used to be.  I can tell it when the sun goes down, but I can still see.<br />
<br />
I haven't worn my glowing stone band in years, I just carry it around for sentimental purposes.  I worked my ass off to camp the damned thing. :)<br />
Play what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your highest character is L54, so you're not in the higher end game where starting race doesn't really matter.  Given that fact, don't take a human as your tank class.  If you want to be a warrior, consider a barbarian or a fatty.  Barb has a lower (or nonexistent?) exp penalty than the fatties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't notice your main's level when I looked at this earlier.  If you're not gonna be heavily twinked, and may not have access to really high level gear, I'd definitely play a large race.  I love being a barbarian, but faction isn't as big of a problem as it once was, so if I had it to do over I might play a troll or ogre.  All 3 have good starting stats (particularly stamina),  racial slam, which is a really nice benefit, ogres are immune to front arc stuns (very nice), and at low levels trolls are hard to beat for regen.  But again, play what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jablek</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the replies all. but im not playing a big race...shamans already an ogre, lol. id still go with human/gnome/or halfling :) but i think humans look awesome fully decked out :) and its all about looks, right? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like iksar decked out in plate gear... at least I did when I used an illusion iksar potion.  :p <br />
<br />
I have a human warrior.  I should have been a barbarian.  Take barb.  They're a bit big, but they're not fatties and starting stats will matter for you.</div></div><hr />
