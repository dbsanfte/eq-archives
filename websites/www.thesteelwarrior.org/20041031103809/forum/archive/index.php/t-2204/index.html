<br />
<br />
hey guys, havent been postin much, as i havent been warrioring much, i got a bit discouraged, not getting groups and such, and slipped off in to alt land. But then the greatest thing happened, my 63war friend in guild was talking about selling his wavecrasher cuz he had other things better (Gomdurig/copper hammer o' striking) and i was just being goofy saying id give him my frostbringer, my savage stone axe, and all the money i make in the next 3 weeks, and to my shocking surprise he said sure why not, toold my axes and said 2k when i get the chance and we can call it even, (Thats about 6k max in trades for a 12k item on my server) so that gave me instant moral boost and all so i started playing<br />
<br />
well i then met a married couple (irl) that each dual box, and i love grouping with em, and asked to meet the next day, and the next etc, we have been regularly grouping like everyday now, ive been lvling like 9 hours a night since i dont gotta put up LFG<br />
<br />
then it gets even better, im in the bazaar and i see this guy say &quot;Greatstaff of Thunder 10k obo&quot; and im like what the hell its worth a shot and offer him my WC for it, he replies with &quot;*shrug* why not&quot; so i threw in my snare whip just cuz i was so happy, then that night i put in 3 yellows from 7 hours in seb, then caught my new frequent group and put in 9 hours in PoJ, dinged 55 and threw up the GSoT, its so freaking awesome.<br />
<br />
--------------End of anecdote---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
So now my question, what do i need to do about armor, i cant seem to ever rally my guild for raids, so i need stuff i can do on pickup raids or single groups heres a magelo, i welcome anything u guys can think of, ur always right, and this GSoT freaking owns, <br />
<br />
currently thinking of getting my draconic pauldrons, and thats about the end of my list, <br />
<br />
magelo is down right now, and my profile is old<br />
<br />
heres a basic run down<br />
<br />
BP, 1 wrist, legs, are enchanted dwarven plate<br />
<br />
boots and arms are indicolite<br />
<br />
helm is a skull shaped barbute<br />
<br />
thats my only real decent stuff, my jewelry is set though for now<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont expect any real replies til i get a magelo up, ill pose a edit when i wake up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Draconic Pauldrons are real nice for the effort required to get them.  While you're there you could try for a Bracer of Benevolence too (check the Keep for many threads on how to do this quest.)<br />
<br />
For the Helm you can pick up a helmet of the Raldukan pretty cheap these days, buy a vial of dye aswell unless you want to have a pink hat. (26AC 35HPs 4sta)<br />
<br />
Kylong Shinguards from Veksar are nice and dropping in price quickly.  Or you could try taking your new group of friends there to camp them. (35AC 45HPs 6sta)<br />
<br />
Arms and boots I'd look for the new cultural, good AC and good HPs for both slots there.<br />
<br />
Having a regular group that you can log in to is in my opinion the best thing to happen to anyone in EQ.  Maybe try taking your group to a few new spots where some nice gear could drop for all of you.  Veksar has alot of lewt in it that could be upgrades for you and theres some nice weapons dropping in the revamped droga (you wont have to look far to find threads on those).</div></div><hr />
