I am level 65 trying to solo some GOD mobs to farm the facelet gem of might.  I am sure there are over 50 items that would help you solo better, but I would like feedback on the ESSENSIAL ones that makes immediate impact.<br />
<br />
Thign soming in mind is <br />
<br />
ornate gloves(self haste)<br />
ornage bp(self buff)<br />
bandages(self heal)<br />
maybe fungi tunic(self regen)<br />
cobalt bp(self heal)</div></div><hr />

a druid.<br />

They can port you, buff you, heal you, and evac you when things go wrong.<br />

Jokes aside --- I have had no success solo-ing. Are you actually solo-ing successfully?</div></div><hr />

Good DS potions should help out a lot too, though not quite as effective once the truncheon procs.</div></div><hr />

Any other stacking ds clickies (tunare belt, dain ring, others). Lifetap augs on a high dps weapon. Random regen items help a bunch too, and the new healing will disc helps a ton. Dress for all ac, let hp go to the wind, you're not gonna be getting a CH anytime soon.<br />
<br />
ToD is good if you're fighting for a long time, but my luck is always that it procs way too late. I certainly can't handle solo'ing stuff like BoT giants, ToD or not. For warriors to solo, stuff has to be darn near trivial, so I prefer to load up the ds's so i can just plow through lots of 'em at a time. ToD &gt; all for cleric duo tho.</div></div><hr />

I do normally slow them first with a ToD. Ornate gloves are essential. A ToD is essential. A snare whip can be if the mobs run. Buffs aren't other than virtue, so no on the ornate BP (though it DOES help). A clicky BP would be ok, but with the regen and bandaging changes, I'd suggest just sitting and bandaging. A fungi + any other regen items would be useful if bandaging, but probably not essential. Any added DS is always worth it. I'd suggest an incarndine BP or cobalt leggings for invis. SoW potions are pretty usefull too.</div></div><hr />

Bandaids + Fungi &gt; Invigorate.<br />
<br />
If I was still playing and had the urge to solo, I'd find the best lifetap weapons I could find (Bloodpoints if nothing else), aug them with lifetap procs and use those after I slowed stuff.  You're not gonna lose THAT much DPS, and your downtime should be shortened considerably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Well, with DW Bloodpoints augmented with the 75hp lifetap with WA5 would generate approximately 700hp in healing per minute and about 12 DPS from procs. That may make up for the DPS lost, but not likely in PoP or GoD. Mobs simply have too much damage output; in my opinion, it's better to end the fight quickly rather than prolong it even with the added healing. With the quality of bonus stats (ac and hp) on most weapons now as well, I think that dual BPs will just lose out anymore on non-trivial content. It definitely depends on your current setup, however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh that's right, you're not.  You're always going to be soloing the lowest level shit that moves your bar because anything else is going to eat you alive.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
From the original post. I actually have no idea if the GoD mobs that drop it are trivial or not; I saw that they were indeed in GoD and responded as I saw fit. I solo in PoJustice, on the second set of robed guys. I doubt using dual bloodpoints augmented with the highest lifetaps would be worth the DPS lost from most DPS weapon setups, though I could be wrong. For example, would a WMBS kill the mob enough faster than the dual BPs to prevent more damage than the BPs healed? I'm not sure, it could be worth looking into if anyone really cares.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use:<br />
Ornate BP buff(300HP)<br />
Cloak of Thorns buff (4HP DS)<br />
Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring (8HP DS)<br />
Truncheon of Doom(50 percent slow)<br />
Silken Whip of Ensnaring(snare)<br />
Orb of the Sky(35dd, the stun don't freakin land)<br />
Ornate Guants buff(30% haste)<br />
<br />
Get the mob or mobs(as often times you will get 2) slowed, then snare em, then beat the snot out of them with Sword of Ssra(pretty good soloing weapon). Once yer done, sit on yer ass and regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a lot of blue mobs out there that are total wimps.  Some of them are in hotspot zones and provide more than 1% per kill.  Since getting the Sword of Ssraezsha I've found my ability to mess around solo much improved.  For example, in Sebilis a dark blue frog only does 500-1000 total damage on me, while I'm lifetapping back at least 500 points per fight.  I can kill them almost nonstop at 1%/kill with my modest gear.  That's a low ZEM zone, POJ or Nadox or Qinimi will be more profitable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bedan</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with others that a ToD and a 15 regen chest slot item are key. I wear the fungi while fighting and find that I can fight more mobs between bandaging breaks. Having a max'd bandaging skill is very handy. I even went ahead and spent three aa's on first aid and never regreted it. With max bandaging skill and a +10 skill mod item I am able to heal 92 hp per attempt. You get 5, almost 6, attempts per minute. Way down the road I will spend more AA's on improving my bandaging skill and should eventually hit 150+ hp healed per attampt. Limited charge clicky snare items are handy for spliting mobs (assumes you are camping a zone line). Rune procing weapons are very good for soloing as well. Crunch the numbers and you will see some surprising mitigation.  The mines in the Grimling Forest, the Deep and now Griegs have been favorite solo spots for me as I have leveled. Breaking the spawn at the zone line in Griegs is a little tricky but once done your set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a rogue, I've cleared most of the camp solo before repops. I've seen my warrior friend do the same (in considerably lesser gear than my own). For the named, I use auto-dodge discipline, and an offensive disc (I open with strike disc too, but warriors don't get that luxury). An elemental level warrior should be able to solo him np. The lesser your gear though, the more tricks you'll need. Things like ornate gloves and self ds are important.</div></div><hr />

I can even solo the stuff near the barindu entrance without blowing a disc (maybe healing will afterwards to help heal)...not one after another, of course, but it's doable (I'm 10.5k 2kac in raid buffs)<br />
<br />
My solo setup:<br />
<br />
Ornate BP (300hp 30ac 30MR clicky)<br />
Ornate Gloves (30% clicky haste)<br />
SEWS (awesome for soloing, specially farming...)<br />
Coldain Ring (I have 8th, 10th is better)<br />
Aura of Battle clicky from Cazic shoulders (stacks with worn regen / atk caps)<br />
PoAir shoulders (10ds clicky)<br />
Truncheon of Doom (obvious reasons)<br />
<br />
Also, try to get items with a worn DS -- KT ranged orb, ldon hard earring from tak, etc.</div></div><hr />
