<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To settle something for me.  I friend of mine has the two weapons in the top pic.<br />
<br />
I have the two weapons in the bottom pic.  While my bud has no complaints about his weapons and tells me he can hold agro all day long, which I believe.<br />
<br />
A third person in my guild disagree's and says it's best to use my weapon set up and anger 3 the GBoS and OSoW instead of the LDON purchased weapons.<br />
<br />
So, since I respect both of them and I cannot decide 100% which is the best avenue to go I figured I would ask you all to lend a hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Friends weapons, augmented.<br />

<br />
<br />
My weapons, which I had planned to put anger 3's in each of until this came up.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Ok so lets hear it where are you guys at on this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks as usual :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have your set up, the GBoS with Anger 3, and the OSoW with Anger 2.  they hold very good agro.  depending on procs and who i am grouped with, they are few times when agro is lost, and if it is, it is gained back quickly. <br />
<br />
imo, the innate procs from the weapons you have, combined with anger 3, if that is the way you are going, makes them better agro weapons than the 2 with just anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think the difference between the two setups is that big a deal. It's like trying to decide which quarterback you'd rather have on your team ... Peyton Manning or Tom Brady.<br />
<br />
At that point, the difference is too marginal to matter.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, I have a better analogy ... I said this to a guildmate of mine the other day when he was asking a similar question ...<br />
<br />
It's like trying to debate which kind of chocolate is better, when in the end, chocolate tastes pretty damn good no matter which kind you eat.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: Your setup will do just fine with Anger augs. Your friend's setup also is going to kick ass. Your friend's setup just costs a lot more LDoN points is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">His setup is better for dps and decent for aggro (although why he got the dagger rather than that LDoN 1hb I can't figure out).  Your setup is ok for dps and much better for aggro (once you throw on a couple procs).  Also, the huge amount of LDoN points that he is spending on those weapons could be better used for armor, thus making your setup more cost-effective.  Aggro-wise, anytime that you can put 2 aggro procs on a weapon, it always trumps 1 aggro proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once you put anger 3 on your setup; you will have 4 innate procs compared to his two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The LDoN weapons are good but your setup will be better for aggro since you'll have 4 procs, pretty much what everyone else says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Obsidian Scimitar of War looks cooler.  Go with it.  =)<br />
<br />
(Errr, ok, you mean you asked a serious question?  Gah, now you gotta make me think.  Okies, hehe, here we go!  Put an AngerIII aug on your current GBoS/OSoW combo and you'll be golden.  With that combo, you should outagro him most any day of the week.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually kept the Gbos/Osow combo.  Today I purchased anger 3 and 2 and put them in.  Needless to say, for experience groups, LDON, tanking in BoT towers and GoD thats all the agro I need.<br />
<br />
Between the 2 anger augments I proc like mad and have more agro then I would have ever imagined.  I was expecting some improvement, like most things SoE puts in.  But my god, with 305 dex those things fire like machine guns.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for the input.<br />
<br />
Note: Only have the 1 anger 3 on my magelo since I logged and didnt update it.  Was a good day also got my first +12hp augment (lol its the little things).</div></div><hr />
