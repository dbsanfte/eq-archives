I have been up there 6 times now and killed him 5 times and no sword?  Am I doing something wrong for him no to have his sword?  And if anyone has a spiroc wingblade in their bank that they are not using on the Tunare server let me know cause I would like to see about MQing it since it is my last piece for my epic.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

Generally you should plan to stay on that island for 10 spawns or so.  I too saw long dry stretches like you did.  I think our first farming trip there went like this:<br />
<br />
No sword<br />
No sword<br />
Sword<br />
No sword x 6<br />
Sword<br />
No sword<br />
Sword</div></div><hr />

I think we might have had a slightly worse than 1 in 3 drop rate, but it was close to that.  What we did was spend the first night getting up to the spiroc island and camped all the blades that were needed, then camped out there.  The next night we went up to get all of the magicians their drop.  Of course things have changed now that you can bank the keys.  You can make a quick run to any island now if everyone has their keys already.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the exact sequence needed for the kills, but you did know that you can endlessly respawn the guy that can drop the blade right?  If not, read up on it and just keep repeating that process until you get all of the blades that you need.  3-6 kills and you should have your blade.</div></div><hr />

We stayed for many hours and lots of death touches :D Probably killed the lord ~40 times to get enough blades.</div></div><hr />
