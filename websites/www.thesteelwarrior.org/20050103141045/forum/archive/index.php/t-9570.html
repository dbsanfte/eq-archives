<br />
However I still am going to work on my AAs after and need some advice on where I should be putting my AAs next.  <br />
<br />
Please look at my magelo and let me know where you think I could possibly put oh say the next 100 lol.  Seriously any Help on my next few AAs would help.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestions:<br />
Finish out Planer Power, Stalwart Endurance, Weapon Affinity and then do Reflexive Mastery and Defensive instincts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Kiya's AA route and then I'd suggest moving the Great Blade of Storms to mainhand and the Sparkling Shortsword to the offhand. The 2 procs and the added procrate of the GBoS in mainhand should more than make up for the +4 damage difference in ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bash</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help really do appreciate it.  <br />
<br />
As for the swords that is how I have them just being lazy and didnt have them changed yet.  I had the anger III on the one in main hand first and then got the other sword that is why it was main handed.  Now that both are anger III augs I did switch them and will fix magelo to reflect hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree, the first 2 ranks of sturdiness arent too bad. i'd probably do 2 ranks before i finish PP and stalwart. after that it starts to become a real trial to do each rank of sturdiness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Souldier</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The suggestions above are good but a little more info would help.  Do you have trouble with aggro? If so and you are the MT for raids then get those WA aa's stat. If your aggro is fine but the clerics are having trouble keeping you up then I would go Reflexive Mastery and Defensive instincts first then go back and finish up PP, 1 maybe 2 levels of sturdiness and then chaotic potential.<br />
<br />
Just take into perspective where you are weakest and work on those aa's first.<br />
<br />
edit: If you aren't maxing out on stats with buffs then don't worry about doing chaotic potential and do something else like ferocity, slippery attacks or more sturdiness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defensive instincts first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bash</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok<br />
now this may sound dumb but what is slippery attacks.  Maybe Im just missing it but dont see it on my list of purchesable AAs.  Unless your talking about Reflexive Mastery.<br />
<br />
Things have changed since original post I am now lvl 70 and again working on AAs.  Finished off PP and am working towards first thing sturdiness and then RM or DI.<br />
I am low on AC and Hps but working them up I am feeling the pains the most in MPG and I know I cant tank RS yet.  Not effectively anyway so working on that.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Next 100 AA ....<br />
<br />
25 Sturdiness<br />
25 Reflexive Mastery<br />
25 Defensive Instincts<br />
20 Weapon Affinity<br />
Then finish Stalwart Endurance.<br />
<br />
After that it gets kinda hairy as to whats best etc, but those are AA's you won't regret having imo.</div></div><hr />
