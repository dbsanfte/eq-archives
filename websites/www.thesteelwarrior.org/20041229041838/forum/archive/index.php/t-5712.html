<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wubba Wubba</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the core problems in a mmorpg like EQ is the constant influx of new stuff into the economy.  Every X days a new Blade of Carnage enters the economy, and it stays there permanently- unless there is a system to suck items out.<br />
<br />
One analogy designers use is of a bathtub.  You have a faucet which is the flow of new items in and a drain to suck items out.  Unless the flow in is as fast as the flow out, your water level in the tub will rise.  Items become too common, and some become valueless.<br />
<br />
The lack of any drains for equipment in the EQ economy leads to ridiculous situations like the Greatstaff of Thunder going for 100pp or the War Marshall's Bladed Staff going for 800pp.  These are items that 3/4 expansions ago would have been considered godlike.  But because there is a constant flow in of these items, and only a small and constant base of characters to use them, their value is zero.<br />
<br />
People groaning and passing when a GSoT drops is a design failure on Sony's part.  The same camp drops an ornate bracer mold worth 50k or a weapon worth 100pp.<br />
<br />
Sony had a great opportunity with the new tribute system to fix this.  A tribute system would provide a drain for too common drops and a minimum price for items- &quot;Should I get 2kp in bazaar for the weapon or 3kp tribute points?&quot;  <br />
<br />
The initial implementation incorrectly priced weapons, such as 27k tribute for GSoT, but it had the right spirit- people were turning in items for points.  The recent patch has destroyed that aspect of the tribute system.  No one will turn in items at their current tribute prices:<br />
<br />
-GSoT 800 tribute<br />
-weighty polearm 50 tribute<br />
-mace of the fallen crusader 50 tribute<br />
<br />
for some of the items that I think are seriously undervalued.  With too low tribute values for items, tribute becomes a plat system, not an item drain.<br />
<br />
The design idea should have been:<br />
<br />
-casino to drain plat<br />
-tribute to drain items<br />
<br />
But too low tribute values will lead to a worthless and unused tribute system.<br />

It won't be happening with near the frequency as before, but it still is a sink. Would you sell a GSoT for 100pp to a noob or just feed it to the tribute machine? Would you destroy a Weighty Polearm, or feed it? I think that this will remove some of the excess tradables, perhaps while still giving some value to the tribute points.</div></div><hr />

Yea you can downgrade to the lowest tier to slow the &quot;Waste&quot; of your hard earned points but we SHOULD be able to completely turn them off without losing them thus having to go back to the TM to re-aquire the benefits.  It's friggin lame. Once again they have the right idea but completely screw it up with one stupid &quot;Gotcha&quot;. Typical...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems they are taking the values from the avg price in the bazaar. Almost every item i tryed was almost the saem value in tribute points as plat. Now to find the items they missed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stuff like acrylia stud masks (decent item but dirt cheap from tradeskilling skillups) have been dropped to trivial pp values (20 or so, far less than material cost) but items with similar cost to manufacture (say a acrylia stud bracer) are worth a few hundred.  <br />
<br />
I hope they aren't trying to be &quot;clever&quot; with this by tying it to some in-game metrics, as what a few developer people consider clever won't stand up to the combined ingenuity of a few dozen thousand gamers... they can't even get tradeskill sellback prices right for pete's sake.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The points are still messed up.  Some stuff from normal LDoN is still worth 25k while other stuff is worth 100.<br />
<br />
The original cost was fine.  Even if you have 1 million tribute points, if you use them up at 500/hour (and you will have that many tributes running if you have 1 million), that figures out to be 2000 hours.  Now that sounds like a lot, but that's under 100 days played, and most people have over 100 days played.  Not to mention high amount of favor points is pretty much a one time thing.  You're simply not going to find another 10 GSoTs for sale at 100 pp each anymore.<br />
<br />
The whole point of the tribute system was that you can't turn it on whenver you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabon Ssteel</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tribute items after patch are now max around a 1 to 5 plat to tribute factor ...i currently have ac buff max vengeance x max and hps max lvl this costs 101 per 10 mins ... 606 in a hour or if you play like 4 hours a day 2424 ...if you play 20 days a month 4 hours per day .. 48480 tribut points per month used .. that if you dont run to tribute master all the time to turn them on if you turn them off while lfg ... 48480 equal to like 10k platin per month unless you find better ratio items which i couldn so far ...<br />
and who would pay 10k pp per month ? to keep up tribute  ? <br />
<br />
if you play 10 hours a day 30 days per month and have 5 buffs lets say 150 tribut per 10 mins ...it costs 270k tribut a month which equals to 54k pp in items spent if you find such items :) or 270k in pp spent .<br />
<br />
hmm i dont think i gonna even look at tribut for along time if it is so expensive to keep it up as it is now . a item should be at least 50 x worth tribut points then pps it costs or this system is way too expensive to use it . but even then you spend 1k pp per month or 5400pp in the second example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... or you could just go with +150hp for a cost of 15/10 minutes, or 90/hour. So turning in one GSoT for 840 points gets ya 9hrs 20 minutes of +150hp. With 11000 points total, I have enough for around 1200 hours of extra hp, which is definitely worth it imo. I do think they toned down the ldon/pop drops a little too far though... with glacierbone hammers and weighty polearms only worth 50 points of tribute, they will continue to flood the market, which is not what SOE was aiming for. Currently on the nameless, GSoT average price is around 900-1000pp, which is still really low for such a great weapon, but at least it's better than the 30-50pp they used to be worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have more tribute points it's just natural to them up faster.  Why would you have a measly one 150 HP buff if you have 1 million (no longer possible, granted) favor points sitting in the bank?<br />
<br />
I really don't see what's wrong with GSoT being 27K, or Glacierbone 10K.  With GoD out LDoN really isn't that popular anyway (certainly the high end people have moved on), and it's not like there's this huge influx of LDoN or otherwise loot in the market.  The loot builtup that people took advantage of was because no one ever managed to sell a GSoT or a Glacierbone... which is exactly what the tribute system is trying to correct.  At 840 favor points, it might still be worthwhile to buy a GSoT at 50pp but I doubt you'll find any at 50pp (at least not for a while), and nor should GSoT be that cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to look at it from Sony's point of view.<br />
<br />
Making the GSoT easy to get makes the game easier to program and balance since they can now assume that at level 56, a warrior will at least have a GSoT.  One of the things that makes EQ fun is to get a really nice item so it's good for the players too.<br />
<br />
Sony has bitten off more than it can chew with the Tribute system.  Balancing it would require an unbelievable amount of man-hours and players will exploit any imbalance which negatively effects the game.  Their only real options I can think of are:<br />
<br />
1. Use merchant prices.<br />
2. Give up and figure on everyone having unlimited Favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wubba Wubba</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to disagree that the tribute system is impossible to balance.  It requires answering one question- &quot;What is this system for?&quot;  For my mind it would have a simple answer- &quot;To soak up the inflow of high end gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once you make this decision, balancing is pretty easy:<br />
<br />
1.  Tradeskill gear should be worth very little.  People can generate this stuff on demand, and the whole point here is to suck stuff up, not generate more.<br />
<br />
2.  Old content stuff should be worth very little.  Who cares if there are 50 Maces of the Shadowed Soul floating about, people only farm City of Mist while powerleveling their alts.  Make MoSS worth 100-200 tribute, and people will keep trashing them.<br />
<br />
3.  Equipment that your average level 55+ character would consider wearing should be worth the most tribute.  PoP drops and level 65 LDoN drops should be worth real tribute.  Enough that people will use the system, and that it will keep the prices of the droppable top-end gear high.  <br />
<br />
Example: Make the GSoT worth 3-5k tribute.  This will keep prices of a damn nice piece of gear out of the trash level.  And it will make people happy when they see one drop in BoT.<br />
<br />
Example:  Make those too-common knight PoP weapons worth 2-4k.  There is no way a character should be able to pick up a 1h weapon with almost a 1-1 ratio for 50pp in bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see anything wrong even with the existing point values on LDoN items like Glacierbone Hammer being 10K (though Planar Lance being 20K might be a bit too high).  No one is diligent enough to run back to Tribute Master to turn things off so points will get used up, sooner or later.  So why not be generous?  It helps getting rid of items even faster (because high tribute value gives people to sacrifice items instead of hoarding) which can only be good for the economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But why is it important that people be pleased when a GSoT drops?  If there are other desireable drops from the same mob, the mob will be killed, that's the goal.<br />
<br />
Why is it important for all the old garbage like the MoSS be drestoryed?  We are limited by bank space.  If someone is taking the time moving their MoSS onto a long-term storage bot then great, that's time they spent playing the game and it doesn't hurt anyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wubba Wubba</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every week, several hundred Architect's BPs enter the game.  I'm guessing that EQ generates fewer new level 60+ characters every week.  So the price of Architect's BPs has to fall over time.  <br />
<br />
How low in price are Architect's BPs now?  Well, wait one week, and they will be cheaper.  Wait long enough, and Architect's BPs will essentially be worthless (bazaar price 100pp).  This will happen to every piece of equipment that drops off content that people are still hunting- unless the equipment is rare and desired like a BoC.<br />
<br />
I would argue that it is undesirable to have almost every piece of droppable gear become valueless over time.  You need a system to soak up items that are currently generated- so make that the tribute system.  And I would also argue that the game is more fun if we have the system soak up items at a price that people still get excited about- GSoT worth 3k instead of 800.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, it does all depend on the purpose of the system, and from where I stand it seems like Sony is having a conflict over what this tribute thing is supposed to do.<br />
<br />
I mean, I can't imagine that the sole purpose of it was to give players a boost in power... they know that mudflation isn't helped by such things.  Thus, it should be about getting items out of the bazaar and removing them from the world altogether... seems pretty clear to me that this should be the ultimate goal.<br />
<br />
What I find funny about it, though, is that the high-end people need tribute far less than the rest of us.  For instance, the Vengeance and Flowing Thought tributes don't give anything once you have those things maxxed with items.  Likewise, Haste and Focus effects don't stack with existing worn items at all... it just takes the best.  So, a warrior with maxxed Vengeance and Haste will only feel compelled to spend a fraction of what a lower-levelled warrior would spend.<br />
<br />
Of course, the other side of the coin is that these &quot;uber&quot; players don't see nearly the same benefit from the new system as those of us who don't have these things maxxed.<br />
<br />
So, what happens?  Ubers, who are generating a lot of these high-end droppable items, don't need the points nearly as much as lower levelled folks.  Thus, they stick them on their bazaar mule just like before, except now us lower folks have more of a reason to buy them... either to use or to hand in for points.<br />
<br />
It's a clever system, but I don't think Sony has done a good enough job of determining its true purpose... it's more like an experiment.<br />
<br />
EDIT: One thought did just occur to me... this *does* allow uber players to swap out, say, one or two vengeance items for something else that has more ac/hps, while maintaining the same Vengeance total.  That's a good benefit, for sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">speaking of missed opportunities, sony had the opportunity to remove &quot;displeasing&quot; items from the game altogether with this system. we know sony always regretted the mannastone and later the fungi tunic. both have tribute values far lower than their typical bazaar price so absolutely none of these will be &quot;eliminated from the system&quot;. and im sort of surprised in a way because i thought they really didnt like these things too much. i mean .. why did they nerf the fungi with ldon unless they didnt like them. --what nerf you say? the one where it has no aug slot--<br />
but they gave them inordinately low tribute values as if to say &quot;thats what i think of you fungi and mannastone!&quot; and all it does is cause people never to donate them into oblivion. come to think of it the deletion of the aug slot from the fungi only encourages people to donate them to their newbie alts.. again the very thing you would have THOUGHT sony would be trying to keep us from doing. /boggle<br />
<br />
p.s. in my calculations i had assumed nobody but nobody would donate plat for tribute but only donate items with a typical ratio of 5:1.<br />
<br />
since that time im coming to the conclusion that any items worth more than 2:1 will likely have their bazaar prices driven up rapidly as people deplet these to use them as tribute. so 2:1 is probably a fairer ratio and the cost per year of that haste/ac is going rapidly in the direction of 100k again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is a suggestion for an uber guildy MT on a limited cash budget.<br />
<br />
bind near your tribute master (soulbinder or whatever).<br />
<br />
20 minutes before the big big baddy that you are going to tank ask someone to duel you and kill you.<br />
<br />
run to your tribute master and turn on all those goodies.<br />
<br />
get your rez. apologize to your groupies that you have to be rebuffed.<br />
<br />
tank your mob.<br />
<br />
turn off your tributes.<br />
<br />
honestly since many of the guild leaders on my server hoard millions of plat in cash i would think ANY good guild would pay the cost of a MT's disciplines just like they pay the clerics for their peridots. and for all i know they may do this. i never asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right, things like Fungi and Manastone should have HUGE Tribute values.<br />
<br />
The thing is, that there was no time to think.  The idea was originally a brain fart on their end, and needed a nerf that didn't piss anyone off, FAST.  Thus, they could not take the time to weigh the merits of each item and how much Tribute it was worth.</div></div><hr />
