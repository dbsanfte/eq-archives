But its not a terribly hard quest, so doing it again wouldn't be that hard if you run out of charges. Plus, its a quest in a series and the 3rd one is infinite charges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is definately not rechargable... after being told it was, I checked all the mana batteries on the market and none worked :confused:  Afteward someone told me that they were rechargable, but that it was probably nerfed.  not sure if that's a rumor or any truth, but it was told to meh.</div></div><hr />

It is nice to have for those situations where youre stuck somewhere, or just really dont wanna walk home. Its not terribly hard (damn those Tri Plated Metal Casings) and worth having. Plus if you are capable the second and third have really nice stats for a neck item.</div></div><hr />

0 AC, imho this whole quest is pretty much worthless to a warrior.<br />
<br />
All of the necklaces require a 100pp shaman potion as a consumable component.  Totally rediculous.<br />
<br />
If you want the ability to gate, go spend 200pp a click on a 10 charge gate to wherever potions and dont bother with the hassle of this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or spend 50-70pp and 2 hours on getting your pottery up to 122, and then parts for the thurg potions are easily camped in CC or Velks</div></div><hr />

Just finished my 1st and 2nd Talismans.  Working on the final one, but not too quickly as I don't need to, since I still got 19 charges left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osyris</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The worker sledgemallet is awesome and very easy to get if you can get your hands on  some puppet stings (those still drop?) But you'll need someone to debuff the capt for the charm to stick.<br />
  I'd also recommend carrying a gate potion in case you get stuck in a high level zone. Attacking something that hits for 800+ and praying that your hammer procs before you die isn't a very good plan. :p <br />
<br />
  If you want to research the quest, just go to AllaKhazam's, then to item search, then just type in &quot;The Binden Concerrentia&quot; and it'll have links on the left that you can click on to research any of  the three quests.<br />

Especially since my Shambot makes them. They arent cheap though, actually costs 252 plat a piece to make, without failures, and what really irked me is like the spell, the gate can go unstable and leave ya sitting there while still using a dose of the potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tachyr</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cost for the gate when using the bind talisman is 50:ish pp / gate since the combined herbs gives you two potions / combine.</div></div><hr />
