<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The most important thing i can think of for warriors currently is upgrading the use of shield.  There is simply too much lost aggro because furious bash is useless.  Aside from that the rest of the class is ok currently.  The balance between warriors and knights is pretty much right on regardless of what those retards say on the knight boards.  Warriors are a fairly fun class to play.  I enjoy it because im main tank and also raid leader so there is an additional challenge.  One other thing i would like to see is a new ability in OoW.  Not just an upgrade to ancient chaotic cry, but something that is completely new.  Possibly a new disc that doesnt completely suck..see healing will and spirit of rage.  I would also like to see endurance conservation items and items that up regen similar to ft.  Standing and sitting regen is identical at 33 a tic with heightened endurance 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I totally agree with Battleblade on this.  Shields could be a lot more effective if they were redesigned.  <br />
<br />
The Furious Bash effect should be a 10% worn agro mod (proc and dps) per level (ie FB 2 is 20%, FB 5 is 50%, etc.) to compensate for our loss of our off hand weapon when we use a shield.  <br />
<br />
The extra bash damage component would help to offset our loss of DPS for not using a 2h weapon.  This would be nice if you are not the MA in situations where high damage ripostes and AE rampage is a significant factor and the extra AC would be helpful.<br />
<br />
If the stun component fired every bash, it would be a little overpowered since you can bash a lot more than 3 to 4 times a minute (what a double stun/A3 auged off hand weapon would give on average) so making the stun into a regular proc on the shield activated by bashing is a good idea. <br />
<br />
I would also like to see some kind of Furious Bash augment  to put on existing shields.  This would be useful to add to or upgrade the FB level for extra agro (similar to the anger 3 idea) but especially to help warriors that do not have access to the mobs that drop shields with more than FB2 on them.  As an alternative, making the shield able to accept Anger 3 or any other weapon augment and fire on bashes would be nice.<br />
<br />
It has also been mentioned that an AA to allow wearing a shield and dual wielding might be a good thing.  This would be a little overpowered but perhaps if the shield stats were reduced by half when equiped with a 2 hander, it might be doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">let soe know that we want to keep our mitigation advantage small as it is over knights. so that if soe does decide to increase knight mitigation per their list we are not nerfed in absentia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't think you should be able to do as much damage with a sheild as dual wielding/2hander.  It makes no sense.  I think all three options should have their trade-offs or everyone will just use one option all the time and the others become useless.<br />
<br />
The options now are:<br />
<br />
Dual Wield...good dps, great aggro, lots of hps, usually not as much AC<br />
2-hand...good dps, low riposte damage...generally less ac/hps than dual wield <br />
Shield...Best defense, low ripostes, most AC/hps of any combo, worst aggro and dps<br />
<br />
In my mind, sword and board should be for maxing out defense.  It should be the worst of the three options for DPS and aggro, but should make a noticable difference in defense.  Not just ac/hps, but some innate advantage to having a shield equipped instead of an offhand sword or a 2-hander.  Raising the AC cap is good, but I'm not sure anyone is at the cap anyway hehe.  Innate block, some kind of shielding effect (imagine that!) something that makes it very important to use a shield on the hardest-hitting encounters, but with a significant drawback (like major loss of aggro and dps) to make it balanced.  If knights are going to be able to use this there should be something to balance the fact that they don't lose aggro generation capability using a shield like warriors do.<br />
<br />
I do agree that improving shields to make them a more viable option is a good idea though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I agree with Brutall. I don't WANT shields to be good DPS nor good aggro. I want shields to be a viable option for when we need the additional survivability. I want each of the setups (DW, 2handed, 1 hander + shield) to have some advantage in different situations. I want shields to improve damage mitigation in some manner that it's a decent tradeoff for the aggro/DPS loss. I don't want shields improved in aggro generation/DPS so that it's just like DW, only with a shield on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tuddar Raddut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'd just like to see the tradeoff balanced. Right now you give up 33% of your aggro generation  for (depending on shield) 5-8% mitigation from using a shield. Obviously the boost to AC from shield is a benefit, but I think it's too little benefit in comparison to losing that much aggro generation. <br />
<br />
Either modify Furious Bash to compensate somewhat for loss of aggro, or increase the mitigation gained by shields to an amount that can actually justify the large reduction in aggro generation. Either way, I think the key is that the collective usefullness of shields needs to be balanced against the loss of aggro generation. Right now it is disproportional IMO<br />

Hmm still trying to figure out what pally/sk (aforementioned &quot;tanks&quot;) only 1Hs are superior to what is available to warriors. Hopebringer for the proc MAYBE but seriously a DBotW is likely far better than any 1H available to all other classes for tanking purposes. I can agree with the fact that pally/sks have better tools to deal with the relative loss of aggro that warriors incur with 1H setups but not with the fact that pally/sk 1Hs are superior to what is available to warriors.

Because of the loss of dual wield, a warrior switching to a one handed weapon + shield will do about 60%(I'm not sure)? of the output he would have putting an equal tier weapon in his offhand. Depending on AA and gear progression, a knight making the switch form a 2 hander to a 1 hander will typically do between 70 and 80% of the DPS he'll do with the two hander, due to the superior ratios on knight one handers. This is a fair bit more gear dependant than the warrior switch over: A low vengeance knight loses a tremendous amount when he loses his damage bonus due to low innate attack, and there are no knight one handers between Velious ratios and Elemental raid ratios.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">doooghh !!!   <br />
&lt;~ retarted warrior that see Frodlin as official warrior correspondent after 2days and a bad statment in another thread (furious nerf). stupid me.<br />
<br />
So, sorry Frod to be late, I wish you the best for this hard work that you have accept.<br />
<br />
My point of view :<br />
 * END need upgrade in regeneration : important<br />
my suggestion is END_REGEN = ( Innate*mod1 + Spell + Bard ) * Mod2<br />
with mod1 = 1 if standing and 2 if siting ; and mod2 = 1 if not fighting and 0 if fighting.<br />
I mean : we should start to see endurence regen in some spell and song to help us especially when we are resurected. it makes sence to regen faster while sitting (much more faster afterall we are at rest), and finnally to not permit a regeneration under disc we stop regenerating when we start to fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
 * disc system :  not essential, it's just an idee<br />
what about an AA that would permit us (all pure melee actually) to fire a disc before the end of the timer but at a high endurance cost ? this should be tested to be sure it doesn't allow us to chain using disc. maybe cut the timer in three part : first 50% no re-disc, 50% to 75% re-disc at 10x the endurence cost, 75% to 100% re-disc at 5x endurence cost, after the 100% of course the disc would be usable again at 1x cost. more over it might be important in this case to make timer stacks : ie if you fire a disc at 50% of the timer you need to wait 150% of the timer to be able to reuse it without endurence taxe.<br />
<br />
<br />
 * kick/slam/bash usefullness :  could be look at<br />
it would be great to link their respective domage with Boots/Gloves/Shield AC. Moreover it would be great to change the stun chance so that you land stunning blows two or three times more with a shield than with the two other (this would help  shields fix a bit).<br />
<br />
<br />
 * shield usefullness :  important<br />
I personnally think that DPs wise we should have something similar with 2Her and DW combo, and that using a shield must decrease our DPS. from a aggro point of view we should have DW above 2Her above 1H+Shield, it's the case but differences are to big. <br />
What can be added is :<br />
a &quot;shield block&quot; ability that allow us to block completly a melee attack (like parry).<br />
a &quot;spell deflection&quot; ability to partially mitigate a DD/PB/AE (not DoT, debuff,...) between 1 and 10% dependint on shield (size/AC ?) <br />
and furious bash should be change to give 2% hate bonus (FB1=2% to FB7=14%,) stackale with EoA and VoT. <br />
In trade off to compensate all theese overpowerfull things we would have :<br />
a DPS malus (like def) linked to FB<br />
and a Haste malus linked to the blocking ability (ie w/o shield haste caps at 100% +&quot;bardsong&quot; at with shield it caps at 90%+&quot;bardsong&quot;. a good starting value would be Haste_Cap = 100%  - 2*Block% )<br />
and finally to offset the spell mitigation maybe a movement malus that stack with everything and that is linked to the 'direct spell deflection' %  but I don't think a 10% speed malus is anougth to decrease the power of a 10% spell shield.<br />
Well all of theese is still too powerfull but I think it's a good starting point to think about it. I like the Bonus/Malus idee to compensate directly shield power (instead to make a link with a potentially too good/bad 1Her), more over it would create a true change in playing modes (Turtle mode would really means something).<br />
<br />
EDIT : a new idee to make the shield attractive would be to chane the /shield power. what about 40%  / 90%  w/o a shield and 60%  / 60%  with a shield insteed of 50%  / 75% currenctly (legend : domage receive by caster/ domage receive by warrior).<br />
<br />
 * another shield skill :  could be look at<br />
to compensate bad DPS push in raid situation, what do you think about a new skill that would be another version of Bash (maybe on the same timer, maybe not) that would deal 1/4 Domage but would push your target a little bit.  Because it would be a different skill it could be used only once a while when it's nacessary. Or to make it easier to use, maybe juste wrap (combat wrap you know) the mob in front of you at max melee range.<br />
Actually I am hesitating between the lazy option : poor domage + Wrap on your max melle range ;  or a more &quot;risky to use&quot; version : no domage,  Stun up to your lvl and a big knock back (more than melee range) to be sure that you won't prefer it over normal Bash.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well that's alot of proposition, so I will take a rest for the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />
Yoda.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Groovdog,<br />
IMO, Warriors are somewhat dependent on procs to obtain and hold aggro. As a result, should they elect to use a shield and bag their EoE /w Anger 3 or Force of YKesha aug and as a result lose some procs per minute and lose DPS, they only have so many choices for a primary arrgo weapon.<br />
<br />
While you might be impressed with DBoW (38/35), and it is arguably one of the two best choices for a 1H aggro weapon, it pales in comparason to the many choices a Knight has when using a shield - Shimmering Jade Axe of Vengeance (44/22), Cudgel of the Oppressor (40/28), Flanged Prayer Mace (54/30), Hopebringer, Knight's Gleaming Mace, etc., etc., etc., etc., oh yeah...... and etc.<br />
<br />
While Warriors have a somewhat wider choice of DPS weapons, our aggro weapon selection is pretty darned narrow. Check out the Library's Aggro Weapon Compendium - don't just take my word for it. Read the Darkblade of Luck thread or Frodlin's comments about the offhand aggro weapon choices. If droprate and selection weren't an issue, such threads wouldn't exist.<br />
<br />
We have a narrow selection starting at the EP's, lose aggro events when moving from DW to 1H + Shield, AND take a disproportionate (compared to other plate tanks) DPS reduction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Bear also in mind that BF, DBoTWL and Fleshbiter are anything but easy to acquire. Aggro options for a non heavy raiding warrior are severely limited. I've seen tons of amazing pally/sk 1handers drop on open raids, and I've never seen a viable warrior aggro weapon drop. Add that to the fact that pallies and sk's want in on BoW's in particular, warrior options are really limited.<br />
<br />
Sony needs to either come out and say they didn't intend for warriors to be dependant on procs, and do something about it, or add in some more aggro proccing weapons that are war only and available to warriors of different levels. Type 7 anger augs would work too, seeing as in most newer weapons seem to have both type 4 and type 7 slots on them.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a LOT more warrior only gear, too. Everybody figures casters &quot;deserve&quot; all their spells, yet we have to fight them for all the same all/all gear, stamina augs, hp augs, etc etc? Lame.</div></div><hr />

 * correction about shield possibility from my previous post : <br />
I think my suggestion were to powerfull, especially the 'spell deflection' it should be cut in half at least, or maybe just a second resist check if the first one if false.<br />
<br />

 * changing the random pool :  most important<br />
we are allways under random distribution pb, during fight, during crafting, during looting, ...<br />
they should baised the random generator, or changed the pool size, depending on what we are doing. I mean, we shouldn't use more than 5 times taunt during a fight, so letting us having 70%   success on a 10000 pool size can possibly give us a 3000 fail in a raw. same for mob drops, long farming is arond 50 kills so so pool size should be 50 (look at the DBotW drop difference, the variance chance is too big).<br />
they should built a biased random generator to take into account that some things might be used scaresly (taunt) and some other intensely (tradeskills). For exemple, they could store the last 100 times we used taunt and modify its chance, making failure increasing its success rate and success increase its failure rate (by diferent %  to take into account a 50 or 60%  global success rate).<br />
<br />

 * changing tloot system :  most important<br />
what makes my angry at most is the roting items. we spend a long time to face an event with our guildmates and when it's reward time we have to let two berserker's tome ort because we don't have any. it would have been better to just reduce the loot number or exenge them with gems.<br />
So a good fisrt step would be to check that there is no class only items with no class to pick them up<br />
a second step would be to check that items are usable (no Darkgling if the ranger have it already).<br />
a third step would be to replace all loot removed by the above checking process by gold/gems/trade items.<br />
a fourth step would be to make this cheking before loot generation, so that in reducing the loot table it increase the drop rate of useable/wanted items.<br />
<br />
This would solve the pb of intense farming of some mobs by one or two lvl 65 group, preventing lower lvl guilds to access the event they should face because it mob isn't up.<br />
This system can be adapted to mobs so that top end mobs don't food to quickly the top end guilds, removing any goal anymore, but the former end game encounters that are no more uber only (AoW, VT,...) can help progression instead of bloking lower lvl guilds because they aren't strong anougth to progress without the loot.<br />
This would really help the most EQ player community, as SoE wanted to do at the guild submit.<br />
<br />
<br />
 * adding tribute value to no drop items :  would be cool<br />
it would be cool to be able to turn no drop items that we don't need anymore for tribute points (even if its almost an ridiculous amount), just to not have the feeling that it's useless now that you have an upgrate to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I will keep thinking of other stuff, in the meanwhile have fun,<br />

<br />
This would definitely be nice.  Aside from saving a set of CR gear for those really bad days, theres absolutely no use for alot of old quest rewards or named drops.  Even having fairly low value tribute on no drop items would be better than just destroying them.</div></div><hr />
