I wanted the LDoN one but not enough points yet and its very hard to get LDoN grps past 65. I have thought about geting our guild to try a raid on Icestorm in BoT for the ornate BP drop. <br />
<br />
Would liek any suggestions on where to try for an upgrade. My guild is not EP flagged and we can handle any of the 1 grp mobs in WOS. I am currently 3rd tank in guild so not a pressing issue but would still like to upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: BP is the worst slot to upgrade right now.  With the addition of OoW its a lot better because you get your tier 1 armor quest, and theres a similar BP that drops in RS but both are only about on par with a regular piece of elemental armor.  Evidently the BP from RCoD is on the same level as both of those.</div></div><hr />

You won't see a significant upgrade from that before Time/Qvic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is the target determined for the non engaged sharpshooters AE arrow thingy? IE: do your clerics get hammered if you leave the other 2 alone, or can ya toss a couple knights at the extras to keep the AE on them while you kill off the other? &lt;/derail&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">12-05-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answered this myself. yes clerics get hammered if you dont control it.<br />
<br />
But also learned the AE isnt really the problem =)<br />
