<br />
 I have been talking with Wars about High end 2hs. Some of them Love Blade Of War and some of them Prefer Stone Edge War sword ( With Anger III Aug ). <br />
 <br />
 I was a bit confusing because in my point of view Blade of War OWNS but i have been told that Rune III has a huge Agro modifier, so i am thinking about which is the better Aug for BoW??<br />
<br />
ANGER III or Guard III ??<br />
<br />
Waiting noticies about hihg end and skilled Warriors thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guard behaves like the Vie Ldon cleric spell...it has damage reduction but no agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally wrong. Rune agro is very small.<br />
I would say 200 Hate, at most 250 (it is however AE agro).<br />
<br />
I have BoW+Anger3   Sews+Ykesha<br />
The BoW is &quot;totally insane&quot; agro, the Sews is &quot;good&quot; agro.<br />
<br />
I hate the bow for its looks, so i use the sews as often as possible<br />
(rune &amp; critic nukes are a fun factor too).<br />
<br />
But as soon as i want agro, the sews end up in my bags.<br />
(I've died in raids drawing agro with the sews, but that happens)<br />
<br />
Stay away from Guard3 <br />
(lets face it, you will always have a clering doing LDoN rune in raids<br />
thus it is totally useless outside xp groups)<br />
<br />
BoW+Anger = Monster Agro (i have that)<br />
BoW+Ykesha = Very nice Agro<br />
Sews+Anger = Very nice Agro <br />
Sews+Ykesha = Nice Agro (i have that)<br />
<br />
Pick one :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the rune III aggro is there, but its not anything you can immediately notice. it wont keep a mob to you if it procs before slow for example. id agree with the aggro being in the 200-250 range.<br />
<br />
why warriors do like sews though is the mitigation offered by the rune proc, although its not a huge amount, a couple of procs in a fight is like 300 added hitpoints. theres also the AE hate generated by it, which is nice when u have a bit of a train in a ldon group.<br />
<br />
and like the other posted said, slap anger 3 on it and your GTG for pretty much any raid tanking. the rune hate + anger 3 hate all adds up and it IS possible to steal aggro from even double auged bows.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly true Emilia ...on some raids a warrior might not have enough Clerics to do chain cast Vie, in those situations having Guard 3 in an off hand proccing is not a bad thing.  I would imagine for some warrs this could be valuable.   Hardly black/white.</div></div><hr />

I'd say that's pretty useless raiding places like elementals, considering I can start a CH well before a trash mob reaches camp and still heal a tank for 6k+ sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never once noticed a mob turn on me when it procced.<br />
<br />
I never did a controlled test, but the observational/anecdotal results were that it produced negligable aggro if any at all.</div></div><hr />
