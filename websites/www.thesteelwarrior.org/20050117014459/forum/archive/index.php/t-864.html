<br />
I've been trying to get an SoD but found it incredibly difficult to buy one since no ones selling it.  <br />
<br />
Would I be having aggro problems by using a non proc weapon off hand?  I see here that most ppl are into duelwiedling proc weapons...but the DPS and stats on this weapon is nice.  <br />
<br />
Advice please ^_^</div></div><hr />

Try it out and see but honestly DPS is agro too.  You should be doing enough damage and procing enough with the BoC to hold agro just fine.</div></div><hr />

From what I've seen, it's aggro is nil.  But it's still a good weapon, as long as your primary is enough (and with a BoC, I don't think you'll have any problems).</div></div><hr />

I had the first one on my server, and I got ridda it pretty quick because items like that are like mini vans; they are expensive, but their resell is crap.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you plan to wield it forever, pick one up.  If you think you might resell in the future, find something else.</div></div><hr />
