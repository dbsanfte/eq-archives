<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greklak</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm level 50 (RZ diety) atm.  I'm of course wanting a range item with as much hp's/sta and ac as possible.  I don't have a decent bow so maybe that could be a choice.  Right now I'm using an idol of the thorned.<br />
<br />
What I've come up with so far is Idol of the Wavecrasher which has some nice ac/hp/sta and resists on it.  Another is Nightmarewood Compund Bow which would be nice to have something I'd use often and could just leave in range.  Beyond those two, either the item seems to be required post 60 or of a diety that I can't use.  Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
I'm really up for anything at all as long as it's not an item that's required 61 and up.  By that point I'll probably just hold out for Stonewood or something like that.<br />

If there is a min level I apologize but I dont remember one.  Stat wise for a warrior it is superior to the bow you listed.  Plus last I knew it was reasonable affordable, 1500pp or so.<br />

The requirement is level 50 which is perfect for me.  I think I will go with that bow over the Nightmarewood.  You were right on with the price too.  I just saw one in the bazaar for 1500pp. haha</div></div><hr />
