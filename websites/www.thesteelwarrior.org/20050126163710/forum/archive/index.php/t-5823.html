<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember seeing a formula that allowed me to do a *rough* comparison of weapon DPS between 2 1handers and a 2hander weapon.  Anyone have that formula handy?<br />
If not then can anyone comment on which is higher DPS:<br />
BoC + GBoS or GSot4W?<br />
<br />
For larger targets that hit around the 1k range, I opt for the 2 hander always due to riposte.  I had thought that once I put the anger3 aug on the staff, I would have aggro locked down like the 1hander combo, but it doesn't seem to work that well.  Granted I haven't parsed things for dps, and I only have a subjective observation from 2 LDONs, but I would have hoped that the staff + anger 3 would be better then my two un-auged weapons with no ambidex AA.<br />
<br />
Comments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sigh, any anecdotes on the GS04W aug'd with Anger III.<br />
<br />
Or just more info from you Zeek? (Where you exp, AA's, hps, etc...)</div></div><hr />

Edit: Found  the link<br />

*disclaimer: I do not have ambi dexterity, I do have punishing blade, flurry and ferocity maxed, so it could very well be the case that my AA's push the balance in favor of the staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage Modals:<br />
<br />
For two handed weapons ...<br />
(2 * weapon damage + Damage Bonus)/Delay<br />
<br />
<br />
For mainhand weapon 1hander ...<br />
<br />
(2 * weapon damage + Damage Bonus)/Delay<br />
<br />
For offhand weapon 1hander ...<br />
<br />
(2 * weapon damage) * (dual wield percentage)/delay<br />
<br />
Add the two up.<br />
<br />
Now, keep in mind that Sinister Strikes adds an offhand damage bonus, so if you have that, it changes it to (2 * weapon damage) * (dual wield percentage) + offhand damage bonus/delay<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that dual wield percentage has increased for level 65 toons. And that Ambidexterity increases offhand dual wield percentage.<br />
<br />
But here's the best explanation of modals I've ever seen, even if some of the data is dated (2handers now display their damage bonus for example)<br />

Edit: nm I am crazy.. link works of our own SW board formulae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so what's a weapon efficency of 2.9 mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I plugged in the numbers into the web based calculator and came out with 3.114 for my 1 handers and 3.354 for my 2 hander.  With the numbers so close, I guess I will parse them myself and report back in a couple of days.<br />
<br />
/pure observations without parsing next<br />
The subjective comparisons I've done have been against normal LDONs mostly and some against HoH guards and suits.  In hard LDONs I go with 2hander, as I take more damage with the 1handers.  In those normal LDONs, the mobs *seem* to go down faster with my 2 1handers.  <br />
As for aggro, the 2 1handers held aggro better then the un-auged GSot4W, but that I will try it both ways again this week.  I don't have ambi/PB, and don't plan on getting either of those in the next 10 days or so as I'm working on the advanced defensives currently.  My 4 melee stats are always maxed at 290 right now.<br />
<br />
My standard approach for comparison only is as follow:<br />
normal LDON: I'm usually the puller and I pull with an Incite, run to group(short run at most), start attacking mob and taunt immediately.  With 1 handers this is usually sufficient now to lock aggro for the rest of the fight with regular taunts as I usually proc pretty quickly.  With un-auged 2 hander, unless I managed to taunt successfully twice after the incite, I would lose the mob to anyone's slow.<br />
hard LDON: I'm usually not the puller. ;)  Bard comes in with a mob, and I assist/incite just before mob is on the group.  The bard runs past me and the mob stops on me.  I then proceed to attack with 2 hander and taunt.  4 out of 5 mobs, I lose aggro to the slower.  When I tried this with the 1 handers I would get just a *little* bit better control of the mob, maybe 3 out of 5 I would lose, but it wasn't worth the riposte.  I attribute this to the higher AC/abilities of the hard mobs to completely avoiding my swings and thus less procs on them.  It seems a little better with the aug on the 2 hander, but we'll see.<br />
<br />
Did that make sense?  Consistent with what others are seeing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have Anger III on the GSo4W now?<br />
<br />
Everything else makes sense. Very interested in what you find. We are even at the same level of PP atm, and GSo4W is my next upgrade weap.<br />
<br />
Thanks Zeek.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might want to try Incite on inc, then wait till the slow has landed (resist or not) and then taunt if mob turns from you... If you have an Anger3 proc on the staff, an early anger proc basicly means you won't need to taunt at all, mob won't even look at shammy.<br />
<br />
When you're comfy with the way mobs are pulled on to you and the position of your shammy, you can also forgo the incite, engage and wait for slow to land, then taunt, then incite, based on the idea that the taunt jumps you to top hate and the incite will build up a nice aggro buffer, or hope (if the taunt fails) that the incite + DPS will pull aggro off shammy.... an anger proc at any time will just lock it for you. And GSo4W + Anger3 procs a lot )<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if your shammy debuffs before slow, an early Incite means the aggro-dot will run longer, building up more hate, making a slow less noticable aggro wise..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jakle: I wrote the original after getting the anger3 aug and only doing 1 hard ldon with it.  That's why I was still comparing 2 one-handers, augged 2 hander, and un-augged 2 hander.<br />
<br />
Ygnir: Thanks for the suggestion.  I've tried that many times, but it really seems to depend on the slower.  If it's a pickup chanter that's doing tash/slow right away and standing away from the mob, I tend to lose it if I don't incite/taunt up front.  If it's someone who has a clue about their class and has worked non-knight tanks, then they usually throw the slow from near melee range and we're good either way.<br />
<br />
Back to the original question of the 2h vs. 2 1h:<br />
I've had some more time and situations to play with the anger3 augged gsot4w, and I like it.  It *holds* aggro just as well it seems as the one-hander combo, but it does have 2 minor deficiencies.  The first is that it looks like a crappy cattle prod.  The second is that doesn't have as much pure snap aggro as augged one-handers.  I do have WA1 from GoD AA and getting that to WA3 or even WA5 should fix the snap aggro a bit.<br />
I don't think there's anything to do for the look. ;)</div></div><hr />
