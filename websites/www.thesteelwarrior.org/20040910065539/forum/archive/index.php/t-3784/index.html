<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going to make a little halfling warrior so I come to you guys for advice of a couple different things. I will probably be power leveling him until he is in the mid 40s. I have about 20k to twink him. I want gear that can get him atleast to the 50s. So can anyone recommend some gear to get him? I will be giving him my monks fungi until he is done being PLed by my druid, but he could use a chest peice when Im done PLing.<br />
Also he can be :Agnostic, Brell, and Rollos deities. I was thinking Brell personally, just because I think it fits the roleplay of halflings.<br />
<br />
The gear is maybe what I am most concerned about but the diety is important too, I think. thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />

Anyway, go Rallos. Some basic twinkie gear is Silver Chitin Hand Wraps, Crusty armor, Lammys, and other fast weapons for skill ups. Be sure to keep ALL your skills up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks, I was actully trying to stay away from crusty and crafted armor. its nice but I like mix and matching different kinds of armor. Thanks</div></div><hr />

Buy Clattering Bone Neck, Cloak of the Maelstrom, couple of Velium Fire Wedding rings, Silver chitin hand wraps...  Check my gear... I think other then weps all items totaled 20k.  Weps will be costly... I have a Copper Hammer of Sriking, Sword of the Bloodsworn, Marshal's War Blade and some other items.  These alone would be 20k.  I had a Skull of Barbute cap crap for lack of better HP head item but I cannot stress how much I HATE the look of that item.  Feel like an extra on friggin the Caligula set!  blah blah blah...</div></div><hr />
