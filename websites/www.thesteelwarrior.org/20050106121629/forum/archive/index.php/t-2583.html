I swear, understanding rampage is as wierd as understanding taunt sometimes.  (By the way, I searched for this info here and couldn't find it.  If I missed it, my appologies and would love a forward to the thread.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It works just like normal rampage...  He doesn't AE rampage.  Just normal, single rampage like any other mob, meaning it behaves just like any other mob.</div></div><hr />

Single rampage has always been able to hit from a longer-than-melee distance.  Set rampage correctly and you will have a flawless fight.  MT/RT dies, and some amount of hell will break loose, since his rampage range is quite large.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sol Ro rampage is standard single target rampage. Read this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well. . .yeah, we usually have the RT pull whatever mob we're fighting, and occassionally other warriors will plink a couple arrows on inc, then the MT intercepts.  I have heard that the rampage list isn't set in stone until the mob does his first rampage, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Sol Ro's rampage has perplexed me.  WITH properly setting up a a rampage tank, he has been known to rampage on casters, after waiting a full minute into the fight then launching their first nuke.  Also, once we had an afk cleric who didn't enter the fight till sol ro 50%, and he instantly got on rampage (with RT still alive).  I haven't tested the AE rampage on him myself, but everyone said he had it, and I think a couple monks died from it as they were trying to throw in a few melee rounds.<br />
<br />
I understand how rampage is &quot;supposed&quot; to behave, but not why solusek ro is misbehaving.  I guess the next time we kill him will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol Ro doesn't have AE rampage.<br />
<br />
Properly set, we've never had any problems with his rampage.<br />
<br />
Something else is going on that you aren't realizing.  Sol Ro is nothing special.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds like your tank got out of rampage range and he hit next person.  i suppose u could pin him in a corner and not even deal with rampage, not sure how big his rampage range is offhand. normally we set rampage like any mob and fight him in the open for archery dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is your RT jousting ae's or something?...<br />
<br />
Solro Rampage is sometimes hard to set because the way he ae's and on pull and how fast he runs... but if its set right never had a problem myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use RT to pull him with arrows, and then shoot arrows while he's running in.  When at the pull spot, the MT intercepts and takes over.<br />
<br />
Now, at this point, does the RT need to actually stand there and fight the mob for a few rounds (risking aggro possibly) and do a few swings of damage?  Does the RT need to stand there eating AE's and meleeing him the whole time?  Sol Ro's rampage range is huge, I'm not sure if you could even get out of range if you wanted to.<br />
<br />
If I were to RT, I would want to pull Sol ro and blast with arrows (hopefully at least landing one shot to do a little damage).  At that point, i'd want to get out of AE range and just shoot arrows while he rampages me (also so my healers could be out of range).  Is this incorrect?  Does the RT need to stand there whacking sol ro to maintain his place on the Rampage list?  I thought it was supposed to be set, in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer, till death do us part (or not).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I don't quite agree with in that thread is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Rampage is a proc. Cripple helps reduce the number of rampages a mob does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, cripple will reduce rampage... so it is 'proc-like'.  However, after viewing many many many logs, I have seen mobs rampage on a missed swing, which means it's not a 'real' proc (since NPCs can't proc on a miss).  Minor, but worth clarifying, since the logical conclusion to draw from saying it is a proc is saying that evasive will reduce the amount a mob rampages (due to missed swings == not procing), and that, at least in what I have seen, is definitely not the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya rampage sorta seems to have two rangers.... <br />
<br />
max range, which is usually quite high, and &quot;priority rampage&quot; usuually (not always) you need to be in this &quot;priority&quot; rampage area to be rampaged, even if your higher on teh list overall, if your in the &quot;max&quot; range he might ignore you till everything in priority dead, then kill you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor, I understand that the issue of rampage is near and dear to your heart, and I appreciate the post you got stickied, but no, it does not answer every question.  Specifically, it didn't answer any of the ones I asked.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for the replies.  So now i'm thinking 1) he does not have AE rampage (not sure why we thought this), and 2) rampage probably does have two ranges, and proximity is important for &quot;rampage aggro.&quot;  Sol ro can land rampage hits from very far away, but I guess even though he can hit that far, doesn't mean he nessesarily will hit that far (may opt for a closer target).  Our next fight I think we'll be sticking RT on the back side of the mob, where he can melee and counterbalance MT push anyways.  RT's healers may even be able to get out of AE range if they are in turn behind RT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rampage simply has a range, if you step out of that range he will rampage the person next on the list who is in range. if the first person steps back into range that person will get hit again.<br />
<br />
some mobs have tremendous range on their rampage while others pretty small. if you are in range of his rampage, he will hit you if you are on top of the list, there is no proximity rampage where he hits the closer person even tho they are 2nd on the list.<br />
<br />
if someone other than RT got hit, RT was out of range or didnt get on top of the list to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you sure about that ldor? i've been on rampage on Magmaton, backed up, was off rampaged, began to camp, he killed a few people then died to rampage because everyone else was deadpretty much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Drag, the answers are there.<br />
<br />
Now, at this point, does the RT need to actually stand there and fight the mob for a few rounds (risking aggro possibly) and do a few swings of damage? Does the RT need to stand there eating AE's and meleeing him the whole time? 2. The rampage list is set in the exact order that players get agro, they do not have to do damage, bard songs and debuffs will also get someone on the rampage list as will proximity and in some cases line of sight is enough (emperor comes to mind).<br />
<br />
If I were to RT, I would want to pull Sol ro and blast with arrows (hopefully at least landing one shot to do a little damage). At that point, i'd want to get out of AE range and just shoot arrows while he rampages me (also so my healers could be out of range). Is this incorrect?See above answer, in conjunction with - 4. Rampage NEVER hits the person who has current agro, even if they are #1 on the rampage list. If the top person in rampage range has agro, it will hit the next person on the list that is in range.<br />
<br />
Does the RT need to stand there whacking sol ro to maintain his place on the Rampage list? I thought it was supposed to be set, in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer, till death do us part (or not).1. The rampage list is static and is not changed by zoning or death. The only things that will change the rampage list is a successful memblur, camping out, or on rare occassions when FD successfully memblurs.<br />
<br />
And Ludor is exactly right. If the RT is not getting hit, he is either out of range or ramp was not set properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As i stated a few times, the RT is the one that aggros and pulls the mob.  So in my opinion, he SHOULD be the top one on the rampage list.  I have personally been rampaged by solro from well over 200 &quot;feet&quot; away (max archery range), so he's able to hit very very far.  I was simply trying to determine what was going wrong, since I thought we were doing everything right.  It sounds to me like it's a range issue (even though the RT was within max rampage range at all times) which your post doesn't really address.  I'm not sure why this is such a big deal to you, thanks anyways.<br />
<br />
I think it would be helpful to add to your post, possibly (if it's true), that RT should stay as close to the mob as possible to ensure that the rampage doesn't skip him and hit the next person on list.  This likely happens automatically on alot of fights where melee are still able to melee, but perhaps on ranged fights these issues might come up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think rampage is a little more complex than what is being stated... Sol Ro is a good example since his rampage range is so large.  I'm a cleric, so I'm usually ~100 away from him, which is well within his rampage range.<br />
<br />
I've gotten rampage before on Sol Ro and backed up just a little and lost it.  Someone else got it; they moved back some and I immediately got rampaged again.  Mob didn't move, I didn't move.  So I lost rampage and was obviously still in rampage range since he rampaged me again later.  This has happened more than once to more than just me on this and other rampage fights.  Unless I was *just* at the boundry of rampage and the mob moved forward slightly, that behavior just doesn't quite jive with what is being said, but again, Sol Ro's rampage range is well above 100 and I can't get that much further away from the MT, so I'm pretty sure I was within his rampage range when I backed up.<br />
<br />
I also only ever see this type of behavior when someone dies.<br />
<br />
I agree with most of what is being said... in general, properly set rampage will be solid throughout a fight, even on Sol Ro with his huge rampage range.  It *is* possible to solidly lock Rampage on a single person.  We do it all the time, exactly how others say it works, and as long as someone doesn't die on Sol Ro, the RT stays the RT for the entire duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
I don't really have an explanation for why I saw what I saw in the example I gave... I just can't quite reconcile it with the current cut-and-dry explanation of rampage that most people give.  Maybe someone else can give an explanation to the behavior I've seen that fits in the currently accepted explanation of rampage.  Perhaps there is a distance factor in there, but with properly 'set' rampage it just doesn't really factor into the equation in any significant amount; or maybe I'm just missing something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">once MT dies, RT may bounce around till the MT is established cause hes never gonna rampage who hes attacking although he may attack several different ppl till agro is re established. <br />
<br />
clerics are going to be high on the rampage list unless other ppl arrow on inc which they should do. you should really know whose going to be the next RT is if you prepared for it. RT dmg is pretty nasty out of disc so worth having a backup on solro and magmatron. if you have the dps, you will burn em down before disc is gone but dont always have the numbers for that.<br />
<br />
if there was something tricky about rampage and it bounced around randomly, mobs would be way more difficult. normally i RT and as it is, im only who ever gets hit unless im out of range. i do absolutely 0 dmg most the time too, so the clerics are way higher on agro but rampage remains the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very likely the rampage tank just ran out of range.<br />
We see a similar behaviour a lot when doing AHR.<br />
The gflux often moves the RT out of range (often myself) and people are wondering why they take rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Missing my point, tho...<br />
<br />
Scenario:  I have rampage, and back up.  Someone else gets rampage, they back up.  I get rampage again.<br />
<br />
When I 'lost' rampage, I'm still in rampage range since I got it again when the second person moved back.  I didn't move, mob didn't move.  If I lost rampage because I moved out of range, I should not have regained it when the second person moved back.  Conversely, if I didn't move out of rampage range, I should never have lost it, regardless of the movement of anyone else.<br />
<br />
This is why I think there is some range component (other than just straight up rampage range) that can go into deciding who to rampage.  It's obviously not entirely based on range; a properly set rampage tank can move where ever they want and not lose rampage, as long as they don't leave the max rampage dist.<br />
<br />
I saw something else happening in VT tonight that made me think about this thread.  One person was getting rampage on one of the bosses, and they back completely out of rampage range.  If they moved back into rampage range, they would immediately get rampage.  When they weren't in rampage range, rampage was bouncing around between 2-3 different people, depending on their distance to the mob.  All were within their *own* melee distance to the mob at all times, yet rampage was switching.  According to the most common definition of rampage, that shouldn't happen.<br />
<br />
We 'fixed' this by having one of the 3 people that were getting hit with rampage to move forward, closer than everyone else (they were standing right next to the MT).  Rampage stuck to that person for the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
And yes, I realize that rampage is settable (I said that in my last post), or it'd be completely stupid to try and keep the rampage damage healed.  It is possible to 'set' rampage.  That is definitely provable and done all the time.  However, I just think something else is going on if the 'set' rampage tank moves out of range or dies, at least until rampage is 'locked' on again.<br />
<br />
I don't have an explantion to explain exactly what I'm seeing... like I said, I think the currently accepted definition of rampage is correct for most cases, but its lacking something to explain some of the behavior we've seen.<br />
<br />
It could be as simple as like, if someone leaves the hate list, the rampage list is reset (so, if someone dies or goes LD).  I dunno... I just know what I've seen and can't reconcile it with the currently accepted definition of rampage.  The VT thing really got me thinking about it...  None of the people getting rampaged ever left the mob's rampage range (I know because I was the one getting rampaged if I moved within range, and that range was well behind everyone), yet rampage bounced around if I wasn't in range of the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a little example of range effecting rampage list.<br />
<br />
 Early PoP killing Desert lord in PoStorms. I was RT. Stayed right next to him the whole time(my typical RT position). During the fight he got pushed right on top of clerics by the jerkass melee squad. Rampage jumped to clerics(not agro, just ramp til low HP anyways) and he proceeded to wipe out 2-3 clerics(Niin included, F Niin) then back to rampaging me.<br />
<br />
 Just a little example that range absolutely does effect placement on rampage list more than just in or out of range. When I RT I always try to be 2nd closest person to mob after MT, and pretty much always works as long as I get initial ramp.</div></div><hr />

There are an awful lot of people who would disagree with that.  Many believe rampage range on all mobs to be exactly = 100 .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why this is such a big deal to you It's not, we don't have problems setting rampage and you asked for help with a problem. If you didn't want help, then don't ask.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I am willing to bet that there is a simple answer to the problems you guys are coming up with. There is always something that is being overlooked when people come up with a weird rampage problem. After a couple of years of dealing with rampaging mobs and countless weird rampage problems, people always find out that the rules where in fact right and they where just doing something wrong or they had missed a little detail. Lots of guilds have 0 problems setting and holding rampage on Sol Ro, in some cases without the RT even doing any damage as Ludor pointed out.<br />
<br />
I suspect that the problem is coming from not setting enough people on the rampage list and people moving in and out of range. Set rampage properly - not just the RT, but the entire list - have the RT stay in range and keep him alive. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thanks for the help.  I think still think it's a range issue, though we haven't found him up again to test yet.  :P  Since proximity affects aggro, it's not inconceivable that proximity affects who a mob decides to rampage.  In fact, we know it's a factor if the RT moves completely out of a mob's rampageable range.  The question is: can a RT loose rampages by being too far from the target while he's still within the max rampagable range of the mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I know what we might be overlooking. We are talking about setting the rampage list by getting some sort of agro - melee damage spell damage etc. Keep in mind that you can get on the rampage list just by being in the LoS of some mobs (Emperor is a good example, so is Arch Lich). I think the core of the problem is that even though you THINK you are setting rampage correctly, you might not be due to mob mechanics. It could be as simple as a cleric was the closest to Sol Ro when he buffed a tank, putting him #1 on rampage. Keep in mind that getting the rampage list != getting agro.<br />
<br />
Early PoP killing Desert lord in PoStorms. I was RT. Stayed right next to him the whole time(my typical RT position). During the fight he got pushed right on top of clerics by the jerkass melee squad. Rampage jumped to clerics(not agro, just ramp til low HP anyways) and he proceeded to wipe out 2-3 clerics(Niin included, F Niin) then back to rampaging me. I think this is a perfect example. Here is what I think happened here. PoS Lord apparently have a small rampage range. When the rampage list was set, the clerics got on the lisr BEFORE Grimm. This might be for many reasons, one of which I suspect could be related to chain agro, maybe healed the puller, buffed someone who was close enough to get on ramp but not agro, etc. Grimm set rampage and was the highest on the list and in range. As the mob was moved on top of the clerics, they are higher on the list and now within rampage range so they get slaughtered. As soon as they are dead, Grimm is now the highest on the list that is in range and alive.<br />
<br />
It seems like the discrepancy is in WHEN the rampage list is being set. Since we can't tell for sure, it would be logical to assume that people are actually getting on the list before you guys are actively setting the list. The only way to be sure would be to have everyone camp and set rampage to FD classes first, then log people back in after the first 3-4 spots have been set. Either that or have a chanter try to memblur right before the pull and set rampage immediately after the blur.</div></div><hr />

This is the key and exactly what I am talking about. Just because the RT is the first to physically agro the target does not mean that he is the first to be set to the rampage list. Arch Lich is the perfect example of this. If you don't memblur him after walking in the room and buffing, there is no telling who is going to be on rampage. You can get on AL rampage list just by walking in the door or buffing someone. It won't matter who plinks the first arrow into him, the buffers are already on the list above him.<br />
<br />
My point is that we don't know for sure when the mob's rampage list is being set. Just because Sol Ro has not been agro'd yet does not mean that the rampage list is not being built. It's not a matter of who is building agro once the fight starts, it's a matter of who got on the rampage list BEFORE the RT pulls him. It could be a matter of a cleric MGBing the raid at a range that is close enough to get him on the rampage list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is exactly the case, which is why I brought it up ;)  Trying to find what that simple answer is that seems to be the missing piece to decribe the behavior people are seeing.<br />

I know the case grim is talking about, and I know for a fact that none of the clerics *aggroed* him (with spells, healing someone who was aggro, etc) until the MT/RT were already there.  In fact, we have had some fights where the RT pulls the mob from far far away, and the behavior Grim and I have described still happens, so there is really no way that we could have inadvertantly aggroed...<br />
<br />
On Sol Ro, specifically... we use RT to pull him in, MT shoots him on inc, clerics start their CH cycle when the MT shoots their first arrow...  So we're doing all we can to ensure that the MT/RT are the first two to enter the rampage list.  And still, occasionally, if the mob gets pushed too close to clerics or whatever, clerics will pick up rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you are saying that a mob may begin making his rampage list before he's even aggro?  That sure would suck.  I would assume that with a target like sol ro, becomming &quot;aware&quot; of a player would not only put him on rampage list, but also make him aggro and run after the guy.<br />
<br />
Arch lich is perma-rooted, so he's much easier to deal with.  I don't think i've seen AL ever aggro on people early except when they pull the mobs behind him.  I would certainly assume that until he is &quot;aggro&quot; that he has no one from your raid on his rampage list.  He's probably always blurred after that though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) From my experience if the RT is alive but OOR of the mobs' rampage it will pick a random person to hit for the rampage hit.  Each successive rampage may or may not hit a different person.  Discovered this on Magmaton when a ranger got aggro and then did the archery bit...  Rampage bounced through the entire guild killing a few till I yelled at ranger to run up and die, he ran in range, got rampage, died, I (the expected RT) got on Rampage and stayed until Magmaton died.<br />
<br />
2) Not all rampage is ramapge.  For whatever reason a lot of PoP mobs that give messages of RAMPAGE act more like a flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">when we took out the big Croc in PoE I was RT. Even though I pulled/aggroed the mob with 2-3 arrows, and was right next to the MT(Nyles), I was not on the rampage until the fight was over halfway through.<br />
<br />
Dont remember who was on rampage for most of that fight.  But maybe LoS was a factor. We were all pretty close to the croc. <br />
Something similar could be happening with Solro.  But then again a bard might have been playing a song when I tagged the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On some mini-boss mobs in PoAir tonight, we tried to set rampage on them, and it appeared like noone was really getting rampaged at all.  Perhaps this is what morningloree is referring to.  Rampage never hit the tank that pulled the mob (being the first person to ever aggro the mob), and when asked repeatedly, no one on the raid responded to having rampage.<br />
<br />
No problems at all setting magmatron's rampage tonight though.</div></div><hr />

Like all fights the initial setup means everything but it sounds like you just had some bad luck.</div></div><hr />
