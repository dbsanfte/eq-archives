I was the adds MT and was having the hardest time holding aggro.  I dont know what it was.  I dual weild BoC and BF both auged with Anger 3 and was having to chase mobs off of Debuffers and Healers.  I had SK Voice, and was not slowed by the AE slow on a few of the named, but it was a fight to keep the mob focused on me.<br />
<br />
After I asked the other warriors if they had noticed any aggro issues as of late and they all had agreed.  Paladins (not that strange), Rangers, Druids, Shaman were all pulling aggro off of me at will.<br />
<br />
When I would go to break a mez, I would get a successful taunt first, which should put you on top of hate list, then incite, and the mob would still take off for the Chanter.  after the 3rd or so wave it got very frustrateing.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this or was it just a bad night?<br />

Don't worry about it much, things go whacky there. Some mobs memblur the top person off their aggro list and whatnot. My guild switched to having knights tank Air due to the extremely fast aggro generation at range.</div></div><hr />

I was peeking into one of the GoD zones with a guild group last night, and had this happen to me as well.  I may be wrong - I may have missed the taunt failure message, the enchanter may have been sitting, etc.  But I had the same *taunt success + Incite + beeline to chanter = wtf* moment.  In ... Natimbi, I think it's called.  I'm waiting to see if it continues to happen (or mebbe, I missed summat).<br />
<br />
Thing is, it didn't happen *every* time, just the once.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

Success taunt + stun + bash + hit to wake = no aggro  on a rather constant basis.  NEVER sit in Tipt/Vxed and beyond as a caster.  All i can think of is that sit aggro is not tick-based but constant checked.</div></div><hr />

While warriors have been given good tools for getting agro, they have not taken everyone else's agro away.  If a debuffer sits, the mob will take off after them when you break the mez even with a successful Taunt.<br />
<br />
These days with agro weapons, augments and increased proc rate AA, all easy to obtain, getting and keeping agro is trivial for warriors who know their stuff even on a mob like Vallon Zek that not only give the MT an agro reducing debuff, but also AEs an agro increaser.<br />
<br />
If you want more agro than that, roll up a wizard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check your parse to see if you get the text &quot;**** looks very angry,&quot; after you &quot;Bellow something profane at our opponent!&quot;<br />
<br />
If the part about &quot;looking very angry&quot; is missing, I believe you've somehow missed incite. This usually happens to me when the mob is running over terrain, or I am pressing incite as the mob runs around a corner, or something.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, and most probably am. Something to think about all the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had this happen to me alot on Ldon's recently.  Successful taunt, incite, and mob goes straight for the chanter.  I thought it had to be sit aggro, but with a taunt and incite that should automatically put you 401 hate above anyone else and rising.  Makes me wonder how large that gap has to be before someone can sit or if its a bug.</div></div><hr />

Using my g/f's druid, and extensive testing, I have calculated sitting aggro to be ... a bajillion.  And a half.<br />
<br />
I've generally no complaints about my aggro these days, I can manage it very well without the group doing the eggshell walk around me.  I can maintain it, and it can be pulled from me by over-nuking, resisted (and so recast) debuffs, etc.  There have recently been a couple of episodes where aggro seemed to randomize all the patterns I'd become used to,  and it's because our tools work as well as they do that I noticed those aberrations at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I figure it's just like using incite to pull.  The 400 hate just doesn't register because after one hit other melees can usually pull it off of you if they hit it on the pull.  Basically the same deal for mez.  Something about incite and not being in combat while using it makes it faulty.<br />
<br />
  Also I thought there was a post a while back with extensive tests showing that sit aggro is equal to around +200 hate.  No clue if those tests were acurate.  Had some crazy info though copy and pasted from Graffe's I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janya</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is, you are all assuming there was sit aggro.  Since Pooh didn't come back to answer, I'll put in my 2 cents here.  <br />
I was the add second tank on this raid.  Not one (I'm not  BSing here) of our enchanters  would ever sit while keeping the adds mezzed on an X raid.  It just doesn't happen(if you ever incurred the wrath of our RL, you would know, we try desperatly to not make these little stupid mistakes more then once).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are they on horses?  I'm not flagged to elemental so I've never been to PoA and have no idea if its considered an outdoor zone or not.  Also I'm unsure how exactly mobs treat people on a horse with respect to aggro.<br />
<br />
I wasn't as much assuming they were sitting as I was trying to eliminate sit aggro as the cause since we weren't provided with that information.  If Bulbog is right and sit aggro is only +200 hate then you can rule that out regardless of the circumstances as taunt and incite is +401 (assuming incite is working as intended), and you're left with some other cause or just plain randomness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KoGuiN</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use a GBoS with another stun aug on it for aggro. in the last week i found that 1 single stun proc was giving me aggro over some peeps using SEWS with ang3 or BoW with ang3.<br />
Took over MT in mid fight on an horrible reparm kill -- switched from ornate blade to gbos and proced once right off the bat and i had him cornered right away.<br />
Dunno what's going on atm but stun procs seem to give WAY more aggro than before GoD patch...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive heard that taunt only works on a target youve already entered the aggro list on. for example a chanter runs ahead and mezzes a mob, you taunt and break and it usually seems to go after the chanter. however if you disarm before taunt even though disarm is horrible for aggro it gets you on the list and then a success taunt puts you at top.<br />
<br />
before i disarmed before taunting i would get success messages and then have the mob go right for caster, now that i disarm, incite, then taunt it still sometimes goes randomly after a caster just not as often as it used to</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also seen oddities with getting aggro lately. Tanking tons in PoEarth with a boc and whatever offhand I've never had problems holding aggro once inciting. The other night, another warrior who simply had GBoS in mainhand and boc offhand was consistently pulling mob off me. He wasn't taunting, nor inciting, nor kick/slam. Just straight auto.<br />
<br />
I too thought was RNG being a bitch, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe stuns have been tuned up a bit, or incite tuned down...dunno. I'm not calling 'nerf' just because there was a patch, but it just seems that incite lately hasn't been as effective.<br />
<br />
Would like to hear other ppl's feedback.</div></div><hr />

This is nothing new. The mobs either mem blur themselves, or have some method of just not attacking the highest person on the aggro list. It's always been like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's been said before, many times, but I'll say it again. GBoS &gt; BoC for agro in the mainhand. If he had a GBoS + BoC, and you have a BoC + something, he is generating more agro than you over time, guaranteed.<br />
<br />
There's nothing &quot;simple&quot; about a GBoS, good fast ratio + stun = big agro. The only downside of it is that it's so fast you'll get riposted more.</div></div><hr />
