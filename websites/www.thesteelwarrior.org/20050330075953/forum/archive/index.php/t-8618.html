<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen it mentioned several places that the de-pop timers on PP starts as soon as it spawns.  I've heard its as much as 10min, as little as 5min.  However, on my server everyone is under the impression that the timer will not start until someone hails the PP, then you have 10min to complete flagging.  This from my experience seems completely false.  My guild killed a big flag mob recently, the Raid Leader and know-it-alls went apeshiz went a couple people hailed the PP after it had stood there for 3min or so.  I have not convinced the Raid Leader to go kill Terris Thule and sit there and watch the PP depop even with no one hailing it.  I would love if someone could confirm or deny my suspisions that hailing has nothing to do with the PP poofing w/o all its flags used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen several PPs despawn without dishing out any flags. Definitive proof? Nope. But everything I've seen has suggested that it's based off of when it was spawned rather than when it was hailed. Some mobs definitely have a max number of flags, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never been willing to let a PP poof without hailing it.  I believe the &quot;timer starts with the first hail&quot; theory to be pure voodoo.  I've gone back through my logs to watch the time of the mob kill to the time of the PP poof.  Its _always_ a round number of minutes regardless of when the hails start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eaglewar</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience it is a combination of both.  You have to hail the PP within 5 or so minutes or it will depop, once hailed you have a certain amount of time before it poofs.  Would be interesting to hear if anyone has actually timed these things on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's purely from when the PP spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get this:<br />
<br />
Killed Aerin'Dar many times. First 3 times we were told not to hail until everyone was rezzed. PP poofed after 10 min with no hails each time.<br />
<br />
4th kill: people started hailing immediately and fresh rezzed people ran over and hailed as well while golems were still being kited. PP stayed for over 35 minutes.<br />
<br />
5th kill: started hailing after about 5min and PP poofed 5 min later.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make any sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's like you only need 30 to gimp, not 32. theres so many PoP wivestales it's not even funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing seems to be certain with Mith Marr Planar Projection - 10min spawn, will disappear within 2 minutes of the first hail. Not sure if it's a bug or not,  but it cost my beastlord twink an elemental flag 3 times (womg impatient people!).<br />
<br />
I should add that the gnome in PoI stays up for a hell of a long time nowadays after MB is dead. When I first did that fight, he disappeared about 2 minutes after everyone's corpses popped to grave yard. now, it appears they could pop to graveyard, be rezzed, buffed, and you could fight back into him to get them. Was a much appreciated change. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bustauff</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the MB PP in PoI just have a monk train him to the ZL, then everyone hails it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do what I did to confirm PP Length (I never believed the &quot;Omg dont hail it or it starts the depop timer&quot; just like I never believed the &quot;Omg dont sit in the frenzied ghoul's room, it's anti-camp code!&quot;). <br />
<br />
Simple method, kill said God/flag mob.  /con his corpse and watch the corpse timer.<br />
<br />
Watch in glorious awe as the timer turns to be 10 minutes for most Planar Projections.  Give 1-2 ticks leeway (6 or 12 seconds) in variation because it's dependant on when you killed it during the servers &quot;tick&quot; cycles.  But it comes almost exactly 10 minutes each time.  For the lamen, that means when your flag mob reaches 20 minutes left to rot from the 30 min alotted.<br />
<br />
You can hail it, give it cookies, whatever you want.  Each Planar Projection works like clockwork, it cares not what you do to it.  I believe Aerin`Dar's PP is 15 minutes.  TZ and VZ's is 10.  Terris' might be 10.  Those are the ones i've timed.  But like clockwork each time.  I know where this rumor stemmed from.  It's from raid leaders like myself who tell their raids not to hail the projection until *gasp* we've finished the job.<br />
<br />
Point in case, Terris Thule fight.  Usually I want the kiddies to kill the 4 gargoyles (as TT is burned down prior) BEFORE everyone starts making the mad rush for their precious flag, so we don't have needless deaths and we, well, finish the script.  Some people fail to see this logic and assume its some big bad voodoo &quot;omg dont hail it or it'll eat you&quot; crap.<br />
<br />
Don't read into the projection stuff too far.  It's a static depop time for each given projection.  It has no bearing of when or how you hail it.  I know it isnt a projection, but the Carprin Deatharn flag mob stays up for what seems at least 20+ minutes.  Same with the gnome for Manaetic Behemoth.  And i've stated the two different Planar Projection timers between say TZ and AD.  Just time it against the corpse rot as I said, there may be 6 or 12 seconds leeway like I said due to the tick-system in place (this applies to ALL timers, ask any ENC who has Mezmerization Mastery where this flaw in the system is blatently apparent).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

See my post above ^^^ AD's corpse rotted and PP was still up (some parchments no one looted is why the corpse was still around).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most people's examples of &quot;extra-long&quot; or &quot;extra-short&quot; PP timers were from early on in POP, before the planar projections were adjusted to not land inside walls.  These days, they seem very consistent to me, as per Payn's and Branaelan's examples.<br />
<br />
I've never heard the &quot;first hail starts the timer&quot; urban myth on Bertox server before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octawan</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed AD last night, and the projection was up for 20 mins at least..not sure of exact time, Ijust know he was up when I looted parchments from AD's corpse with 10 mins left on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright then we can compromise and say that the projection duration at best may be random for some encounters (Aerin`Dar so far the only one with fluctuation apparently, though I still believe it is a static timer.. be it 15 or 20).  However hailing, giving cookies, petting, or poking the projection has no effect on its duration whatsoever.<br />
<br />
There, maybe we can agree on that ;P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've never actually tested with cookies, Vendak.  Do you have a parse of that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raid leaders yell at you for going to hail because in alot of those raids the boss being dead doesn't necissarily mean you're out of the woods.<br />
<br />
Take AD for example. When AD dies you still have the 8-12 golems to deal with, if everyone says &quot;screw it&quot; and goes for the PP the golems could possibly wipe out a few healers, and in turn wipe the raid. (I've seen it happen, it sucks bad)<br />
<br />
Pretty much the idea is that you should never worry about flags, loot, or anything else until you know for a fact the situation is under control, that is unless the raid leadership sees a wipe is emminent and calls free for all on the flags / loot.</div></div><hr />
