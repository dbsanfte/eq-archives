The cheapening argument is pretty weak in this case, no encounters were changed, it's just one way to alleviate some of the timesinks that are outdated with the addition of new expansions.</div></div><hr />

IMO this is going to be nice, I doubt very few guilds will escape the attrition WoW/EQ2 are going to cause in the next 30 days</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly why I think it's right. When TIME is the absolute BEST thing out there, you shouldn't be able to piggy in (it's a key, duh!), but once new expansions have been added and TIME is now a stepping stone... doesn't it seem ridiculous to have to do 42-45 raids to get everybody else caught up? I think this was a necessary step... and included at a good time. Personally, I think it was the right thing to do, and not too early or too late. And bonus points to SoE for saving a few of the lower end peeps from going to WoW/EQ2 instead of getting both =)</div></div><hr />

Good in theory, as long as it doesn't drop constantly it should be good in practice also.</div></div><hr />

I already assume that clerics that app to high end guilds will never be expected to have necessary flags anymore ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they do put it in, owell. Time is Obselete, and I hate doing Uqua/Ikkinz4 reflagging, because we have 1 cleric and 2 monks that need Qvic.<br />
<br />
If they don't do it, owell. Uqua/Ikkinz atleast produces some decent loot!<br />

(I hope they do it though, so I can get my paladin a rotting SoS and Hopebring =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pending Backflag Solution is in the Works <br />
<br />
I had the opportunity to speak with Lyndro, the developer in charge of creating the backflagging solution for the locked access zones, such as the Elemental Planes, Plane of Time, Qvic and Txevu. These zones will have an alternate method added that allows a different path for players to gain permanent access to the zone. In addition, there will be alternate paths to achieve access to pre-elemental zones. This solution is slated to be introduced to the game in mid December. It is important to understand that the actual methods of exactly how these backflagging paths will be implemented has not yet achieved full resolution. These details are subject to change; however, the concepts mentioned below are pretty much set in stone. <br />
<br />
I. Elemental Planes <br />
<br />
Currently, the method to gain permanent access to these zones requires the task of meeting a series of goals, in the form of a linear path of killing specific raid targets that ultimately grants the player permanent access to an otherwise inaccessible zone. In it’s day, the linear flagging for access flowed pretty well; however, as the content became less and less ‘new’, it became a chore to go backwards to reflag newer members to the locked zones. The Backflag Solution addresses these concerns. <br />
<br />
After the Backflag Solution is set in place, a player will be able to be shuttled into an elemental plane via the 15%/85% raid rule, and hail for the Elemental Gods’ quest piece as before; however, now that hail grants the player permanent access to that particular Elemental Plane. Example: 15%/85% raid into Plane of Fire, be present at Fennin Ro killing, hail projection… you now have permanent access to Plane of Fire (only PoF – you must defeat Coirnav for PoW access, Xegony for PoA access and the Avatar of Earth for PoE access. **NOTE: the decision on EarthA and EarthB access has not been finalized. EarthB access may or may not require the Mystical Arbiter key from EarthA. ). <br />
<br />
It should be noted, that this alternate access will have no affect on the PoP charm; meaning – using the alternate access path to the Elemental Planes and beyond will not enhance the stats on your charm. <br />
<br />
II. Plane of Time <br />
<br />
Currently, one could only gain access to the Plane of Time by being present at all 4 Elemental God defeats and gaining each of the 4 essences to combine into the Plane of time Key (quintessence of elements). <br />
<br />
The Backflag Solution for Time will allow for players to be shuttled into the Plane of time via 15%/85% raid rule, and now certain mobs in the Plane of Time will actually drop the quintessence of elements itself, for permanent access. It’s undetermined exactly which mobs and how many flagging opportunities will be available per trip. I got the impression that Phase 4,5 and Quarm kills will likely grant 2-3 flags per tier, for approximately 9 backflags per visit. Example: defeating Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, Saryrn and Terris Thule will trigger a mob/chest to spawn, which will drop 3 quintessence of elements; the situation would repeat in phase 5 (defeating the 4 gods), and then repeat again after Quarrm himself was killed. <br />
<br />
III. Qvic/Txevu <br />
<br />
Currently Qvic access requires Uqua and Ikkinz 4 raids (Ikkinz4 raid access is dependant on a series of raid encounters). <br />
<br />
The Backflag Solution will also allow for the 15%/85% rule to shuttle in players, and will have raid mobs (Zoo/Cynosure) who will drop 1-2 flag tokens to grant permanent access to the zone. There will be a quest associated with gaining permanent access to the zone, meaning that you will not simply be given access by 15%/85% zoning in, and looting just the item from here. There will be additional steps that can be completed with a group, outside Qvic or Txevu. The solution has an analogous scenario located inside Txevu that will allow the player to bypass the need for for reflagging through the Noqufiel event.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds good in theory, but when it happens in game, will be a shocker.<br />
<br />
Although, Being able to Loot QoE and having to do Quest for Qvic/Txevu seems kinda lopsided(Granted, Time is easier to acess, but all the zones should be done the same)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudana</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a recruiter for my guild I see this as a God send fix now. My Guild is working now to beat Uqua atm, we have been in Time for a few months gearing up, we have many rots happening now p1-4. with unflagged not able to join us.<br />
<br />
Adding this fix I do not think will take away form any guilds hard work to get where they are, it still takes 85% to even gimp people in, thats 85% that worked hard to get flagged during the heat of the content.<br />
<br />
with WOW and EQ2 beta and releases, it has dropped population on Tholuxe Paells ALOT.<br />
Any recruit I have working to gain access now is nonexistant for them, backflagging is in a dead stand still because no one is backflagging EPs or EP Gods due to lack of people. So recruits get discouraged and move on.<br />
<br />
I am one of those warriors that was flagging many people in Tipt, I have 40+ runs under my belt and we still dont have everyone flagged, there is always someone else that shows up in need :(<br />
<br />
so im my mind, I cant wait for this to become live, maybe my recruiting would pick up and concerns could fall back on the &quot;person&quot; being recruited instead of the &quot;flags&quot; this person has.</div></div><hr />
