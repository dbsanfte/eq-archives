<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Granthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone done any real testing to see if Strikethrough, Avoidance, Combat Skills do anything at all?<br />
<br />
None of the items I am really interested in have dropped for us yet but it would be nice to know if this stuff is actually doing anything.  Someone mentioned in chat last night that the Strikethrough mod was a 3% increase in DPS but without quite a few parses to back that up 3% is low enought that it could just be variations and luck in the hit/miss tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I saw something on the cleric boards about it, however I can't find the post atm.<br />
<br />
So anyway it's a place to look :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont have the numbers, but a guild shaman parsed out Ring of Evasion (10% Avoidance). Results were so shitty, it can easily be nothing more than the margin of error. My thoughts are the effects are all broken or just as useless as Luclin Dodge, Parry, etc modifiers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vathoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or the skills haven't been implimented yet, waiting for the new expantion. Just an idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That would be utterly retarded. Most people are capped stats, so the only reward would be some HP and AC. Definitely not worth it for the endzone. I highly doubt they intend to implement it in another expantion. There would be massive uproar if we were told &quot;yea, in order to use that feature from content you already paid for, you need to buy the next expantion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, as history shows Dodge, Parry, etc mods are in the same boat. Worthless.</div></div><hr />
