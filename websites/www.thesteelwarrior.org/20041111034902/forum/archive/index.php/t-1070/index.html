<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I downloaded and unzipped Yalp. I ran the program with eq and thought that it would start detecting dps. However I cannot get Yalp to do anything. Does the yalp folder need to be any certain place? Does the Yalp.exe need to be in the eq files? Any help would be great. Maybe a step by step walk through would be even better. Thanks for your time and information. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If im not wrong, you need to run it on another comp or something like that to get real time detection.<br />
<br />
I run yalp and EQ on the same computer and have not been able to get it to real time. Doest really bother me though. What i do is turn log on when i want to  parse a fight and log off at the end of the parsing session. Then i alt tab out of EQ,  load up yalp and get it to open the log file and get my stats.<br />
<br />
You  dont need to have yalp in any special folder. Just open it, click on file, then open it should bring up a list of all the log files to open. then click on the log file that of the character you want to parse. Then get ready for a shock as to how bad your dps is, hehe i know i was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you configure it to read your eqlog file? I use eqcompanion and you have to tell it what eqlog file to be parsing or it doesn't do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have to enable the &quot;monitor&quot; function under the &quot;file&quot; menu, then select the file that you want to parse real time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where do I find the EQ Log files? When I click on the open or monitor selection under file it brings up the search screen so I can show it what file to open. In the bottom its looking for only EQ Log files... I cant find anything in my Sony/EQ directory that is and EQ Log file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EQ Companion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like you have not had logging turned on in EverQuest. EQ only logs the messages into the log file if you have logging turned on. Just type &quot;/log on&quot; in your console window after you have signed on to EQ (I.E. not in YALP, but in EQ).<br />
<br />
The file name is something like 'eqlog_xxxxx_nn.txt' where the 'xxxxx' is your character's name and the 'nn' is a number that identifies the server you play on. For example 'eqlog_Gilador_85.txt' is the log file name for my shaman named Gilador on Tribunal server (85).</div></div><hr />
