<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kallur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to see aggro become even more of a skill than it is presently. My idea is to keep the present crappy taunt and AE taunt and add additional situational taunts for warriors. The different &quot;new taunts&quot; I'd like to propose would include: Personal Insult; Lineage Insult; Blasphemy; and Racial Epithet. There would be a reuse timer of one minute on these, but the effectiveness of each of these would be different for each mob depending on mob type. <br />
<br />
This would cause a great deal of overhead, I'm sure, but each mob would be coded as to how they'd respond to each of the above new taunts. Perhaps priest class mobs or gods would be more pissed-off by Blasphemy and for them it could be coded for locked aggro for the full duration of the one-minute reuse timer. Boss mobs and named mobs might respond better to Lineage Insults. Int caster mobs might be better annoyed at Personal Insults about their casting abilities or squishiness. Racial Epithets might do well on yard trash /shrug. The other taunts might have no better result than the regular crappy old taunt or perhaps a fixed amount of hate for each mob. <br />
<br />
This would require warriors to become familiarized with what would work best for what mobs. No single taunt that I posit above should be a miracle cure for aggro in every situation. Wouldn’t you love to see when you push the right button on a mob, “Talk about my mother, eh?  I’ll show you…” <br />
<br />
If snap aggro is what we are most concerned with overcoming, and I think it is, then the knowledgeable warrior would be able to generate snap aggro in a sense. Pushing the wrong button on a mob would mean that you’d have to work at it the old way with regular taunt and other tricks until the reuse timer cycles. <br />
<br />
I know it would probably be incredibly time-consuming to implement, but I was trying to think of a way to level the playing field while allowing us to remain distinctly warriors. I don’t want spells. I want to talk trash like a good battle-worn, beer-drinking warrior would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I LOVE this idea.... It would be like figuring out a mobs resists. Makes warriors smarten up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very nice idea. I've been emoting jokes about mob's mothers and such for a long time, be fun to have a skill that did something along the lines for a real taunt.<br />
<br />
Well done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the whole idea of TAUNT is flawed to begin with.  If a wizard blasts you to kingdom come, some joker with a sword is going to convince you to to attack him or her instead of the wizard somehow?</div></div><hr />
