Usually see them for 3-6k. I offhanded a Sarnak Parrying Blade, it also gave me an additional 10ac. I've seen them as low as 100pp. I kept agro with high dps output + taunt skilling.</div></div><hr />

hmmmm, I used a Lamentation (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=313)  and a Jagged Blade of Mourning (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=338)  until probably at least 40.  Both of those are cheap, dunno which whip you're talkin about, but if those are better they are options.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know how your money flow is, but if you wait and just level a little you can probably get a Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009)  once you hit 40 (that's when it starts proccing) for a little over 5k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FurryCrew</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's always Barnacle Covered Axe...has an Agro proc+DD<br />
Also Praetor Blade of Dibility (starts in Sanc Seru soo must have faction) has a Very nice agro proc and is a very easy quest that can be done in 30mins<br />
<br />
but realy @ the low levels just get the best 1h dps weapons you can find...taunt and provoke (wherever the low lvl one is called) should be more than enough<br />
<br />
Soo i'd say Lammination, Defiance, Centi LS, Wurmslayer, Guard Captain's Mallet, Jade Mace damn even good ole SSoY!....whatever has nice HPs/AC<br />
<br />
Once you hit your 40ish switch to weapons with agro procs like SotBS, Sandstone Hilted Short Sword (or something like that), Frostbringer maybe, Blade of Insanity if you're short of Cash....Smithed Yak weapons if you're the right Race/Diety combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xebokan</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At such low level, you need to take into consideration such things as damage cap - thou that mostly apply to 2 handers. Aggro at that level isn't that much of a deal either. I held aggro with 2 handed weapons up to the 40'ies, so I may suggest a good 2 hander as primary weapon (for dps). Here you could take a look at Reaver, which have very good dps, good saves and no recommended level.<br />
If you wish to go dual wield, buy such weapons as Fungus Encrusted Hammer, Guard Captain Mallet or a set of Etched Steel Batons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zekez</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stick with 1 handers for now. Dps wont start getting better with 2 handers for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gordic</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.  I hadn't even bought a wurmy cause i heard people say they weren't that great anymore and i shouldn't use it.  looked at a defiance/lammy combo or should i go with the wurmy/lammy or defiance combo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also invest in the cheapest fastest weapons you can find for all your melee skills and keep them maxxed or close to it. It's a bummer when you find a nice weapon .... say 2HB and your skill is 22.<br />
<br />
Ooka</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">overall a wurmy is great for people &gt;lev 45 or so with it's high damage output and the likes; but overall the two-handers won't be as effective as a sheer DPS-aggro set until your late late 50's and even the 60's.<br />
<br />
at 39 i got dual lammys/rod of the knight ( gm event weapon, 2HB ) .. and for work I will take the lammys ( which is a defiance that you have; with AC imho ) and leave the stick for goofing off/just DPSing and skillups.<br />
<br />
for weapon suggestions, any of the above mentioned are ones i grew up with and used as well, and did the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">crescent blades of luclin is really nice imo, 10/18 pierce. Can find them very cheap sometimes.<br />
There are some different exquisite velium 12/20 weapons out of dn and dragons in ww that are nice aswell, but they can be hard to find.<br />
Guardcaptains mallet 11/20 6str 6dex 40hps iirc, is always good.<br />
<br />
I think prior to the first damage cap getting removed 8 or 9 damage is the most you can make use of cause of the cap. Thus getting something really fast is more effective than getting something with a killer ratio, but it doesnt matter much as you will soon enough be past the the first cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megavixen</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies (procs 80DD at lvl20) and an Iksar Beserker Club (procs feeting fury at lvl 10) at those levels. Both really quick delay, skills go up pretty fast.  And they are inexpensive to boot.  2hb I used a Poison Wind Censer (the proc is bad but doesnt kick in until 50 anyway).  2hs I used an Ornate Rune Blade.  The important thing to me was a fast delay to keep up skills because I leveled so quickly.  I never had a probelm with agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muurlat McKrom</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lets see, i used 2 combine long swords for dual wielding and for 2hs i had a shiny brass hally.... granted that was over 5 years ago but hey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I used a BABS for 2 handed, and a BALS/Sarnak Skullsplitter DW, tanked uphill both ways And I LIKED it! :)<br />
<br />
This is a pretty tough question as the game has changed so much.<br />
I remember I avoided the wurmy due to stamina issues.<br />
Not sure if that issue is gone or not with the endurance bar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BabaHanz</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My weapon of choice from 10 till my mid 30s was http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14734.  Sure, the dmg/dly are bad, but it still really pissed off the mobs.  I was able to out-taunt other warriors using SSoYs using this without having to hit my taunt button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Helwaqe</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*clears throat* I suggest 1 handers especially slashing. Maybe cheap Jagged Blade of Mourning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a new 12/18 whip with no level limit that would be perfect for you. It is made by other players using tradeskills. For the life of me i can't remeber the name. Its something like barbed snake whip, or snake tail whip, or some damn thing. 12/18 is so powerful for your level that its ridiculous. On my server at least they go for 2k. Also, they are not lore so you can use 2 of them. Not bad at all for like 4k, hehe.<br />
<br />
edit: its called Steel-Laced Aged Snake Whip, and its nice enough that you can use till droga weaps or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">salandius</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would find the fastest weapon you can get UNTILL your damage cap lifts... a lamentation would be really good for that cause it will last you a while after your cap lifts</div></div><hr />
