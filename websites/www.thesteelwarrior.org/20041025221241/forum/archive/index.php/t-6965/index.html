Now that you're all excited....<br />

The new features make extensive use of Shader 2.0, so you'll need to have either a 9800 or a GeForce 3 or equivalent to enjoy the new visuals. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only thing I'm concerned about is &quot;will the game be absolutely playable for the 2 weeks after it goes in?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cosmetic changes are nice (although I hear bolt spells/archery received an &quot;upgrade&quot; from DX9), but really I just want to be able to play and enjoy the game I bought and still pay for.  I'd rather take the lag and problems I had before DX9, than the problems that have been coming up since DX9 update was put in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be new visuals to go with the current *new* engine, yes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hope the new engine is optional.  Looks to me like my 3-box setup is gonna become a 2-box setup till I can replace the 1GHz machine that won't be able to perform up to speed after the change happens if not.</div></div><hr />
