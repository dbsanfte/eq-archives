<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I must have missed the point somewhere along the line.  Could someone explain why type 1 slots, which seemed to be on all pre-LDoN gear, have been changed to type 7?  What exactly was the point of this?<br />
<br />
Also I saw this huge list of items in the patch message which have had the ability for augments completely removed.  Is there some particular reason for that as well that I'm not seeing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">those augs were removed because they were causing too much &quot;imbalance&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">those augs were removed because they were causing too much &quot;imbalance&quot;<br />
<br />
It would have been a sharp move to consider whether or not this would be the case prior to releasing the expansion and adding the augments in question.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gah, I hope i didnt lose my wisdom augment... <br />
I had it on my primal..<br />
<br />
Damn Wis hard to get past 240 for a warrior... frickin tradeskills...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SoE often doesn't consider how players will react to things.<br />
<br />
When they first released the game they admitted that they NEVER imagined that monks might use FD to split pull rooms.  They always thought everyone would bum rush all the mobs.<br />
<br />
This time around they admitted that they NEVER imagined players would purchase HP and only HP augmentations.  Apparently they figured the agility augmentations are worthwhile or something (and, hey, someone must think they are since they changed the Time gear to reflect more agility and less stamina).  If I wanted to be a crybaby I'd point out that yet again SoE unintentionally screwed the warrior since the ONLY augments that are good for our class are the augments that every other class also wants - but which SoE didn't put in the game in a higher supply because they were stupid enough to think chanters want INT. <br />
<br />
And, yes, all the augments currently on your armor will work (with the exception of the ones put on LDON purchasable armor).  They will just all be Type 7 now instead of Type 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Excuse my ignorance here, but what's the difference of a 1 or a 7?<br />
<br />
What does this change, it must change something.  Did type 1 slots allow any aug to go there? and 7 only allows an 8?<br />
<br />
I just can't grasp the reasoning behind changing the slot # unless any aug is able to go to a slot with a lower number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">type 7 can have type 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 augments put into it, i think its a bit more fair considering how hard some quest armor is and its crazy to have a type 1 on a champions BP and a type 1 on a tunic, so basicly you can use a haste augment on your oldie items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Obviously the type one augments are supposed to go to ldon armor only now (not sure if its purchased only or both purchased and dropped in ldon).<br />
All pre LDoN armor except drops from time has now a type 7 slot.<br />
My purchased bp has one slot of each type 1,2 and 3 after patch, which used to be 2 type 2 and one type 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;type 7 can have type 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 augments put into it,&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this confirmed? Because I don't see them mentioning this anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no its common knowledge, if you put a type 1 in something that doesnt have a type 1 slot it will take up the...... um ill get back to you on that :D i think augments are backwords compatable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they are not backwards compatible... only type 1 Augs can go anywhere because they are/were considered type &quot;all&quot; augmentations also..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This so called &quot;coomon knolledged&quot; just does NOT sound right.  There is  NO way they would allow ANY slot aug ( 1- 7) to fit in ALL the old armor.<br />
<br />
That would allow me to place FT2 type 3 aug in my chanters old school Robe of the Oracle .. nope, aint going to happen...<br />
<br />
Anyone with more common sense then common knolledge illiterate on this.. plzz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was under the impression, Gunrack had it right - slot 1 aug's were all slots compatible all others are specific to their slot. <br />
<br />
Originally old equipment was slot 1 (slot all). Sony's decided that some slot 1 augs (probably intended for old gear) when added to new equipment were overpowered due to stacking multiple 'alls', so by changing slots on old equipment and making the problem augs slot 7 rather than 'slot all' they can prevent 'abuses' of the flexibility of slot 1.....<br />
<br />
Ok, i almost lost myself then and I'm the one typing. Something like that anyway :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So... do any type 1 augments exist today?  Or are they all type 2-8 now?<br />
<br />
And if any type 1 augments still exist, are they still usable in any slot on any piece of gear?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Suggestion to Absor: It's too confusing having numbered slots AND numbered types.  Use letters or names for the types instead of numbers.  Call type 1 &quot;Stat&quot;, type 3 &quot;Effect&quot;, type 4 &quot;Proc&quot;, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gonna go out on a limb and say type 1 (all) augs will remain dropping and since they are 'all' they'll still fit in our newly type 7'd armour. Whatever they want to restrict will get bumped to type 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">calm down its a joke, everyone thinks i always so angry/mean or something, i cant have alil fun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, I love how everything is a joke now when you're wrong.</div></div><hr />
