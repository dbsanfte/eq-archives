<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borix</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it seems that there are at least two more expansions heading our way according to some rumours.<br />
<br />
One of the big questions in such a case is: &quot;What ways of personal improvements are we going to see, Levels or AA's?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I really really hope they are NOT going to add some levels. I'm certainly not impressed by the xp prison they created with the PoP expansion.<br />
<br />
So, lets hope it is going to be AA's. But maybe now with the goal to make people a bit more distinct. Otherwise everybody is going to take the same AA's again (ND3, CA3, CS3, etc. Yawn). There are some ways in which this could be accomplished.<br />
<br />
# Racial AA's (Examples)<br />
Ogre: Stalwart Endurance 4 (complete immunity)<br />
Vah Shir: Slam<br />
Troll: Ultravision<br />
<br />
# Diety AA's (But then also including special AA's for the Agnostic folk).<br />
<br />
# Or AA's which have a pre-requisite like &quot;And NOT having Combat Stability&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyhow just some thoughts.<br />

At least I hope so.<br />
Oh, and if you're going to do racial AA's, how bout this one:<br />
<br />
Barbarian: <br />
Berserker Frenzy - lasts for a set amount of time per character level, works just like going berserk does now(or maybe tweak it a bit).....we are savages after all. :)  Give it a reasonable refresh duration during which you're tired from berzerking and cant use it again. (Please not something ridiculous like 60 minutes) :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i think the levels and AAs are fine. PoP made getting from 50 to 60 trivial, but when 1-2 lvl 65's can take out a kunark dragon like gore adding more levels would only make the old world and kunark game even easier. Raising the level cap to 70 would make it entirely too easy. As for racial/diety AAs, this is a good idea but it might screw things up. If you give ogres an AA that makes them much better tanks, you'll be getting lots of hatemail from everyone else. Some more interesting AAs than they have right now would be nice though, as long as they don't mess things up.<br />
<br />
What i'd really like to see is more revamps to older zones that would make people want to go there and balance out the number of people in certain places. Enough with expansions, just improve the older things to make the entire game, lvls 1 through 65, enjoyable. Also, would be nice to see some lower and mid level quests that people will want to do, as well as fun events.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pixie warrior ..... would be gay as all hells if an ogre couldn't tank better... a gnome?  Again I am putting EQ in its current format aside... race should always hold an advantage somehow..<br />
<br />
D&amp;D example.. Dwarfs are great warriors due to +CON... but humans they get an extra feat.. this actually makes it balanced and a hard choice to make.. but of course I always forget.. in the D&amp;D world you play in.. its only you or a handfull in EQ there is TONS to keep satisfied... anyways.. just typing out thoughts</div></div><hr />

<br />
Iksars would mitigate more damage due to scales.<br />
<br />
Wood Elves, Half Elves, Humans have average avoidance (ala small people) and average endurance (ala large people)<br />
<br />
Barbarians, Trolls, Ogres, Vah Shir are easier to hit but have more HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already tried this remember? And literally slaughtered the Iksar's ability to level anything near quickly like all other races (Especially before the class penalties were raised), and for what? infravision (75% of the races of Norrath have that), AC bonus (50ac differnece for tanks at 65 means jack and shit), and 18hp regen at 65...now that's something that was actually worth a damn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could be a great IF there is a real balance in the possible AAs,not like cultural.<br />
<br />
For exemple some king of &quot;scale rune&quot; for Iksars, cost 3-6-9, and add a rune of 50, 150, 300 hp. (renew time : 90 mins). or a dwarven endurance (reduce poison and disease damage by 5, 10 and 20%).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In fact the third option was the real reason for my thread. It would be nice to see some diversion in each class. Now they just pick ND3, CA3, CS3 with somewhere on the line AE Taunt.  All warriors are about the same, how boring.<br />
<br />
And yes i agree they should first do something about Taunt (and not via AA's!)<br />
<br />
And yes i agree that they shouldn't add levels at all.<br />
<br />
And yes i wish there were bigger racial differences, but Verant gradually removed those differences. There used to be large, medium and small armor and weapons. Well i don't think we have seen that anymore since Kunark. But then again EQ is a game all about Classes and NOT Races, it is a given fact, so why not accept it.<br />
<br />
Just adding new content is a waste of time i think. Nothing will be improved by that. There are already plenty of zones and they will add certainly new ones when an expansion comes out. Class balancing is much more important.<br />

And then once you beat the content you just don't log in till the next expansion? Levels and AA, no matter how much we don't like them, keep us playing.</div></div><hr />
