<br />
I'm looking for some upgrades in certain spots atm as these seem to be needed most atm.<br />
<br />
Ears x2<br />
neck<br />
waist<br />
shoulders<br />
<br />
I haven't much pp to spare so a maxium of 1k in each slot would be it, or if I could talk my friend (65 shammy)  help me camp for any upgrade would be even better.<br />
<br />
LDON isn't a viable option atm as I  only have 1 win in BB, but I am working on getting more, try to get EF and Nro.<br />
<br />
Sorry but my atk and ac are wrong can't seem to get it right(.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Wil</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amulet of Mummy Wrappings  +12 AC +7 Str +3 Sta +5 Agi +10 vsCold +45 HP +25 Mana 0.8 Wt  -- about 1k to 1500PP<br />
<br />
Don't have a lot of options for you on the waist.  - You coulld farm the components needed for Helanic Tundra combines and see if you could find a smith to combine it for you. <br />
<br />
Same with the shoulders. Not alot you are going to find in the price range to be an upgrade. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps a small amount at least.</div></div><hr />

Waist: <br />
<br />
i) Visit Droga in a couple levels with your shammy (friend /wink) and get yourself a sash of wonder from the Bone Knight Runri camp.  Heck, your shaman might be able to solo that now.  <br />
<br />
ii)If you don't want haste, there is a rare belt that drops in Maiden's Eye from the four arms.  20 ac 15 str 15 wis no level req, if I recall.<br />
<br />
iii)If you don't want haste, don't care about level req, there is a nice belt that drops from CoD rats (it should be in my inventory if you click magelo, I use it when I have tribute haste on for an extra hp/ac bump).<br />
<br />
Earrings are expensive, your best bet is either save money and do as suggested above or pick one of a few select quests that you will not finish until your in your 50's or 60's (Luclin Era)...presuming LDoN is not an option, otherwise Tak has a nice cheap (100 points) 2 slot earring that isn't too bad since you can sell it back later.<br />
<br />
Shoulders: You could get CoV faction and get the same ones I have fairly easily with your shaman or you could wait until you're higher and try for Strength of the Elementals one.<br />
<br />
Neck: as mentioned above (it's a normal LDoN Tak drop, at least at 65 it is).  Maybe you could talk your shammy into doing a few and see if he/she could roll on it for you or just buy one.  But honestly, I'd buy earrings first, get the biggest bang for your plat first.</div></div><hr />
