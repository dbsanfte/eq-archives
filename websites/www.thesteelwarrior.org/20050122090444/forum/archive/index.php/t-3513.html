Get one of the better bazaar 2 handers like Windblade or the best 2 hander your guild can get.  Stuff like Great staff of 4 winds or Emp Sword works.</div></div><hr />

I keep DPS weapon/s in an open slot, or aggro weapon as the situation calls for, then when I am forced to offtank, just swap it out really quickly.  Only takes a second and allows you to always use your best weapons for each situation instead of settling for a middle ground.  Works for me very well.<br />

that combo not only allows me to get agro or offtank without it but is affordable lol. ofcourse a nice 2hb like greatmaul of hatred is nice dps with no proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to use BBB to offtank and regularly pulled agro off the tank to be splattered early.  I recommend a good ratio 2hs with no proc or 2 decent ratio 1 handers.  <br />
<br />
DD or lifetap procs are ok,  Rune 2 on the SEM doesnt seem to pull too much agro, but Rune 3 on the BBB seemed to be big agro.<br />
<br />
For raids as a non tanking warrior not pulling agro is as big a part of your role as doing additional DPS and since almost every other melee aside from warriors and paladins have some way to mitigate agro it is something we need to be very careful with.  It is worth wielding lower ratio non proc weapons if thats what you've got to do to stay down the hate list as you do more DPS in the long run and serve your guild better if you do 90 DPS for the whole fight rather than 110 DPS for half the fight and then pull agro and die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also was hoping to se a good list of excellent dropable high dps/low agro weapons usable by a warrior if someone could take the time to compile one.</div></div><hr />

Windblade or a War Marshall's Bladed Staff works very well; or I even got a cheapo Battleworn Ch'Ror which is really helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really learning my lesson about offtanking with proc'ing weapons to this day. I just recently got Gloves of the Crimson Sigil off Aten, and I really like to try and keep my Call of Fire buff on when I use my DPS weapon for added DPS. It has however gotten me killed after 1 proc shortly after the start of two fights the other day. If you're going to off tank and strictly do DPS, go with something that either has no proc or a very low agro proc. If you are in the EPs or Solusek Ro tower, both zones drop a nice sword (different swords) that proc boil blood and do very good DPS:<br />
