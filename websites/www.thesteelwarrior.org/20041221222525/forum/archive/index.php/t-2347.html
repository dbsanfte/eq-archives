<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say you should move into PoN or PoD until at least 58 or so.  Around 60+ you can start xping in PoS and maybe 62 for PoV and BoT and CoD.  At 54, though, there are lots of good places to xp outside of PoP.  You should try veksar, karnor's castle, sebilis, velks, howling stones.  Those are all great zones and are much more fun than PoI IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoI is decent.  Personally I hate PoN and PoD, mainly because of the fact that I don't particularly like outdoor zones.  The corrollary to that is that bards and wizards quad kite in outdoor zones and often either drag their quad over your group, or lose control of it and die right  next to your xp group, both of which = bad (which is why I hate them....outdoor zones, not wizzies and bards....I think...).  At 54 I'd have to agree with sulvar and say veksar, seb, velks etc.  ZEM is pretty good 'cause they're dungeons, cash is decent, and they're infinitely more fun than the DL for the 60ish crowd that is PoN/PoD.  Also, unless your gear is alot better than mine was at 54, tanking in PoN and PoD will be hard. Doable, but not at all easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also on the the gear note...<br />
<br />
If you don't have a good guild that raids often or pretty good gear already I wouldn't advise PoP. The loot is generally non-existant especially for tanks since the casters that use components will get first dibs on the drops.<br />
<br />
Velk's, KC,OS, and Veksar are all pretty good for cash and item drops assuming you are still in need of such things.<br />
<br />
Another thing, keep in mind that after 61 you'll be spending most all of your time in PoP so get out and see the other places while the exp is still pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about LoY zones? at 48 xp was nice on the oceancrasher in dulaks harbor, and loot(that time at least) was great 1 blue diamond every 30 mins or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoI is good exp. Do not like GY unless no one in zone. You can make a moving group tho.<br />
<br />
PoN - Dock, ZO2, and Hobgobos are nice. Hobgobo are more of a 58+ thing.<br />
<br />
PoD - Courtyard, Skeeters and at 59 Castle<br />
<br />
Velks - easy steady exp but kinda small. Go deeper for better exp but most people do not.<br />
<br />
Seb - Shrooms/Juggs are nice exp and tons of spell drops.<br />
<br />
UP - Have not been there since 54. My war could keep up being pretty twinked out but all mobs were red.<br />
<br />
Veksar - I personally do not like exp but the new zoneness and the drops are nice.<br />
<br />
Droga - nice exp and good money.<br />
<br />
PoH - Completely different zone now. Easy to port up and exp at ZI.<br />
<br />
PoJ - Basement  Kinda low but still doable.<br />
<br />
Other places I have thought about but not tried<br />
Ssra<br />
FG<br />
Deep<br />
GE<br />
AR<br />
PoStorms<br />
PoValor</div></div><hr />

<br />
Six zones being partially revamped during one of the upcoming August patches, check out all of them after the revamp, they were all level 50+ zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kremib</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you everyone for the help. I am on the Rath Server is it easy to find pick up groups in a lot of the non POP zones? Or must I bring a group with me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Maz, all the zones people have previously mentioned are good but places like seb that use to be the zone of zones for exp are now dead and you need to bring your own group.  The best bet for exp however is the planes if you can get groups, they generally yield the best exp.  I haven't been to the LoY zones yet so I can't speak of those.  If you can bring your own group, seb is still one of the funner and more profitable zones around for that level.</div></div><hr />

(King in Droga was camped, no hammer for me /pout) XP was at least as good as tier1 planes and it was way more fun than Plane of Boredom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ZEM is pretty good 'cause they're dungeons,<br />
<br />
one would think their ZEMs are good, but their ZEMs are nothing compared to lowlevel dungeons and PoP</div></div><hr />
