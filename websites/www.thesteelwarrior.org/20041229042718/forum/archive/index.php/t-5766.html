<br />
I was doing and expedition and noticed it didn't seem to be firing off as much as it was the following evening. People in my group were also complaining, followed by people in the guild complaining.<br />
<br />
Maybe it could have been bad luck with the RNG.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct, as if WA was slightly nurfed.<br />
<br />
Without parsing I have no data to back this up, hence why I was asking if the parsing gurus had some info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be more inclined to believe that your innate proc rate was nerfed and that WA brought you back up to where you should be at, kinda like what they did with Stalwart Endurance when PoP came out.<br />
<br />
Of course i'm not inclined to believe anything that hasn't been parsed these days.  Too many years of &quot;OMG! JBOOTS NERFED!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably just bad luck with the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a brutal time holding aggro last night in earth. I dunno, there was another warrior in my group who kept pulling it.<br />
<br />
I had BoC main with Ivory Hilted Cleaver offhand.<br />
He had GBoS main and BoC offhand.<br />
<br />
None of our weapons were aug'd, i was incited and taunting and no matter what he'd yank it constantly. We couldn't figure it out. Neither of us have WA, and he only has a litte more flurry than I do.<br />
<br />
I was stumped and resolved that I musta had a bad run with the RNG...dunno, if anyone has any ideas, lemme know.</div></div><hr />

He had GBoS main and BoC offhand.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Probably because Force Shock + EB &gt; EB + Crap DD proc.<br />
<br />
We couldn't figure it out <br />
<br />
Might wanna start chokin it down.  EB is not the be all, end all to aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the adverage 2 force shocks + 1EB ppm would steal agro from 2EB + 1DD ppm. also, he has a slight advantage of firing off an agro proc first. mot to mention GBoS is just a little better DPS than a BoC.</div></div><hr />

yea i know its not a long log but it's what i had.<br />
<br />
procs used: main hand ruj mist 75 dd from aug on defenders lightblade. offhand guard 2 on bwowd, and mirror 1 aug on bwowd.</div></div><hr />

There is another post with extensive data and a longer duration that shows 0 combat effects and WA 5. Total procs or 3 separate parses were 9.0634/8.957/9.215ppm.<br />
<br />
To me, just with a minor parse the rate of procs with WA 4 and CE 15 &quot;should&quot; be more.</div></div><hr />

I've made an 8+ hour parse of procs every day since GoD went live.  I've noticed no nerf.  The above difference is well within the usual randomness margin.  These logs just happen to be the biggest time gap.  Trust me, there was no nerf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, dumb question... but anyone know what filters to set so I can see just my anger procs in the main window and not everyone elses?  I thought it would be something to do with spell effects, but that didn't do it.  On my guild raids I don't think I'm the only one with an anger proc, so I'm not sure if the &quot;twists with anger&quot; thing is me or someone else.  bah!  :P<br />
<br />
And so much for being able to parse it when more than one person has an anger proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good one I used to hang out on the EQ Traders boards my main Druid is a big time tradeskiller but left because of the NERF NERF calls after each expansion.<br />
<br />
Torrin have to say thanks for sharing that information.</div></div><hr />
