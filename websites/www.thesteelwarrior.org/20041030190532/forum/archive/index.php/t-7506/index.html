<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hujarl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I just completed my epic last night (Woohoo!) and have some questions for the community.  I have searched through the boards but have not found specifically what I am looking for.  Any help would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if I aug my 1hs blades with the anger2 or 3 augs from EF if the effects stack when combined into the JBOW?  If I put an aug on each would all three hate procs (including the resident redblade proc) stack?<br />
<br />
Any other links to previous posts that anyone thinks would be helpful to this or other epic concerns would be great!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can't aug the weapons given out in the quest.<br />
<br />
You can hand your JBoW and the Scabbard to an NPC by the Human and Dorf in EFP to get a non-summoned version of each weapon which is aug'able.<br />
<br />
If you hand in the JBoW and Scabbard you'll have all three blades on you at all times.  There is also a trick to get 2 red epics out of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hujarl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahh ok, thanks!<br />
<br />
I ran across a thread regarding that trick I believe.  I will take another look.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep in mind to use these on epic two to the faster path of progress you may have to have the blades as quested for.  Meaning two blades of strategy may hammer you later on.  I wouldn't aug them wither in case they are to be turned in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You'll be able to remove augments soon, though.<br />
<br />
I'd go ahead and aug it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can remove augments now, just cannot recieve the augment back.</div></div><hr />
