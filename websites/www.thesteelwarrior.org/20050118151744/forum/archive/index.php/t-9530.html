<br />
I'm planning on getting Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates from Vahskiz shortly, easy enough to group... other than that though, and doing my epic, I'm kindof stuck. I have 170k in bank at the moment from some lucky drops and a lesser muramite rune to sell. So, where do I go now? Any advice would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Muramite proving grounds has a bunch of prospective upgrades for you. You'll need to bring a solid group to keep you up in there though. Theres a mask, ear, neck, legs, and ac aug upgrade for you there at the minimum. I have the mask and neck on my magelo.<br />
<br />
Vxed has an ear, and legs, and face. Tipt has a 30 hp aug, ferubi has some AC augs from the pixxt elites.<br />
<br />
It looks like you have eplanes access too, so get the flame gilded cloak from fire so you can get better stats on your earrings with the vxed and mpg ones. Theres a nice charm from the C1 named in fire, too. See my magelo.<br />
<br />
Buy a horz with your money. Try to round up some people to kill tormax and get boots of the storm and velium encrusted gauntlets. Or you could buy them, too.<br />
<br />
You can start looking at replacing your ornate pieces with the new tier 1 oow quested pieces. Several of the pieces drop off named in WoS/ RCoD i understand, although I've never seen them.</div></div><hr />

From your gear, I'm guessing you have a main to tag you EP so just use your main to farm the lewtz from MPG and park your war there to loot.  there are some really nice upgrades you can farm with little effort in MPG if you have elem friends.  if you get lucky, you may get those charged magnetic armor which are pretty close to LDoN/EP they do require some farming for the core, but well worth it if you have access to a grandmaster smith friend.  considering you are EP flagged, you should be around 1800ish AC so time to get farming:)   alternative methods of farming is just nail dozekar every time he pops his head in HoT.  eventually you can get a nice haste bracer and a decent necklace out of the deal  the mask isnt bad either, but MPG got a good no drop mask too.  anyway.  good luck farming.  looks like you are going in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

I simply have amazing skills at getting invited to raids I don't really intend to go on with various guilds :P And 1800AC? Don't think it's going to happen. I'm not wearing any raid armor and don't want to spend the time to get it. As for elementals... not a lot of good armor drops off groupable stuff outside fire where people are actually willing to go. Hard to find a good group for Water/Air these days. I believe there are player-made augs now that have dodge on them, would have to check to see exactly which, but methinks dodge aug + spiked plates better than the nimble mantle. Thanks for the advice everyone, I'll get on it ASAP :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey spike, I found myself in just that same boat as you.  I am in a non raiding guild and have not received any sort of raid loots since back in the day when i got my BoC.  today however i am 9100 unbuffed hp and like 1700 AC.  heres how i did it.<br />
<br />
First and most important, EXP EXP EXP.  you want hps and better tanking skills, get lvl 70 and bang out those AAs.  im up to 660+ aas atm and im guessing that about 1500 of those HPs came right outta AAs, as well as dmg mitigation skills which make me a more favorable tank.  anyway, down to the nitty gritty for gear.<br />
<br />
Be a loot whore, roll on anything and everything that is sellable.  Take it and make some $$$ for those items that you want that are tradable raid drops ie BoC, boots of the storm, velium gaunts, horz (notice a kael trend?  P).  Also, i was lacking a haste item, hopped on allas and found 2 tradable 41% items.  i am using a Scalecracker atm which i bought for 40k.  33 ac 15 sta 100 hp 41% tradable RANGE SLOT.  Gotta keep after those rare old school loots that are more lesser known. crystalized acid bracers, scalecracker, iron cog ear etc.  CT and Kael are really warrior goldmines.<br />
<br />
For no drop loots and attunable loots:<br />
GoD and OOW has a nifty feature: most zones in these 2 expansions have 2 or 3 rare random loots that are for the most part, very nice, as im sure you're aware.  try to group in those zones as much as possible, not so much in PoPower.  Work your way up too, from WoS and RCoD up to MPG and RS.  Do tipt/vxed trials for loots, get KTed for loots etc etc. The oow armors from what ive heard are also wuite good.  about ready to do turn ins for mine, just need faction and i can go ahead and get a full set.  Very easy to get the pieces. <br />
<br />
Most important advice i can give though is this: EVERYONE HAS A PRICE.  if something you want drops in a group and you dont win the roll, try your darndest to buy the loot rights off that person. people dont expect you to do this and usually will say yes for a stupidlow price like 25k or something, just cause they are caught off guard.  they will regret it later, but thats not your problem.<br />
<br />
anyway, i'll stop ranting, but there are MANY paths to greatness, just gotta be ruthless.<br />

It's not hard to be caught off guard. Just say no. You must group will stupid people.<br />
<br />
It's just as easy to be uber without being a loot whore too. Don't go to the dark side. =\</div></div><hr />

Could you post your magelo? 9100 is a good grip of HP. I'd like to take a peek for some potential ideas.</div></div><hr />

I guess.......... I have found the game more enjoyable to play with people and make their day by passing on some loot and they wear it.  They will more than likely return the favor for you at a later date, but if you'd rather use the cash for some piece of shit bazaar item then go ahead.<br />

Gelo inc in a sec, im new here, trying to set up profile</div></div><hr />

That is awesome for a warrior to obtain 9khp+ UNBUFFED and not from raid gear...<br />
<br />
However its odd seeing that much HP, and seeing the AC a bit low, or is magelo bugged.</div></div><hr />

Magelo isn't off. That's just the life of a non-raider. You can do alright on HP, but your AC is gonna be way low. The only way to hit anything decent is to get all the Riftseekers augs for every slot.</div></div><hr />
