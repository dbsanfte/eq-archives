<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Others have discussed this both on this board and PoN. I think the idea warrents further discussion.<br />
<br />
Mob variation can be used to make the differences between the three major tank classes more important. This would allow increasing Warrior survivability without making Knights no longer useful.<br />
<br />
Knight's could gain spells that would make them more valuable in a mixed mob environment that would not make Warriors useless in turn. Warriors could gain new unique (to the 3 tank classes) disciplines (immune to magic, stonestance, etc.) that would give them a place even in the presence of greater Knight utility.<br />
<br />
Mob variation in a zone can be used to encourage two tank groups (8 person groups might be needed if this were done) where perhaps a Warrior's beef is an advantage against a mob that is immune to magic and hits like a truck while the very next mob has a huge unremovable damage shield that a Paladin might tank with stuns while non-melee in the group kill it.<br />
<br />
What mob abilites are there that might favor one tank class over another?<br />
<br />
I'll start a list, feel free to add to it.<br />
<br />
AE Damage - Paladin<br />
Undead - Paladin, SK<br />
Not affected by spells - Warrior<br />
Unaffected by stun - Warrior, SK<br />
Mana Draining - Warrior<br />
Unremovable damage shield - Paladin<br />
Rampage - two tanks<br />
Self bluring - Knight?<br />
<br />
As a separate exercise, new, underutilzed, or abilities in combination would also be worth exploring.<br />
<br />
A modest start:<br />
DD Reposte (Reverse Damage) - two tanks<br />
AE Heal/Summon pets - Paladin, two tanks<br />
Knockback/Whirl until you Hurl<br />
Fear/Summon - two tanks<br />
Knockback/Snare - Paladin, two tanks<br />
Hits hard and repostes - Warrior (new discipline - Counter Reposte), Knight (new discipline - Shield Reposte)<br />
Unstunable/unslowable - Warrior<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And what'll basically happen is people will ignore the 'difficult' mobs and fight others that aren't, kiters will have a field day with the unused. :p</div></div><hr />

This is something I would really, really enjoy seeing in a game.  For any class or group role, overlap of abilities and strengths can make for a fun fun group.  Whether by design or not, I see a trend in EQ away from the specialist classes towards general classes, and this kind of thing would make that trend more viable and enjoyable IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm suggesting mixing up the population of every zone (or at least new expansions) with these, having fewer static spawns (more roamers - especially named mobs), and increasing mob density.<br />
<br />
This is the opposite of LDoN. Deadly surpises, challange, and unpredictability. No more EQ Lite.<br />
<br />
More:<br />
Shadow Step/Summon<br />
<br />
Pacified/Hidden Danger - Mob is green and indifferent. Touch it or get too close and it transforms into a nasty.<br />
<br />
Hey Rube! - hit it and it calls for and gets help (like CT in Fear but more limited).<br />
<br />
Double Trouble - like Sir Lucan, Black Reavers, etc.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of mob variation in the game, but we generally know what we are in for and can fight on our terms. This needs to change.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Random attacks.<br />
<br />
imagine a mob, you don't know and you CAN'T know what he will do before you engage it.<br />
<br />
No spoilers, his abilities will change every time you engage a new spawn of him. <br />
<br />
It could be be done for exemple with giving o total of ability point to a mob, and when he spawn he choose his attack in the table. for exemple lets take a_regular_random_named01 with 1000 ap, he could &quot;buy&quot; :<br />
<br />
- Hit hard : 200 points<br />
- Hit Very hard : 400points<br />
- Hit Fast : 300 points<br />
- Unslowable : 400 points<br />
- Proc a Lifetap : 300 to 500 points<br />
- Proc a Manatap : 300 to 500 points<br />
- Bazillion hp : 400 points<br />
- Flurry : 300 points<br />
- Rampage : 300 points<br />
- AE rampage : 500 points<br />
- Proc swarm pets : 500 points<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
So basically a 1000 points mob could hit very hard and proc swarm pets, and the next time he proc a lifetap and is unslowable, etc... Instancing bosses, here it come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That would be pretty damn fun, better make sure highly desired loot is on each version, or else no one will bother with it.  That's a pretty fun setup tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SOE should be actively designing events and monsters that play upon the strengths and weaknesses instead of passively making monsters that are no better than drunken brawlers.  An easy weakness of Paladins is they have to be free to cast.  Why are there no raid monsters that proc a single target silence?<br />
<br />
Particularly the idea of having a monster select a tactic that forces the raid to adapt is a great idea.  One source of stagnation in the game is because the monsters are so static.  If you can beat it once you can go back and beat it down again.  If the monster was chosing different strategies then at least the raid has to think in motion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This would be an interesting and fun change, if it were implemented in tandem with some changes to both knights and warriors.  All we have no that knights don't is a VERY small difference in our skill caps. 1.5-3% better avoidance, and /disc defensive.  Basically, anything we can do, you can do, and you can cast spells too.  Until that is addressed, all this idea will do is give us more stuff that a knight can tank just as well as a warrior.  If something like this was implemented in tandem with some serious tweaking of melee classes, it might actually make it worthwhile to have all 3 tank classes in the same group.  At minimum it might make people actually hesitate and weigh the pros and cons of each tank before making a decision when forming a group.  I do like Aeka's analogy to most mobs as drunken brawlers.  One of the biggest problems I've seen with the game since the early days of EQ is that whenever they decide things need to be made tougher they make the mobs hit harder and have more HPs.  Soloing classes in the mid levels are a perfect example of why this concept is retarded.  Jack up a lvl 30 mob to the point where it's melee is insane for it's level, and a necro/druid/shaman/wizard can still kill it just as easily as he used to, all you've done it make it so that a melee class has no hope of killing it solo.  This same trend has continued with group xp mobs and raid encounters too.  It would be damned nice if they could come up with something other than &quot;make it hit harder&quot; when trying to design challenging encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Mob variation can be used to make the differences between the three major tank classes more important. This would allow increasing Warrior survivability without making Knights no longer useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
An interesting idea, but I'm now sure how they could get it right, and apply it properly.<br />
<br />
Case in point:<br />
<br />
&quot;AE Damage - Paladin&quot;<br />
<br />
Why would a paladin be a better tank than anyone else on AE damage, if the healing is there? In fact, the first time I ever encountered AE damage in EQ was against some dragons, and the warriors usually tanked them, back in the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Undead - Paladin, SK&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, not really seeing how any class is a preferred &quot;tank&quot; against an undead boss. In fact, in this instance, a warrior might be the better tank, so you can put the paladins behind the mob and get them a nice DPS boost with their anti-undead type of abilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not affected by spells - Warrior&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh. Maybe. Depends. I mean, a lot of boss mobs already aren't &quot;affected&quot; by the aggro generating spells, but the aggro is still there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unaffected by stun - Warrior, SK&quot;<br />
<br />
What makes warriors and SKs better choices to tank giants, a mob that is already unaffected by stuns?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mana Draining - Warrior&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh. Alright, this might be an instance where melee classes are better are being in melee range.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unremovable damage shield - Paladin&quot;<br />
<br />
Eh, a warrior with a big fat 2hander that has good aggro proc or aggro augment on it can probably do the job just as good as a paladin. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Rampage - two tanks&quot;<br />
<br />
Kind of already exists, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Self bluring - Knight?&quot;<br />
<br />
There is an encounter like this isn't there?<br />
<br />
I dunno. Like I said above, the IDEA is an interesting one. But the application within the framework of everquest's combat system, will be the huge obstacle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like the old griegs end, which of course everyone avoided like the plague.<br />
<br />
About the only way to do something like this would be to raise the max level to 75 and have all mobs over level 70 do it.<br />
<br />
soru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I explored the old grieg's end from one side to the other... in fact there was NOTHING in this zone. It was full of high hp mobs that dropped nothing, except a few named with marginal loot you'll never use. <br />
Except beer googles of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was hoping for LDoN to be more like this.<br />
I'd love to witness this much variety in the game.. engaging a mob and going &quot;holy *&quot;%ç!!&quot;... impossible to know before hand what will happen...<br />
<br />
As much as this would be really sweet ingame, it won't do anything for class balance. Because knights have more strengths then us...<br />
<br />
This sort of stuff might come within the next expansion who knows..<br />
man.. being on the edge of your feet through every fight, and actually dying now and then because the mob was just too damn hard! &lt;3<br />
<br />
<br />
Grieg's end was nothing like this, at all...<br />
the only fun part was the shape shifting, everything else was horrible.<br />
Lots of nameds that didnt drop anything, bad exp, a big waste of time, except for the limited fun with illusions.</div></div><hr />
