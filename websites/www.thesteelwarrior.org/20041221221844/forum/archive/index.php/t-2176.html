<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By now I imagine most if not all have experienced the effect of having your mouse over a chat window, or having an open cursor in a chat window resulting in autorun. Myself, I try to avoid it, but I still get caught a couple times a day and while it has not led to anything more than minor annoyances (which has led to me /bug and /feedback it), I can see where the wrong circumstances, it coud be a raid-breaker.<br />
<br />
Some of my guildmates have said it was actually a feature introduced (for what reason I cannot fathom) and not a bug. If this is so, does anyone know how it can be disabled? I mean we had an autorun key in the past (by default the Num-Lock), what do we need this uncontrollable crap for...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a peice of shit feature. When Alt and Shift got switched in your Keyboard setup thing in options they switched em back to normal and somehow enabled (re-enabled?) this stupid thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate it too, makes it very difficult to try to type commands during a fight AND position myself and the mob.  Maybe I'm wrong but my understanding was that this 'feature' was originally a bug, but some morons decided they liked it, so they kept it around.  I'm positive someone will correct me if I'm wrong =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it only turns into autorun if you walking in that direction and I love that feature for conner tanking and kitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was certainly unintentional.  It used to be, when you enter while holding up arrow you went into autorun.  Now it is reversed: enter, followed by uparrow and look out.  As Baadan mentioned, this happened as part of the alt and shift key fiasco.  I pray it gets fixed soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how do you fix the ALT/SHIFT thing?</div></div><hr />

how do you fix the ALT/SHIFT thing?  <br />
<br />
In EQ, open up the settings panel, go to the Keyboard page, and click the &quot;Reset to Defaults&quot; button.</div></div><hr />

Nothing like running through the MoB, down the hill, into the lava in Nadox...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate this thing.  If I wanted to auto run I'd hit my num lock key.  This just keeps messing up me and many others who aren't used to it.  Gotta love talking to people while working on positioning, only have have the mobs position get messed up because you auto ran straight through him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another recent bug, Selos now stacks with Jboots SoW SoE and all other speed spells, I hate having selos kick in mid fight and I inch foward to the mob only to run between thier legs and thru the next zone before I cant stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think selos stacking with SoE, SoW, etc is a bug.  Personally it is one development that I love.  That way I don't have to click off SoE to get bard speed while moving, so I can still have SoE once I'm away from the bard.  It's also great because you can get the lev from SoE so you don't accidentally 20k if you go out of range of the bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if they could put it back as it was before the patch I'd be a happy camper too. I dont want it taken out thought. That was the only way to auto run backwards and it made chating while runing much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you auto run backwards?<br />
<br />
Chatting while running has always been easy - just hit NumLock and chat away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you could hit Enter and forward at the same time, and you would auto run....<br />
<br />
it got removed somehow, but they wanted to reimplement it for some completely retarded reason...<br />
<br />
but instead of having to hit enter and forward... now its just forward while chatbox is open....<br />
which messes up completely...<br />
<br />
made me almost run into adds a couple of times.. and im sure one of these days its going to happen, and its going to mess things up...<br />
<br />
soe...<br />
sigh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, now I fully understand the difference between how it is now, and how it was before.  I always use that auto-run while typing feature, that's how I'm able to chat so damn much when I have to pull.  But I don't use the arrows to run, I use E S D F... so I don't get the negative effects than they recently introduced.  So you can avoid that crap if you feel like switching your run keys...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the way it was before if I was usuing arrow keys to move backwards or forwards and pressed &quot;Enter&quot; so I can start chating or whatever it would lock you into autorun backwards or forwards. I love that feature. It was totaly screwed prior to last patch ei it was removed. Now its back reimplemented, but still not the way it used to be I take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I HATE this new feature.  The moron who implemented it was obviously in my group tonight in PoS.  Was typing during a pull gone fubared, and ended up running out of range of the healer.  Chanter makes some remark about how he loved the new feature and I said &quot;Oh yeah?  That new feature helped caused your death.  How do you like it now?&quot;</div></div><hr />
