<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zerakel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My warrior has just reached 51 and is currently wielding a fleshgrinder in primary and snowchipper in offhand.  In his rallic pack he also has a swiftblade of zek.  Now, I'm all for selling these three items and buying two new weapons if you could can give me an idea of what to get that will allow me to have decent proc to get and hold aggro.  So do give me some insight on what steps I should take if you believe I would be best off in selling these three.  I've seen some wars with both weapons only having ac/hp/sta/str stats and no procs, and see other wars with both weapons having procs etc.  I've seen some nice weapons 14/22 w/stats, 13/19 w/stats etc, but no proc.  My warrior is a dark elven warrior and this is his magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=720883).  <br />
<br />
I really do like looks and have had an eye towards a splitblade of destruction or something else that looks cool, but the splitblade has no aggro proc so I am not sure if I should look that way or not.  So my question basically is, should I stay with what I have, or if you believe I should change something and it is okay to have weapons with no proc, what weapnos should I get?  Again, I'm not opposed to selling all three and using the money to buy new better weapons.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

Edit: I forgot to add.  If you have some godo advice on armor changes as well, please do tell so I can make the adjustments.  I three-box this 51 war, a 65 rogue and a 64 druid and tend to do alot of Seb 6r farming, so money I can get.  But I doubt I could raise more than 150k since I don't have the patience anymore to wait that long.  So if you need a budget to help me with my weapons and armor, just go with me having 150k in my bank.</div></div><hr />
