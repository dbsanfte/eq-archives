3 small bricks of medium quality ore + 1 flask of water = 1 large brick of medium quality ore. Alternatively: 12 silver + 1 silver = 6 plat. It's a 5000% profit margin. A bot macrod at a rate of 26 combines per minute (8 10 slot bags) will make 9600 platinum per hour<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried it and can confirm that it does work,or at least did this morning of dec 8.Under normal circumstnaces it would take a person ages to make any amount of money off this,However with a macro program as stated above you can rack up the change quick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets hope this is actually what has been the platinum making scheme and not just some other one and lets hope sony gets on this and gets it fixed quick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plat getting added via exploits basically further divides rich and poor in the game.  I used to do a lot of bazaar trading and I've got about 60k in the bank.  However, the stuff I would like to buy has doubled and tripled in price over the last 2 months....effectively making my 60k worth about half what it was.  <br />
<br />
The more plat exploits out there, the less us &quot;non-exploiters&quot; effectively have to spend (since the items are going up in price so fast, thereby making the plat we have worth less.)<br />
<br />
Yes, if I ever get a high end droppable item I can make some good plat and buy something I want...but I'm generally not in an uber group to get those drops and I always play NBG.  (and raid drops go to the guild so they don't count)<br />
<br />
It's not a game killer at this point, but I definitely think this type of thing hurts EQ in the long run.  Think about new players...they're the ones that are really screwed because everyone they group with expects a minimal level in gear and they have no way to get that gear since the prices are skyrocketing so quickly...that is, unless they find an exploit.<br />

Anyway...my 2 copper...</div></div><hr />

best thing you can do in EQ is buy a item you know wont drop in worth all that much, such as ornate, haste items, high end spells.<br />
<br />
same reason people buy gold from the US mint, it wont drop in price if something goes wrong</div></div><hr />

<br />
______________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheaters and the recent up swell of concern (12-8-03)<br />
Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication.  Rumors and speculation have begun to run rampant, and I've received a lot of concerned email on the topic.<br />
<br />
First of all, I want to thank you for your concern.  The fact that you worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the community that I work for.  I want to especially thank those that have sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or exploit situations.  That information has been very helpful.<br />
<br />
With your help, we have been able to discover and eliminate some unusual ways of cheating.  Obviously I can't go into detail about exactly how this cheating was done.  I can tell you that several of our programmers and designers took lengthy breaks from working on their current tasks to define, investigate and smash those exploits.  Most of these methods for cheating have been removed.  The few that remain will be fixed shortly.  We will be watching, and anyone using them will be banned.<br />
<br />
At the same time, our Customer Service folks have been diligently tracking down the cheaters.  We have banned accounts and deleted characters in the hundreds.  It's never a good thing to be forced to remove so many accounts, and we're not happy that such cheating was possible.  We are pleased, however, to let you know that we are confident that we have located the majority of those that exploited the game and have removed their characters or accounts.<br />
<br />
Obviously we won't be able to prevent all of the possible ways to cheat.  The folks that insist on trying to cheat have proven to be persistent and clever (and here is where I wonder why they don't apply that energy and skill to something beneficial...).  We need your help to locate these issues.  The multitude of eyes and ears of our players is always the best source of information for us.  If you ever suspect that you have discovered something that seems like an exploit, please send that information to us through the Developer's Corner AND through /bug.  Please don't assume we have heard the information already.  We'd rather have ten reports about something like this than none.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to address a rumor about the nature of some of the cheating that people have been talking about.  There has been speculation in the community that in order to pull off some of the rumored exploits someone had to be working on the &quot;inside&quot;.<br />
<br />
We take such possibilities very seriously.  And we have investigated this very thoroughly.  We keep track of all special EverQuest commands issued.  We have looked into the possibility that someone working here had a hand in helping others cheat, and we have discovered no evidence that indicates that to be the case.  Also, the nature of the cheat did not require such inside help.  I can't describe the cheat method in any detail, but there was an experience cheat that allowed extremely fast leveling.  This required some rather sophisticated cheating, but was being done without inside help.  Obviously we have removed that exploit and banned any accounts that used it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for playing EverQuest.  And thank you for you help making the game fun.<br />
<br />
Have a great holiday season.<br />
<br />

<br />
Nope. The thing you are linking to is a macro. Not a dupe. There's a difference.<br />
<br />
Both are cheats, and not allowed in everquest. But the dupe is a different way of cheating.<br />
<br />
Read Alan's post, and you'll not get any idea of what the cheat was, BUT you should get some sense that the cheats they were looking to stop were different than a simple pricing error on ore.<br />
<br />
However the ore pricing error is also a bug/problem/macro/cheat I hope they have fixed or are going to fix.</div></div><hr />

When I just started this game about a year and a half ago I was extremely interested in learning to smith before I realized the time and platinum sink I would have to make to be anywhere close to money making at it.  I figured this one out just by going through the motions of learning to smith, when I was below lvl 20 I'd do this combine and sell back the results for a method of making money that was unbeatable at that level.  That was the way I afforded my first set of crusty armor.  I understand that macroing is where the issue comes in, there's no way I would consider this type of thing profitable at my lvl now unless I was able to exponentially speed up the process.  <br />
<br />
I think it would be a shame to have to change the pricing on this just because a few idiots are so greedy they have to exploit it.  Learning a trade skill is already a big enough money sink without them making it so its not profitable at all anymore, but I suppose thats probably the only way they're going to stop things like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks to being in the army and serveing overseas I cannot join my guild on raids and such except for maybe 1-2 times a week.  So all my cash I get gets saved up to buy my gear so that I am not shorting one of my guildies that raids more then I do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a time where you could reap a profit in fletching for making Shadewood Compound bows, IF you could tinker your own bow cams.<br />
<br />
But macroing was abused doing this. And they poofed the merchants for a week, adjusted prices and now you can't make the profit.<br />
<br />
It's just the way they fix these problems. You can still make the bows to skill up on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious Khazzuz, which combine did you do a year and a half ago to MAKE pp smithing ?  I've been smithing for 3 years, and this is only the 2nd time I've seen a combine that actually made money selling back to merchants.  The first was silvered weapons, which were nerfed pretty quickly, and this pricing bug has only been around for about 3 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I went back and looked at the exact combine he was talking about, and no, I didn't do that exact combine, I suppose I read it wrong initially and didn't notice the medium quality part.  However, when starting from the ground up, meaning if you start by combining 3 pieces of ore to make small bricks of ore and continuously combining up to blocks of ore, you can indeed make a profit by selling this back to merchants.  You can sell the small bricks, large bricks, blocks at any point along the chain and still make a small profit, however the greatest profit came when you made up to blocks, with the largest risk of failure along the way of course.  <br />
<br />
I'll check this again today when I log in, but I'm certainly not talking out my ass about this one, I did indeed do this extensively when I started playing.  I'm sure you can imagine how large of a pain in the ass it was though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That must bite the big one, and maybe a little bit of the small one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loredena</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On EQ Traders Absor posted that they weren't penalizing folks doing this combine in the course of skilling up, but rather those who were doing nothing but this combine, for significant periods of time.   Skillers versus macroers for plats should be readily distinguishable, this is a relatively low skill item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, went back and tested this.  I remember being able to make money on ore combines, albeit small, but it no longer works at this point.  Where there used to be a gold or two profit with ore there is now a loss of about a gold or two.  But I did eventually remember that it wasn't the ore that I had determined the most profitable for my effort, my results are below:<br />
<br />
In Kaladim, my home city, with a charisma of 110.<br />
Small pieces of ore @ 4 silver, 4 copper<br />
Water Flask @ 5 copper<br />
<br />
Total cost for one small brick of ore (3 small pieces of ore + 1 water flask): 1 gold, 3 silver, 7 copper.<br />
Total cost to make one sheet metal (2 small bricks of ore + 1 water flask): 2 gold, 7 silver, 9 copper.<br />
Merchants buy sheet metal @ 9 gold, 5 silver, 2 copper<br />
A profit of 6 gold, 7 silver, 3 copper per sheet metal assuming no failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I say Khazzuz, I'm just curious, because I wasn't able to find combines that you could make and sell back to a vendor for a profit, other than the 2 short-lived examples I listed above.  I tried everything, including ore conversions.  I started smithing right when I was a poor, broke newb, so every copper was important. Just wish I'd seen that combine when I was skilling up... lol farming pp for smithing literally took months of my play time.  Damn, I'd hate to know how many hours I spent baking fish rolls, because you could actually make around 30pp an hour on them :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was apparently a conscious design &quot;decision&quot; that no tradeskill combine that was completely vendor purchaseable and/or forageable would ever sell for more than it cost to make.  Unfortunately, there was obviously no automated tool to ensure this was the case, so there have been any number of these &quot;exploits&quot; over the years.  Not like it'd be rocket science to code something up to check TS/quest combines either, wonder what they were thinking...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Making a profit of 6 gold on several combines, that doesn't seem as bad, spending 4 silver and doing a nofail (or incredibly low fail) combine and getting 6pp back...that's bad. (Yes, I checked this myself yesterday, and then today)<br />
<br />
Anyways, just letting people know that it's been fixed.  Servers came down last night, I believe.  The sell back price for the large bricks has been lowered to 2 silver or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashbomba</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">used to be able to make toolboxes for a profit. if i remember right it was 2 metal bits and a flask for a toolbox and the merchants bought back at like few plat. did this to make money when i first started playing/smithing course you could only do this 7 times seem toolboxes are containers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilsofa</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget that when you're doing the math about how much you lose for each recipe, you need to account for your failure rate.  &quot;Assuming no failures&quot; will get you a number that is actually incorrect. amd can be significantly far off the mark.<br />
<br />
For lowlevel recipes like we're talking about here, you can assume the player has a skill level high enough to get the maximum success rate which is supposed to be 95 percent.  This means that, on average, out of every 20 combines you should fail 1.  I've done a lot of hardcore tradeskilling and I can tell you that you can take this to the bank - you might see lucky streaks on short runs of less than 60 or so, but in the long run you WILL get that 5 percent failure rate.<br />
<br />
Therefore, a recipe can appear to give a small profit for each combine &quot;assuming no failures&quot;, but if you account for a 1 out of 20 failure rate, the recipe will actually lose a small amount of money.<br />
<br />
The way Alan talks about complicated methods of cheating makes me wonder about Jewelcraft Mastery - I kind of remember it being fixed in a patch a few months ago.  If that is true, then perhaps it was working just a tiny bit better than it was supposed to on a recipe or two.  This is pure speculation on my part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ebay it of course.<br />
<br />
im sure its the macroing of this cheat which was the primary reason the players involved were supposedly banned. macroing is bannable anyway and to the extent that its used for powerleveling or power platinum making i think it should be bannable since its flagrant enough that no one could realistically say &quot;i didnt know there was something wrong with this&quot;.<br />
<br />
sony's policy is &quot;all trades are final&quot; hence they will not repay you back for an item lost to a trade scam. at the same time they have always banned career scammers.<br />
<br />
compromised accounts are subject to banning. theoretically they can ban you for letting your wife play on your account though i serious doubt they ever would. proven ebayed accounts i suspect are always banned.<br />
<br />
eq cheat code has been sold on the (black) market for a long time.understand if you so much as download such code from a public website the update patcher CAN find it if programmed to check for it. so you do it at serious risk. i suspect the risk is much greater after this incident since theyve put much programming effort into finding those who have partaken in these recent scams. so even if you want to look into such cheat programs purely out of curiousity i suggest you think long and hard about what risk you are taking.</div></div><hr />
