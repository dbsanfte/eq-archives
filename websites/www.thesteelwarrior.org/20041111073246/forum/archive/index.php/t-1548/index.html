<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, who are you talking to here Dobbo?  There is an imbalance that needs to be fixed, and really, SOE doesn't listen to almost anything.  Have to be loud before they can hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shutup the hell up you $#@!ing babies.<br />
<br />
I'll shutup when they $*(@*# fix us and not a moment before.  k, thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you think they are gonna fix us before Lost Dungeons? no if they even do there i'd be personally amazed. so just wait for that. but you guys seriously. i know there is some problems but i think we whine a little too much. we have 2 whole places just for complaining. we used to have 0. i know theres a problem but we gotta stop posting the same thing over again and make something worthy of sending to SoE and then MAYBE they might listen to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">also, glatius i like what you wrote. didn't hold back. also there isn't a ton of problem when theres not a knight in the group. Yesterday i was invited to a bc group (the cave left of gy in PoV) with a 65 rogue from the 2nd best guild and a pretty well decked 65 monk. and for some reason i hold aggro pretty good till we got 3 (no ench) so maybe the problem isn't really our aggro ability. just the knights inability to keep aggro away. Note the rogue and monk where probably evading alot or whatever. but we killed quick exp was rocking and the only time i had trouble also was on slows. But for me slows are difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dobbo, you're not telling me anything I haven't heard before, a couple of dozen times at least.  First off, the problem is not knights stealing aggro.  The problem is, for the most part, the slower getting the crap beat out of them on a regular basis.  Doesn't your group slower take aggro regularly?  I bet they do.  Does taunt always work on the first or second try?  I seriously doubt that it does.  Does your slower die once in a while because the combination of resisted slows, failed taunts, and mis-timed heals?  I'd bet serious money that they do.  Do you realize that every time your slower dies in this kind of situation the chances are that a knight wouldn't have had the same thing happen?  Do you realize how much more stress and effort is involved with the healer having to not only worry about timing your complete heal correctly given the massive damage of PoP mobs but also worrying about getting fast heals on the slower in time to save them?  Do you think either the slower or the healer are really kean about this arrangement?  Do you really think it's one they will jump into if they can easily avoid it?  If you do, why?  Why on god's green earth would a slower and healer, looking for a tank, say let's get the guy who is going cause us more stress and grief and possibly less experience in the long run over the guy who can make our lives easier?<br />
<br />
No one claims that Warriors can't tank.   The point is that while we can tank, using a Knight at this time is just a hell of a lot more fun for the people who ususally make that decision.  Isn't the game about entertainment?  Having fun?  Is sitting at the zone line being passed over for a Knight with worse gear and fewer AAXP than you because they have an inherent ability to keep the mobs off the slower and/or healer really your idea of a good time?<br />
<br />
No one guarantees us that we'll be able to find a pick up group when we log on.  If most guilds are like the guilds I've been in, your guild doesn't guarantee you a slot either.  If we're less fun to group with than another tank class, people will ditch us and take the other tank class.  Right now, using a Warrior tank, with the possible exception of Warriors who have the best aggro weapons in the game, really isn't very much fun for either the slower or the healer in PoP.  And the other classes are finding their lives are easier with a Knight tank as well, which is influencing who they prefer.  What does this add up to you?  Can you do the math on it?<br />
<br />
So before you tell people to shutup about it, consider this.  We all spend our $13.  We've all put in massive amounts of time and energy into leveling and aquiring gear.  And at this time one group of players is receiving more entertainment value for their $13 a month over us because of a flaw in the game.  We're no less worthy.  We've jumped through the hoops just the same as everyone else.  You might even argue that we've jumped through more hoops because our character type is gear dependent to the extreme, even beyond the hybrid tanks.  Yet here we are, a less valued commodity through no fault of our own.<br />
<br />
And you want me to shutup?  Not on your #*@#* life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dobo, if you want to bury your head in the sand about the warrior issues and not work to try to be heard, fine. <br />
<br />
DO NOT BERATE THOSE OF US WHO WANT THE PROBLEMS SOLVED!<br />
<br />
There is a problem with the warrior class. Only a few people say there isn't anything wrong or that there is no way to fix it. They are part of the problem.<br />
<br />
When you come here and tell us to essentially STFU about the warrior problems, you become part of the problem.<br />
<br />
Your game play may be unaffected by the problems and inequalities warriors face today. Good for you, but damnit at this point you are either for warriors getting fixed or you are against it, and it appears that you are against warriors getting fixed. <br />
<br />
Folks, it is going to take a lot of work, a lot of perseverence to get the devs to hear us let alone listen to us. We have been trying over  the last year to get changes, to get our problems addressed. But now we are organised, the devs have acknowledged that pure melee have problems, we can not just shut up and go home now. <br />
<br />
Because of people like you Dobo, we will just have to shout louder and longer, but I don't think anyone is truely ready to give up and throw in the towl. It is not the warrior way.<br />
<br />
If you want to act that way, go be a ball-less, pansy ass paladin. We are warriors here and we will fight (aka complin, discuss, and petition) until we are heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nice edit btw dobbin ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">aveen. i want to help us gett problems. theres no burying i want to do. i have problems getting aggro. but we don't need to make thread after thread after thread after thread about the same thing.<br />
<br />
lol thanks valeris. i don't think most people got what i meant the first time. so i said it straight foward.<br />
<br />
2nd edit: also aveen. this is what i'm trying to say. MAYBE the devs might read something if we create a really long good list of idea's on how to make taunt work. we don't have to write the same thing over with a couple to 20 posts again. devs won't see greatness about that. now also. i was doing the same thing as raaj kinda only i would send an email to SOE developers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You're right, we don't need half a dozen new threads a week started on the same topic.  But apparently every person who has an idea they think is new or some insight they think is new, when usually it isn't, just starts another thread.<br />
<br />
Also, no offense Dobbo, but the people who insist on starting new threads to tell the rest of us to stop whinning and to stop making new threads aren't really helping the problem either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i'm helping what little i can. but i can't see the good posts with all these new threads. i'm glad raaj stickied so then i know where to get<br />
<br />
god i love edit: also now instead of posting new idea's in new threads do it on the sticky since it's on top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is no reason of having a dedicated forum for class balance if people can only post to one thread. <br />
<br />
If that were the case Raaj would have been smart and made on thread and stickied it in the Arena or Outhouse. <br />
<br />
It can be annoying that half a dozen new threads are started to discuss a whim of an idea. However, the bad ones are going to naturally die off anyhow and the good ones will stick around long enough for them to get added to the post at the top of the forum.<br />
<br />
To tell people to stop complainaing, or stop posting is anti-productive to the purpose of this forum and the cause of warriors. <br />
Which is what you did Dobbo and then you tried to hide behind some edits. <br />
<br />
If you feel that people are using this forum in a way that is inconsistant with what the moderators intended, I sugesst you take it up with the moderators, namely Raaj. <br />
<br />
Until then, you will only serve to alienate youself from the community when you tell us to stop complaining or that it wont do any good.  What you intended to say after several edits and what you origionally said, and then replied to Glatius are very different in their intentions and meanings.<br />
<br />
On the off chance that the dev team will read this forum, they will be more enticed to come back if they see that it is active, flowing with ideas, good and bad. If they see that some of the members of our class would rather we stop complaining, they will probably use that as misinformation that we are all happy, just like what they said at the release of PoP. <br />
<br />
Even though there is an edit button, consider your words wisely. People will look here both to help us and to hinder us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't wanna take sides here Dobbo but this is THE forum for the disscussion of class balancing. So of course there will be repeatitive posting.Granted we need to get our ideas organized but until we come up with a majority concensus on what we want done it will continue to be hashed out in threads before we post it in the sticky :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yes but we should turn the war room and the outhouse into one forum. also i'm gonna end this conversation. i take back some of what i said. but maybe we could combine these two forums to one forum. like the warhouse or something.<br />
<br />
edit: btw sorry if i was a little harsh my guild going through a desperate moment we lost 3 officers. in 2 days. you have the right to be mad at me but don't be too mad please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dobbo is right, but I think it needs to be taken a step further.  If I were a Dev for Sony, I would see pages and pages of whines here.  Would I want to sift through all the redundant whines to find good suggestions?  <br />
<br />
No.  Even if I did, I might mistakenly skip a very good idea while scrolling through the whines.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion, have a Moderator-only thread that lists our suggestions.  Someone should make a suggestion in a new thread, then people can post comments about the idea.  Once enough people buy into that idea, then the Moderator can post the original idea to the Stickied list of accepted ideas.  <br />
<br />
This way people can read through the sticky to get the ideas ALREADY mentioned so we dont repeat ourselves.  <br />
<br />
THEN, Devs, if they should decide to read our forums, will have a single thread with only ideas that most of us like.  They will have to sift through nothing.  <br />
<br />
Fuck, make each suggestion a Poll.  The first post lists the idea and the Poll is Agree, Disagree.  If the Poll gets 10 (or whatever) Agree votes, and a 60% approval rate overall (or whatever) then it gets added to the moderator only post.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah kiddies, don't fucking debate on the 10 votes or 60% approval rating if you like the idea, that's not the point.  If the Mods like this idea then let them decide the exact system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">err...check the sticky in this very forum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">a Moderator-only thread<br />
<br />
so we all make a suggestion<br />
then if we think it's good. you mods add it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">its not the place of the mod to  decide if its a good idea.<br />
<br />
they have been taking ideas and editing the thread to listing just the ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">if WE think it's good  then the mod adds it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When you can learn to read Landrain, please feel free to post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">And exactly how are they to know if its a good idea, that WE all think is a good idea, if only they can post?<br />
<br />
NO you think, and read...<br />
<br />
A moderator only thread...<br />
<br />
And This is the ONLY place to post ideas..<br />
<br />
UMMM? <br />
<br />
And WE are supposed to say if we like it?<br />
<br />
HOW, we cant post... its MODERATOR ONLY...<br />
<br />
That Aint gonna work...<br />
<br />
THINK...<br />
<br />
IT already being done..<br />
<br />
People who complain about people discussing and trying to come up with ideas, are not part of the solution...<br />
<br />
THEY are part of the problem...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ok sorry. i thought he meant something like we make new threads. we vote on them on the new threads. then in the mod only thread they add it if it gets like 70% yes thats a good idea. sorry the first time i didn't go into enough info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I did Dobbo.  At least you can read.</div></div><hr />

There ya go again Landrain.  I did not want to re-post something that is right in front of your face, but since you have shown complete incompetence and ignorance, I figured I'd help ya out.  <br />
<br />
By the way, do you need this kind of hand holding for everything you do?  Thanks for demonstrating to all of our readers how fucking incompetent we can be here.  That's the way to give our ideas credibility.</div></div><hr />
