<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm currently in a &quot;confused&quot; state as to what i should go after as far as weapon choice so i thought i bring it to here and get some opinions going.  <br />
<br />
questions:<br />
<br />
1.  is there a &quot;good&quot; bridge between greatstaff of 4winds and BoW?  been looking for something to go between a 41/31 and 48/32 but having problems to fill the gap.  anyone got any ideas as to what i may want to go after?  i'm currently in a &quot;pre elem&quot; guild and want to see if i want to just burn my ang3 on the 4wind stick? or hold out for a BoW quality weapon before burning my 1150 points.<br />
<br />
2.  the age old question of 2h vs 1h...  would a GSo4W be &quot;better&quot; then tooling around with BoC + club of the mad researcher?  I know 1h will give me more aggro but is it really a good trade off considering the riposte i'll be eating?<br />
<br />
3.  would a &quot;fully loaded&quot; club of the mad researcher (17/20 ang3) be main handed or BoC + ang3 be main handed?<br />
<br />
4.  would BoC out aggro a double edged stormblade?  or would it be about the same aggro?<br />
<br />
thanx for your opinions and hopefully i'd get some good ones:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.) Bloodied Berserker Blade drops off of Seru, its good enough on its own, slap anger 3 on it and the only thing you would need to pick up a BoW for is cause its trendy.<br />
<br />
2.) i personally like 2 1handers over 1 2hander. i would hit up the BoC/club over that staff anyday, especially with anger procs on them. i have a BoC and a blackout, both with anger procs and with just WA2, the agro i build up is jsut absourd. riptose damage is negligable unless your raid tanking and geting 2k-3k riptoses imho.<br />
<br />
3.)i think they'd be close to even... again, just my opinion... mainhand the club, better ratio = better dps = prettier numbers = happy<br />
<br />
4.) again, about the same, or close enough that your not gonna straght up notice a difference, both would be more then efficient into elem's+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) What you should be looking at IMO is the procs in the weapons you are talking about I think peronally that the GSo4W with an Anger 3 Aug compares quite nice to a Unaugged BoW. But thats Just Me.. In betweeen those 2 there isnt much as far as dmg/delay goes other than SEW's, which is a great weapon in it's self.<br />
<br />
2) Depends on what you are looking for DPS? Agro? .... Boc and club ( especially Auged)  would be better Agro then a non auged GSo4W.... Auged GSo4W should be Awsome Agro with less reposte. win in my book =) ... <br />
<br />
3)  would main hand the club but, thats just me ...<br />
<br />
4) Yes !!!</div></div><hr />

There really isn't much that you're going to find to be better ratio than the staff unless you're in EPs. Really, you're looking at it the wrong way. You really want an aggro setup, which would be a BoW, SEWS or the like, or a DW setup like a BoC and GBoS or something. The staff is really more of a DPS weapon; the proc isn't much aggro at all.<br />

<br />
Ripostes are over rated on most mobs. Sometimes they can cause spikes and kill you. Most of the time they're not significant enough to worry about. EP gods/minis can hit hard enough in a round that an extra hit via riposte could be an issue, otherwise don't really worry about ripostes.<br />
<br />
3. would a &quot;fully loaded&quot; club of the mad researcher (17/20 ang3) be main handed or BoC + ang3 be main handed? <br />
<br />
  BoC mainhand. 2 aggro procs primary &gt; 1 aggro proc primary. DPS isn't overwhelming for aggro.<br />
<br />
4. would BoC out aggro a double edged stormblade? or would it be about the same aggro? <br />
<br />
BoC wins. Again, DPS just isn't that good of aggro for us. You will never win a DPS war with a rogue or wizard, you HAVE to use something else to get ahead.</div></div><hr />
