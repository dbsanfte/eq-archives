<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, the guild i'm in is mainly 46-61 and we are currently trying to recruit players. Theres one guild on my server that is ALL 65 and they almost ALL have a full set of Plane of Time gear and that just shocks me. The way my guild gained 46+ members was through an alliance with a lowbie guild. When the alliance broke we decided t open our doors to lower lvl characters. What i'm trying to figure out is a way to recruit new members to the guild but still keep the guild a raiding guild. Any hints? We currently only have roughly 140 members mainly between the levels of 30-61. alot are in their high 40's mid 50's. I'm currently the highest lvl war in the guild(58) and the most the highest in our guild is a lvl 61 cleric and a 61 shammy<br />
<br />
All i'm asking is ways to improve the guild i'm in to make it more appealing to more players.<br />
Thanks to all in advance who at least read this post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have the active players in your guild level up until you have about a 24-30 person group of lvl 50-55 players.<br />
<br />
From there you can farm Growth, or Hate, or Kael Arena until your guild is fully equipped.<br />
<br />
And you just work your way up from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">quality is always better than quantity. 140 i waaay too many imo.<br />
<br />
your problem will be that your numbers are too great and the level range too disparate to cater to everyone. if i were you i would stop recruiting, concentrate on levelling up people.<br />
<br />
have set goals for the guild - raid objects, end goals. do you want this so be social, social /raid or pure raid guild? <br />
<br />
this may sound tough but you may want to cut down your numbers either by people leaving, or disbanding those who are just too casual or not in line with the guild goals.<br />
<br />
as the other poster said - ideally you want about 30-50 people of 50 plus who are regular players - that way you have a lot of raid options. <br />
<br />
have a detailed questionnaire onthe applications and vet all new members or make them go through probation. the last thing u want is people from all over the world in the guild as coordinating raid times will be v hard.<br />
<br />
take a look at the good guilds on your server and their websites - that will give you a good idea of what the good guilds are about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my old guild Divine Legend did the same as what you did Fulrik...when it was first formed Plane of Fear was a longshot......but we had a solid base of 50 or so players who literally broke their asses trying trying trying and being dedicated to bettering ourselves and one day growing and takign on the harder targets we thought were impossible.<br />
A lot happened. We had a great reputation which is key for a guild. Don't be a bunch of zerg_rush idiots who think quantity&gt;quality. Plan yourselves targets, farm farm farm that gear you'll need. Plan events to get to meet your guildmates and make yourself visible to them ( no one likes a guildleader who's always logged off or busy doing other stuff and not being with the troops )...and I cannot stress this enough..never get yourself down no matter what happens.<br />
My old guildleader is a ... cleric. Yup, he set the tone for the guild; he is one of the most dedicated and responsible people you'd meet; and besides the typical stress moments everyone faces..has always been there for the guild through thick and thin...<br />
<br />
And people notice that. That is when you start becoming a visible presence on your server. Others who see and respect that will help you out when things don't go right. I think most every other ub3ruild on our server has helped my old guild out at some point or the other because of who we were and what we all did in order to keep our cred and respect in-tact.  <br />
<br />
You're also going to have to realise along the way you are bound to lose people. You're going to run into idiots who try to act on their own premise; not on what the guild ( whom should be your friends not just your guildmates ) and they'll only be there for the lewts and nothign else. Weed them out; keep your base players who have been there and always be honest and up front with them and soon enough you'll be amongst the top end players on your server.<br />
<br />
Two years ago we were barely in the PoH/PoF able guilds. Today; they are just about ready to crack into the elemental planes and have a very solid and capable raid force and respect and work with each other as a team. <br />
<br />
Quality is always a more important factor than quantity. Teamwork&gt;all. As an example Hussar's guild isn't very big in relation to most of the pure_raiding guilds; yet if you see a list of their capable targets and recent victories you'd be dumbfounded. They are very tight and work incredibly as a team.<br />
<br />
Basically it's work. Keep at it; never say die; and the world will beat a path to your door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like others said, you dont need 140 or more people. There's very few things you cant do (pre-PoP) with 4 groups of high level, highly skilled people..or less.<br />
<br />
The most important things are; a good leader, a disciplined team, and levels. Having uber gear helps, but can be overcome if you have these three things going for you. And with these things, the gear will come eventually as your accomplishments grow.<br />
<br />
And a lot of it starts with the leader, since there seem to be very few good leaders out there who can hold a guild together a long time.<br />
<br />
A good leader has to be successful. Nobody is going to follow a leader that leads them into failure after failure. He has to set goals and accomplish them time and time again.<br />
<br />
A good leader has to willingly and happily sacrifice his own needs for those of the guild. He knows the more he gives to the guild (in time, loot, whatever), the stronger they become. <br />
<br />
A good leader does not pull rank on his members, unless absolutely necessary. If such need arises, it should be done privately whenver possible - not in front of the team. This is probably the hardest thing for most leaders to learn and practice. If a member challenges the leader openly during a raid, then it must be dealt with immediately and harshly. If a member challenges the leader openly at any other time, the leader must let him have their say. If the leader is truly a good leader, he will not need to defend himself because his team will defend him.<br />
<br />
A leader can, and sometimes must, be a tyrant in action. But if the leader is benevolent and generous off the field, he will earn his team's trust and loyalty and they can forgive and will come to understand his actions on the field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thank you all for the advice,<br />
Let me shed a little more light on this guild o' mine...<br />
I was an officer but i decided to leave at one point because it was too much pressure but i left only for a day, came back becaiuse they all wanted me back. Currently, i'm a member but peeps seem to still look at me as an officer.<br />
<br />
Our leader is a 55 ranger, he is very, very quiet. He speaks almost always in tells, and only speaks in guild chat when the need arises. Our second in charde is the 61 cleric, he is the one who leads us into battle alot of the time. Only sad part is, he gets on at midnight when alot of the force has gone to sleeps.<br />
<br />
we have 139 members to be exact, and to say the least...alot are alts. One person has a lvl 56 main, and 5 alts around 40-50 which are pretty useful, i myself have 2 alts that are reallty not important, My main is a 58 warrior(highest in guild). I spoke to the guys today and told them instead of playing alts they should concentrate as much as possible on getting there mains to at least 60, i mself have put all else aside and have been grinding my ass off. We are mainly a social guild but we hope to become more of a raiding guild. <br />
<br />
Thats why i consulted you guys. My guild is more or less like this, 20 druids about lvl's 30-55, 8 clerics same range roughly, a handful of chanters(56,58, and a KEI'er and others the same range as the clerics), same for warriors. But what we have alot in one case, we lack alot in others. We have 2 bards both 50-55, 1 beastlord i know of who is 53, no rogues that i know of(how do we expect to do CoM or overking?) 2 shamans that are of some use atleast(51 and 61) and thats just the main group the rest are either alts or lowbies.<br />
<br />
So how can we hope to recruit more clerics and shamans and rogues? If we don't recruit its not like i can pull em out of my hat!.<br />
<br />
That is my only complaint all your other imput was fabulous and i will put it to work right away!<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a guild on my server that has a pretty interesting presentation on guilds, and how to make them prosper.  Only disclaimer is, that is it one(or a couple) persons view of what a guild should be.  I dont agree with everything in it, but a lot of work has been put into it, and it would probably be helpful to any guild out there.<br />
http://www.eqclanx.com/ is the website, Look for the links to thier vision, thats the presentation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raid guilds with low level mains simply don't work.  It's fine to have some people who are more casual than others but a level 35 character is not only useless but an actual liability on a raid designed for 60-65s.  If people want alts that's fine but if you want raiding to be successful you need to require that everyone get at least 1 char to within a couple levels of where your main raid force is.<br />
<br />
Having that large of a level spread just breeds dissention.  Anything the higher level people want to do the lower level people are useless for.  Anything the lower level people want to do is pointless for the higher level people.  In that type of situation your highest level people are going to either bail on you and join a true raid guild or retire their main and work on alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say and largly spread guild will have problems, but thats the thing. We have to count on the lower levels in our guild to gt to 65 to strengthen the raid force. Its not as easy at it sounds to recruit a lvl 55 shammy these days, you have to catch em while the're free, and they are usually only freen in the first 1 - 15 levels before some guild grabs them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say and largly spread guild will have problems, but thats the thing. We have to count on the lower levels in our guild to gt to 65 to strengthen the raid force <br />
<br />
That will not happen.  Ever.  The people who are 65 already will not wait around for you to get your act in gear very long.   If they're 65 in a guild that doesn't do anything, they're going to be applying for uber guilds and you're going to be left with the people that don't play.<br />
<br />
You need a core group of players...2 or 3 groups of 55+ is probably enough to get started.  Once you have that, you need to do things nitely with those people and you need to keep moving onward and upward.  Make it clear to the rest of the guild that if they want to do things, they need to get their asses to 55 ASAP.  Anyone that doesn't is dead weight and can't help you anyway.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking that you need 140 people in your guild...you don't.  Start with Velious progression, you're not going to be killing Rallos Zek next week, you need to start from the bottom and work your way up.  Get your core group of people equipped with Kael/PoG gear...maybe it will entice a few more to get to 55 to help the guild out.  Work on HoT after that, maybe the thought of killing dragons will spur more initiative to climb.  Once you've got a group of well equipped players, you can start looking at the next phase, but for right now, you need to weed out the people who are going to be with you for the long haul and the people who are just there for green chat.  Figure out who your hardcore 55+ people are and keep them busy.  If you don't, you're going to lose them waiting for the 30's to catch up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If all else fails you will still have this to fall back on so to speak.<br />
<br />
The guild I'm in has been around for most of EQ, and though we don't have the numbers to do the big stuff we have the respect of our peers. There has been quite a few of our members that have moved on to bigger raid guilds and the tag has helped them because of the reputation.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I would hate to be an officer in charge of that many people, but I wish you luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, they need to level and pronto.  I'd rather have a 55 (ideally 60 or higher, tho) character in a place like HoT than a lvl 46 who will be doing more dying than anything else.  (Old world planes are a slightly different matter.)  Btw, my guild chat is blue... :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i made a list of the members we have a filtered out the inactive and  people below 46 alts are still here though.<br />
Here it is:<br />
3 bards,<br />
6 clerics,<br />
10 druids,<br />
4 enchanters,<br />
5 monks,<br />
4 necro's,<br />
no pallies/beastlords,<br />
6 rangers,<br />
12 warriors(including myself)<br />
6 ShadowKnights,<br />
4 wizards,<br />
3 Shammy's,<br />
3 rougues.<br />
Thats all our members who are all above 46 but no higher than 61<br />
Total members in Explorer's Unity: 140<br />
Of those members, 49 are alts of people and 32 are inactive(alts and members)<br />
People above 46(invluding alts and inactives) 73<br />
There ya have it took me awhile to do that. <br />
I am thinking of starting to use the 3 groups 55+a night things, i hope it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will disagree with hass on one thing :<br />
- Weed out those only here for the /gu<br />
<br />
Everything above is great advice, exept that (for me at least).<br />
<br />
There are 2 people in EQ : Raiders &amp; Socialisers.<br />
<br />
A Raiding guild needs HC players. And has to keep those HC busy.<br />
A guild of Socialisers &amp; Casuals doesnt need that. They are here for their friends.<br />
<br />
If you plan to move foward, do not GET RID of the good socialisers.<br />
They are a very important part of every guild.  <br />
<br />
A Good casual player is someone who logs to see friends.<br />
Even if he doesnt have the lvl/aa to be with them he will just stick around to chat.<br />
<br />
Do not get rid of these, they play a important morale role.<br />
Just clearly warn them that they are not keeping up with the current objectives.<br />
<br />
That they will always be welcome &amp; accepted under 2 conditions :<br />
-They Accept LESSER HAVING RIGHTS than normal members<br />
-They do not WHINE about not beeing able to participate<br />
<br />
I was in a guild a bit like yours (90 membres , 20ish really casual)<br />
That you saw like once every 10 days.<br />
<br />
Some of them were whining jerks that got boot really fast.<br />
<br />
A couple of them (Special Tribue to Tarval of Karana).<br />
Didnt have the lvl, Didnt have the gear, Didnt have the AA etc etc<br />
Logged once every 2 weeks for 4 hours. Came and played.<br />
Died 10 times per night, didnt even care about loot.<br />
<br />
Tarval poped 4-5 nights per month. He never asked loot.<br />
Never was pissed/whined he couldnt come to ST.<br />
Always was in a good mood. Always was a pleasure to have around.<br />
Always was cheerfull, willing to help, say a good thing to someone.<br />
<br />
There are people like him. Dont kick them, it will be a loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have that many people, and have pretty good turnout on a nitely basis, I suggest doing PoG raids to gear up your guild.  You'll die alot, you'll learn alot, and the best part is that you'll gain enough gear to keep moving onward and upwards.  Once you're mostly geared up in PoG/Thurg shit, then move on to skyshrine.  that should keep a guild like that busy and feeling productive for a long time to come, and by then, you'll probably have a few leaders emerge to start taking the guild on to bigger and better things.<br />
<br />
The key thing is that you have to do stuff with your guild.  You have to get the guild together and you have to function as a guild.  If you can't do that, you don't have a guild.  recruitment is definitely not an issue at this point in the game, so gear up and have fun with it and learn while you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I'd say, which probably has been covered.<br />
<br />
1.  Develope your core.  Don't go heavly recruiting now.  Take your core of people and work on gearing up in Kael/PoG.  Arena can be done with one group, even pre60.  PoG is a two group sort of thing for lower levels.  Work on developing that core group of people who.  Try to stage leveling events, like go into an old, under used dungeon, and have groups sit at camps for a time.  The more you work on develping your core of people, the more others on the fringe will see, and want to be part of.  That will inturn cause them to level/AA to be with part of that group.<br />
<br />
This will increase the size of your core, and your ability to take on new targets.  To help facilate that, have some folks level up some tracking alts.  PL to 39 can be done in a few days.  At 39, ranger track is pretty good, and they will be able to find if/when mobs are up.  If you diversify your targets, then you will see a lot more interst in raiding and advancement.<br />
<br />
2.  After you have gotten your core out there, and if you have a good rep, you will start to see a lot of outside guild folk, and unguildied people wanting to raid with you and apply.  When you get to this point, make sure you have a good system for recruitment.  In my guild you need a number of member and officer votes to be accepted, and those aren't increidbly easy to get.  An applicant must also be sponsered by a member as well, therefor, it's the members responsiblity for the applicant.  We have a high degree of accountabilty in our recruitment process, and it has given us a group of wonderful people who work well together, and are a riot to be with =)  /hug guild<br />
<br />
You'll see yourself grow and as you grow, your raid targets will get better, and your members gear.  Don't forget the importance of xping though.  As has been said, levels are the most important upgrade a guild can have.  Level 65's can do alot more things than a level 60 can do, spells aside.<br />
<br />
Now that you've gotten to this point, remember this very important rule, have fun.  If you are able to keep your members happy, and having fun, you have done yourself and your guild a huge favor.  My guild isn't really a raiding guild, even though we do it often, and usually extrememly well, we are a social/family guild first.  We have a lot of people who love to tradeskill and chat and hang out more than raid and level.  We also have people who are more hard core, who raid all the time if they can, and xp as much as they can for AAs.  We are still able to fully fuction as a group even with these diverse wants from the players.  I /salute my officers for the job they do.  Set your style and stick to it.  We've had folks leave for more uber raiding guilds, but we've also had some of those folks come back to us as well.<br />
<br />
One last point of perspective, how I think about my guild.  If I wasn't in my guild, then I would have probably quit some time ago.  I love the folks in Sword of Fate like family.  Our guildleader have a yearly get together that really reinforces that to me.   I would never leave my guild, unless there was a horrible, fundimental break down of leadership, membership, and the quality of a group we are.  If I ever did leave SoF, I'd more than likly quit in a month or too.  The friendships I've made are vastly more important than any loot item.<br />
<br />
If you can have your members truly feel like your guild is your home.  If you can have new members come in, and they feel like your guild is their home.  Then you have created a really wonderful guild, and something to be proud of.  With time, and some good leadership, you will be able to over come many encounters.  Those encounters will be made all the sweeter because you do it with your friends.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long sappy post, but that's what I'm in, and it has worked incredibly well.  As a group of friends, we are able to find about any mob we want up, attempt it, and we usually succede.  Raiding can happen with good friends, or it can be done by hardcore players.  Just have fun while you do it, and you'll be ok.</div></div><hr />

dont be afraid to boot out those who arent meeting your guild requirements or actively participating. this may be difficult to do, but int he end you want to keep those that are good, and its hard for people to be motivated when there is a lot of dead weight dragging them down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have joined my server's uberguild a LONG time ago if I had the playtime to be abel to devote to them.  But I don't, so I'm happy with what i've got and I made a guild that does enough to keep me occupied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All i'm saying is at 59 atm i'm highest Melee in guild period. I have a hard time finding groups and can't even count on my guild to at least start one. Everyone's off doing there own little things and forgetting the big picture. Sure, the're following my advice on levelling as much as possible but wehn a guildy needs a group and the proper peeps are on and no one wants to get together....they'd rather stay in there pick up groups. Theres a guild on my server that hardly needs pick up groups. A lvl 55 in there guild who is eligible to get into PoV is imediately taken there and has a group. I rarely see a guy from that guild who doesn't have a group and it makes me mad that half the guys in my guild don't wanna try and start a group to help out a fellow guild mate. It just burns me up with jealousy that my friend was grouped from 53 to 65 in maybe 1 month and we were both lvl 53 when he joined that guild. now he's 65 and i'm 59. He had more groups at 55 then i do at present. I play alot, i want to raid alot, i want to group alot. All these things i won't be able to find in my guild for a long time. right now all i have in the guild i'm in is friends. friends i grew in levels talking with. And i'm having trouble deciding the righ t way to let go...if any. I'm torn between friendship and raiding and looting and grouping and levelling.<br />
<br />
Thats why i started this thread: In hopes to get my guild more powerful so i wouldn't have to make the decision, what do you guys think about that? I'm i being selfish? should i stick around? should i leave? what should i do?</div></div><hr />

I have guildmates, and i have a friends list.  Most of the time when im not raiding, i am grouped with friends of mine, that arnt in a VT+ raiding guild, hell, they arnt even HoT yet.  But they are friends i made a long time ago, and i enjoy the company they keep.  When i need a break from the &quot;uber&quot; end of the game, i go hang with them...  And they bug me continually on a day to day basis to join them (only jokingly, they know they cant pull me away from MS).<br />
<br />
My advice, if your not getting what you want from your guild, join one that you can raid with happily.  It doesnt mean your ditching your friends, just means you are moving on.  Let them know that you are not leaving the family, but purely going your own way.  Some of them will be upset at you for leaving, some people will feel a trust, or loyalty was broken, but let them know that you just want to see more of the game.  Most of the time, they will understand.<br />
<br />
IMO, if you cant get them to do more things, go do them with other people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds to me like you want to leave your guild already and you want somebody to tell you it's okay. It is okay to pursue your self-interest, you will survive. <br />
<br />
But dont think it wont change your relationship with those people in your former guild - it will. A few of them may act like nothing happened and still talk to you daily, but it will be in tells because you cant talk to them in /gu anymore - just a private conversation between you and that person.  A few of them may be outright mad or hurt that you left them - chose loot over friendship in their minds. Many of them may not have strong feelings either way, but they'll be busy with guild matters - something you arent a part of anymore - so they wont have occasion to socialize with you much. <br />
<br />
Anyone that tells you you can still be 'part of the family' by leaving your alts, whatever is lying to themselves and you. Alts are just that - they sit on a shelf until sometime when you need some 'alternate' entertainment. They are of very little value to your former guild, since you wont be playing them.<br />
<br />
And dont be surprised when you find out that raiding guild you have been pining after isnt the utopian society you thought it was going to be. A while back we had a handful of high levels leave our guild. One of them has stayed with the guild they all joined. Another one has jumped guilds three times since. Three others stayed with the new guild a short while and now are guildless. Another friend from an allied guild left his guild around the same time and joined a raid guild for maybe a month or two, and now is guildless. <br />
<br />
What he found out, and I suspect some of the others also, is that he just didnt have the time for a raiding guild. It just wasnt his play style.  He likes to raid, but he just cant spend 10 hours a day, 5 days a week playing a game and doing raids. If you can do that, then maybe you should follow your heart and cross that bridge. Just realize, things wont be the same once you do.</div></div><hr />

Tell them that you feel distanced because of level range and desire.  See what their reaction is.  Leaving a guild is rarly easy, but something most people do through EQ.  If the guild isn't helping your enjoyment of the game you play, and no one really cares enough to do anything, then it sounds to me like it's time to move on.<br />
<br />
Like others have said, don't be ashamed.  Just remember that whenever anyone leaves or joins, there's always some kind of drama, both good and bad.<br />

Keep having fun, however you can manage it.</div></div><hr />
