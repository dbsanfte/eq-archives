<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gellio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have 3 weapons and I'm trying to figure out which 2 to use and in which hands.  The weapons are:<br />
- Barnacle Covered Axe 9/21 with Pique and heated blade proc<br />
- Bladecatcher of the Marshall 12/24 with Shock of Ice proc<br />
- Defenders Lightblade 23/34<br />
<br />
So, which 2 weapons and in which hands should I use them.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What level are you?<br />
<br />
With those 3 weapons, while you are tanking, keep the barny axe in primary. If you can use the defender's lightblade well, ie you are near/at/past the rec level, use that. If you are way below the rec level, go with the 12/24 until you can use the def lightblade.</div></div><hr />

Visiting Allakhazam's webpage and looking up the weapons, it rates them as follows for efficiency:<br />
<br />
Barnacle covered axe  73primary 26offhand<br />
bladecatcher of the marshall 77primary 31offhand<br />
defenders lightblade 83primary 40offhand<br />
<br />
Assuming you are level 60+, I'd say these numbers matchup with what I'd think would be your best setup... which is:<br />
<br />
bladecatcher of the marshall primary<br />
defenders lightblade offhand<br />
NOTE:  If you got a 9/20 weapon it would be on par with the bladecatcher, 9/19 would surpass it for DPS &amp; pure hate<br />
<br />
Even though the efficieny would lead you to believe that the lightblade is best in primary, if you look at the other two offhand they are much much worse than the defenders lightlblade offhand.  This jives up with threads on this board and the rule of thumb is offhand weapons should be chosen solely for their ratio.  You can see some of that here, even though the thread talks about hate per second, it roughly equates to DPS as the thread only deals with hate generated from damage of the weapon, procs are omitted:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All three of those weapons kind of make me cringe.  Not sure what level you are but I had a defender's lightblade and it was not really an agro weapon and it really wasn't all that good for damage either so I would recommend working towards a CHoS/SotB combo as soon as you can and replace all three of those.  I believe the axe has a 250 hate proc so for now I would think that would be best in primary and the bladecatcher secondary if those are all you can manage to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe the axe has a 250 hate proc<br />
<br />
Ahh, bonequest was a bit more observant than I.  I failed to notice the proc on the barnacle covered axe (I also missed the augments listed).  This definately puts it at the top of the list for a primary weapon, if you want to keep aggro, as the DPS/HATE/sec difference between the weapons pales in comparison to the 100 hate proc + 50dd &amp; heated blade proc for this weapon.  I'd also agree with Bonequest on his recommendations, but Gellio didn't make it appear he was able to obtain anything outside of the three weapons he listed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gellio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a lvl 53 warrior who is eternally broke.  I'm working towards saving up for a CHoS but since they run about 11k min on my server its going to take a while.  So for now I'm pretty much stuck with those weapons.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the Barny in primary and the Bladecatcher in the secondary is the way to go.  Out of curiosity, if I get the CHoS, do I keep the Bladecatcher in the secondary or move the Barny over there.  Basically is the hate proc on the Barny everything or is the better ratio of the Bladecatcher better (I'm assuming the heat blade proc is offset by the Shock of Ice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep if when you get a chos/sotbs barny id off for agro, then you have the dlb and botm for dps weapons. botm prin dlb off.<br />
<br />
naturaly when you want big numbers with mightystrike and those weapons dlb mian and botm offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gellio,<br />
<br />
The barny will make a decent off hand aggro weapon with it's pique proc.  However, the heat blade proc and shock of ice procs are not equal (in this instance), due to how weapon procs work and your weapons:<br />
<br />
The weapon's primary proc has a chance to go off.  If it doesn't, then the augment proc has a chance to go off, if not then it continues down the list (spell procs and the like work in here).  The thing to keep in mind is that aug'ing a weapon which already has a native proc means that the aug proc will not go off as much as the innate or a weapon that only has an aug proc on it.  Search the boards here and you'll find folks logging data that shows it (wandor's piece on weapon affinity is a prime example)<br />
<br />
Once you have the copper hammer, if you want damage (i.e. not main tank) then use the bladecatcher offhand.  If you are main tanking and need to keep aggro, use the barnacle axe offhand.<br />
<br />
Either the copper hammer of striking or sword of the bloodsworn is better aggro and should be placed in your primary.  If you manage both weapons, go for the copper hammer mainhand and the bloodsworn offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zilden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Typically lower dly weapons are better for agro.  I would use the lower dly weapons when tanking and switch for the better ratio when not the MA/T</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Typically lower dly weapons are better for agro.<br />
<br />
Actually, there is a better way to work it out.  Quite a bit of testing/parsing was done in this thread:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789&amp;page=3&amp;pp=15<br />
<br />
The general concensus of the thread is that:<br />
(DB + 11 * MINIMUM)/delay<br />
Where MINIMUM = Damage/Delay rounded to the next whole integer<br />
Is a good calculation for hate per second generated by a weapon.  This of course is pure melee hate and does not cover procs/augs/etc.<br />
Also, you get hate regardless of whether you hit or not.  The actual hit amount does not matter as your hate is based on the maximum possible damage you could've done, so even a critical does not generate more hate, as per the thread.<br />
<br />
So, working this for each of the three weapons (mainhand):<br />
barnacle axe - 9/21 - (13 + 11 * 1)/21 = 1.14<br />
bladecatcher - 12/24 - (13 + 11 * 1)/24 = 1.00<br />
defenders - 23/34 - (13 + 11 * 2)/34 = 1.03<br />
<br />
(offhand)<br />
barnacle axe - 9/21 - (11 * 1)/21 = 0.52<br />
bladecatcher - 12/24 - (11 * 1)/24 = 0.46<br />
defenders - 23/34 - (11 * 2)/34 = 0.65<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that damage bonus only applies for the mainhand, so for offhand you have no damage bonus (0).  Which means the forumla works out to (11 * min)/delay, so basically the better the ratio, the more hate/second it pans out to.<br />
<br />
So, yes, in this instance, the faster weapons wins out, but if you had a wurmslayer (25/40) it works out to 1.15 hate/second....  So the key is to really run the numbers on the formula and see what you get.  Of course, never forget innate procs (like I always do) and augments as they'll up that number a bit.  Mainhand weapons proc 2 per minute and offhand 1 per minute (roughly, without advanced AAs) so that can help decide the overall winner.<br />
<br />
Seeing as the barnacle axe has a 100 hate, that will add 200 hate per minute or another 3.33 hate/second to that weapon.  There is also hate associated with the 50dd portion.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gellio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the great information.  From what you say though, it looks like the Bary in the mainhand is the clear winner.  The interesting thing is that it looks like the Defenders is actually the better weapon in the offhand for both Damage and Aggro.  Looks like the bladecatcher is about to get scrapped.  Which is too bad, it has a cool graphic, I like the serrated blade.    Having said that, has anyone figured out what the hate from a proc is (other than the hate specific components).  Is it 1 pt of aggro per point of damage?  If it is then that would indicate that the bladecatcher still remains the better weapon in the offhand than the defenders afterall because of the additional 38/60=0.63 hate that is generated by the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I say the following: <br />
<br />
Mainhand the Barnacle and offhand the DLB; hang around PoJ or PoI until you're 55. You don't have far to go. It'll take you about 10 hours /played at the most to ding. Then, sell your three weapons and spend the 500pp you'll get for them for a Greatstaff of Thunder. Considering its average price, and the fact that you can probably tank until the end of your non-elemental days with it, it is the single best item for a Warrior in the history of Everquest. <br />
<br />
2hb low? Don't worry. You won't be doing tremendous damage with it until your skill is up. Your aggro capabilities will be exactly the same from skill 0 to max. <br />
<br />
Considering your weapons, I'd bet your armor is somewhat lacking, as well. Go camp a FFBSS in Lower Guk before the 15th for Haste if your server has a permaraid down there; be sure and sign up for Fabled Exe Axe for DPS and Fabled SSOY to offhand when you're old enough to camp CHOS. Go to Sol B and snag the Fabled Mith BP = 61 AC + nice HP. For the rest of your holes, hang on to Cobalt until you can LDON those pieces. Also, check PoK merchants for cheap Gothic armor if you're missing some pieces entirely.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is it 1 pt of aggro per point of damage?<br />
<br />
Gellio,<br />
If you read the thread that I linked, folks seem to think it is less than 1pt of aggro per point on a DD.  I must admit that I don't bother to look into that as the general concensus is that DDs are not a good source of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gellio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Got the Greatstaff sitting in the bank already and have had for a couple of levels since I first discovered it (didn't want the drop to get nerfed or it to suddenly go shooting up in price :)  Can't wait to get it out, my 2HB skill isn't even that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would see if you could find a shammy to camp droga with you for a CHoS. at your level you would get nice xp and perhaps a nice weapon too.<br />
