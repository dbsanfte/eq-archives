<br />
At lvl 29 buffed with temp I only have 2k hp. For some reason I feel that is low, I could be wrong tho. I have a sta of around 170 ish thanks to a few items I have aquired/bought.<br />
<br />
Is this a average for hp at my lvl? Is there a table or website out there that gives a base hp value for the Warrior class?? Any info or comments from you uber folk??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm without temp you have 1200hp at 29? Yes that is rather low I'd say, but I havent played a war at that level in some time. My 29 twink zerker has around 1600hp, but isnt twinked too hardcore. You could look through eqrankings.com for sample magelos of people around your level, which is what im gonna do now...<br />
<br />
Hmm one level 29 war listed, 1173hp or so. Others a few levels higher have 1200-2k+ depending on level of twinkage. My best advice to you is to spend money only on upgrades that give ac and/or hp, ignore other stats for the most part. Make a magelo profile, post it here along with what you have to upgrade with, and you'll get some good advice.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't worry about hitpoints in isolation: your AC, hitpoints and some of your stats are helpful. Check your gear against the &quot;crafted&quot; and &quot;crustacean&quot; pieces in the chart I link. If, in general, you have either pieces from these sets or pieces with the same AC, you're probably doing okay for an untwinked warrior.<br />

Then again, I was using crafted at the time (level 20-60).  I think I finally broke 3k hps when I was 60.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started a warrior and was pling him with a friends 49 cleric..<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1003876<br />
My friend started playing more and more and i lost the access to his account when i wanted to PL because he was on line then... so i started a 2nd account and restarted the warrior...<br />
i am now pling him with my 63 shaman...<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1080589<br />
that magelo is about 11 levels old as he has about 1700 or 1900 hp right now... I have not been able to update this lately as magelo has been down and or i have just forgotten to start the program to auto update... i am going to try and update it tonight to show his 31 level stats...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also i hunted for these items with my 63 shaman and or bought them from the baz and only spent about 20K on him...<br />
<br />
i am still trying to recover that plat as i am not a farmer of plat and 35K is he most i have ever had at one time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe nother old schooler who was thing that sounded high. I couldn't tell you what is good--but you can really go bad in this day and age of EQ. Stamina does not really start to pay until post 50--I would trade HP for stam..but knowign what I leveled with (incrafted legs until 59th) I would worr ymore about having fun and leveling. Keep up with players who have high level alts, or even a years experiance will not be any fun for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Kailyn; if this warrior is your main, you can't keep up gear-wise with the alt of a 65 mage who can farm several thousand plat a night.<br />
Focus on what you can control: donig everything to aquire and hold aggro; positioning the mob, being aware of adds, reacting immediately ifyour casters get hit, stuff like that. Pay attention to mob pathing and respawn rates. If you level in OT or DL, learn to pull (proper pulling in outdoor zones like these involves picking up on mob pathing, characteristics, topography, knowing the strength of your group, and so forth). Do what you can to make your entire group's performance better. <br />
My only experience playing a healing caster is with a shaman, but I can tell you that at that level I worried much more about whether the tanks could play than what their hitpoints were. Pull rates and even mob selection can be adjusted in most zones, but there is no adjustment for dirt-stupid play, and stupid will get a group killed way faster than a tank whose hitpoints are a tad low. Few things more irritating than being unable to cast because three adds are beating on you while the full cultural twink warrior is mindlessly tanking one mob and completely ignoring the spammed &quot;ON ME&quot; messages filling his chatbox.<br />
The best check for your relative basic mitigation/survival level (AC, hitpoints, other minor stats) is your healer. In one or two heals, a caster will pretty much know how many hitpoints you have. After a mob or two, he'll have a good idea of your relative ability to mitigate damage. If you have some caster friends/guildmates, simply ask them how hard it is for them to keep you alive. If you're getting hints that you're a bit weak, head to the bazaar and search for upgrades by AC, looking for the best upgrade bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />

But if you do have the means, when looking for an upgrade look for raw HP. Forget Sta/Str, that will come in time, just go for raw HP on anything you get as an upgrade.<br />

Back then warriors did not have hp bonus levels or more hp per level then hybrids.  Was pimping all that banded until I could a set of rubicite in Cazic thule.  That was the best low leel dungeon ever, why did they have to ruin it.  Surprised I didn't hear more about rubicite heh.</div></div><hr />
