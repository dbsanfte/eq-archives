<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a lvl 47 warrior.. been playing EQ since oct 99 when I created Katina (my main) well I had a cucca computer and couldn't play as often I wanted to.. but now I have a comp that runs EQ fairly well. Promblem is I've been out of EQ so long, I don't know what is good and what is bad anymore... I would be most appreciative if some of you would paruse over my magelo and give me some suggestions. Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off - haste item. Anything =) Even a Flowing Black Silk Sash. Some kind of idol (Goranga, Idol of the Thorned, etc.) would be nice for your range slot.<br />
<br />
That's just to start. I'm sure other ppl will give more suggestions.<br />
<br />
*incorrect info edited out cos I read too fast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with getting haste, GSoT wont be usable at 47 though. I don't see a problem with anything else for that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aww thanks guys.. that makes me feel good that my stuff ain't that bad... talked to an EQ player in a mIRC RP game I play and showed her my magelo.. she's been only playing for 3 months and called my stuff newbish  *sigh* Well I remember the days when if you had bronze at 10 you were twinked!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahhh!  The good old days!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">go check your local bazaar and do a search for :<br />
<br />
Gothic Steel<br />
<br />
cheap stuff; decent AC plus str/sta; full suit maybe run you @1500plat if that.<br />
<br />
all in all though; your stuff ain't half bad at all. levels will help it more too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your equipment ain't bad at all!<br />
<br />
Haste item (fbss) and if you got the pp buy a frostbringer, you will love it for it's dps and aggro!<br />
<br />
Both go around 1,5-2k or something like that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Katina,<br />
<br />
How much available platinum do you have to work with ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have somewhere are 3k to work with.. I'm poor -_-. that gothic steel sounds nice, will have to check it out tonight when I go in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">for the gothic steel stuff, check npc merchant if you plan to buy some pieces...often smiths sell them directly to npc, and it will be surely cheaper than the price you will get in bazaar.</div></div><hr />
