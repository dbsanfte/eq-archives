<br />
so lets discuss how guilds distribute loot:<br />
<br />
1) gl or officers decrees who gets it.<br />
2) point system.<br />
3) /rand<br />
<br />
first one used to be the most popular. it is one the THE two reasons i have always equated most guilds with slavery. the other reason is &quot;raid &gt; keeping your job&quot;.<br />
<br />
second one is a great improvement. but the large majority of the guilds employing this still have a master looter who forks over everything to the guild treasury where if you are a good little doggy they MIGHT throw you a bone from it.<br />
<br />
third one is usually used on pickup groups but i have never been in a guild that can fathom it.<br />
<br />
stop robbing the members. /rand the loot. its owned by those who raid not by the guild officers. distribute the money from the trash loot and /rand everything of value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd see your point if officers didn't do more for the guild than regular members. There are exceptions but that's how it happens in decent guilds serverwide. Also, there will always be disagreements in a subjective system, and there is always at least one small group who feels the leadership is doing it wrong.<br />
<br />
Of course, blatant corruption and favoritism are entirely different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have someone keep track of who gets what loot. We had an officer who kept records, and if there was any dispute would tell you the exact stats of who got what. I would have prefered a more open system, but loot was reasonably fair. We definitely had at least one officer who got much more than his fair share, and we definitely had officers who didn't know who should have been awarded what, but at least loot over time was fairly even. This was for an award system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use a mixed system though. Random members from the raid are selected to join a &quot;loot committee&quot; and AYEs are submitted along with what will be replaced. DKP and need as well as degree of improvement and willigness to hand down NON-NO-DROP items are all considered. IMO this is the best way to go about evenly distributing loot for an entire guild. THe best improvements get made first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twalin</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my favorite is dkp with auction style bidding, works well to reward those who raid the most and obviously people are willing to pay more for bigger upgrades.<br />
<br />
My guild uses this system and it's my favorite by far after having been in guilds that do all of the above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dkp is very fair but its a big pain in the posterior to manage. /rand however is very workable because it...<br />
<br />
1) rewards those with the most attendance. after all you cant /rand an item if you arent there.<br />
2) better items are up for /rand on harder raids that presumably have bigger groups necessary to down the mob.<br />
3) people who cannot use a no drop item wouldnt /rand it anyway. obviously if some jerk wants to rand a no drop he could not equip he would not be awarded it.<br />
<br />
biggest disadvantage i can think of with rand is the level 58 with 3 aa has the same chance of winning as the 65 with 300 aa. yet they dont contribute equally to the success of the raid.<br />
<br />
another disadvantage of /rand is it awards the poorly equipped since they can /rand items that others consider junk and upgrade if they win. the long time guildy who has been on 100 raids this year waits long and hard for something he actually needs and then has to /rand with the new recruits so likely looses the roll. dkp avoids that problem.<br />
<br />
my biggest problem is not whether its done by /rand or by dkp. my biggest issue is  the cash from the vendor loot is never distributed by most guilds. i always hear the talk about a guild treasury to pay for coffins or peridots or whatnot but im highly skeptical how much money is going toward these things. no way it could be close to all the loot. also my gf has never been given peridot money.<br />
<br />
so while i know there are guilds with integrity out there im just a bit cynical because the balance sheet just doesnt usually balance in my experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I burn 200+pp on peridots and emeralds every single day I xp. More if I do Tipt or Ikkinz, Ikkinz being my favorite zone. I don't raid.<br />
<br />
When I was lead cleric of an elemental guild, it wasn't that rare for me to burn 1k a day just casting spells. I'm only one cleric. That doesn't include mages' pearls, coffins, peridots for enchanters, or peridots for wizards.<br />
<br />
1) rewards those with the most attendance.<br />
<br />
Not nearly reliably enough. You could theoretically attend every raid for a year and roll 1 out of 1000 every single time. Another warrior could roll 1000 out of 1000 every single time. The possibility is there. It is not in Merit/Point systems. The problem with /rand is that it's not fair enough. Duh? Random loot systems also encourage loot whoring and high turnover - two things that kill high-end guilds. Loot whoring in that everyone who will use an item will roll for it, which means that one person can win several items in one night (or even multiple times from the same mob); high turnover in that once someone has better gear than the guild average (like say, your core, long-term members?) their chances at upgrades drop dramatically, since they roll on less and less items overall against new members that always have an equal chance at winning the best items. That's not good for morale.</div></div><hr />

My recommendation to you is to go join a raiding guild and become an officer ASAP.  You clearly have no actual knowledge of the interior workings of a raidforce, or the costs associated with it.<br />
<br />
I don't know about your &quot;gf&quot; (whatever that is, guessing you might mean &quot;girlfriend&quot;?) not getting any peridot money, either the policy should be written down somewhere, or maybe she should ask.<br />
<br />
The clerics, chanters, mages, sks, necromancers and anyone else in our raidforce with significant reagent costs can get said components for the asking.  The gems used up on me in a night of being Main Tank sometimes is shocking. <br />
<br />
I'm a warrior and I carry at all times *at least* 1 stack of dots, and 1 stack of portal fragments.  Sometimes I carry other reagents, yes, even just for grouping.  I have 2 stacks of coffins in my bank for emergency summoning.  You'd be surprised how much your casters will value you if you even once in awhile drop a peridot on your wizard and say &quot;spell shield please&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With nodrops we use a prety regimented system for distribution based on time in guild, attendance, and past wins.  All droppable loot is treated as no drop loot with regards to guild mains.  If no mains want then it is taken and put into the guild bank.  If no mains post on the boards to take is as a win the guildbank sells it for guild coffers.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guild then takes the coffers and<br />
 -stockpiles it<br />
-buys reagents (pearls, emeralds, dots, coffins, necro rez gems ... etc).  We keep all our casters up to date<br />
-Loans to guildmembers<br />
-Buys spells for guildmembers<br />
-Buy the occasional item of lust for guildmembers (counts as a win and guildmembers must have a low win count).<br />
<br />
Most guild officers are really good with guild money ... perhaps you should have a little bit more faith in your leaders or go speak to one personally.  There is a lot more that goes on behind the curtains there bub ... maybe if you'd stop being so fucking selfish you might realize that.  Guilds burn tons of pp every single raid ... the sellables generally only make a small dent in those costs....<br />
<br />
Thanks god the new planes dont require reagents to gate (hate anyone?)<br />
<br />
<br />
-As for /random ... it fucking sucks<br />
-As for guildleader/officers decide ... its biased and only good if everyone is ok with it and trusts the leadership<br />
-As for points-  it is the fairest and easiest imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was running my guild, we had a simple loot policy...I decide where it goes.  And I think if you'll talk to all of the people who's gear went from utter bazaar trash to 5khp+ or 4k mana in a matter of weeks, you'll find that they agree it was a damned good system.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, your average EQ player (even officers or guild leaders) has basically no clue what loot is useful to what class, and there's where that system runs into problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you need to try to lead your own guild, that would change your opinions on them evil guildleaders/officers drasticly, I assure you. The worst thing for any guild is members constantly questioning the leaders, it kills moral like nothing else. Of course there are bad apples, that's when you leave the guild and look for another one, guilds with bad leadership don't last long anyway.<br />
<br />
Been in the guild I'm in for several years now (with a few breaks) we went from random to tiered random to a point system. No system is perfect but points are fairest by far, downside is the time that goes into constantly updating the points, it's a lot of work.<br />
<br />
Every system needs room for exceptions though, for lootdrops like the BoW. On our server we had a guild that had their first BoW go to a 5k warrior who hardly raided because of holding on to the rules. Another guild almost gave their first BoW to a paladin cause he just happened to have the most points at the time. Fair lootdistribution is a good thing, but not if it conflicts with guildprogression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have no idea how much that stuff costs.  1 stack of peridots - 210p.  1 stack of emeralds - 270p.  One stack of pearls - 105p.  <br />
<br />
VT raid... not much cash loot at all drops.<br />
I would use 2+ stacks of emeralds each clear and that was ONLY using DI on the MT for boss fights.  Then we would use a few stacks of peris.  And a few stacks of pearls - lot of CoHing going on in VT.  So raid cost is well over 1k more then what was looted.  And thats assuming you don't have a nasty wipe and need coffins which are 70p EACH.<br />
<br />
Then you move up a bit.  In PoP more diamonds and stuff drop but clerics are casting DI like its free.  For some fights you want all the clerics to have DI, all the chanters to have DI, of course the MA and then the ramp tank too... but not just the MA and ramp tank but both backup tank lines as well.  Oh and don't forget the pullers - they have to get the mob back to camp and if they die that slows things down.  And even if it doesn't fire (which is what you are hoping for) it only lasts 10 minutes (or up to 15 if the cleric spent 20 AA on extended buffs).  I easily go through 3 stacks of emeralds on a raid nowdays.  And I'm one cleric.  We have several clerics casting the spell.  And of course then there is the peridot and pearl costs.  Some days there is a profit.  But some days there isn't.  And some days you go negative which is why you keep it in the bank on the days you make a profit.<br />
<br />
If your girlfriend isn't getting peridot money, have her ask the lead cleric how they do regent reimbursement.  If there isn't a lead cleric, ask the raid leader (either before or after the raid not in the middle).  Some guilds don't... its rare but a few actually won't... if you are in one of those then run and find another guild.  Most likely though the policy is just to tell someone how much you used and they'll pay for it out of all that plat they are &quot;stealing&quot; from you.<br />
<br />
I think it all boils down to trust though.  If you don't trust your officers then you are in the wrong guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CA rules/policy (http://www.freewebs.com/cassault/rulesandpolicy.htm)<br />
<br />
<br />
From a guildleader's PoV (me) peridots/emeralds/pearls/coffins shouldn't be paid for by the members as not everyone has money etc.. and they aren't &quot; forced &quot; to cast X or Y buff that costs that item, but they need to for the raid to succeed.<br />
<br />
Someone stated that dkp is a big pain to keep up with (its really not) - we have our dkp listed in the guild management tool so every member can see it at all times, if something is changed, people notice, if something isn't changed, people notice, if someones left, people notice, if someone joined people notice.  <br />
<br />
Once all your clerics have divine intervention (something your guild shoulda farmed, or purchased with guildbank money) you'll start spending ALOT for emeralds on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Randoming real loot is a really stupid way to go, considering that EVERYONE who gets any kind of benifit will random, why not? Its not just pick and choose, its random as much as you can wear so you have greater chance to win.<br />
<br />
The only time I see random as a real workable way to distribute loot is like total garbage items, say.. like the cloak off that frog warlord in earth, which rots even in xp groups. Or like Rhag 1 and 2 loots, which is trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do DKP with set prices on items no bidding. say the item is 5 dkp 3 people put in the person who put in and has the most dkp wins the item. That seems to be the fairest way to distribute loot to me, and it seems to work real good. The problem you have with DKP is 2 and 3 boxers and how you handle it, but i guess that would be a pain for  any loot distribution system. As far as the cash items that drop from trash mobs we try to get officers leading groups and have them loot all the cash drops. the cash goes towards spells, spell components etc. If you want to be buffed on raids the guild is gonna have to buy this stuff. You can't expect the casters to pay for buffing the whole guild x amount of times per night by themselves, or at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a simple system like Cimmar's. Items are determined based on a formula that gives a value from the stats of the item. X hp = Y dkp, and soforth. Raids are determined by the average drop (in dkp) of that mob divided by the average raid (usually 50 nowadays). That gives a number of pts awarded for that kill. We take logs right before engaging and everyone who was there when we win is given those points.<br />
<br />
Theres no auctioning or point reduction at all, you have to pay the cost of the item, or you don't loot it. Highest point total gets it. If nobody'll pay the cost, it rots. Sometimes it sucks to see some nice things rot, but we can point to the numbers whenever someone has a problem with something - it's all in black and white.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a pretty good systems, almost ideal except for tank with high stats like ac where prices can get up there, where as casters would have it much easier.</div></div><hr />

ASK AN OFFICER ABOUT IT.  Maybe they pay pp/dots after the raid is finished based on how many regents were used.  I know in my guild, we either give clerics peridots at the start of the raid or reimburse them after the raid, depending if officers remembered to bring peridots along with them to the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, your average EQ player (even officers or guild leaders) has basically no clue what loot is useful to what class, and there's where that system runs into problems. <br />
<br />
  Jesus. No kidding. I've noticed that most officers just don't get what's good for what class. We had one officer that just didn't get how important BoWs were. Just didn't quite comprehend how much of an upgrade it was for some people, especially compared to what our warriors already had. I really feel that each class should decide who gets the items in an award system, when possible.<br />
<br />
  Another thing I've noticed with officer assigned loot is consistancy. We had one officer, again on the BoW topic, that said that it'd be going to the warriors that had no Bloodfrenzy/other EB combo. Another one said that it'd go to the warriors with full 2 handed offensive AAs. Instead, a third officer awarded our second BoW to someone with a BF/BoC combo who had no 2 handed offensive AAs that had only recently un-retired, over one warrior who had a SoD and BoC aggro combo who played much more. Communication = good.<br />
<br />
  Last major problem I have with officer assigned loot is definitely loot whoring. We had one officer who would *always* award himself top new loots. It wasn't a problem in general for officers to get some of the new items, but it was assigned by other officers in those cases. It got to the point that, instead of congratulating this officer over his new gear, the guild would simply sit there silently as he looted it. Loot whoring is one of those bad possibilities with an award system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a system like Cimmar &amp; Raaj.Works great keeps everyone happy.Random is the worst idea ive heard.Every joker wants to random on every little upgrade...eck.We want something we pay for it with earned points.Always the same price for same item.If you want something rare you save your points hehe.<br />
<br />
Our only restrictions are:a) casters get ft stuff first,<br />
                                        b) wars get eb weaps first,<br />
                                        c) melee get 41 haste items first.<br />
First being first crack at bidding.<br />
Bots don't earn dkp .Only 1 main per person earns dkp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use auction DKP, no fixed price, just spend DKP until some1 stops outbidding you or you run out of available points...it's a system I like...we have a few exceptions, for example EB weapons go to warriors, melee try not to bid on FT items, caster try not to bid on vengence etc...but when you get to EP and beyond that line kinda blurs as many items have a melee and a caster effects....<br />
<br />
To counter the effect of people disappearing for a long time then coming back once to bid on a uber item using the DKP they saved we implemented a policy...<br />
<br />
If you raid between 61-80% of the raids in one week you get a 10% bonus, if you raid 81%+ you get a 20% bonus, and once every month 50dkp is removed from everyone as decay. Bare in mind we get 5dkp every 30 mins while raiding, so we can make easily 50 dkp a day...also if some1 doesn't show for 3 months with no word as to why, they are guildremoved and all DKP is wiped...<br />
<br />
So basically the system rewards those who play, gives those who dont play much a chance and doesn't leave loot up to someone who could be corrupt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point at which unpriced auctions break down is with restricted class items. Knights would get their weapons dirt cheap, whereas warriors would generally have to bid against most other melee classes. Leather classes would pick up their class restricted armor cheaper than plate. Then they would have more DKPs left to spend on the all/all items as a result. You also get to a point where someone finds DKPs worthless (so low it doesn't amtter, or back for a 'sightseeing' trip before retiring again) so they can bid as high as they want without penalties.<br />
<br />
We use cDKP (current saved DKP) to distinguish loot order and a fixed pricing system. Sure, there are a few annomalies in pricing, but generally we're faily good at pricing things after this many years. If anyone was to try and vastly unfairly price something, the rest of the guild would be able to overturn it anyway. Show up to raids and earn cDKP, buy something and spend cDKP. Show up lots and loot little and you rise up the ladder for the nicer, more sought after items. Loot lots or show up sporadically, and you have to wait for the top folks to loot/pass on the best items.<br />
<br />
For junk stuff we use gDKP (gross DKP) which is your attendance over the last 3 months (cDKP divided by total possible DKP over that period). This means the currently most active people get first refusal on the toys, crappy random augs or quest stuff.<br />
<br />
The 'best' system is a perfectly run merit system, where the loot council is implicitely trusted by the rest of the raiders, unfortunately they are few and far between, as every decision is open to interpretation 50 different ways.<br />
<br />
As for the trash loot, what little there is from raids gets looted by officers and goes to buy dots/ems/pearls etc., as with the tradeskill stuff. There's rarely enough to be worth 'stealing' as you suggest, and hasn't been droppable raid loot for years (Velious and ele tradeskill stuff)<br />
<br />
If you don't like they way your loot is distributed, go find a guild that does things the way you want. Come back and complain when you've raided solidly for a year to get into PoTime and a bard on a rare visit wins the first BP with a lucky roll, then vanishes again.</div></div><hr />

We took the stance when deciding to use unpriced auctions that our loot system couldn't and shouldn't try to fix problems with SOEs itemization. Sure, supply and demand might not be equal for all classes, not much to do about that, I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />

No system is perfect, we just all have to choose which flaws we're willing to put up with. Most DKP systems have tweaks and subtle differences to tailor them to the specific guild using them. If yours works for you and ours works for us, then we're both in the right</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use a DKP based system which, while administrated by the officers, is well understood by all members and is based on raid attendence.  It could just as easily be administrated by the newest members with the same results.<br />
<br />
While our guild does require the return of any droppable loot gotten in a guild raid when you get an upgrade, we also buy all spells for everyone.  If you have a class specific tradable need such as shrink bracer, peridots, coffins, EEs etc (something that will help speed raids) the guild bank will gladly buy these for you.<br />
<br />
At Christmas time each member was given a 35,000 plat Christmas bonus from the guild bank.<br />
<br />
From my experience I just can't agree with the original post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on the reimbursement thing for reagents, i just give our clerics some money out of the spell bank (i hold our lvl 65 spells) every now and then, works nicely. necros get money for coffins and ee's as well. or mages. hell, even enchanters for rune.</div></div><hr />
