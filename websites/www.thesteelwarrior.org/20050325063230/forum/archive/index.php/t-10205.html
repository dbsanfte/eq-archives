<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im wanting to try these and have a couple questions.<br />
<br />
1. If you lose, where do your copses pop and whats the timer?  <br />
2. Which do you think is the easiest to try and do first considering my gear level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Corpse pops by where you enter the trials in MPG... takes about 20 mins or so.  Would be a good idea to camp a rezzer outside.<br />
<br />
Fear or Efficiency would be the easier trials IMO... Fear probably is the easiest as long as you have enough people who can fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, so with no rezzer parked there you have to summon corpses to zone or fight your way back through any see invis mobs. Thanks Phantron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard efficiency is now very difficult now as you cant avoid or even cure the zone wide mana tap AE.  Back when you just had to time the bard DA song it was by far the easiest trial.<br />
<br />
It really depends on your group makeup.  Judging from your magelo you will need to have 2 CHers to even try the bosses of Subversion (2800 hitter) or Ingenuity (2k unslowable hitter).  If you have a few great crowd control people fear should be doable (use furious on the initial onslaught or you wont survive it).   If you have another tank and good dps destruction would be the best bet.<br />
<br />
When you first try the trials bring along a rez-capable toon that you can park outside the trial room to rez you in case of wipe.  Most spots outside the trials are safe.  Subversion is the exception because that one has a roamer that can path by and aggro.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  If things go downhill and theres no way to win just quit the expedition and run like hell for ~90 sec.  Sometimes you can live long enough for the expedition to boot you out to safety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Efficiency is now officially the hardest. We beat weaponry with 1 min left to go, but lost Efficiency with similar people.<br />
<br />
Easist two are fear and power.<br />
Corpse pops about 10 min after you /dzquit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya they really overpowered these things in their last patch, sucks horribly I dont even wanna touch on arcana trial anymore, and i'm 11700 unbuffed with personal/guild trib..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeus</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Efficiency is not really hard if your healer(s) know how to be... efficienct with mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't have the uberest cleric in your server doing efficiency, I suggest just completely unmem pious/supernal anything because you're just going to kill yourself for ever using these heals.  There are pretty much no circumstances where a pious anything is a good heal when your max HP is around 10K for the duration of the trial.<br />
<br />
It also helps if you are using Sleep to mez the mobs instead of Euphoria/Felicity since everything that's mezzable is under 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought Destruction was the easiest.<br />
<br />
Efficency being the hardest now makes some sense. That girdle is pretty much te best thing a non-raider will probably every get~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Efficiency has always been tricky, the key is to use the lowest possible mana spells that will adequetly get your group through to the boss with enough mana left over for the kill. If you can handle it, don't slow the mobs and bring a magician with the new damage shield that hits for ~500. You'd be amazed how that chews through mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new damange shield only works for a set number of hits, so it really does no more good then the mage nukeing those mobs~ its not like normal DS that stays for a set amount of time... the 400 hp mage ds is only for a set number of hits, i think its like 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new damange shield only works for a set number of hits, so it really does no more good then the mage nukeing those mobs~ its not like normal DS that stays for a set amount of time... the 400 hp mage ds is only for a set number of hits, i think its like 6.<br />
<br />
The resists are bad enough that the damage shield is much much better than nukes on that trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The elite/commanders have mega resists.  You can easily nuke yourself OOM before you know what's going on if you tried to nuke on those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The resists are why I prefer the DS - which can be recast as soon as it fades afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DS has a recast time of 13 or so seconds.<br />
<br />
But it actually takes a surprising amount of time before a mob lands 4 hits on you when it can't dual wield, especially if it's slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the time I do efficiency each tank tanks at least 2 or so mobs, so there is no risk of the DS wearing before it lands all 4 hits.</div></div><hr />
