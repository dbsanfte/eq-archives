<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Olld F</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi im a 64 warrior and i am about to buy a anger 2 aug from EF ldon but i had a quick <br />
question that has been sitting on my mind for awhile. Say you didnt have agro on a mob and you pressed taunt doesnt it move your agro slightly above the person with agro? If thats how taunt works you could lose agro. Say you were first on mobs hate list and you taunted wouldnt it move you down to slightly above the 2nd on mobs hate list? The point im really trying to get is if you proc a hate of any kind say 500 your ahead in agro than anyone else on the mob, then you press taunt right after proc would it move you down on agro list a little ahead of the person thats 2nd on mobs hate list? Im trying to clear this out it would be a great help if anyone could answer this it was kinda hard to explain.<br />

So, since this leaves opportunities for aggro gettin taken off of you, best to not use it unneccessarily.<br />

There are many times when those 6 seconds of refresh are just waaaay to long.</div></div><hr />
