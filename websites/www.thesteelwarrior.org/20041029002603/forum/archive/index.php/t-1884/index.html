<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aside from Paludal caverns, you would probably have to bring a group of friends with alts to the zones I mentioned.<br />
<br />
  I've played those zones for fun with alts and still do.<br />
  I'm guessing there are better zones to be powerleveled, but those were fun and fast.<br />
<br />
The Broken skull zones can be quite of bit of fun to play in, and if you have a steady group of friends,  the Tower of frozen shadow is another I can think of thats actually entertaining, although the ZEM isn't quite as high as a place like Kaesora.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Misty thicket 1-10<br />
<br />
Paludal trash, then paludal bandits 11-23<br />
<br />
High hold keep (best experience ingame at these levels) 24-35<br />
<br />
Could stay at HHK til 39... Shrug<br />
<br />
DL-39-45<br />
<br />
Echo caverns afterwards?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">28 - 35.  Hands down Infected Paw is the best.  You can solo in the room by pulling 5 -6 mobs one at a time.   Then take the two at the entrance together.  Then's there the wanderer to kill.  These days will also find it empty and yet it has an xp bonus.  Sometimes I got bored and left to pull from the hills and spires to keep the action going.  Don't forget to take an embalming knife for some bandages.<br />
<br />
edit.. To solo that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1-20 Paludal, start at the Hallowshade Moor zone at lvl 1 and go to SH, i i just did it with a cleric and a 65 druid took about an afternoon to go one end to the other just keep killing reds<br />
<br />
then i moved to Sol A, havnt gotin past there PLing a cleric, warrior much much easyer to PL though<br />
<br />
PS: if yer Tarew Marr by chance lemme know, or if anyone has a warrior they wanna get up i could use somone to tank for my cleric :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fastest possible? NP<br />
<br />
1-24 paludal caverns (everything)<br />
25-40 Sol A (goblins till 33, then nobles)<br />
40-50 Nobles Highkeep (the 2 in the casino, the one at lozani spawn, the 2 bards, isabella cellus, Mistress anna till she gets crapblue at 48, Carson and Lady McCabe from top floor)<br />
<br />
I personally dont understand how people can suggest places like LOIO or DL as these zones have absolutly no bonus exp.<br />
A crap group at HK Nobles beats the very best chain pulling DL group easily AND makes lots of cash.<br />
He didnt say &quot;ultra damn hardcore twinked&quot; So  I doubt he could do much in PoV at 58-59, I personally would suggest Torment for 58-61. However, we are not there yet so I dont know</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Surwraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think there are several good Kunark places that are commonly overlooked these days: <br />
<br />
Dalnirs from 27 to 34+<br />
(did a weekend LAN party of alts from 30 to 35 and owned every mob in the zone. BL, SK, War, Clr, Ench, Bard)  Bring your own group.<br />
<br />
CoM from 35 to 45+<br />
Tons of mobs here, and a Cleric and Warrior can duo nicely.<br />
<br />
Kurns Tower 1-20<br />
Yes, I Pl'd here.  But that was with a cleric healing me once in a while for about 5 hours to get to 20.  At about 19 I went to PC and got to 25 in another 3 hours simply duoing with another warrior<br />
<br />
Dreadlands 35 to 47+<br />
Yes, this is slower.  Yes, this is not the best XP in the game, by far.  Yes, you WILL get a group inside 30 mins 99% of the time.  Longest it has taken me to group was getting from the portin towers all the way to KC ent with SoW.  So, 10 mins?  As wars can't really solo, we need a place where we're assured of a group.  DL is the place for this reason alone.  If you can get a group nearly any other dungeon, forget DL.<br />
<br />
Kaesora from 33 to 45<br />
Bring your own group and be prepared for an AWESOME ride.  This is one of the best kept secrets in Norrath.  You can bind right outside (EVERYONE, there is a bind spot), PoK will take you right to it (as will a wiz port in to EJ, though that takes Levi + wall scale + a zone to get to).  And to top it off, there is some good stuff there still. +25% XP bonus, group bonus, and a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Sebilis 45+<br />
Still a great place.  Good money-maker, great XP, and tons of fun.<br />
<br />
Old world? <br />
<br />
SolA and SolB are nice, and if you're in the 30's+, SolB will get you faction to eventually go get a tinker's back (a must need for any player).<br />
<br />
Guk 20+ (Upper) 35+ (Lower)<br />
Still people lingering around here, and I still find this a fun zone to play around in.<br />
<br />
Hole 45+<br />
tons of mobs + XP bonus = GOOD.<br />
<br />
Droga + Nurga<br />
Experiment here.  They have upped the zone recently, and where I would mosh hard with a full group of low 30's before and they were blue, now they're red and I was duoing Necro and Warrior through the entrance mobs getting 3% a kill.  This was yesterday.... But we're twinked somewhat and both serious alts, so take that into account.<br />
<br />
Lots more to explore.  Play around and have fun.  And as soon as you can get PoP group, DO!!!!  51+ should get a group in most PoP zones.  If you have the skills it takes to be a GREAT warrior, then 51 will get you a group in PoJ/PoD/PoN/PoI regularly.  PoP XP is insane, plain and simple.  I have tested it out every way I can, with a warrior, wizard, and necro, and PoP is greater than any place I can find solo, grouped, duo'd, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kergin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mistmoore is an excellent PL spot that seems overlooked quite a bit.  I helped a friend raise a melee alt  from 15-45 using my 60 druid in Mistmoore, just move deeper in as you level up.  Tons of mobs, fast respawn and the ability to stay in one zone for a long time (less travel between levels).  Of course, I helped pre buff nerf, but I'm sure it's still viable with skin like nature/lvl 49 thorns.<br />

So, today we had me, 58 warrior with excellent dps really and a 62 mage in sebilis for a lesser group of low 50s. mage and I teared through the mobs like a hot knife through butter and we basically cleaned all of D1 and D2. However, after 3 hours the exp the 51s got was just decent. To my surprise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect that is because the 62 mage was taking a huge portion of the group's xp.<br />
<br />
At level 62, it always killed my xp rate if a level 65 player joined my group.  I can't imagine being 11 levels below the top person.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I suspect a higher-xp-modifier zone like Nadox or Droga would have produced better xp than Sebilis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Higher levels only take a slightly higher %age of exp. At 10 levels difference the higher one takes 55% and the lower 45% is what I am  told. However, the 51s should be getting highlevel bonus of all krups and boks, which should result in alot more exp<br />
<br />
btw, Nadox, Droga and Sebilis ZEMS are the same.<br />

Long enough to level 47-51.  The kills here are fast, the only trick is to keep the DPS constant to stay ahead of respawns.  Fun camp, good pp, great exp.  Would recommend Enforcer Hall as a great place to 59, from then on its just good AA.</div></div><hr />

and no, im not thinking too highly of myself, <br />
<br />
But i am getting sick of Ebay PLed Bazzar twinks who cant play the game, and need mommy to show them everything<br />
<br />
the easy way leads to shitty skills ... go level in Unrest, Guk, MM, Najena, Befallen ... in a group, without some uber druid standing by to watch you.<br />
<br />
Then come join the ranks ... instead of PLing your way through the game, ... which usually nets you shit for skills (both play skills and offense/defense skills)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">tell me the next time you have a 50+ PL class doing nothing and you sit there and not twink or PL yourself<br />
<br />
<br />
after that, doing it a few times, you have the right to be pissed off at people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, don't give me the garbage of saying you did it 3 years ago, because 1)Full Bronze and a Mino axe was decked out back then 2)There is a reason you spent those 3 years to get to this level ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only leveled my necro to 60, then my shaman and warrior to 65/64, but on a regular basis I play almost every melee, both other priests, and chanter, all 60+, and I play them well.<br />
<br />
The only class that I've never been behind the wheel of post 60 is a bard and I'm sure it wouldn't take me real long to figure it out.  It's not like this game is fuckin difficult you know.  Same shit, different gear.<br />
<br />
I don't need to level up toons &quot;correctly&quot; to be able to figure out how not to be a numbnuts with them.  Sure, some people do, but generalizing all PL'd characters in the same category would be inccorect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why after a retirment and deletion of my toons I would want to group with people to teach them how to play their class is beyond me.<br />
<br />
After approx 182 lvls as various warriors since starting eq i'm at ease with the warrior class. ( can die with the best of em )<br />
<br />
Yes it  hacks me off to grind lvls again, but there is little to be gained from doing it slowly.<br />
<br />
Be safe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just curious where the best places to go would be non-twinked / PLed.<br />
<br />
Me and my wife just started playing on Stromm. I'm a Barb warrior, she's still picking a class atm (she said she wants to play whatever will be the best to compliment the warrior, and I honestly couldn't decide between a Cleric and a Shaman...prolly go Cleric though). It will prolly be mostly just us at first, but I'm sure we'll group as we go on.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to volunteer ideas on newbie weapons and armor to shoot for in the 1 - 20 range (remember, no twinkage, no free plat :P ), I wouldn't stop them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Cleric is nice, but believe me once you get a little higher you will be much happier if she goes shammy, I currently duo everywhere with a shammy. <br />
We have currently been able to duo all the way into the arena with me pulling and her malo pulling the doubles... so you may want to convince her to start the Shaman instead of the cleric. (my shammy friend also has a cleric alt that she used to play more often, and now only comes out to rez.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go with a cleric. A shaman will not get your warrior grouped as easily on stromm, and getting grouped is fairly hard. Your duo capabilities are pretty low as you wont get any good weapons in bazaar at 25-35 that will make it better for you. and the best exp 20-50 is in fullgroup camps anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Shaman and Warrior -- there is nothing else.  Your cleric won't get CH until 39, but at 51, your shaman is a god and your ability to do things together increases exponentially.<br />
<br />
Any group that doesn't want a shaman is on crack too.  High level shaman +5 melees = the shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The ability to do things together is very dependant on his weapons. He will NOT have good weapons. And getting 51 on Stromm without being grouped is an epic already.<br />
<br />
I would agree with you if I didnt see his server, but I do and I know :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Shaman provides dots and other stuff, can't believe that a duo that requires the warrior to take unslowed damage and do the  majority of the damage with his sub par weaponry is better unless they can always garantee themselves a full group. bit of a toss up - but the shaman provides much more flexibility later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">&quot;Later on&quot; you will just find yourself in a world of pain with a Shaman Warrior duo. As your shaman will not have the mana to do DoTs as well and the warrior will melee forever on a single mob. Groups are the way to go. Or duo bard swarmkiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">As far as quests go for weapons on Stromm, You're a Barbarian, it's your cultural imperative to quest 2 Langsaex and a Langsaex of the Wolves for 2 hander. My G/F and I created a Shaman/Warrior duo during the first days of Stromm, but just could not deal with 100+ people in zones like Everfrost and EC. With the addition of the Barbarian newbie armor quests though, we might revisit the server again.<br />
<br />
At lower levels, Clerics get better heals sooner in life than Shaman and Shaman slows don't really start to make up the difference until getting their Lvl 39 slow that starts at 49%. Once they hit 51 and get Turgurs that starts as a 66% and gains 1%/2 levels, that will more than make up for the better HP/Ac buff ability and Complete Healing that the Cleric brings. And SoW will be your best friend since I'm sure SoW potions won't be selling for 70pp a 10 dose like they do on my established server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The whole point that speaks against war / shm is that you wont duo anyways because the mobs do not die fast enough. Like you said, langseax.  6 / 23, you think that one kills anything fast?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For crying out loud you're a fool.  How is a cleric going to speed up kill rate?  How is a druid who has to do the same healing a cleric does only without the tool of slow going to speed up the kill rate?<br />
<br />
You can duo with a warrior/shaman with ANY gear.  If you're on a new server, you just have to work harder.  Since you claim that you have to group anyway (Which is bullshit, there are places all over you can duo to 65, even with sub par gear), warrior/shaman doesn't suffer at all since EVERY group wants a shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you've never grouped with a well played shaman, because what you're saying makes zero sense.</div></div><hr />
