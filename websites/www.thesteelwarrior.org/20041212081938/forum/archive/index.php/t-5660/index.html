<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello! Im a lv 55 war and 2 box with a lv 55 cleric, both characters are almost lv 56. My warrior has 3khp and 1150ac and uses a GSoT most of the time. My question is can I do the enterance to old seb and single pull them? Once im done would I be able to invs and make my way to the exit or will I have to try and train my way there? I have never been and was looking for some advice before I just pop in. I assume since nothing seems to be undead in here, that all mobs will run at 20%? Should I invest in an Anklesmasher before I head into old seb? This looks like a zone that I will want to learn well, since it has several good warrior items that drop once I can get deeper into it. Should I not come to Seb unless I have a chanter, or evacer? Are there many casters between the enterance and the exit that might be able to see through invs? Do I need to worry about gaters? I see lots of mobs in the beastiery list 44-48 are those by chance the enterance mobs or am I going to be looking at lv 50+ mobs at the enterance. I have several map printouts of the enterance and from what I can tell the very first part looks similar to the hole. In the hole you can single pull them atleast the first 6 or 8 and was wondering if I could do the same here. I would appreciate any advice you veterans might have to offer. Thank you!</div></div><hr />

The most wipes which happened to me in Sebelis were because a frog escaped and 10 buddies came to join the party :rolleyes: ...<br />
so buy the snare whip :) or just root with your cleric ;) entry should be easy doable for you<br />
*depends how good your cc is if you get an add ;)*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are lots of mobs in Sebilis who see through invis.<br />
Some mobs in entrance are real hard to single cause you have to stand nearly on them to see them/target them or have a line of sight for a spell.<br />
<br />
And when you get a runner ... have gate memmed for your cleric.<br />
<br />
In your level only possibility for single pulls is the cleric and when he is not successful he will be first target for 2 to 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
Btw. without snare its alltime a deadly session there, cause root will alltime break in wrong time and when you fight at entrance mob ist fast out of sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent a ton of time in Seb.  I will concur that mobs there run, and when they run, they run fast, and they bring back lots of friends.  I don't think you can single pull at 55-56, if I recall correctly you can start sometimes getting singles at 57-58.  But you should be able to handle two mobs, which is what you should get on all the entrance pulls.  <br />
<br />
The biggest problem you will have is dealing with runners, root is only marginally effective.  If you can spend some plat on a silken whip of ensnaring.  I use one in situations like that and in mainhand it usually procs pretty early, so I can swap it out for a better weapon, and snare lasts a good while.  Kunzar Ku'juch is also ok for this, but dark doesn't last nearly as long and the ratio isn't as good, but it's cheaper, not sure of the proc rate on it.  Of course with either there are going to be mobs you just don't get a proc on, but if you have either one you will be much better off.  Sure your dps will be lower, but the most important thing in Seb is controlling runners.<br />
<br />
Lots of mobs see invis, you won't be able to run to exit with invis, you will get seen.  However, make sure your war has max hps, toss him a celestial heal, gate your cleric, and run for the exit, you should make it without a problem if you know the way.  Or buy a DA idol before you go and use a charge of it to make for exit.  Make sure no one is camping exit, as that is a somewhat commonly camped area due to the ease of escape if things go bad.  Also, if you have an invis potion it will help because you won't draw aggro right off the bat, you should make it a ways at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another good, cheap snare option is the serrated bone dirk. Procs at level 27 iirc. Also procs clinging darkness.  Not the best option out there, but better than nothing in a pinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 65 I can run to the exit with no invis and usually not agro anything so long as I don't run right over the mob. <br />
<br />
I think the following see invis from the last time I went around conning stuff with my cobalt greaves:<br />
<br />
Dar knights<br />
any wizard frog<br />
ilis frogs<br />
reet frogs<br />
shrooms<br />
rarely a krup will see invis<br />
golems see invis, but if you hug the wall they shouldnt agro by the exit<br />
<br />
Since you are 55 you can also hit defensive or evasive on the run to the exit in case something does attack you. Sometimes when I'm in a high level area and I'm trying to get past mobs to the exit I'll hit fortitude. (eg I'm ally in skyshine but not with Yelinak. I don't want to run all the way back down so I pop fortitude and run past him and click on the wall in the back of his lair)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If memory serves, all knights and bugs see invis.<br />
<br />
Cleric lvl 34 pacify, or 55ish wake of tranquility, should be huge here for getting single pulls.  Sit the warrior down and use the cleric for pulling.  Pull with annull to ensure that the mob doesn't have SOW.  Cleric stuns are probably your best way of stopping runners.  A snare whip is useful but not reliable.  Remember your cleric has bash too, which doubles your opportunities to interrupt casters and stun runners.<br />
<br />
In case you haven't figured it out yet, your cleric is your primary character in this duo when you head into dungeons.  Your warrior is just a DPS/taunt pet.  Use all the tools that your cleric has at its disposal: MOR, hammer pet, protection of vie if you have it.  At 56 you will get your first proccing hammer and good yaulp, and this combo will add a lot of DPS to your duo.  At 56 your cleric's total DPS may nearly match the DPS of your warrior.  Don't just sit the cleric in the corner like a bot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">None of the bugs see invis that I've come across, even the named. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my advice if you looking for a deserted zone with good xp and ok loot get yourself keyed for Howling Stones. Most of mobs dont run and its pretty easy and you can do basement and wing which you can get  a key for. I had a lot of fun 2 boxing there.<br />
<br />
As per OS. Mobs run, gate and not single pullable till 60. There is good cash loot here thought pp, gems and items. I wouldnt 2 box sebelis entrance. If you can get to zone out thats a much easier and safer camp and ou can pull singles all day once you break it as well as be safe as long as no one trains and mobs dont run far from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there's any way you could clear enough to get to exit camp, in fact I'm sure of it.  But if it's already cleared out by someone else you could head to exit and pull to there.  Snare whip may not be 100% reliable, but I would estimate I get a proc 50% of the time before 25% of the mobs life is gone and 75-80% of the time before it starts to run or so.  So that's about 70-80%+ percent of the mobs you won't have to worry about running from, the other 20% or so you can control with root/stun/bash.<br />
<br />
Although I think you could 2 box Droga at that level also.  Nothing sees invis in Droga, aggro range is lower on those mobs so it's easier to get single pulls, and it just seems to me like they don't run as fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pacify or Wake should get you to the zone out camp safely.  If you can't manage that then you will have trouble pulling singles anywhere in the zone.<br />
<br />
The suggestion of doing Howling Stones is a great one.  The mobs in HS have probably half the hit points as those in OS, most of them don't run, and the cleric's undead nukes will work on about 2/3 of the mobs.  You do have to be able to afford a gate potion or get an OT hammer, though.  For some this is a bigger obstacle than for others.  With the revamp you can now XP right to 65 in HS if you wanted to, and you can build a master key for all the doors too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aamen</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some really odd suggestions here(?)<br />
<br />
First off, SBD is rog only.<br />
<br />
Secondly, mobs don't run if there's more than one of them attacking you.  Invest in some DS potions, load CH, go to town.<br />
<br />
Third, yes, once you get the pattern down, you absolutely could work your way to the 1st zone out/exit camp and hold it.  Although I wouldn't suggest it, since it can get 'trainy'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2-box warrior and cleric as well and I never spent a lot of time in Seb due to the runner issue and the CR issue.  It is definitely doable, and what Aamen said is good advice that has worked well for me, just make sure you always have 2 in camp.  Now your cleric might not be able to keep up with that, and if so the snare whip is your best bet but you will learn to hate the thing when it doesn't proc for the 3rd mob in a row hehe.  At least if you're using the GSoT you don't need to worry about DD procs breaking root.  <br />
<br />
If your cleric happens to be a dark elf you can do the regeant symbol of innoruk quest which is a very nifty item, although the snare on it is very weak.<br />
<br />
One thing to consider.  If you're not sure you can make the zone-out, and you're the only one in the zone, you are better off to run to the zone-in and die than to try to make the zone-out and die back in there because your cleric won't be able to get to your corpse.  I did manage to DA, run to the corpse, DB, drag corpse to the zone-in, and gate one time, but 9 out of 10 times you're gonna be in bad shape if you have to CR with the cleric and your corpse is way down inside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use those tools that your cleric has.  It's not just a CH bot.  When duoing, think of your warrior as the bot and your cleric as the main.  You will accomplish more that way.</div></div><hr />
