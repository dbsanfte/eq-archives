<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am losing the phantabulous 65 epic'd cleric I had sole access to for the last 2 months (/sob uncontrollably). In a guild somewhat short on clerics already, this is a big loss :(<br />
<br />
So I've had this 25 cleric twink for a while (abandoned, but didn't strip him when I got access to the ubah priest). He's fairly well geared up. What I'm looking for is suggestions on how to PL the cleric up to useful levels (for us that's 50 or 55+ really). I don't expect to be able to photocopy the 65 cleric of course (he had gear that's beyond my guild at this time anyway), but I am looking to at least be able to bot a functional cleric on raids again in a reasonably short period of time.<br />
<br />
With regards to characters I could PL him with, well, I have a 60 warrior :p. However, given it's implications for the guild, I can probably bully some people into helping (sometimes it's good to be guild leader :D ), so assume access to 55+ members of pretty much any class.<br />
<br />
It's easy to PL melees, but I have no experience doing priests/casters, so any help would be most appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bogonia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you'll probably need some outside help to get the cleric to 40 so that they can group with the warrior, then from there it's smooooth sailin, just lotsa greenie killin' with the warrior.  See if you can get access to a druid, then load up the cleric with as much hp/ac gear as you can within your reasonable budget.  Remember that this isn't the gear the cleric's going to actually be playing in once they step into the cleric role, this is just their pl'ee suit.<br />
<br />
Get whatever buffs you can on the cleric AND the druid, then head out to unrest.  Load up at least word of shadow and expulse undead on the cleric.  With the druid always have up - share wolfform (verrrrry important here), the best thorns you can put on the druid, the best thorns you can put on the cleric (shield of thorns, the 49 spell), ensnare, and your most efficient quick-type heal.  Make sure you have a hoteky to target the cleric with the druid just in case.<br />
<br />
Now, wolfform both toons and take them up to the fireplace room.  If you haven't been here before, unrest is an outside dungeon with a mansion in it.  when you enter, you'll be heading to the front of the mansion.  Go in the doors and head around the halls - the house is mainly setup like a big square with open areas pocketed in the middle.  You want to follow the first floor square around to the left until you are opposite the entry doors in the back of the house.  There's a stairway there, head up it one flight and you're in a room with a fireplace.  This is where to hang out for the next 10 or so'ish levels.<br />
<br />
In unrest, things won't aggro on you in wolf form unless you are attacking (or being attacked by) another creature right next to them (assist aggro only).  So ALWAYS keep wolf form up.  Also, as they're undead, they will -almost- always stay aggro on the nearest target.  This is what you'll use to your advantage.<br />
<br />
Park the cleric near a corner (but not in one, that's going to be the druid's spot).  Toss thorns on the cleric and thorns on the druid, then head out to pull with the druid.  If you haven't been here before, scout around.  There's a lot of creatures on that floor and the first floor, which will be your targets until 25ish.  After 25ish, or if you're really comfortable in your abilities to pl and the druid's strength mana/gear-wise, you'll be wanting to go up the staircases.  The staircase that you came up originally continues up two more floors - the 3rd floor has one room known as the bar with a bunch of mobs in it, and the 4th floor has a room has a room with three mobs in it.  The other staircase is right around the corner from the fireplace - face the fireplace and go to the right of it.  there's 3? (maybe 4) mobs in the room at the top of the stairs, then 4 inside the door and one or two out on the balcony.<br />
<br />
Creatures to avoid or just outright kill dead fast with the druid include - ghouls and werebats, who run, and possibly festering hags (who nuke).  Don't even bother with Krix Fritchkoff, he's a pain in the butt like most gnomes.  If the druid's gear is okies and you toss up fire/cold resist you should be ok to pl with hags as long as you're VERY careful about the cleric not getting aggro.<br />
<br />
Now the tactics :D   Ok, head out to pull with the druid.  On a usual pull, you want to get 4-5, but start with 2-3 to get a feel for it.  Pull the mobs with ensnare and bring them back near the cleric.  Wedge druid in corner.  Let mobs beat the snot outta you and heal yourself.  Take cleric in and pbae (word of shadow) if you can get close enough to without getting closer to the mobs than the driud is.  If you can't get close enough to pbae, then use the undead dd or a hammer (might as well work on the cleric melee skills:) )  As long as the cleric does one point of damage to the mobs, you're good.  After the cleric does their dmg, you can either work on casting/medding skills (healing self, casting more dds, summoning food/water, casting an abjure buff over and over) or melee skills, while just keeping the druid healed 'til the mobs fall over dead :D   This place is bone chip heaven if you're up for doing all the looting (highly recommended as otherwise it gets hard to target with cleric).<br />
<br />
Test how much they hit the cleric for every once in a while, because you're going to want to work on the cleric's defense.  About 25ish, just have them be the porcupine for the first floor pulls and smack each thing with the hammer once, while healing the cleric with the druid.  Or if you're looking for faster increases and are the adventurous type ;) have the cleric be the porcupine for yellow/red pulls.  Just be sure of the druid's healing power first.<br />
<br />
Somewhere around mid-30's, this spot gets kinda inefficient, so either head to the basement or to kaesora library, or even guk dead side.  Same sort of tactic everywhere, just no wolf-form in the other areas to make for the nice, non-aggro roaming around.  Froggies and some of the Kaesora stuff also run, so be sure to pull with ensnare, and know that it's going to be slightly less efficient as the cleric must nuke/melee the runners down (druid cannot outdmg the amout that the cleric does).<br />
<br />
Once you get the cleric to 40, you can group them with the warrior and just slaughter your way through whatever mobs you want that are blue to the cleric.  They'll have CH by that point, so you should be pretty golden.  Kaesora xalgoz area is kinda nice just cause there's sooooooooooooooo many mobs, but it's pretty much your personal preference at that point.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting and good luck!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kadore Damadred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cant remember what lvl a cleric gets atone, buts its a memory wipe spell, me and the girlfriend have used it when she has fallen behind in lvls, should be able to kill a mob to 5-10% health, wipe it and have cleric kill for the exp, your skills will suffer from fast lvling, but its a viable option if in a big hurry to assist your guild as you say <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">atone is 34 IIRC. would be an interesting way to go about things if it 100pct mem-wipes :) I can get the casting skills up easy enough- levels are more important to me atm.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies guys :) Got 29 last night just grouping in Highkeep but the xp is still slower than I'd like :) These should help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Question what level would the cleric need to be to get exp from a 65 Warr..is it level 45 that the cleric would need to be to exp exp from him??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level + half of level = max level the char can group with and still get exp.<br />
example:<br />
lvl 30 cleric, 30 + 15 = 45, 45 would be the highest level they could group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mem wipe from Atone isn't 100 percent.  <br />
<br />
Just get the highest level melee possible to group with the cleric and slaughter. At 25, that would be a 37.  Most 37 melees could rip through Marus Seru. Even with sharing, the exp will still be fine.  If you want to hasten the process, grab a druid and have them slap a DS on the melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morgred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grouping lvl requirements equation is acutally closer to this:<br />
<br />
(highest lvl char lvl x 2) / 3 = lvl required to group with.<br />
<br />
(65 x 2) /3 = 43.3 Round up to be safe:D <br />
