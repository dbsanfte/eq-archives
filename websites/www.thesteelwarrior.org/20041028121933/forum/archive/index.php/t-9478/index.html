<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LotharoftheHillPeopl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I have been trying to level up my 2hs (now at 30, I negelected it because I was leveling to fast for it too keep up)  I am finding it painfully slow.  I am currently using a Di'zok Imperial Katana 35/43 but am looking for something faster to boost the skill at a high rate.  I am looking for a 2hs with under 30, or close to, that can be bought for less than 3k or can be quested by a 30 with help from a (60 druid and 55 wizard)  If you guys have any suggestions please tell me.  Here is my current gear. <br />

Thanks for the suggestions on WMBS.  I didnt think i would do any damage for me because of my low level but it will end up at 17/28 with a +2 dmg bonus on top of that which is decent enough for leveling.  The longer it takes to kill a mob the more swings I get in.</div></div><hr />

Underfoot (adds some wis) or Brellium</div></div><hr />

/agree, though i got mine up with a Sword of the Crypt Creeper (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23315).  Im not saying it went terribly fast, its only at 172</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Back in the day, there was this little Mechanical Merchant by the Windmills outside of Akanon that you could stand behind and attack, he wouldn't attack you if you were behind him. Used to be a good way of keeping your skills up. I used to visit him after 5-10 lvl's and catch up on all my skills. I would attack him and go to bed, when I woke up 2hs would be maxed, then I would put in the 2HB and go to work. I know I know, I used an exploit to enhance my toon, sue me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">heh i did that with swimming.  i jumped in the lake under the bridge to PC in shadowhaven, did autoswim up against the wall, and by morning my swimming was at 200 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Btw .. before going to skill up in a weapon, try and get some Shaman buffs for DEX.<br />
It helps weapon skill increases quite a bunch. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit :<br />
Oh, and I agree on the choice of the War Marshalls Bladed Staff, it'll even be useful once you get into your 50's as a damage dealer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">eh, I couldn't afford a WMBS back then. I used a weighty polearm (29/34). Unfortunately, not sure that would be very effective today, as it has a recommended level in effect now ( I think).<br />
Anchor's point about getting the DEX buff is a good one, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sanctimas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">War Marshall's Bladed-Staff is like amazing to bring it up, also, its it Underfoot Platemail for the cultural armor for dwarves</div></div><hr />

high wis and/or int also helps a lot.  might be a good idea to get KEI too just for the wis and int boosts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AS far as I know, INT / WIS doesn't govern how fast you get combat skills in anyw ay, Offensive OR defensive. Instead it is governed by DEX and AGI .... DEX for offensive skills sich as Offense, Weapon Skill, Dualwield .. etc. And AGI for the defensive combat skills, such as Defense, Dodge, Parry, Riposte, Safe Fall.<br />
<br />
INT / WIS governs Spell skills, and tradeskills however (Though smithing has a Strength bonus, and Fletching a DEX bonus, if I remember correctly). And also those skills not already covered, such as Forage and swimming. Used to govern skill ups for Sense Heading too, but they gimped the skill instead.<br />
<br />
However, it can never hurt to have a KEI buff there if you have room enough for the buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Offcourse, things can have been changed since I played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frawdo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Anker is correct, only DEX has an effect on offensive skills. INT/WIS won't help getting the 2HS skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LotharoftheHillPeopl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for all the help guys.  I am going to go buy a WMBS seeing as i just hit 37 (Pled by a 60 druid) and it is now a 20/28.   I am going to get temp Harnessing of Spirit for a handy 55 str and dex buff and go kill some hhk nobles.  <br />
Thanks again,<br />
