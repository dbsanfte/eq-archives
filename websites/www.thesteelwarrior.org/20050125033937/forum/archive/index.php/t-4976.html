I am non-guilded, non-raiding, and have about 35K in the bank.  Lots of stuff could be upgraded - just wondering where I can get the most bang for my buck. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One problem, Kahael, Xene's a dwarf and dwarves cannot worship Rallos.  That pretty much rules out RZ cultural armor. :p <br />
<br />
I'd suggest upgrading your arms, as they look like your weakest slot, currently.  Brellium, or the veksar vambraces. (name escapes me, at the moment)</div></div><hr />

I'd be looking for something with stats, such as the arms from the Everfrost or North Ro adv merchants. <br />
<br />
Surprised you put 2 points into Regen, and not Run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the replies. <br />
<br />
I've upgraded my arms to Feartouched Rubicite, though I can't seem to get Magelo to reflect the change.   I also now have a Nightmarewood bow but still looking for something better. <br />
<br />
I'm not only a Dwarf, but agnostic as well.  The pieces of Brellium that I have were very hard to come by. <br />
<br />
Surprised you put 2 points into Regen, and not Run. <br />
Yeah.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  I'm putting my points in run now - just need one more.</div></div><hr />
