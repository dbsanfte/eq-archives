<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some rangers on test have reported what the reward is, albeit unverified. Anyway according to  the patch message there is such a NPC who you are now meant to hail, so at least that part is true. I cant bring myself to believe the rest till i log in later today, but if there is any truth to it, well, hot damn!<br />
<br />
Theres a new mob in a building near the Soulbinder named Gram Dunnar.<br />
<br />
Hail him. He will give 2 []'ed words. <br />
The First one gets you a Charm that has stats specific to your class and the number of POP zones you have access to (not fixed on what flags you had BEFORE you got the charm, it will ramp up when you get more POP zone flags)<br />
<br />
The second key word you have to say 'I will tell stories'.<br />
<br />
****If you have XP going 100% into AA points.... ****<br />
<br />
Each time you say this, you will get &gt;&gt; *1* AA point &lt;&lt;<br />
Say it multiple times. You will get 1 aa point for each flag you have.<br />
<br />
Before the changes I was flagged for:<br />
Storms/Valor<br />
BoThunder<br />
PoTorment<br />
<br />
I had 3 flags, and i had 100% of my XP going into AA points. I said it 3 times and got 1 full aa point each time for a total of 3 aa points. When I said it again, he did not give me an AA point, he just said 'I've heard that story before' or something like that.<br />
<br />
This is an XP GAIN, not a flat out AA point gain. If you have 100% XP going into AA, then you will gain exactly *1* aa point. If you have all/some XP going into regular leveling, it will split appropriately. Your mileage will vary.<br />
<br />
Also, apparently, each time you get flagged for a new zone, you can Hail this guy and say the keyword and get another AA point worth of XP. This is *UNCONFIRMED*! (I may be wrong)<br />
<br />
Now, the Charm...<br />
<br />
This charm ramps up depending on how many PoP zones you are flagged for.<br />
<br />
If you have no flags, the charm will have no stats.<br />
<br />
My charm was this:<br />
<br />
Intricate Wooden Figurine<br />
Slot: Charm<br />
AC 5<br />
Dex 4<br />
Wis 3<br />
Agi 4<br />
HP 27<br />
Mana 24<br />
ALL RESISTS 3<br />
Wt 0.1<br />
Class: RNG (Its dependant on your class, Rogues charms wont have Mana and have different ammounts etc)<br />
<br />
I asked an elemental flagged ranger (Thank you, Cloudwraite) what his stats were (He had all flags except Time):<br />
<br />
AC 15<br />
Dex 13<br />
Sta 9<br />
Wis 9<br />
Agi 13<br />
HP 81<br />
Mana 72<br />
ALL RESISTS 9<br />
<br />
Im going to take a wild stab at *ALL 10 FLAGS*<br />
(This is just a guess, since there are no Time flagged people on Test)<br />
AC 16 (1.6 per flag)<br />
Dex 15 (1.5 per flag)<br />
Sta 10 (1 per flag)<br />
Wis 10 (1 per flag)<br />
Agi 15 (1.5 per flag)<br />
HP 90 (9 per flag)<br />
Mana 80 (8 per flag)<br />
ALL RESISTS 10 (1 per flag)<br />
<br />
This was for *rangers*. I didnt ask aboutother classes. Different classes will have different stats per number of flags. Im sure this will all get noodled out soon.<br />
<br />
A definate nice upgrade to my Charm of the Emerald Warrior (which will now just be PR gear). And the 3 aa points didnt hurt. With the 1 aa I had saved, I bought Planar Power 2 and 3. =)<br />
<br />
I imagine this will be a nice upgrade to Time flagged people. Upwards of 100 raw HP and 10 to all resists in a slot that probably just had Bundle of Tiger Whiskers or some other lame charm.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

I hope im wrong cause my Charisma based charm blows hehe. although it does get me 1hp when I have a chr buff and that gets me 9701hp hehe.<br />
 Someone log onto to test and he to the soulbinder. Test is usualy up during patches after an hour or so</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azlana</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reward for planar progression will be available this week.  We found an issue with part of the reward on Test server, and are in the process of fixing it.  This is a top priority and we plan to bring it to all live servers this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kildace</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is borderline overpowered, I'm not complaining :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pleasantly surprised by this, but I don't think it is overpowered at all. It looks like the charm will be a decent item, a very decent item when you compare it to other charms but nothing overpowered imho. The AAs are okay...something I didn't honestly think they would do actually. All in all I have to say I think they are doing a good thing here. It's great to be rewarded for your efforts...something that can seem few and far between in EQ at times...so...Wtg SoE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rolsdar</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/Agree Rylaa<br />
<br />
I dont think its overpowered at all, seems to be a fair reward for all the time spent flagging.<br />
<br />
Its nice to see something decent like this for a change :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The charm doesn't look overpowered, since in order for it to get more powerful, you need to get the flags.  However, they removed the flag requirement to enter the zones, provided you were a certain level.  People won't be always going to get those flags, so having a charm that will improve as you actually take the time to get flags is actually a pretty good deal.  Wonder if an effect appears (vengeance/FT/regen/special ability) after you reach Time...<br />
<br />
Love the solution for the exp too...it gives you enough exp to get one AA...you can put it on normal exp and get regular exp for the flags even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">now if only i had some god damn flags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems that the good thing about this is that when you do get the flags, youll recieve the same rewards as the flagged people will.<br />
<br />
Seems pretty fair to everyone :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you know if you can get both rewards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rolsdar</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparantly the reward is both :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeeoRZ</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And my guild laughed at me when I sad I wanted to get flagged before the patch =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, you get both the charm and exp.  I assume the charm will keep getting better, and I don't know if you can get exp for flags you get after this change, but it seems like you could as long as the dwarf is still there.  I am flagged for Tactics and PoV and I got 1.8 AA and 7% life exp (set it to 90/10 AA so I could ding 58 hehe) and my charm was 2 ac 20 hps and 2 to a bunch of stats IIRC.  My cleric bot only had one flag (tactics) but he gained about 2/3 of level 53 and his charm was 7 hps 8 mana and 1 ac 1 to stats/saves.  <br />
<br />
Nice that finally people will be able to fill their charm slot.  Even a character with no flags could get the charm, but it had no stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They mentioned that the Acrylia key was turned into a charm that's wearable, even if you don't have LoY... Is the planar one the same way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the reward is not actually going in with this patch, but likely later in the week according to the patch message, you still have time to get flagged before the reward is put into place.  Also, it sounded like the charm might just gain in strength as you get additional flags, like most charms do.  The experience bonus might also still be available for when you gain additional flags, but I guess that remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the upgrades to charms and experience bonus will be available to people who flag past today. It only makes sense. As long as the NPCs there and I  see no reason why Sony would discriminate against people who are only flagged after today. <br />
<br />
After all, the rewards are for getting FLAGGED. whether you are already flagged or get flagged past today, the level of difficulty is still the same.</div></div><hr />

If it is true... shame on anyone &lt;60 who gets any AA exp!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The comments from those on test is that its pure XP so you can split it to either Reg or AA. At 65, its one complete AA point.<br />
<br />
And yes, its both rewards you get altough anyone with PoP gets the charm, it just won't have much stat wise until they get beyond the 'opened' zones. The stats also improve as you progress through PoP.<br />
<br />
IMO, having only a few flags I'm happy as I'll grab 3 or 4 aa and something for my empty charm slot. I only hope that there is maybe say 50% AA xp for flags I have from the quest version. I also hope that if they open up POI Factory and PoNB that there is something given for having those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The charm says &quot;item increases in statisics as you gain access to more planes&quot; or something like that, so I don't think you will get improvments for things like PoNb and the factory.  They are different zones but the same plane.  Just speculating though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reward is a tad too overpowered.<br />
<br />
How many people here know someone who got a PoV/PoS flag juts by being the 6th wheel in a 5-man kill team? Just by being part of a big chain of flaggings?<br />
<br />
And for the supreme effort of doing nothing more than NOT dying and NOT getting in the way, they get TWO FREE LEVELS?<br />
<br />
All those people who claimed HARD work for flags means something ... <br />
<br />
And this is the result of hard work? FREE levels?<br />
<br />
It's almost as cheap and dirty as buying powerlevelling from Playerauctions or something like that.<br />
<br />
I don't like it all that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please.  2 or 3 AAs isn't going to &quot;overpower&quot; anybody.  Neither is 1 &quot;free&quot; level or 20 or 30 extra hps.  They could have gotten powerleveled for 2 AAs instead of getting escorted through the trials and had the same result.  <br />
<br />
OMG some noob has run 3 now!  What are we going to do?</div></div><hr />

Free AA? yank yank, I suppose it's an excuse to do finishing blow though..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those &quot;unflagged and opposed to free levels&quot; because a flag can be gotten by &quot;dead weight&quot; has clearly never grouped with &quot;dead weight&quot; in an exp group.   They get &quot;free levels&quot; too.   The thing is, all the time dying while learning all these crazy encounters and spending days learning them when I could've been out grinding away cost me a LOT more than 7AA's.   My understanding is that they will also be an ongoing thing as a &quot;reward&quot; for getting future flags, as well as the charm being &quot;upgraded&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Those who had no access before and now do without the sacrifices involved in flagging should be happy, their horizons have expanded greatly. <br />
<br />
Those who have done it and will now be reaping the rewards of their efforts... should be happy, their efforts were recognized.<br />
<br />
Overall, I couldn't think of anything better that could've been done.</div></div><hr />

If you have a plus 1 to 1 single stat that is better than before!<br />

IMO this was a reasonable reward for opening the planes :)</div></div><hr />

As it is, we get a cool item in a slot that was empty for many and is a big upgrade for those that did get a charm.  Enjoy the fact that the reward for flagging didn't suck.</div></div><hr />

#6 is Torment.<br />
<br />
Not sure what #7 is.  I thought it would be PoNb but I am flagged for that and didn't get anything for it either.<br />
<br />
And no you don't get AA for elemental planes flags because the elemental planes weren't &quot;opened up&quot;.  The compensation was only for doing flags for zones that are now &quot;free&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The charm works for all planes though, which is nice.</div></div><hr />

PoV<br />
PoS<br />
CoD<br />
BoT<br />
HoH<br />
PoTatics<br />
SoL Ro <br />
<br />
I think this is correct but dont hold me to it...<br />
<br />
7aa is the max<br />
<br />
Grats SoE on not fuggering up the reward and giving the player base something they will acctually use in terms of the charm and giving aa that was earned with hard work instead of the SoE free ride!<br />
<br />
Grats on the rewards all !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's got to be Sol Ro I think.  I only got 6 AA and I'm flagged for everything short of the elementals and Sol Ro.  I can't find any reason to complain about the flag reward.  I think it was just about perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's exactly what Bigtyme listed. He tells you what they are as he gives you points.<br />
<br />
 And because he gives AA for Sol Ro flag I think it's odd no AA for Ele access. Should either be 1AA for all of them, or one for Air/Water/Earth and 1 for Fire. Charms give stats for zones clear up to Time. So I guess it's intentionally hard capped for 7 AA max. Oh well, 2 more AA woulda been nice=)</div></div><hr />
