My guild are at the stage of Vindi/Velketor/Xanamech, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't worry about riposte killing you until PoFire. Magma, Reparm, blah blah. As long as you stay somewhat in progression the other big hitters die fine with DW(MM, AD, Bert).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Riposte isn't as big a deal as some make it out to be. It's true using a 2hander helps, but I don't think it'll make or break you. It's all a matter of luck sometimes. I've stayed up longer tanking Reparm using defensive (while dual wielding) before than one of my guild's better equipped warriors with a BoWar using evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye our top 3-4 tanks all DW still(F Rallos) and the big hitters die fine. But if you're really concerned about riposte, that's the time to worry about it. Basically you're gonna want a BoW, but you'll want that anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Riposte damage isn't something that's meaningful to observe in practice.  It just doesn't make sense to go back and say 'well that time I died because it riposted twice, if I didn't DW it'd only riposte once and lived.'  All you can say is using 2H will definitely make you live longer on average due to reduced ripostes (stat loss from 2H is usually minimal, especially with BoW's superior tanking stats), but there's no guaranteed you will live longer in any given instance of tanking.  If surviving the mob is the problem, then you probably want to use 2H.  If you're feeling pretty confident about your likelihood to live, then it's not a huge deal to avoid ripostes.  That said, even on mobs where MT can be pretty confident on surviving, I tend to see most people switch to 2H or sword &amp; shield after the disc is up.  Of course, you may be forced to DW for aggro if it's a fight where aggro is more important than survivability.</div></div><hr />
