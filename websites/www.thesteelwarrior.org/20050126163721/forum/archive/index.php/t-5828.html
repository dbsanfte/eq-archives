<br />
My problem... can anyone suggest gear/weapons to upgrade to?<br />

Iam a just lvl'd 61 Oger Warrior. I have decent gear. Most of the armor since 55. I used to be able to hold aggro just fine but Im finding its harder and harder everyday. My Taunt almost NEVER works, and Berate does 90% the time. And I play ping pong between the slower and the casters. Now since Im a Ogre warrior, and basically lazy I dont like all that running.:D <br />
<br />
Any serious suggestions would be appreciated</div></div><hr />

If agro is an issue pick up a Great staff of thunder or a CHoS/SotBS combo, or maybe try an anger aug on your windblade.<br />
<br />
Other than weapons the only thing I would recommend upgrading is to get an elemental bow for range.  Stonewood compound bow is probably the best for warriors and these seem to be coming down in price.</div></div><hr />

I find in most situations the CoHS and SBoD dont hold aggro will look into some hate Augs then. Thanks guys</div></div><hr />

hmm I believe his dex is higher than yours.  I wield the cookie cutters as well, but they do fail at aggro occasionally, this definely has to do with how often they proc.  Also I have realize over time sometimes some high damage nuke spells will out aggro your weapons no matter what, and you just have to taunt, bellow, and wait for your weapon to re-proc to regain aggro.  As for the range item my friend, if you do not have the hundres of k to spend on an elemental bow try war bow of rallos zek, it does not a really nice proc, it does not give you elemental warding, but it gives you awsome stats on dex and stregth, and it is 100 life+, it is about 50 k on my server.<br />
