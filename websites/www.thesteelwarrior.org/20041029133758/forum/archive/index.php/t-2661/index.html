<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main is a 65 enchanter with 100 AA and my guild is short on warriors (tanks too but warriors in particular) so I thought I'd see what the 'other side' of EQ is like and try to level a warrior ASAP. I have read almost everything in the Library here and love the site.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I twinked my warrior out with about 20k in gear. I have SCHW, a Cobalt BP (invigorate at 45+), Frostbringer, CBoL, BCA, Venomous Axe, etc.<br />
<br />
My skills are all maxed and I think I've got the hang of shield and my other warrior abilities. <br />
<br />
What I'm having trouble with is finding appropriate spots to 1. solo and 2. duo with a 31 enchanter and his 2box'd 53 cleric for maximum experience. My guild's minimum level is 55 and I'd like to get there as soon as possible (I'm missing out on DKP!).<br />
<br />
Solo'ing<br />
I currently solo in Echo Caverns and the xp is good. When I hit 35 though I imagine the xp will start dropping off in this zone. Where should I go to next? <br />
<br />
Duo'ing with a chanter and 2box cleric<br />
<br />
Really, the combination is ideal. But we are having trouble finding places with high level mobs but low enough AC HP that I can kill them quickly enough to warrent the effort. <br />
<br />
Currently we are doing basilisks in JP making about 2 levels a night. The basilisks range down to level 30, though, and we will soon have to move on.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for are some high-level, hard-hitting (I have 2300ac with Temperence), low AC/HP mobs. Zone xp bonus is, of course, a plus but not a neccesity. Does anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quick 2nd Question:<br />
<br />
Are there any easily attainable gear upgrades you notice in my magello? How important is having 150+ dex?<br />
<br />
My main has Dire Charm and I can clear areas like Kael fairly easily... I cannot 2box my character but could buy some invis potions and camp her somewhere, kill mobs with my main and loot using Uira.<br />
<br />
I'm nervous about doing this in Kael given the number of people there at any given time. Are there any other zones where there are good NO DROP items or quests that would quickly upgrade Uira?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Level until you can get exp with the chanter (42 I believe) then have the enchanter DC clear a zone (argh, same account, never mind).  It's the best exp there is.  Your skills will suffer somewhat, but since they are capped pre-50 by level 40 you should by ok.<br />
<br />
For exp, you could probably hit Sol B at 31 with backup and level to 60 there (window/tiger to 40, KPC to 50, bats and bugs until they get LB, then LDCs to 60).  Just make sure you have a snarer.<br />
<br />
I'd snag a pair of crystal spider eyes, that's the only upgrade that really jumps out at me.  If you want to clear Kael, have the enchanter do the looting, then park both characters in Thurg to MQ that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As it stands now, before they change the zone, City of Mist is great.  The reason is that there is NO heal agro there that i can detect.<br />
Zone in.  Bind at zone in.  Step 10 feet forward and thats camp.  Lull to get single pulls (might be able to single pull with cleric at 53 but not sure) or just pull both of the front 2 with the warrior and mash away.<br />
<br />
Keep the cleric at some range from the warrior and the mobs and just kill all day.  Move farther into zone as warrior levels up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd also give up on the idea of soloing if I were you.  You'll need VERY specialized gear and a ton of patience to do it once you get past 40 or so, and it's way faster to group. (solo xp slows to a crawl and becomes nigh impossible somewhere between lvl 40 and level 55 depending how good your gear is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weldilar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">im 55 i solo in velks for about 3 kills per % of reg xp. i havnt tried aa there yet but i assume it better. i have relativly low downtime wiht a thurg bp(100hp self only clicky heal)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I found Naggy's lair to be great XP 40-50 (and even in the low 50's off the bats and spiders), and Lower Guk is pretty good in the 30's.  <br />
<br />
City of Mist as mentioned above is great too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 35 now with closer to 3k buffed hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">with the cleric and ench, you might try the Mines of Nurga, went there last night with a 55 monk and myself (2box cleric for heals)<br />
<br />
Mostly green at the zone in, some light blues.<br />
<br />
Spoke to a 49 BeastLord that was soloing, said that from mid 30s to 50 it is great exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">mid 30s with the new revamped Nurga?</div></div><hr />
