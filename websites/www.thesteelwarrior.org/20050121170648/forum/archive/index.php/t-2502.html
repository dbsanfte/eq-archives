<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have decided to use EQCompanion but I have a couple of questions.  When people parse... do you guys parse a whole days worth of a certain set of weapons and mobs or do you change weapons through out the parse and the program separates when you used which weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well EQ companion can parse diff weapon setups in the same parse as long as they are different skills.  Like for example my dual wield setup is two swords, while my two hand setup is a blunt weapon so those are easy to seperate.  Other than that the parser doesnt know what weapons you are using.<br />
<br />
It is best if you are going to parse a certain combination of weapons vs another to use one set of weapons for an hour or so then say in chat &quot;TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST WEAPON SWITCH&quot; or something, then switch to the other set of weapons.  After you log for the night, then you can search your log file for the &quot;TEST TEST TEST....&quot; line and cut the log up into two logs and then parse each one seperately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The program will distinguish between different damage types (crushing, slashing, piercing, etc...) but it won't know what weapon (or even single or two handed) did the damage.<br />
<br />
What I do if I am testing something specific is say something like, &quot;Parse test - hammer main and Blackout off&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I do my test.<br />
<br />
When I go back to look at my logs, I can use the FIND feature in notepad/Word to search for &quot;Parse Test&quot; and I can rapidly find the correct section of my logs.<br />
<br />
I usually then copy the appropriate section out to a new document and parse only the part I am interested in (particular weapon/buff setup).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome.  Exactly the kind of tips I was looking for!!!  Thanks a lot guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the features I will be adding to EQ Companion soon is the ability to 'tell' it which weapons you are using. The next (unreleased) version already has a new feature where you can assign a 'Command chat channel' and you can send tells to that chat channel to command EQ Companion.<br />
<br />
When it is done, you will be able send a tell to your chat channel and say something like '/1 Primary SoD' and '/1 Secondary LSoEE' for example. EQ Companion also have 2 new columns in the fights list for primary and secondary weapons. From then on, each new fight will have 'SoD' in the primary column and 'LSoEE' in the secondary column.<br />
<br />
Then when you switch to a 2-hander for example, you can use command like '/1 2-hand WB' for example and then the primary and secondary columns will show 'WB' for all the fights that follow.<br />
<br />
This is something I have wanted to do for a long time already and now that I implemented the command chat channel feature, it will be easy to implement. The next 0.792 version will not have this yet, but I have a feeling the version that comes after will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually ended up implementing this last night (it only took about an hour to do) so when I release 0.792, hopefully real soon, this will be available.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, you can already prepare for this so you have a log file that shows your weapon info when you get 0.792.<br />
<br />
The way this works is you have to join a chat channel and send tells to it to let EQC know your weapon names. The name of the chat channel can be anything, but I would not recommend using something as generic as 'EQC&quot; or 'EQCCommand' for example because other people who start using this feature might join the same chat channel. I would use something like 'SilgurdarEQC' for example if your character's name is Silgurdar (that's my warrior's name).<br />
<br />
You can use the /autojoin command so you will automatically join this channel every time you log on to EQ.<br />
<br />
Once you have joined the chat channel, you can send tells to it using its channel number. The first channel you join will be number 1, etc. To send a tell to the channel, you would just do a &quot;/1 Hello!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Your log file will then have a line like:<br />
<br />
You tell SilgurdarEQC:1, 'Hello!'<br />
<br />
If you have assigned 'SilgurdarEQC' as your command chat channel in EQC, the 'Hello!' will be treated as a command.<br />
<br />
The commands are:<br />
<br />
PRI weaponname<br />
SEC weaponname<br />
2-H weaponname<br />
ETC etc_information<br />
EXP experience<br />
AA aa_experience<br />
<br />
Using command &quot;/1 pri SoD&quot; will tell EQC that your primary weapon is SoD. From then on, every new fight will have 'SoD' in the 'Primary' column of the fights-table.<br />
<br />
If you use &quot;/1 2-H WB&quot; command, your secondary weapon will be cleared automatically and your primary weapon will be assigned as '2H: WB'.<br />
<br />
The 'ETC' command is for showing buffs, etc. stuff that affect DPS and that you would like to show in the fights-table.<br />
<br />
The 'EXP' and 'AA' commands are if you want to track your experience gain. When ever you notice your AA experience for example increases, you can send another '/1 AA 30&quot; command for example to show that now you have 30% AA experience.<br />
<br />
All of these PRI, SEC, ETC, EXP and AA are shown in their own columns in the fights table. They are hidden by default so if you never use ETC-command for example, the column will be hidden.</div></div><hr />
