I have everything except the drop from the animated conscript, and have even taken a couple groups down there.  However, we can not find any way to split them, we even used a necro using pet, yet all three came?  I've heard of low level necros doing the pulling, so whats the catch?</div></div><hr />

Its too low of a con, and the other mobs go like &quot;umm fuck that, charlie go kick his ass&quot; and wont aggro.</div></div><hr />

A 65 SK did the split solo when i got the SoTE for my warrior.  It looks like a tough split, but it can be done.  GL :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some shaman can<br />
<br />
Shaman FD (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27730) <br />
<br />
One of the best utility items I ever seen for a high aggro class. Great for initial slows on hard mobs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Necro pets come in different classes, ie. monk pet, warrior pet, rogue pet, just like mage pets.  If they play the class, they should be aware of which level pet is what class type, as it makes a difference if they want a DPS pet vs tanking, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of misinformation on this thread.  Here's how you use a pet to single pull:<br />
<br />
A) the master must have the pet hold AA.<br />
B) the pet must con green to the mobs.<br />
C) the pet must NOT die. (so buff it up!)<br />
<br />
1) send pet to attack mob.<br />
2) as soon as mob engages pet, spam the command to have the pet withdraw.<br />
3) mob will pursue the pet as it walks back to the master.<br />
4) as long as the pet does not die, the other mobs will not follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrot</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done this many times for various friends and twinks of mine (and I am checking the spawn as I type this). The easiest part of the necro pull to mess up  is FDing close enough so  your pet will run at the mob when you command him, but being far back enough so the gargoyle is out of aggro range of the Guardian and the other 'goyle when he reaches you and you stand. It's a pretty fine line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need pet hold in order to do it.  <br />
<br />
Wrot is right.  You simply need to get close enough that the pet will run up and attack, but far back enough so that when you get up, the others don't agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't have to be anywhere near the mobs...just the pet needs to be.<br />
<br />
I usually did all the splitting for my guild when they did this, here's how I did it.  Please note I have a level 60 SK, so the pet I'm using is actually the level 44 Necro pet.  I believe the level 49 pet would work also.<br />
<br />
Summon 44/49 necro pet (60-65 SK), throw Virtue, Focus, whatever on the pet.  He just needs as many hp as possible.  Plant him near the mob with the Guard command.<br />
<br />
There are two large rocks along the ledge with the pool, I usually got on the side closest to the doorway into the rest of the Hole.  I FDd (not sure if necessary, but I did it anyways), then sent pet to attack the one I wanted to pull.  Immediately, I hit the Follow key so he'd come back to me instead of where I planted him.<br />
<br />
As soon as the conscript is agroed, I'd spam the back off command to bring the pet back.  You could alternately use the pet Hold command.  You'll have to work out how far away is enough to attack the conscript without agroing the guardian though.<br />
<br />
Repeat for both mobs, if desired.  This method is insanely easy, because you simply have to be far enough away.  No fine line, because the pet only needs to start out close enough.  The conscripts could easily be offtanked while killing the GotS if you'd prefer, but if you're only going for the Earthen Ore then splitting them like this works.<br />
<br />
I don't know if FD is necessary for this or not.  You may be able to do this simply by having a pet green to the mob, which means any pet class could theoretically do this, including shaman.  A Necro/SK beats it all easily though, because if you mess up and bring all 3 they can simply FD and clear agro to try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't require FD, as mages can and do use this technique all the time.  The keys are these:<br />
<br />
1) the pet must be green to the mob that is pulled<br />
2) the pet must not die within assist range of the other mobs<br />
<br />
It is ok for the pet to die, but only after it has pulled the mob far enough away from the other mobs to prevent them from assisting.  When the pet dies, the other mobs will assist based on the master's level.</div></div><hr />
