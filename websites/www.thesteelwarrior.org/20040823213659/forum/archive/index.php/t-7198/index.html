<br />
  I have been gone from everquest for about a year now and i was thinking about coming back to play a little bit... But i was wondering if my characters would still be around.  I know everquest says after 3 months of cancelation they are removed, but a couple friends of mine are trying to tell me that they will still be around cuz they &quot;know people&quot; who've done it before... So i'm wondering if there is any chance i might still be able to play them, or if infact they are gone for good (which i think they will be), just looking for a small hope lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>toesniffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the link, got a reply today saying that they guarantee your character will be there for 3 months after that time they may or may not still be there, but most characters will be, they just don't guarantee it... so looks like i might be back in business! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, acutally I did it a while ago on one of my friends accounts. I reactivated his mage that he didn't play for the longest time...about 5 months. Got everything back and yah, it was all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I stopped playing before pop came out. I restarted my account shortly after the release of god. All my characters and all their gear was there. I just had to reset all my hot bouttons because for some reason they were all gone. (Too bad, I had some nice messages too lol.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jlkusaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My brother quit playing when kunark came out and just started playing again 2 months ago and all his old characters were still there so I imagin yours will be too. Im sure the 3 months is just a cya thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So far, they never deleted any characters on any canceled account, so you should be all fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>toesniffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">aye well every once and a while i've been stopping by these boards, but i'm going to feel like an ebayer, theres so much new stuff since i last played my war (almost 2 years)  But i couldn't find an everquest card anymore in this city, so i'm not playing yet, hopefully i'll figure something out by next weekend...i'll let ya know if i do start playing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bludnutt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With the number of people cancelling their accounts, I seriously doubt they will wipe any person's toons on purpose, regardless of the time.  They want to get them hooked on the crack again.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You guys wanting to reactive old accounts should be wary though. I personally know that they do purge accounts. I had a friend leave the game and his account went unused for about 4-5 months until I took it up and reactivated. All his characters were gone on our server (vazelle, never can spell it right) he had a high lvl cleric, druid and war on that account too, so I was really disappointed.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it really goes on a per server basis, whether they purge accounts or not. If that is the case, don't be looking to reclaim characters on my server that were closed as far back as August 03, that when my friend cancelled his account. I tried reopening in December-ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My first character stayed around 2 years on my unactive account. If that tells you anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">for me its simple if all my characters are gone there is no way I'd ever sign up for EQ. On other hand after puting 160+ played on my war and god know how long on my other 15 characters... I still get urges to come back to EQ.</div></div><hr />
