Does this mean they check against your lowest resist... or does it mean that they shift resist checks each cast?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From Allakhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/spellhelp.html):<br />
Resist: <br />
This value specifies which player resist value which is checked for detrimental spells. The number in brackets is the Resist Adjustment value, which modifies the resist check of the target. For example a spell with Fire (-300) will be resisted by the target as if their fire resist was 300 points lower than the value you see on your player screen. Two special resist types exist as well, Chromatic which checks against the targets LOWEST resist and Prismatic which checks against the targets AVERAGE resist.</div></div><hr />

Talk about annoying. I've noticed a resist message a few times. Thing is though, it only happens when Ive already gotten hit by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing here. I have only seen a resist message once I have already been hit. Though I dont resist often anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I resist it a reasonable amount with 231 being my minimum resist.  It is chromatic -150, so equivalent of 81 resist.<br />
<br />
Chaos Claw can definitely land on you even if you already have it.  It's just a coincidence you get your resists when you already have it.</div></div><hr />
