<br />
I in large part spent aa's for flurry cause I thought it would be cool to have that message:  Nales unleashes a flurry of attacks on target.  I do see that message, however! noone else but me sees it, like we do see it on a NPC that flurries.<br />
<br />
Question, is rampage the same way as in only you can see the rampage message or do other people see your message:  So and so goes on a rampage ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, no message that I've seen...unless you happen to have a proc'ing weapon, then depending on how many mobs you're hitting you might get a few procs.  Other than that, and &quot;A_pissed_off_mob has been woken by Soandso&quot;, there's no way to tell a warrior just used Rampage . =)</div></div><hr />

We're all used to it now. Heh.<br />

Betchya you could do the same and 99.9% of the people you play with will actually think it's part of the ACTUAL AA, and never question it.<br />

Nales you read my mind. I was very dissapointed that I was the only one to see my flurries. Yes it is an ego thing but how often do we pop off with an 800+ crip or something else that actually gets us noticed. I also likle the idea of a hotbutton for it although I am sure after about 10 Flurry messages I will me asked nicely to bury the button forever.  Oh well I guess the only important thing is getting the job done.<br />
Night All</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maleron</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Morning again,<br />
My above post was my first and obviously need a hand utilizing my signature. Any help is appreciated.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nales</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already had made a hotkey lol as soon as I found out noone could see it a long time ago, but it's lame, because it's not RED.  Also, another thing was on my mind, we get flurry and rampage, sorta not worth aa's to spend on, but  why on earth could we not have gotten enrage, now that would have been a nice aa to have!@<br />
<br />
Also, I sent in feedback about the message not being sent, if you care about it send in feedback to and maybe they 'll do something bout it.  Laterz<br />

I have rampage now and almost done with Flurry so I would love to see a message attached to it like  a Disc if nothing else. I dont have to have the big red text but something would be cool.<br />
<br />
However its not what others see its what you know you are doing that matters. I see my spam of 100+ hits using 1hs weapons but someone else noticed my uber crit kick for (18) lol.</div></div><hr />

No, thanks.</div></div><hr />
