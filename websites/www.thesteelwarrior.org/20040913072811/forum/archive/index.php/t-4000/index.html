<br />
I have been checking out these Warrior boards for quite some time, I just wanted to stop by and say hello.  I have recently made a warrior alt by the name of Thorwick on the Rathe and I am planning on taking him to 65 and getting him flagged up if I can.<br />
<br />
I am enjoying the warrior class so far, have big plans for this toon, and appreciate all the helpful advice that can be found on this site.<br />
<br />
Hopefully before long my halfling M1-A1 Abrams will be tanking in elementals :)<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been having fun with EverQuest for as long as I have played the game.  Its funny because with my rogue, I found myself looking for oppurtunites to tank as often as I could.  Its easy to become all brave when the hp buffs are on :)  I knew at that point it was time to start a warrior that I could really tank with.<br />
<br />
I still grind out AA's and do my raiding with the Rogue (my rogue is a blast), but the warrior is going to get a lot of attention here as time goes on.   Eventually I hope to get the two toons on as close to even footing as I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well you made one mistake....you should've been a Gnome tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL yeah my gnome enchanter buddy says the same thing.  However, Thorwick and Myrrick are like brothers man... halflings and gnomes cannot be immediate family.  Distant cousins maybe...</div></div><hr />
