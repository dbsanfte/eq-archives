I plan on getting it right after i finish ID5 :)</div></div><hr />

as for fear resistance I dont deem it worth the points. My MR is 140ish unbuffed atm and I havent thought anything that fears since kunark.</div></div><hr />

Giants in BoT seem to always Bash first../shrug..</div></div><hr />

<br />
my next 6 AA go to SE3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araushnee</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SE3 works really well for me.  I don't have parses or anything but MTing in elementals i was getting stunned pretty much the whole fight.  With SE3 I get stunned maybe once or twice.  It's nice seeing the &quot;you avoid a stunning blow&quot; message spam :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakaris</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea SE3 owns.. I hardly get stunned now! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just about any mobs 60+ can stun with both kick and bash anyway.  The best thing about SE is that you have a high chance not to get stunned on the mob's first bash/kick, and if it's an uber, you can guaranteed that if you're stunned on the first hit then a cleric is going to die.  Stalwart Endurance is one of the best AAs to get for the MT warrior.<br />
<br />
Fear Resistance, on the other hand... well, some stuf in Time supposedly fears, but other than that there's virtually nothing between Kunark and PoTime that fears.  Well, Rydda Dar and Aerin Dar, but those two can be dealt with by having good resists instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I originaly got SE3 to be able to get the hell out of Dodge when things went bad without getting stunned every 10 feet.<br />
<br />
Not only does it keep you alive on the fly, but I also noticed substancial aggro gain.<br />
<br />
Im glad Aandien pressured me into getting it.<br />
Thought it was a toy AA at first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear resistance is necessary for tier 5 in Plane of Time. You cannot effectively tank without it.<br />
<br />
All other fears are too easily resisted with decent resists to bother getting the AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have fear resistance 3 and warcry 2.<br />
<br />
I have 198 MR without elementals gear, and find it useful occasionally. (I found warcry 2 useful for the people in my group on aerin dar as they were immune to fear. Had a bunch of rogues able to go crazy for 20 seconds without the fear).<br />
<br />
SE I have found to be very very useful. You certainly get a lot of spam about avoiding stuns with it, so I find it works pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenguran</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did 2 parses on SE3 when I first got it and they both came out to 75% stun avoidance. I think it's great for 3 reasons.<br />
<br />
1) fist attack round from a mob almost always stunned me before I had it. So it made agro hardest on the most critical part of the fight, the beginning where the mob is being debuffed.<br />
<br />
2) pulling in XP groups, or on the rare warriors pulls on raids. it works from any angle so my chances of getting shit back to camp with some HPs left went up a ton.<br />
<br />
3) it *seems* to me that you don't dodge,parry,riposte when stunned. I haven't parsed this, but I was watching my hits window on some mobs with spell based stuns one day recently and I didn't see any of those messages (blah blah but you Dodge!, etc) while I was stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kriegartorv</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fear resistance is hoss cuz of the emote...<br />
<br />
-kriegar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course agro is going to be a bit better getting SE3...you're not getting stunned much, so you're actually fighting during that time.  Seems that way to me at least =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course SE gets you more aggro, since you can't get aggro while stunned and SE reduces the chance of that happening.  It is most noticeable when you avoid a stun right as a mob comes in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You won't need FR3 until you get to phase 5 PoTime (Inny). FR1 and FR2 seems basically useless, but I noticed a decent increase on FR3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dral</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just posting to be sure that I'm not missing anything.. could someone clarify this for me please?<br />
<br />
I'm an Ogre, and haven't bought SE at all (because of the racial frontal stun immunity)<br />
<br />
Is there any other benefit to it that I am missing?<br />
<br />
When you avoid a stunning blow, does the damage still land (just not the stun?)<br />
<br />
I just want to be sure that I'm not missing out on an AA that could be useful (because it seems at this point to be useless to the Ogre warrior)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage still does land, you just don't get stunned.  Admittedly it's not that great for ogres, unless you are not facing the mob (SE affects stuns from all directions, whereas ogre immunity is only frontal).</div></div><hr />
