<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, has been a while since i've asked for advice on gear, and I still feel that I'm better equipped than the average warrior my level, except for one slot- In one ear I have earring of solstice, which is great, but my other ear is 6ac 3agi 10hp, and I'm looking for something that will give me more hp, and also has a few ac on it. I have almost no cash to spend, so if anyone knows of a cheap or easily obtained ear that will help me out, please post. I can usually gather up a group or so of lev 65 friends to help out, but I can't see myself needing a raid force for an earring, so keep your suggestions viable please. :) <br />
<br />
Also, if anyone sees any other easily upgradable stuff in my magelo, that would be great too. (I do plan on getting a second BoB and a thurg helm as soon as i can)<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mosquito Leg Earring from CT is a great upgrade, doable at your lvl with a good group of friends. CT sewers is easy enough to get to with Invis if you don't want to fight there. Check it out.<br />
<br />
Your gear is very respectable, much better than I had at lvl 55. You may want to look into Fierce Heraldic in some of the lower HP slots. Also, easy to get in a Champion's Helm from Kael. 5 raw AC upgrade, plus STA on it as well. Veksar camping w/ friends can net you a nice Soulscream Belt (spelling?) . <br />
<br />
Anyhow, you are still doing well. Have fun and grind some AA's when you hit 60 or wait for 65 if you get on an XP high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't recommend anyone go to Grid in CT, that place is fuckin wretched.  It's as close to hell as I've ever been.<br />
<br />
I recommend a pearly sarnak bauble (10sta, 35hp) from chardok.  It will give you more stamina than you need right now, but it will allow you to trade some out elsewhere and still keep 205+ stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">maybe a cheap 300hp is 2 ac 35hp earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Jagged Bone Hoop from Chardok B is extremely common, though I don't know what they are selling for. Drops from the semi common named chokidais. Stats are 6ac 40hp/mana 5svf/svd. A minor upgrade, but an easy one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye Jagged Boon Hoop from Chardok B is common got 2 of them while killing those Chokidai's, I think my group was there for like 40mins and one dropped and then 10mins later another one dropped I ware one and its shown in my Magelo. So try and get a Chardok B group its nice exp and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another good one from CT is a Lizard Bone Earring which I wear 70HP and some other stats.  Bought mine so not sure how hard they are to get.  Also the named rat in PoD drops a pretty nice one I hear he can be done with 1 group if you know what your doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay responses look good guys, thanks. Since i just got my green scale from Sev yesterday, I'm probably going to head to Chardok eventually to get the ancient blade. Looks like i'll take some extra time there and grab an ear. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
