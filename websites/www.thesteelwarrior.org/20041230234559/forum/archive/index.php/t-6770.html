<br />
I currently have a 65 barb warrior with 85 AAs  LR4 - ID2...  (link below)<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=954777 <br />
<br />
Im starting to look at AAs to help DPS and was wondering if Ambidexterity AA is worth it, 9 AAs takes sometime to save up.<br />
<br />
I think im on the right track for taking damage, just would like to dish out as much as I can too :)<br />
<br />
First time to AA any character, so any advice on warrior AAs is welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kondor</div></div><hr />

<br />
So is it any good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When starting offensive AAs, i personally would go for the ones that are not limited to certain weapon sorts, first. (ambi,sinister strikes, pb,...) For pure dps, crits is pretty neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ambidex will increase your dps, but it only works on 1 handers and in general until you start getting time 1 handers, 2 handers will outdamage one handers.  So that said I would tend to agree with Buuhman that you should first get the aa skills that will help improve dps with 1h and 2h weapons.  Ferocity is a good choice, as is tactical mastery (if you are tanking) and crits / flurry is pretty good too.  <br />
<br />
On a personal not I use 2h almost exclusively and I have all my offensive aas maxed, but I still dont have ambidex :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I use 2h weapons right now, but I did some general offensive AAs for both. Ferocity, Tactical Mastery, working on Combat Fury to go the Flurry route, then prolly Raging Flurry or something like that. I also did Punishing Blade, but that was a personal choice because Im using 2h all the time now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure Ferocity is one of the best DPS improvements, esp if you don't want to rely on either dual-wield or 2h weps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a look at your magelo, specifically your AAs.<br />
<br />
Although you are looking into DPS AAs, I'd recommend you do the following first:<br />
<br />
- AE Taunt<br />
- ID 3 - 5<br />
- LR 5<br />
- Tactical Mastery 1 - 3<br />
- Ferocity 1 - 3<br />
- Punishing Blade 1 - 3 (only if you are using 2Handers most of the time)<br />
- Combat Fury 1 - 3<br />
- Flurry 1 - 3<br />
- Raging Flurry 1 - 3<br />
- Fury of the Ages 1 - 3<br />
- Ambidextrous<br />
<br />
That would be my recommendation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lvls 1 and maybe 2 of both sturdiness and WA are worth it in my opinion before offensive aa's as GoD scale poorly, grab the cheap ones first then move on to offensive.  But otherwise I'd say the above list sounds good just toss WA2/Sturdiness1/2 in there after LR5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ambidexterity is a really good DPS boost, if you dual wield.<br />
<br />
A LOT of people dual wield, due to hate procs like the droga weapons at the not-so-high-end game or Anger 3 augments at any stage of the game.<br />
<br />
Which makes Ambi even more useful an AA than before.<br />
<br />
Ferocity is a small DPS increase. I believe it was Haas who has quite a bit to say about Ferocity. Heh.<br />
<br />
Other DPS AAs a warrior should not overlook:<br />
<br />
- Sinister Strikes. Expensive. But it does its job. Again, only good if you dual wield. Again, dual wielding is quite the rage these days because FOUR hate procs are better than 2.<br />
- Tactical Mastery. This really helps warriors since, you know, you're the one standing in front of the mob the most.<br />
- Doulbe Riposte. This also really helps warriors since, again, you're the ones standing in front of the mob and able to riposte it.<br />
- Flash of Steel. See Double Riposte.<br />
- Combat Fury/Fury of the Ages/Flurry/Raging Flurry. All small DPS increases, but when you get all of them together finally, it's more noticable.<br />
<br />
So yeah, Ferocity is ok. Punishing Blade seems to still be popular, though I can never figure out why. The same way Ambi is frowned upon because it only helps dual wielders ... Punishing Blade should be frowned upon because it only helps you with a 2hander.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get AETaunt before you do anything else.  This is the best aa of all for warriors.  After that I would finish maxing your defensive aa's then worry about offensive ones.</div></div><hr />

I too feel that PB is a bigger bang for the buck than Ambidexterity, although I didn't actually compare parses before and afterward.  He left out Sinister Strikes which would probably go near the bottom of the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, I figured by the time those AAs were achieve, any direction would be ok. Be it WA or Sturdiness or Sinister Strike etc. :)</div></div><hr />

After that I would finish maxing your defensive aa's then worry about offensive ones.Do you guys still value AET this highly since the introdution of incite and proc augs? I didn't have AET when incite came out, and I have not had many problems getting or keeping agro. I decided I would finish all the defensive AA, WA2, Sturd2 before AET.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE Taunt saves lives, get it!  I don't care how much long term aggro you can build with incite and augs, some shaman trying to land criple or a wizzie over nuking or someone breaking mez too early will always happen.  AET is for times like these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right. AE Taunt is one of the few class-defining skills that we have. And rightly so.<br />
<br />
Incite &amp; proc-augs are not 100% aggro-lock. When the sh!t is beating on your caster / cleric, and Taunt fails, and they're like, 40% hp, you'd be glad (actually they would be even happier!) that you had AE Taunt.<br />
<br />
Not forgetting those times when you get adds in camp, and mez gets resisted, while you are beating on mob_01, and mob_02 is eating the enchanter, while frantic_cleric is trying to heal fragile_enchanter and keep meatshield_warrior healed. AE Taunt saves everyone.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how well you tank or how much DPS you do. Without AE Taunt, you handicap yourself by not having another avenue of gaining aggro fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh honestly I don't really see the whole &quot;dps upgrade&quot; from using 2handers.  Granted, I have ambidexterity, but I still get *at most* a 5-7 dps upgrade from switching from 14/18 179dd and 13/19 50dd to a 41/31 75dd and 100dd.  And the change in agro just doesn't make that worthwhile.  I have pretty much stopped equipping my GSo4W except in raid situations where agro isn't desireable.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the derail, but IMO Ambidex is definately worth getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ferocity is a small DPS increase. I believe it was Haas who has quite a bit to say about Ferocity. Heh.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Ferocity isn't as good as everyone says..  If you're saying that ferocity is better than Ambidex, you're mistaken, they actually are very similar in return for the exact same amount of points.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, since the game is basically unplayable now, and I refuse to put up with that shit, I'll never do a punishing blade test, but I would be very interested in seeing the results from no PB to PB3 (Hint hint, for anyone who wants to earn some wings around here), since I have the suspiscion that all the Punishing Blade touting is exaggerated greatly.<br />
<br />
From what we know, Ambidex and Ferocity are probably your best bets for DPS aa's, as long as you dual wield and as long as your offhand isn't a complete piece of crap. Some people will SAY that Punishing Blade is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I haven't seen anyone prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy crap, there were more posts in this thread that I didn't see for some reason.  Here we go.<br />
<br />
Wandor --- Yes, absolutely, yes, yes yes yes yes.  Incite isn't a guarantee by any means, and neither is the taunt button.  Having a guarantee once every 15 minutes is indispensable.  In fact, I'd imagine that most warriors who've had AE taunt since Luclin wouldn't know how to live without it now, and on top of that, aren't even consciously aware how useful it is, because it's leaps and bounds beyond useful.<br />
<br />
Heh honestly I don't really see the whole &quot;dps upgrade&quot; from using 2handers <br />
<br />
Ditto the above.  The 2h &quot;DPS upgrade&quot; is a myth.  SoD + Copper Hammer is on par with the windblade.  Unless for some reason one setup completely outclasses your other, they should be very competitive DPS wise, such as you having a Vanzair or some shit while still dual wielding droga weapons.  Conversely, the same could also be said if you've got a Darkblade and an EoE but still using a windblade.  It's ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps at the windblade / droga weapon level dual weild and 2h are pretty comparable.  But after that 2h pulls ahead and stays ahead until plane of time.  Common weapons to have in ssra / VT level are Bloodfrenzy / BoC/ hategiver for 1h and BBB, emp 2h GSo4W for 2h.  At this range 2h handily outdoes 1h for damage ( I have BBB and BoC / hategiver and I do 10-20 more dps with 2h than dual wield for example)<br />
<br />
At the elemental level, you can get even bigger upgrades to 2h like BoW or SEWS, but I dont really see the upgrades to 1 handers.  Perhaps you could get stuff like the agnarr 1h and jagged shard of frozen flame or such, but those dont really compare to BoW or SEWS at all in dps.<br />
<br />
Also some aas like flurry and double rip give a distinct advantage to two handers since you can only flurry with the main hand, and a riposite gives you an attack with the mainhand only.</div></div><hr />

Switching to a BoW it became 140-155.  Switching to DBOW/JOS I'm 180-200ish.  To my knowledge all offensive AAs were trained when I had BF/AHBS but I may not have finished raging flurry.  Oh, and 180-200 is with the GoD Offhand damage bonus AA so that is something different.  Guess maybe I'll go back and use BF/AHBS a bit to get a feel for how they are now just to be sure...</div></div><hr />

I'd get AE Taunt as soon as possible.  You are correct that you won't be able to take the hits as well as you can after LR5 and ID5, but you can already take those hits a lot better then the casters can. :p   Saving the casters is  really the key issue...sure, you may get beat to a pulp quickly if you have 5 mobs beating on you, but if the mobs aren't on the cleric/enchie, the group (and you) still have a chance...if the mob leaves you alone and chews up the cleric, all the AA's in the world won't help. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll leave it to your judgement on which to get first, LR/ID or AET :)<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd go AET first hehe. As posters have said, even without maxxing ID/LR, you should already be able to absorb hits better than the casters or clerics. In the event that sh!t hits the fan, the priority should be to get the cleric to a safe spot (be it camping out or even zoning) so that a CR can be effected asap should a wipe be imminent. In such a case, AET increases the chances that a cleric would be able to make it out alive, saving a lenghty CR (especially if you are at a &quot;safe&quot; spot, but deep inside a zone with repops on every end).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conflicts greatly with my data, which is around here somewhere. Fero increase was more like 3% TOTAL, well within margin of error for parsing.  <br />
<br />
Ambi was 4% or so when I parsed it mid luclin.</div></div><hr />

I would expect Punishing Blade to be extremely similar, if not identical.</div></div><hr />

The reports on it that I had seen kind of indicated that as rarely as you riposte, having a small chance of an extra hit on riposte added up to roughly zilch, but maybe I'm wrong.  I have double riposte right above warcry on my AA priority list.<br />
<br />
For the 2-hander vs. dual wield discussion, I would agree with the idea that saying 2h &gt; DW is not the right way to go about it.  You have to consider it based on the weapons that YOU have access to.<br />
<br />
I really need to do some dps parsing for posterity since the only offensive AAs I have now are CF3 and TM2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need larger data samples if you're getting a 3% margin of error.  I do 2-3 overnight parses to get sample sizes with 120-150k swings for MoE of approx 0.25%</div></div><hr />

<br />
My offhand swings pre Ambidex and Fero3 was 50%.  After ambidex it went to 59%.  After fero3 (3% per level) it went to 67%.  Okay, so it was 17% total from both, I'm 1% off.<br />

No shit sherlock.  Ferocity &gt; ambidexterity, which is contrary to what Haas states - fero effects both primary and secondary and in incremental levels, whereas ambidex you'll have to do it all in one shot.<br />

Sinister strikes.. look it up.. offhand DB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) The entire thread is about DPS.  Therefore, it can be Deduced that the return talked about above was in reference to DPS.<br />
<br />
2) Parsing off-hand swings is GREAT!  When we're talking about aggro.  We're not.  We're talking about DPS (wow, this sounds a bit like 1...why am I reiterating it?)  The (DPS) return of Ambidexterity is better than the (DPS) return of Ferocity.  Please put your aggro parsings in the thread that talks about AAs from an Aggro perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do people really think double riposte is worthwhile for increasing dps? The reports on it that I had seen kind of indicated that as rarely as you riposte, having a small chance of an extra hit on riposte added up to roughly zilch, but maybe I'm wrong. I have double riposte right above warcry on my AA priority list.<br />
<br />
It should be easy to parse since the AA description tells us what percent of the time you get a double riposte.  If you spend 36 AA to completely max it out, you will double 80% of the time.  So tank some crap mob and run a parse.  See what percentage of the time you riposte.  Multiply by 80%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, Haass, did you post most of your parses somewhere so that I may look at em? <br />
<br />
Yeah, they were posted here.  I searched back thru mine for them, but if you do a search on all posts by me, you only come up with 500 results.  I know I posted the results before last October when I started my current job, so I'm guessing they've just fallen off the pages.<br />
<br />
The jist of it is that unhasted, uhh, probably 1180 atk or so, mobs ass end, I was doing like 59ish DPS or so, and after Fero 3 I was running about 61.  Despite what some people who think they're important will tell you, that's pretty much sitting right in the realm of &quot;Statistical error&quot; and the increase you're getting from Ferocity is jack and shit.  In fact, the thread was really short, it consisted of my results, and then about 5-6 people going &quot;Yeah, that's pretty much what I expected too&quot;<br />
<br />
But some people think that because they're in an uberguild they know what's going on.  Ferocity overall is only going to increase your DPS by about 3-4%, and the whole reason I did the parses is because I've never seen anyone elses data.  3% per rank is pretty funny, since i know that's total BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you refer to my above posts, I'm stating 3% double attack percentage, not DPS % increase.  I don't use my DPS increase when posting on a *warrior* forum since my DPS gains will be different than a warrior class.  Let me quote myself since you seemed to have missed it: &quot;My offhand swings pre Ambidex and Fero3 was 50%. After ambidex it went to 59%. After fero3 (3% per level) it went to 67%. Okay, so it was 17% total from both, I'm 1% off&quot;<br />
<br />
See the word &quot;swings&quot;, that does not imply an actual dps gain.  See those numbers, those are percentages of swings, not actual dps gains.<br />
<br />
As far as the original question, I'd still go with ferocity over ambidexterity since you get the gains of fero in both primary and secondary and when using a 2hb, but then again I'm in an uberguild and think I know everything.  Debating with you is worthless since you're always right and everyone else is wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;1) The entire thread is about DPS. &quot;<br />
<br />
Since when do threads always remain on the same topic?  Threads get derailed all the time.  He read my numbers the wrong way (original post didn't state whether my numbers were a dps % or swing %) and replies in typical Haass fashion filled with insults and curses and doesn't bother to read what's being posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His fero thread - http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5237 - You never answered Mokor's question about the double attack # increase.<br />
<br />
To feed your ego  a bit, I got roughly the same % increase from ambidex and fero3. 2.8% DPS increase with ambidex and 4.2% with fero3.</div></div><hr />
