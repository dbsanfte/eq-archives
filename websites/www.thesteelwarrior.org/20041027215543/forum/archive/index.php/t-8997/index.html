<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well well.. those of us who are agnostic been complaining about cultural being sucky for agnostic. I know I have.  And after cultural there are two choices.  Ornate or LDoN.  Not all of us have time (28x30mins min = 14 hours of LDoNing) per one piece of armor to get all 7.   Welllll luckily looks like SoE was listening.  For those of you who are bazaar warriors, like myself, there is new 'Magnetic Armor'.  This armor is about ac quality of cultural or a little higher/lower on some pieces, but generally it is more hp on every item.  The magnetic BP is something like 58 ac +10str/dex/int/wis +6sta/cha and +95 end/mana and +100 HP!  100hp on a bazaar breastplate is pretty good for us non-raiding, non-guilded, no uber rich warriors. The leggings also are ac 44 and 95hp + other stats on them.  That's definitely better than pre-augged Nro pants.  And the best part is:  These are all smithed with a trivial of about 262 (GM Smiths rarely will fail) and the parts are supposedly very easy to obtain... So if you're like me and agnostic, or poor, or unguilded... check out OoW and try to pcik up some Magnetic Gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best change ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are attuneable when crafted I believe. My cleric friend got Bp and legs dropped so they seem pretty common. I also have got a bracer. We'll see if he can craft em. EQtraders has the items spelled as Magnetized but when I looked at the bracer it was spell Magentized. The final pieces are called magnetic though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Magentized? Maybe they ARE pink. /snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just FYI, it's &quot;magnetic&quot; armor... and they're not pink, they're silver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wish they were pink =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Uh ohs! UPDATE! Looks like the magnetic armor is actually UPGRADEABLE!  Magnetic core +3 lightning cores (savem from lightning mobs in MPG) +smithy hammer =.... CHARGED MAGNETIC ARMOR!<br />
<br />
Looks like it's magnetic armor but slightly upgraded.  Only seen the helm so far and it went from ac 34 +60hp to about ac 40 +90hp and other stat upgrades.... this means the BP is probably going to be +110 or +120hp on it unauged.  One hell of a BP for how easy it is.  So if I were you I'd make sure to get some or buy it for cheap (under 100k) because Fuzzee's Intuition says drop rate is gonna be uber nerfed.  This stuff is making VT and ornate look like crap (minus effects).  So hopefully a cheap market will be flooded for you if you're a bazaar warrior such as myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ac 34 +60hp  34ac 80hp. <br />
<br />
I've seen almost every piece and the most expensive was the Bp at 60k =\ ..or maybe the helm was 80k.</div></div><hr />

I just checked out this set of armor (mostly just the magnetic) and the ac is up there with ornate but where is that sta??  Those would be a nice little upgrade if there was sta on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Charged Magnetic Leggings:  Ac 52 and 135hp.  Holy christ.  Need I say more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah on this stuff I'd keep an eye on EQtraders--and, if you have info on stats, etc., for pieces of gear that are not yet in their data base, perhaps post it over there. They also have basic info on how this stuff &quot;works.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I checked out EQTraders, bought a couple pieces of the armor in the bazaar yesterday, and had the guild smith craft me a pair of the vambraces.  Total cost of 11k for vambraces that are basically ornate comparable, I was fairly pleased.  <br />
<br />
As far as the upgradeable versions I did some checking into them as well.  To upgrade them is also a smithing combine, and the items are attunable, so if you have someone else craft them for you initially you can't wear the armor until after you do the upgrade since you won't be able to hand them back to your smith.  If the smith fails on the upgrade you lose the piece of armor as well.  Overall a very nice addition, I'm very pleased with this stuff so far.</div></div><hr />
