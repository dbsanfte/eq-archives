<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day, a friend in my guild said that Taunt is even more broken than it already is. I hope I can explain this like he did...<br />
<br />
He said something like: &quot;Say you had a BoC. If you procced 2 times for an amount of 1400 hate then Taunt immediately after that, you lose all that agro you gained and you get put back to +1 over the person who is seconds highest on the hate list.&quot; -- something like that. (He said it happened on a Naggy raid or whatever he did. The MT was complaining, and they ended up wiping thinking that was the reason why.) <br />
<br />
My question.. has anyone noticed this, or has it always been this way? That was the first time I've ever heard of it, and frankly, I never really noticed it myself until a day or so later.. unless it was my mind making me believe something false.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just checking before I /bug it in-game. Sounds kinda silly to me, but, it *could* be just another bug from the patch that screwed skills and AA's up... just a guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I knew that :P I was just doing it to test it out myself.. usually it doesnt do anything to further my agro increase, nor does it lower my agro.<br />
<br />
As I said, maybe it was just my mind seeing something false and making me believe it was this problem. Could have just been bad timing with the Random_DPS_Class out agroing me. Just wondering if it's been noticed at all by anyone else /shrug</div></div><hr />

exp grind and raid is different situation.  what you said is true, however I push taunt incite as soon as i grab a mob during raid to make sure i have the snap aggro i need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It doesn't happen. I occasionally press taunt while I'm at the top of the aggro list, and it has never, ever, in my entire history as a warrior lost me aggro. If it did, every successful taunt while another melee or a dotter is doing damage would cause pingponging, which just doesn't happen. You can test this out on whatever mob you'd like, and I assure you that you'll only lose aggro if you were going to without taunting.</div></div><hr />
