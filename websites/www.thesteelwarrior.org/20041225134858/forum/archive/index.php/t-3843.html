I´m now Level 60 and i started today to put my xp into AA`s. <br />
So in what should i spend my first AA`s? Everyone seems to put them into run speed but i have Jboots and i dont really see a reason to put the points into it. Sure in a dungeon its kinda handy but with LDON many caster have now SoW that u can cast in dungeons too.<br />
I also have still very low Stamina, just 132, so i thought i put the first points into that. <br />
Any comments? Should i do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
it enables you to outrun mobs in dungeons and keep up to your comrades. Nothing else comes close in basic AAs to usefulness of this. Where you spend the other 3 AAs does not mater since the rest of them pretty close to worthless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no gimmar, get lv 62, run3, then whatever you want form there, although 65 then aa is good, not necessary for a war like it is for it's caster friends or hybrids.<br />
<br />
My own thoughts were run3, then on to resists, MR is best in my opinion but dr/pr ain't half bad due to the inherent lower values by default.  MR will help against your charms/mez's which can hurrt a raid alot or a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, if you're gonna do aa's before 65, do them at 60.  The difference in the AA rate is mind boggling.  Get run 3, seriously, nothing else comes close to bang for buck as run 3.  I don't care how useful you think it isn't, the fact is that you're wrong and you're gonna love yourself for having it.  I for one wouldn't bother doing any indoor sow crap on anyone over level 60 because there's no excuse not to have it.  Get it, save your friends the trouble of taking care of you.<br />
<br />
After that, most people do regen 3, some do stamina 3, some people have a hardon for metabolism because apparantly Halas meat pies aren't cheap enough for them, but just do 6 in general and move on.  Arch skills are worth far more than anything in general, even maxed out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After having run 3 for so long it is actually physically painful for me to play alts that dont have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly. Logged on my troll sk the other day because it's occasionally fun to just solo. Not having run3 was incredibly painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get run 3. Yes it really is that good. I stopped levelling at 51 to get it and if I had my time over again I would still do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run 3 is the single most powerful, game altering, useful, worthwhile AA available to a monk. Bar none. There is nothing in the AA suite available to a monk that is better than Run 3. Let alone as powerful per point spent.<br />
<br />
Rapid Feign 3 is great, and powerful but not even in the same ballpark.<br />
<br />
Wu's 5 is awesome kung-fu stylings, but nowhere near as powerful as run 3.<br />
<br />
Now that's just a monk.<br />
<br />
For a warrior it's still one of the most amazingly powerful AAs available in the game. And that's just across the board. Comparing it to other AAs in a cost per point type of comparison and it's just insanely overpowered.<br />
<br />
That being said, a lot of casters now have their indoor &quot;sow&quot; spells so yeah, you can get by without it.<br />
<br />
Up to you man.<br />
<br />
In regards to general AA suite, I think Run 3, Regen 3, First Aid 3 and Metabolism 3 are the most popular and the most useful.<br />
<br />
Then the resist AAs, because it frees up the strain of resist gear.<br />
<br />
BUT, both the stat boosting AAs and the resist boosting AAs lose a lot of their gusto now with LDoN. You can now get stat augments.<br />
<br />
Like stamina augs. 10 STA on ANY slot and it's not lore. Even STA challenged races can boom, boom, boom, load up on STA with LDoN, on the cheap too.<br />
<br />
Can do the same with resists now.<br />
<br />
Thus, Run 3, Regen 3, First Aid 3 and Metabolism 3 get further ahead of the other general AAs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aabidano</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone seems to put them into run speed but i have Jboots and i dont really see a reason to put the points into it. <br />
RS3 at 51 is the best AA investment you'll make IMO, it can't be dispelled and works indoors.  (I hate outdoor zones in general)<br />
<br />
I know quite a few folks (myself included) that have no intention of ever buying any indoor RS spell, and jboots don't work indoors.  Additionally, lack of buff slots is frequently an issue for me, I don't want to waste a slot on something I can have on permanently for a minor bit of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run3 first.  I think regen is useless, if I don't have a healer, I can't play.  Also, your choices could well depend on how much time you spend in LDoN.  LDoN is about DPS, and that can change your AA selections.  That being said, warriors get crap for DPS AAs, but I thought I'd throw it out there.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it over again, I'd go runx3, STAx3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaluas</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah i probably do that, run 3 and sta 3</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err....what are you talking about?  The reason warriors are starting to outshine monks is because we get ALL the offensive AA's.  What don't we get that would constitute &quot;Not crap?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feysboil</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm at 54 with 11 AAs (I spent a good time at 51 doing pure AAs waiting for my wife's druid to catch up in levels, and when I play my warrior without her, I go for AAXP so I don't outpace her again).<br />
<br />
I've got Run3 and Regen3.<br />
<br />
By the time I hit 55, I expect I'll have added another AA, giving me 6 to go into Archetype Abilities.  I plan on doing Natural Durability 1, Combat Fury 1 and Combat Stability 1.  I've toyed with the idea of going straight to ND2 with those 6 points, but I think in my case it would be better to go wide, then deep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about warrior AA's is that no ONE will make a huge impact, but we get so many different ones that overall we can add a lot of dps. Personally id grab 1 defensive then 1 offensive ... etc, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you skip our on run3, you are only cheating yourself.  I have a 65 druid as well, and there is no way I would ever waste adventure points on something as silly as indoor running speed spells that are slower than run3.  If you are ever going to be pulling in a dungeon, get run3.  If not, then you need to get into some dungeon crawls because they are just a lot more fun IMO;)<br />
<br />
After run3, the next 3 points can pretty much go where ever.  If you are a low stamina class, that is not a bad option.  Metabloism isn't a bad option if you use stat foods and drinks.  Heck the others aren't bad options either, just whatever looks good to you.<br />
<br />
Most agree once into the 2nd level of AAs, ND1-3 are big ones to get.  They just give you so many hps.  Once you have those, it is up to you if you want to continue with that level of AAs (CA1-3, and CS1-3), etc.  I personally did ND1-3, then AETaunt, then back to CA1-2 which is where I am at now.  I will get CA3, then CS1, then PE I think, then back to CS2-3.<br />
<br />
Haven't thought much past that...probably lightning reflexes, or maybe I will splurge into an offensive for a change of pace before doing LR1-5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other 3 in metabolisim. I wish I went that way now, and but no... I had to put some in regen and some in stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
First aid? /laff. You're a warrior, just don't try and solo anything that can take you from 70% to 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mieux</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go Run3.<br />
Later on, when you're ready to do more AA's, if you use stat food (and you should) go for Metab 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zilden</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally was in the same spot as you having low sta. Run3 reg3 are the most common way to go and it is very good. Personally I ded reg3, run2, sta1 and wouldnt change it for anything. I have no prob keeping up in dungens with ppl, needed the sta, And the extra regen is very nice and noticable.</div></div><hr />
