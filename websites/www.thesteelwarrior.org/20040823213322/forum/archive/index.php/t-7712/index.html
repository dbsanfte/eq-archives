<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're proposing to start an ez-board called The Balancing Chamber (http://p214.ezboard.com/bthebalancingchamber) . Please let me know what you think about the idea. Here is my rough concept for it: <br />
<br />
There are plenty of boards out there for each class separately. The Balancing Chamber is a class balance board. No ONE class is more important here than any other class. If you think so, then this is not the board for you. <br />
<br />
If you get your kicks flaming people that disagree with you in a civil manner, yet again, this is not the board for you. Incidentally, if you do flame and keep doing it, you'll likely just be precluded from coming back. <br />
<br />
I will be looking at the class community sites and will try to pick a few representatives from each board to approach for moderators. <br />
<br />
The goal is to get enough ideas that can be approved by enough of the class-wide player-base across the board that SOE will not need to worry about class balance. This would get done in what I call versions or stages. Each of these would have a clearly defined schedule of suggestion, rebuttal, suggestion, modification, final rebuttal, cutting out the losing suggestions and writing the final joint proposal. Then we would do the next round. <br />
<br />
The process will likely be long and sometimes painstaking, but I feel like if we came up with joint class proposals that had a decent amount of thought put into class balance, and if we could get someone like Brenlo to read the final reports, it might just yield something. Hope to see you all here. And thanks for checking it out.<br />
