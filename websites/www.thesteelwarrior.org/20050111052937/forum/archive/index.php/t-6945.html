 Have been reading thru this forum for a couple of days and really cant find the info I am looking for. I am a Troll war and I'm looking for a decent EXP spot for me to grind out some levels. I have tried DSP and I get close to 1% a kill, im not sure if this is good or not ( I have only been playing now for a month). Any help in this matter is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romtom</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When is this hot spot method going to be live<br />
<br />
Hot Spots are supposed to be live already, but I haven't noticed any difference at all in the LoY zones, all of which are listed as hot spots. I am duoing with my 56 shaman and the xp bonus could be heavily dependent on fuller groups, and that is why I am not seeing any real change.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to answer the original post, go to the beach in Gunthak on the undead side (left). If you have a bot to PL you, or can bring a healer partner, the xp is awesome. The normal mobs will give about 2% per kill until you get into high 30's when it settles down to about 1% per kill. The beauty of the undead side is guaranteed single pulls and mobs that die fast and don't run. The coin and item loot is good to make a fair bit of cash as well.<br />
<br />
There is also some sort of event that occurs on the beach where slightly higher level mobs spawn which give an insane amount of xp. Solo with my shaman PLing me I was getting 4-7% per kill on these special spawn mobs.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 41, if you have a slower that you can bring along, go kill the fire elementals just inside Nadox at the lava river entrance. They give crazy xp (4-5% per kill) until level 47 or so. After that they are good for 2-3% per kill until level 51 when they aren't worth it any more. They hit hard and fast so a slower is a must if you plan on going here.<br />
<br />
There are 7 elementals, but 4 are under the lava in the river. Two before the bridge and two after. I always did the 3 at zone in and two from the river, then I would zone into Gunthak and kill the guards at the nadox zone line. That would give me time to heal and refresh buffs before the elementals started spawning again. You will need good swimming skills and fire resists for the lava pulls to minimize burn damage.<br />
<br />
Also, there is a named that spawns off of random corpses and he is a real pain if you're not ready for him. He can yield 5-8% xp when killed depending on your level.<br />
<br />
Like I said, at level 51 they aren't worth the trouble any more, mainly because of their long respawn timer (21 minutes +/- a couple). At 51 you should have no trouble with them if you have a slower, but will spend a lot of time waiting for respawn and getting 1% xp per kill. It's best to then move to the boats in Dulak's Harbor.<br />
<br />
I like Dandolak's Run. The captain drops a crappy 1hs axe with a low anger proc (Pique) and is a fairly rare spawn, but the pulls are easy singles and the loot is really good for pp. I averaged 3-4k pp in gems, coin, and items during a good 4 hour session filling all my bags and my shaman's. Sometimes even better if the gem drop rates were high. The mobs on Dando drop peridots, star rubies, sapphires, diamonds, and blue diamonds. The xp is solid, but not the greatest now that I am grouping with my shaman bot. I went there because a boat camp is quiet, train free, and steady. Plus the loot is really nice if you need to gather up some plat in a hurry.<br />
<br />
I know this is a bit of a run-on, but I just went through this exact cycle so I know it works. I am 54 now and the boats aren't doing the trick any more. I have moved to Nadox and it isn't too bad, though I would like to find a similar spot that isn't so far out of the way.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that I have had a 56 shaman with me the whole way, so my experience will be far different than yours if you do not have such a friend to bring along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-02-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having had my twinks in Gunthak for the past 6 weeks, I can say that yes, Gunthak's XP modifier jumped by a lot.  I figure each kill is giving about 50% more xp than before.  I think the same is probably true of all the LoY zones.<br />
<br />
I also took my twinks through TOFS and Paw to see the new XP modifiers.  I had done Paw recently before the patch, and XP is definitely better now, but Paw always had a pretty good XP modifier, so I don't think it changed a lot.  TOFS definitely has an outstanding XP modifier now - but most of the mobs have a ton of hit points for their level, in many cases double of what you'd see in other zones including Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Long story short, my twinks are going to live on Broken Skull Rock from now on.</div></div><hr />
