If you think something you're about to post might violate one of them - don't post it.<br />
<br />
The main goal of this forum is to allow people to post their whining about anything they would like. Your day at work, the paladin you were grouped with, the guild that trained your raid - whatever. However, the moderators and I WILL NOT allow this forum to be turned into a hellhole of profanity and personal attacks. If that happens, it will be shut down just as quickly as it was put up.<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 No profanity in the subject lines. If you feel the need to have it inside your posts, that is fine. However - if moderators have to constantly edit your posts because they have no value whatsoever - you will lose your posting priviledges to this forum.<br />
 If something is even remotely not safe for work, put NSFW in the subject line.. Many people browse these boards from work or school. This rule will be enforced strictly. <br />
 No porn. No exceptions.<br />
 If you have a disagreement with another poster - fine. If you want to yell at them - fine. If you want to babble off mindless profanity, use the private message feature.<br />
