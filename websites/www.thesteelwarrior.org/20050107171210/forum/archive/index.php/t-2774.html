<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This topic's probably been beaten to death but here goes anyway.<br />
<br />
62 warrior here in a small guild which just took down Vindi for the first time.  I was MA and after giving myself approx. 12 seconds to build aggro before calling assist I managed to hold aggro the entire fight without a single ping pong.  Took about 4-5 min to drop him.  <br />
<br />
I used a Great Sword of the Bloodsworn 30/32 procs Acrimony 100hp/mana dot, basically identical aggro to a GSoT.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is if it would be worth duel wielding something like a BoC/CHoS over the GSotBS.  Yeah, the BoC combo would be much better aggro, but I can only imagine how much the extra riposte dmg would add up to on mobs like Vindi.<br />
<br />
The way I see it: BoC/CHoS better aggro but more riposte dmg which leads to clerics going oom sooner.  And our guild somewhat lacking in dps we really need for them to have mana for a long fight.  There's also the possibilty of dying to the extra riposte dmg which could lead to a wipe.<br />
<br />
GSotBS: Less aggro but also less riposte dmg.  Of course, there's more of a chance I'll lose aggro which could lead to a wipe as easily as dying from riposte dmg.<br />
<br />
And so I'm torn, should I go for the better aggro with BoC/CHoS or go for less riposte dmg with GSotBS?<br />
<br />
Any advice is much appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is you can not think this way.<br />
<br />
Dual wield = More agro = Shorter fight BUT more ripostes<br />
Need more heals (so lotsa clerics)<br />
<br />
2H = Less agro = Longer fights BUT less ripostes<br />
Need more heals (so lotsa clerics)<br />
<br />
Going 2H or 2x1H wont change the amount of healing needed.<br />
Specially in your case.<br />
<br />
A ripose in PoP is from 2000 to 3500 dmg.... Thats from 25% to 30% of the HP of a tank....<br />
(worse case scenario)<br />
<br />
A single ripose from a mob you tank will never be 1/4th of you HP.<br />
So they will have no real impact on how well you tank.<br />
<br />
Want my opinion ?<br />
<br />
Dual wield while on defensive to try and maximise agro generation.<br />
<br />
Once disc drops put a shield if survival is a real problem for you.<br />
(u wont find a 2H &gt;&gt; 1H+Shield) at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't have to worry about extreme riposte problems really until PoP.  I would use whatever weapons generate the most aggro when MTing for old-world mobs.  The best situation of course is when your 2h weapon aggros more than your 1h's.  :)  By the way, I don't know the proc on your weapon, but it sure doesn't seem like the proc on it would compete with a 1 second/65 stun like on GSoT.  I'm sure GSoT is alot more uber than what alot of us used to tank vindi with. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something not mentioned here yet - Vindi's aggro is highly based on proximity (as are some other boss mobs), so you may not need the best aggro weapons for him if he's properly cornered and the other melees fight at max (or near max) range. <br />
<br />
That said, I agree with the others. You don't need to worry about riposte damage so much that you should disregard a good dual wield aggro setup pre-PoP. A good aggro 2hander is nice, but most likely not a life or death matter. Just use whatever you need to keep the mob on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took Vindi down the other night for kicks with ~16.  Dropped him in a little under 4 minutes I believe.  I was parsing.  Vindi did 411dps to our MT (Fully Defensive AA'd) and in the process the main tank, who was using a BoC+GBoS combo, took about 25 repostes.<br />
<br />
That's a lot of damage considering how hard Vindi hits.<br />

What board did he post all that on while tanking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually don't worry about ripostes when tanking anything in velious or luclin.  Dual wield is definately not a problem.  One thing that I do, though, is turn off attack completely when I get low on hps and the next CH hasn't landed yet.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, he was poking fun at you Eriatha because you said &quot;repostes&quot; and not &quot;ripostes&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies all.<br />
<br />
Dragonetti, I say the proc compares to GSoT's because I tested it out against a 65 war using a GSoT.  Neither of us taunted, and basically whoever pulled the mob held aggro the entire fight.<br />
<br />
I guess part of the reason riposte dmg from duel wielding bothers me so much is that once /def is down we are essentially worse tanks than Pallies thanks to the ripostes.  It's bad enough they already hold way better aggro.  But I'll take everyones advice and when a dw combo comes along that out aggros my 2hander I'll go for it :)</div></div><hr />

You say &quot;erb&quot; and we say &quot;herb&quot;... because there's a fucking H in it!!!&quot;<br />

Eddie Izzard came to mind.  Darn my spelling.  I get it now. :D</div></div><hr />
