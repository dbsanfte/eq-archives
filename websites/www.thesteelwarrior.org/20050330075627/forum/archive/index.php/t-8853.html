<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilsofa</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had thought I understood exactly what Avoidance and Shielding do, but as I read some of the threads here, it seems that people here believe differently, and now I have found something strange in Magelo.<br />
<br />
I got a Platinum Cloak of War today, and in my magelo's AC modifier page, it lists the AC &quot;stat&quot; modifer as expected from the cloak, but then also lists an AC &quot;avoidance&quot; modifier of 10 from the cloak (this meaning magelo thinks I get 10 AC from the Avoidance +10 on the cloak).  Surely Avoidance isn't merely AC!<br />
<br />
Now the theory that I had come up with on my own was that the Time effect Avoidance modifies an internal number called Avoidance that represents a modifier on my chance to avoid a hit, with the base number being 100 for most classes; the Dodge skill would adjust this number (maybe something like a Dodge skill of 200 gives you the base 100, so it could be as simple as your base avoidance is your dodge skilll divided by 2, but I am just pulling numbers out of thin air here).  Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes would adjust this number by a percentage, while the time effect Avoidance would add its raw number to this number.  Thus, if the item has Avoidance +10, it would increase your Avoidance number by 10 percent only if you didn't have those AA and your base avoidance was 100.  If you did have those AA and high dodge, Avoidance +10 would be less than 10 percent of your current Avoidance, which would be why parsing shows Avoidance 10 to be variable numbers somewhere below 10 percent.  Example: your base Avoidance is 100, you have added 20 to this from your AA for a current avoidance of 120, so adding 10 to this for a new total of 130 would be an increase of only 8.25 percent.<br />
<br />
So, when I thought all that, was I completely off the track of how Avoidance works?</div></div><hr />

and...the only problem with 10 avoidance = 1% shielding is that is no one knows how how large of a hit you avoided because you never got hit.... its impossible to parse and call fact.</div></div><hr />

If you get hit by 34 percent of incoming attacks, and you get 10 Avoidance, which means you now get hit by 33 percent of incoming attacks, you're now taking %97.06 of the damage you were taking without it.  Was that so hard?</div></div><hr />

If you get hit half as much, that's the same as having twice as much HP whether the hits are for 1 or 6000.<br />

1% hit avoided is roughly having 2% more HPs, depending on what the mob's to-hit is (higher to hit equates to less usefulness out of avoidance).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct.  The only way for them to not be theories is to pick apart the coding of the game itself.  Where would the fun be, then?  We would all have alot more time on our hands since we would have no reason to parse anything.<br />
<br />
Hits are partially random, but randomized with a distribution of results based upon AC of the tank versus the atk of the mob as well as level comparison.  If hits were truly random, AC would be completely useless.<br />
<br />
You claim that you cannot know the effectiveness of Avoidance because you cannot know how large the hit would have been which you avoided.  Over time, everything pans out to an average, with a standard deviation based upon the sample size.  There is an entire branch of mathematics which revolves around the analysis of statistics.  I'm not bringing anything more complicated than high-school economics stock projections to this discussion.<br />
<br />
And in the end, the mean benefit is indeed as simple as basic division... however, the raid applications are more complicated, as outright dps means nothing, and flatlining damage intake for the greatest managability of risk is the most important factor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">clotVS</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is for chanters but it looks to follow the 1 avoidance = .1 percent reduction in hits theory and also breaks the 60 cap theory.  I personally have to do a parse sometimes since I'm hovering around 80ish.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to the article that this parse was originally from:<br />
http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2737&amp;highlight=avoidance<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the part that is interesting:<br />
<br />
As previously said I didn't expend extraordinary amounts of dkp for gear with avoidance mods, but since most of the gear was at near rot levels I decided to gather some and figure out why anyone would put such a low return effect on endgame gear. This parse was done with much less noise and higher maximum avoidance to better pinpoint what exactly the mod does for an enchanter. <br />
<br />
Details: <br />
- Mob was a stoneshapen gladiator; level 65 rooted mob in Forgotten Halls. As close to a real GoD mob that I'd care to parse against atm. <br />
- Attack was off, and I was facing the mob at all times. <br />
- Buffs of importance to this parse were Virtue and Shield of Maelin. <br />
- Healing was done by my cleric alt. <br />
- Agro was maintained during the entire fight using tash. <br />
- Mob wasn't slowed. <br />
- Each dataset lasted as long as my cleric had mana or I died, whichever came first. There were 3 datasets for each gear setup and each was consolidated into one. <br />
- YALP was used to gather some of the info(total damage, attacks, hits, misses, dodges), however, the times listed are obtained by starting at the first attack attempt by the mob and ending at the last attack attempt for each dataset. <br />
- I have max def skills and AAs, and I have included the magelo for gear setups below: <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------ <br />
<br />
No avoidance mods <br />
Magelo <br />
305 AGI from SoV <br />
<br />
Total time: 2802sec (died zero times) <br />
Total damage: 621829 <br />
Mob DPS: 221.9 <br />
Mob attacks: 2685 <br />
Mob Hit %: 1965 - 73.18% <br />
Mob Miss %: 672 - 25.03% <br />
Mob damage per hit: 316.54 <br />
Dodge %: 48 - 1.79% <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------ <br />
<br />
65 avoidance mods <br />
Magelo <br />
305 AGI from SoV <br />
5 raw AC higher than the other setup, the number is significantly higher because the avoidance mod affects the shown AC <br />
<br />
Total time: 3796sec (died once) <br />
Total damage: 781588 <br />
Mob DPS: 205.9 <br />
Mob attacks: 3665 <br />
Mob Hit %: 2439 - 66.55% <br />
Mob Miss %: 1156 - 31.54% <br />
Mob damage per hit: 320.45 <br />
Dodge %: 70 - 1.91% <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------ <br />
<br />
Difference <br />
- The healing for 65 avoidance was far far easier than the one with 0 avoidance. <br />
- For 65 avoidance an enchanter avoids ~6.63% fewer hits. <br />
- Dodging as well as mitigation effects, shown by Mob damage per hit, is negligible. <br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
In stark contrast to the previous parse one can easily see that the returns one receives from the potime avoidance mod is decent. The difference is easily explained by the noise from the varying AGI levels and higher mob hit % of the PoE parse as well as the stacking effect of avoidance. AGI will affect how often a mob hits you. A mob that hits 100% of the time hitting for 99% of the time is barely differentiable, whereas a mob hitting 2% of the time then hitting 1% of the time just had his dps halved. Drawing from the previous concept one can see how much better the avoidance mod works the more one gets. <br />
<br />
Again, this mod has nearly no effect at low levels because we have low defensive caps and are hit quite a lot. However, when the supply of avoidance is substantial enough to get lots of gear with the mod, then it's a worthwhile purchase.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking back at the hardest mob I have parsed (system does not react too well to parses anymore) I found a fight with Blazzax The Omnifiend, during that fight (prior to anyone getting any time+ loots) he non bash or kick hit 111 times I had misses turned off but I think it would be fair to assume that he likely swung around 200ish times total?<br />
<br />
Every 10 avoidance if the 1% general rule is right means on average 2 more misses or 12 misses total if you have maxed avoidance. While that does not give an exact picture of what is going on at the upper end I think it is kinda telling.<br />
<br />
The 12 misses total that could come mostly at the start while your furious or later in the fight after your dead remember we all know EQ is patchy lots of hits or lots of misses at once not to mention that all 12 &quot;bonus&quot; misses could come during one hit rounds when you don’t need its mitigative effect as much.<br />
<br />
At 4 hits per min or one every 15 seconds that’s an extra miss every 6 attack rounds with his 2-2.5 second attack speed. <br />
<br />
Adding up the attack rounds he hit:<br />
- Once 28 times<br />
- Twice 23 times<br />
- Three 4 times<br />
- Four 6 times<br />
<br />
The ones that would be a danger of the MT being killed would be the last 2 types (3 and 4 hits). They collectively make up 36 of 111 hits or 32%.<br />
<br />
For those attack rounds (10) you can expect to reduce hits by about 2 or 20% of the attack rounds you need it in.<br />
<br />
Defensive reduces the value of avoidance as well Blaz hits around 2k max and 500 min so max hit about 1250 in defensive.<br />
<br />
In that case 1250 less damage from a mob 2 out of 10 attack rounds you will need it most versus 525 off of the 3 hit rounds and 700 off of the 4 hit rounds and 175 off of the single hits.<br />
<br />
In GoD the mobs hit much harder a hit of 2500 defensive hit is not unreal but your also would be getting about 1k mitigated in that same attack round considering min hits are usually are around the 700-800 range. Even if hit patterns have changed in GoD I would rather have 700-1k off of the bad attack rounds rather than have a small percentage chance that there is an extra miss.</div></div><hr />

No it actualy does not. If a mob max hits for 2k and min's for 500 defensive changes it to 500-1250. With or without defensive shielding will reduce damage by the same ammount 175 per hit with maximum shielding.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and of course since avoidance negates hits less damage can be negated when in defensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats debateable, max avoidance causes an extra miss every 16 swings over those swings a warrior with maximum shielding will prevent 2800 damage (on a 500BD mob), since few if any mobs hit over 2800 with defensive one miss reduces damage by a smaller amount totaly and provides no guarntee that the reduction will come when needed, granted it could but very unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avoidance's effectiveness is only affected by a mob's to hit.  If a mob hits for 6000 and you get hit half as much, now it needs twice as many hits to kill you.  If now it hits for 3K because you used a disc, it still needs twice as many hits to kill you.<br />
<br />
A mob's damage is only relevant if you need to make a decision on avoidance versus shielding.  For example if a mob has a min hit of 3000 then it's probably a better idea to invest in some shielding so you don't instantly die on the round it didn't miss (which will happen no matter how much avoidance you have).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about shielding is that unless you're straddling the line where a mob can 1 round you without shielding but can't with shielding, shielding won't really make you less likely to die on any given round than avoidance will.  If a mob can do 15k damage to me without shielding and 14k damage with shielding then I can still be 1 rounded.  If the mob averages 8k damage per round and shielding reduces that average by 1k and avoidance reduces that average by 2k then avoidance is providing more of a chance for me not to be 1 rounded than shielding is.  Aside from some really warped encounters that I've heard people talk about in GoD where DB = 90% of the mob's damage output, AC is going to provide MUCH more mitigation than shielding will.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, shielding is relatively easy to get.  Avoidance is relatively hard to get.  Because of that I'll be snapping up as many avoidance items as I can get that don't require a big AC sacrifice and filling the rest in with shielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding directly lowers the highest possible spike of damage, as well as the average spike.  As spike damage is what kills, Shielding is king for this.  Avoidance lowers the chances, but spikes WILL still happen, in the end.<br />
<br />
I doubt it matters.  Every tank worth their weight in salt will try to get as much as they can in both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your confusing total damage prevented with mitigation of killing damage.<br />
<br />
The way I see (though it is not accurate term) is that avoidance introduces spike mitigation, great if all you care about is total damage incurded but when you have to think about total damage at any one given time then the only thing that provided a certain benefit is shielding.<br />
<br />
Since it has a randome chance to effect hits it may miss you totaly when you need it.<br />
<br />
Something to think about when your getting 0% extra misses on some bad ass OoD mob and 12% extra misses later in the day tanking for some cleric alts clicker in chardok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From this thread I would say 10 avoidance = 1 shielding = 2% hps but I know that nobody out there is going to trade 200 hps for 1 shielding.  Maybe they should though?  Would you trade a 200 hp aug for a 10 avoidance aug?  a 30 avoidance aug?  Why not if it reduces dps on you by 3% and you're only giving up 1% (or less) of your hps.<br />
<br />
AC is even tougher, I think it depends on what your AC is.  At 2600 AC the hp/ac calculation is probably different than it is at 1800 AC.</div></div><hr />

I look at what my goals are for melee focus effects and which slots I need to be particular about to get all of the effects I want (like shoulders for parry, back for dodge, etc).

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem with having a formula is that there are far more items with shielding that are also the best for that slot as opposed to items with avoidance that are best for that slot.  To get avoidance is more than just giving up a % of shielding or some HPs, you usually have to give up a sizable amount of AC as well due to itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slassh</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well what I meant really was under defensive disc Avoidance plays bigger role than shielding(even def disc do not reduce any value of shielding).<br />
<br />
Well, actually. The way I see it (and note I am not a huge fan of either defensive nor shielding) Shielding actually increases its value when in defensive while Avoidance has exactly the same percentile effect either in or out of disc.<br />
<br />
This is because Avoidance effects hit/miss and therefore the actual damage dealt is illrelevant as the ratio of hit/miss is the factor on which Avoidance' effectiveness is measured.<br />
<br />
As for Shielding...<br />
<br />
DB x (1 - shielding) + (DI / y{0,20})<br />
<br />
As Y increases the amount of overal damage is reduced, yet the modified DB component stays constant. Therefore if the damage being reduced by shielding is constant and the overall dmage is reduced then the effectiveness of shielding is now greater!<br />
<br />
Now when discussing which is better or whats the ideal ratio of shielding and avoidance.... To believe that this is even a valid question only displays an acute inabilty to understand how damage is mitigated and avoided.<br />
<br />
For a tank with High AC, he will gain relatively more gain from shielding as one with low AC due to the above formula, remembering that Y is a factor of both AC and discs.<br />
<br />
This does not say that Shielding is &gt; avoidance. I am just trying to illistrate how factors can make other people's parses inconclusive for your own situation. I am not even going to bother droning on about how a specific mobs can cause discrepansies in comparative parses.<br />
<br />
AC, Resists, HPs, effects, Shielding, Avoidance etc. Balance is the key to a good tank IMO. AC freak? I am 2586AC buffles and without tribute (nor any poofy shields) with some easy ac upgrades coming, and 45 Avoidance. The irony is that I am missing a lot of shielding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way you view DI is not really important as long as you understand the {0,20}. The fact its now commonly believed that DI is 1/20th of its full potential instead of its full which can be mitigated is entirely arbitary.<br />
<br />
it makes more sense in my mind to consider DI as its potential and we mitigate it down.</div></div><hr />

Avoidance lowers the chances, but spikes WILL still happen, in the end.What, spike damage is the most common way a tank will die, but its from Flurrys and a good run of hits. The best way to decrease the chance of this from happening is Avoidance, not shielding. The effects of Avoidance are not as visible as Shielding, which is easy to see the pay offs.<br />
<br />
The belief of being saved by shielding via the reduction of spikes is a far fetched fantasy, as the spikes normally entail a good run of large DI. The overall effect shielding will have on a round of max hits is of course dependant on the MoB, but will be minimall, since it has been explained previously how shielding is most effective when DI is at its lowest (and whch is clearly not your normal expectations of spike damage).<br />
<br />
In retrospect, you could say that due to shielding the spikes expierenced from a specific mob would be consistantly greater..<br />
<br />
min round = (DB x (1-shielding)<br />
max round = (DB x (1-shielding) +DI<br />
<br />
Spike per hit:<br />
(max-min)/min<br />
<br />
When i die, its is generally not because I am missing the measly shielding that reduces each blow by a poof-teenth (no substitute for AC), but I fail to avoid enough blows. And this is where Avoidance has the best chance of saving your life.<br />
<br />
You can argue this all day, and as i said early, or maybe not.. Its not so much that you believe one way or another, its just vital that you understand the importance of all factors and try not to get the 1,000 yard stare fro HPs and Shielding.<br />
<br />
As for Avoidance being harder to get and Shielding easy.... OoW seems to have rectified this greatly, which is a blessing for all those with a load of low Avoidance crappy items. You can now replace them for others without losing high Avoidance.</div></div><hr />

And saw another good misconception....<br />
Defensive reduces the value of avoidance as well <br />
<br />
<br />
same goes for shielding % ....  <br />
I saw some highly parsed post where the poster then used maths to prove how the more shielding you have, the less effective Avoidance is.<br />
<br />
There are 2 things that people are misunderstanding, or maybe deliberately misrepresenting figures to confuse others into falling into their line of thinking.<br />
<br />
Both Shielding and Avoidance work independant of each. It does not matter how much shielding you have, Avoidance will behave in the same fashion as it did without. BUT what you will find is that the greater of one you have, causing your average defensive (not disc) DPS to decrease, the overall gain to defensive DPS from the other will decrease.  This is because the percentile deviation on the DPS is constant, yet the factored total is smaller.<br />
<br />
I also wonder if anyone has pointed out that the greater the shielding you gain, the greater effect it has on average DPS (percentile). This is true due to the same principle that as shielding increases, the damage removed per blow by each % of shielding stays constant, yet the percentile of each subsequent shielding % has greater effect since the resultant DPS is smaller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example let's say a mob just always hits for 1000 50% of the time every second and call that 500 DPS.<br />
<br />
If you avoid 10% (using 10% to mean you now get hit 40% of the time) you've reduced DPS to 400 DPS, a saving of 100 DPS or 20% DPS.<br />
<br />
Now if you have 50% shielding (just so numbers are easier to calculate), you get hit for 500 50% of the time for 250 DPS.  Avoiding 10% more reduces the damage to 200 DPS, or 50 DPS saved, but it still shaves 20% DPS off.  Regardless of what a mob's hit distribution/DB/DI is like, avoiding 10% more always means you live 25% longer (assuming a mob's to hit is fixed at 50%).  <br />
<br />
Although in the second case the amount you mitigated is less, in both cases you reduced damage by 20% which translates to living 25% longer due to avoidance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I think AC is more important than anything else on her once defensive is down because of that 5K max.</div></div><hr />
