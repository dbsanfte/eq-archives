I saw it the other day and it made my jaw drop when I saw a Royal Attendent Breastplat of Sand with 500 HP's on it. It was fully augged with high end GoD augs and one from the BiC quest as well, just wondering if anyone here is considering going that route for a new BP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way this is possible is with an exploit.  They are patching in July 8th a fix for this.  The best &quot;legal&quot; ldon bp is ac87 hp400 which is tak bp + BiC final + two ldon raid hp50's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure if it contained more than one BiC augment or not, however it was a total of three different augments on the BP, i don't see how it would be a bug to do the quest 3 time and get 3 different levels of the augments however, much like people who do aid grimmel twice to get the final and second to last earrings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Couldn't you just as easily get tipt 30hp aug, for slot1, 40hp ldon aug for slot 2, 30hp aug from ferubi or tipt for slot 3? and have a 200hp bp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can assure you it's bugged. I don't know if the particular BP you are talking about is from a bug, but http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=2699#M2699 clearly shows that it most likely is. I don't know any details that aren't on that thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I saw the link floating around the other night, it does have three of the BiC augs on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shirmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After the patch which i heard was moved back a week you will only get to use the effects of one BiC aug. There are also 90hps augs dropping in KT cant remember if they had slot requirements though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After the patch which i heard was moved back a week you will only get to use the effects of one BiC aug.

<br />
They are slot 8.<br />
<br />
The only options now for ldon bp are the type 1 AC15 aug from ldon raid (Bloodstone of Enhanced Protection) and the type 1 HP50 from ldon raid (Scion's Shard of Death Chants and Bloodied Gravestone Fragment.)<br />
<br />
So your &quot;best&quot; bp would be AC84 HP350 (AC15, HP50 + BiC) or AC69 HP400 (both HP50 + BiC) at least for the chest slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kelekdrixs Sandstone of Fortitude is also Slot 8 for 100HP, not that it matters for the LDoN BP of course.  If you have a BiC augment, it would probably be best spent in an off-slot that the more restricted augments cannot fill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Seen it also. Did have 3 BiC augs on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, the LDoN adventurer stone is restricted from this kind of thing, because you can only wear one, on your charm.  Why don't they just change the augment so it only goes in one slot?  Like say, neck slot?</div></div><hr />
