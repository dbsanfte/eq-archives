<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkmoose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question, I used to group with a ranger, while on my enchanter, that used to open boxes and chests in LDoNs after the rest of us exited. I've tried that with my warrior and have had no luck. Is there a special way to do it? I've tried just hitting &quot;open&quot; a bunch of times with it targeted, received several acid baths, and then the chest disintegrated. If I hit one with my weapons, they also blow to pieces destroying anything in them. Same thing when I just tried bash. Of course the ranger no longer plays, so I can't ask her. So, I figured I'd ask here if there is a way for a warrior to open a box, not caring whether the trap goes off or not, and get what's inside.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most chests are mechanically or magically trapped.  You can usually tell which by inspecting the chest.  Depending on what kind of trap you either need someone with the LDoN spells to remove the magical traps, or characters that can pick the mechanical traps.  I think...  I have yet to see anything worthwhile out of a chest on an LDoN =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If they're cursed, I use the 3 spell lineup on my 2 boxed cleric to try to open them.  I use to that is.  Even when you use the spells and burn the component, it seems the damn things go off half the time anyway.  I don't get that.  If you have the freaking spells that you paid adventure points for and you burn the component, the chest should open perfectly.<br />
<br />
LDoN chests are a retarded implementation and my groups still leave them all alone.  They're crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know that the LDoN advertisments promised us the chance to break open a chest and take what we wanted.<br />
<br />
I have NEVER seen that work. I've used bash, kick, and attack, and like Darkmoose, I usually end up cursed, bathed in acid, breathing poison gas, or pierced by flying blades. In every case, the item (if any) inside the thing got destroyed.<br />
<br />
So, while I agree that the damned things are crap and implemented poorly, I also would love to know the answer to Darkmoose's question:<br />
<br />
Has ANYBODY ever broken open a chest without destroying its contents? (Do not tell me about spells ...)<br />
<br />
If so, how did you do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bashed a chest open once. From the inspect, there appeared to be no trap - It's ultra rare, but it happens. Once the trap, of whatever variety, is disarmed, the box can be freely broken, the trap is what destroys what ever is inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">send in the gnome. serious !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kronch Polarbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mostly all I've seen in Chests are potions and stuff... but I believe it is where I got my Bloody Ancielle Pouch (sp?)... summons Arrows... best piece of gear I've actually ever gotten in an adventure...<br />
<br />
I normally never touch the chests, but have a rogue I travel with, if its a mechanical trap, she normally disarms and /open... otherwise need int/wis caster for other trap types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">have seen +hp, +5% mana pres potions(yes they stack) the heat cold ect awareness ones, many a illusion, once a ft2(that was a holy fuvk moment), cash loot.<br />
<br />
but lately it has been crap only illusions and standard +x resist crap.<br />
<br />
any way.<br />
<br />
/inspect <br />
if it says runes or other junk let the rogues and casters mess with it.<br />
if none of that<br />
/open<br />
if opem dun work slam bash it to death.<br />
<br />
no xp for this method<br />
<br />
 if a caster or rogue or bard opens it without smashing free xp a decent chunk at that.<br />
<br />
alot of times the bard or rogue cn disarm it but not pick it in that case it's safe to bash, it was a caster chest they just happened to get lucky with. unable to pick the magic lock though.<br />
<br />
while god stuf can be had, normaly we pass thm up because the acid bath isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I opened a few on my rogue once the only problem was that only a couple in the group were able to loot them. As in, I open em, can't loot em. All I lost out on was an aug or two. Other times it was just a illusion or gem. Not worth it in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I *once* have had a box that I couldn't open (Rogue here) by my normal means that I was able to open by just bashing it.  Now, there's plenty that I can't open but I normally leave them alone.  Honestly, I just don't know what your odds are but the rewards are almost always crap anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One time in well over 100 adventures we got a chest that was not trapped.  I was able to bash it open for the contents.  Very very rare, but it does happen.  As mentioned, you are better off letting a rogue or bard open those with picklock so you get the experience which isn't half bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fix to let the other people in group is to have them camp out and log back in. It's a stupid bug. :/<br />
<br />
Have found potion and +6 aug type stuff. Oh yeah, and 5pp. Otherwise, various traps (AE poison/curse, charm [orc weapons rack in Ruj]), simply empty, hiding slave.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the orcish weapons rack charm, my group had a slave pet ... they let him tank me while i got charmed, nearly killed me too (6+ months ago though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, the Rogue fix (or Bard) is to use escape to drop all aggro.  You can then loot cheerfully.</div></div><hr />
