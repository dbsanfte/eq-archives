1. If u are like i would hit TAUNT as soon as the mob come in.Dont when u see the mob pulled use arrows to tag him on the way in.<br />
2. Have the chanter call before he slows exp.. IM tring to slow %T.<br />
after he calls it then HIT your taunt its all about the timing, this has helped me alot same way with Tash, Once yall work it out u will see  a BIG help there.<br />
3. Reverse the situation PERFER a SHAMAN over a chanter, reason MORE HPS !.<br />
I have used this threory and has worked very well for me.<br />
PS.. Id like to see an SK tank any Tier 3 boss and live with the HPS most of them have most will tell you&gt;&gt;&gt;NO THX &lt;3..<br />
and /disc defense /disc evasive I THINK NOT !! Hang in there and keep your head high.. Half the battle is over  with YOUR AN OGA!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put yourself between the mob and the rest of the group.<br />
If someone gets aggro, the mob will run through you, you use your fast reflexes to go &quot;hey! someone got aggro&quot; and Taunt.<br />
By the time you taunt, the mob will be juuust behind you and in range.<br />
You then turn around, to realise wether your taunt worked, and continue tanking..<br />
or realise that your taunt did not work and that your fellow groupmates are /oocing for a Paladin! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
And paladins can easily tank what warriors tank.<br />
A few tier3 planes actually demand paladins to tank instead of warriors.<br />
woowoo</div></div><hr />
