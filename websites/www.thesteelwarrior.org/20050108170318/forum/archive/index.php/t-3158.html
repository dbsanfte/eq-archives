<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dian</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got the 100dd ykesha and i am debating which weapon i should aug. Currently i have BoC, Agnarr 1hs, Obsidian Greatblade (procs taunting blow), CHSD and blackout (yes, i am a weapon freak). <br />
<br />
Usually when i tank i will engage with 2 1handers first then switch to 2hander. Eventually I know I will get the 125dd ykesha and most likely Anger3 to aug other weapons for other situational purposes (ideally will have added proc for 1handers and 2hander), but for the time being, i just wanna put the aug that i have now into the most effective use.<br />
<br />
I originally planned to put the aug onto Agnarr 1hs coz i really like the stat and dps so that i could pair it with BoC for agro generation. But then i realized i would rather have 2 agro procs in primary rather than separate procs from primary and secondary.<br />
<br />
my guild has been pharming Fire lotz, and i found myself tanking with 2hander a lot more than before (hail, general &quot;macho proc/riposte&quot; reparm). but the hp on Obsidian Greatblade just blows donkey nutsack, proc is more inferior. i hate to say it, but it seems like to me that sometimes it holds agro better than BoC + blackout/PoI hammer.<br />
<br />
So should i:<br />
(1) aug BoC and use BoC+CHSD<br />
(2) aug agnarr 1hs and use BoC+agnarr 1hs<br />
(3) aug Obsidian Greatblade<br />
<br />
alternatively, i am thinking to get anger3 and snap it on obsidian greatblade, but hell 1150 points seems like forever to me and i am still debating if i want 2 half-ass EB procs pretending it's a BoWar with inferior ratio or if i want half-ass EB and 1 stun to make a EB on Obsidian greatblade. <br />
<br />
thank you in advance for the advice. just some background information, i have 6800+ hp unbuffed and 230aa, patiently waiting for a BoWar but my guild has been really unlucky in getting BoWar like 1 in 15 kills or something like that. i am not the next in line, but i might be close to that (unknown due to dictation).</div></div><hr />
