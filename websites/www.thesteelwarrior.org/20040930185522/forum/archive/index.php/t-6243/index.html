<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LastLizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Special events with special mobs and special loot ... another great Idea by SOE .. in theory.<br />
<br />
Practically people like me that can play an hour or 2 a day and would need a group or more to kill those fabled mobs are screwed again, because the usual 3boxing Time equipped crowd has a &quot;line&quot; from LGuk to Freeport to loot some &quot;unique&quot; crap to rot in their bank for their zerker twink.<br />
<br />
While at the same time they still just can't put in 1 groupable stuff that drops loot of similar quality as advancement for the &quot;casual&quot; player.<br />
<br />
At first sight, i was excited about all that fabled stuff (which would be an upgrade for most people who can't wait 24/7 in a line for 3 days), but the way it turned out again .. kiss my scaled butt for stupid game design.</div></div><hr />

The fabled mobs spawn in green zones - the only reason to spend 1-2 days there is the one item they drop. <br />

EEEEEEEEEEEEP !!!!  Lol damn I'm hoping you're joking now ! :p  If not, not really a huge loss, as I was lucky enough to get most of my camps early in the mornings before the mad rush began.  The worst was 1 of the Mithril BP's, which took about 5 hours.  Damn that really sucks now, was just going to start twinking the cleric ! :D</div></div><hr />

God,<br />

I hope you are right and wrong.  Right because it would clear out a bunch of the camps.  Wrong, because I spent a shitload of times in a bunch of camps.  Most of it is a nice upgrade for my 54 paly.</div></div><hr />

I doubt any of it will replace my BoW and kizrak's ( although the FFBSS is quite the upgrade for me ) and I got my stupid Bladecatcher of the Marshall ( looks funky as all hell ) and i'll be happy.

Exe camp always seems to be pretty open, the other day I strolled by the camp killed a few PH'ers and spawned em, asked a couple of friends over, had a cleric and a ranger and took em down to 20% before cleric ran OOM and we die, run back to finish him of because he has insanely slow regen and find 2 groups finishing him off and randoming the axe off, gratz level 12 zerker gimp. After that I didn't feel much like camping it anymore, guess i'll get it later or just wait for my BoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty simple Aldarion.  If the entire group waiting doesn't have the force necessary to kill the mob, then they have no camp.  Give em a few minutes to engage and kill the mob; if they can't do it, camp is yours.  Nothing to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yep, have to agree. First in Force rule is in effect. If they do not have the force present, give them a set time (ie, 5 minutes) to get their force there. If they cannot, and you are ready to go, tell them that you are trading places with them on the list while they get their force together. No harm done, you get their spawn, they get their forces together and learn a lesson about camps while they wait for a respawn.<br />
<br />
And if they try to engage and lose, oh well). Take the spawn, kill it, then rez them if you have a cleric available and give them your spot in line.</div></div><hr />

 Having just come off an 8 hour camp list, I'm not seeing what's so wrong with 'respecting' lists, especially when each spawn had a pull team handy.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately there are several camps (Exe is one, Gebs is another) where you need the 2- and 3-Boxers because all the needed classes aren't usually there.  I played my Shammie and Druid at the Exe camp (there was also a guy boxing a Cleric) for about 3 hours after I got mine just to help out all the other Warriors and Zerkers because you'd never get a Healer at the camp.  There were no solid tanks at the Mith BP/Gebs camps either, so you had 10 Clerics and some low level Pallies standing around (I tried to explaining to them that with 9 Clerics the 55 Pally with 5k HPs buffed could tank if they did a Rotation, but apparently they would rather sit around screaming for a 65 Warrior to come help than try some tactics and get the camp done).  I also ended up playing my Shammie/Cleric combo at Frenzy for about 7 hours because there was only 1 boxed Cleric there and they couldn't keep the list moving.  My RL brother was on the list and I wanted him to get his.  He finally did at around 6AM and that's the last Fabled list I'm waiting through, lol.<br />
<br />
I plan on taking my Druid and Cleric there for Gebs and a BP this week if it's still going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
more joly elitest shit, who says that the 3 groups waiting in line are not a raid force? dumbass the reason there is a list is so everyone gets it and everyone has the help to get it, its still a fucking force if they are all helping eachother<br />
<br />
whats the problem? time gear doesnt have clicky &quot;camp steal&quot; or &quot;make you wipe&quot; effect? or is it that you have to wait in line like a &quot;commoner&quot;?<br />

someone give him his rattle... OOPS i mean sceptre back<br />

on my server the entire line helps eachother out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hey nice rant lol, same thing on my server theres been about 20-30 people on average down near the frenzy camp, it's a bunch of rag tag's kinda jumbled together in a raid, people come and go as they get there loot, some stay and help after, it's kinda cool actually having all these random people work togther to help each other &lt;and thereselves&gt; out. Though i've seen people abuse this, for some reason if a level 10 zerker comes along he's allowed in on the list and the mob gets killed, and he get's the loot when his time comes around, kinda sucks seeing a low level sit around getting nice loots when he can't even contribute virtually nothing to the fight.  And I agree, i've seen a couple people come in and think that the camp should be there's simply because they have better gear and can kill the mob with maybe 2-3 people compared to the 20-30 that have been patiently waiting in line, well to those people, they just need to get there heads out there asses and wait in line with all the &quot;commoners&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Youre not getting the problem with lists.<br />
<br />
Player 1 gets to the camp first.  He has a worthy force to attack the mob.  He does so and he gets his loot.  No harm done.<br />
<br />
The problem lies in player 2 who approaches while player 1 is waiting for the mob to pop.  Player 2 brought jack shit.  He doesnt have a friend on the server willing to help him out.  He didnt bother ammassing a raid force.  Instead, with an MTV generation sense of entitlement, he stands in line and thinks thats earning his loot.<br />
<br />
See, heres the problem with lists:  if the list didnt exist, player 2 would be shit outa luck.  He cant kill the mob himself.  So in the world of no lists, as soon as player 1 is done the camp is free.  Fair game.  So when player 3 approaches, the cmap is open for him.<br />
<br />
But the list does eist - so player 3, whos capable of killing the mob, has to wait behind player 2, who is not.  Player 2 doesnt deserve the loot.  Not because he doesnt belong to an uberguild.  Not because he doesnt have time gear.  Because he doesnt ahve enough people to kill the mob.<br />
<br />
With no lists, it would take a full group to claim the camp.<br />
<br />
With lists, any moron who can stand in line for 16 hours can claim the camp.<br />
<br />
And thats plain fucked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hello and where does the bladecatcher drop? <br />
<br />
Many zones have mobs of skellies, such as Nektulos, East Commons outside tunnel, Butcherblock, not sure where else.  The Skeletal Commanders drop decent loot, nothing spectacular but good for most level 30-50's.<br />
<br />
I too am disenchanted with what SoE did.  It seems to me you're looking at minimum 8 hours to get one of those camps, probably more like 12-24.  Most of us with real lives don't have a shot.  We may be able to play 3-4 hours a day every single day, but because we can't do the 12 hour stretch we're screwed.  It sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">arf arf<br />
<br />
Bladecatcher drops off the skeleton commanders that raid some of the newbie areas with their skellie army (Toxxulia, East Commonlands, Butcherblock, Steamfont, Feerott that I remember atm) every game night.  24/12, tiny proc.   G/F and I have spent a few rounds grouped with lowbies and newbies helping them get their twink - the commanders are level 40 or so, and they come with many underlings.  Fun to see the house druid coming over the rise, with a phalanx of assorted size skellies in tow.  :D<br />
<br />
I like the rotating list/raid - it's an elegant and non-egalitarian solution to camp whoring by high powered lewt phreaks.  Very communal, and completely in the spirt of an anniversary celebration.  Tho if the rotating raid doesn't comprise an engagement force (all lowbie twinks, f'rinstance), that'd be a different story.  It's not as though any group that can march up to one of the camps and take down a Fabled at their leisure can't find another spawn that drops summat as good or better.<br />
<br />
EDIT :: listed newbie areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">99% of the time I'm all for helping out the other people waiting in line.  The first time I see 5 level 10 toons waiting in line for Exe and I have to bring in my own group to kill him I'll be damned if I'm waiting for all them to get one first.  Common sense should still apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hehe, the joke is gonna be on those level 10s because as Jenarie said, all that stuff has a rec. level of 50-55ish on test now, and thank god for that because now the people in my guild will stop trying to get me to come kill that crap for their testbuff alts after raids :p.<br />
<br />
As the original poster said, the fabled stuff was a really cool idea, and even the thought of camping an FBSS again (I spent 18 hours straight at that camp once an didn't get a sash :D), the greed-fest that you have to deal with at these camps is pretty disgusting.  Haven't actually seen any &quot;lists&quot; on test, but still a lot of leeches hanging around wanting to get stuff for their alts and people you barely know showing up and expecting to get into your group etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's your take on it, my take is that the problem is that some people refuse to lift a finger to help anybody else out unless it is of some benefit to them. God forbid that a newbie 46 warrior come along and have people help him get a Ffbss, I guess you think everybody should be level 65, and if there not in a guild capable of killing a mob they have no right having people help them obtain that loot. It's a freaking Fbss with average stats, it's not a &quot;uber&quot; item. I have a shitty haste item atm, no fret i'll upgrade it soon, i don't feel like camping the Ffbss for 20 hours like so many do, gratz to those that are willing to camp that long you most likely deserve it. The fact is that the camp is doing something that I haven't seen done in a long time, and that's getting people to help each other out, and gratz SoE for figuring out a way to get people to do that for once.</div></div><hr />

I think this hits the nail on the head. These camps are a magnet for all the worst the game has to offer. Go there and expect to find every ninja looter in the game lurking around, their 3-box toons in the shadows. Not to mention the grief in /ooc you must hear and the frenzy when the things spawn. &quot;Kill it or I'm KSing&quot; Pretty disgusting stuff. Like someone said prior, good concept, but in actuality, a morass from hell. Ain't waisting 30 hours of my life for the newest fad.</div></div><hr />

Sure,  it might have put a little more on the server then they wanted, but to fix that just make the week 2 or 3 days. You can get a LOT of 29 minute spawns in 2 or 3 days. For both European and EST-PST time periods.<br />
<br />
I'm sad that my FJBoots are getting nerfed though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">For some reason all the nonsense has avoided veeshan on the frenzy camp, there has been no threats of ks'ing training etc, everyone has been willing to help each other out, very suprising beings that this server is so overpopulated and  full of trash, scam artist, greedy money grubbing bastards etc.. I guess i see how some can become bitter with these camps if that nonsense is happening on other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>cuedyen2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I see the lists in a different light then others.  The first night I went to LGuk to check out the fabled's - it was basically all 65's not answering any questions/LFG requests.  It was kind of disappointing to hear the laughing everytime a sub 60 toon entered LGuk and the yelling about Ksing etc...<br />
<br />
I went back a couple of days later and was shocked to discover open raids and lists.  Everyone was helping each other and working together to kill the fabled's.  The average level in the raid was 57.  I spent 12 hours in the frenzied camp and made a few new friends.  <br />
<br />
Sure, there were level 65 toons waiting in line who could have taken the mob with a group of friends, but, there were also lots of 65 people there who were benefitting by having gangs of lower level people help out.  I talked to some and they could not get their guild to help out - you see, it did work both ways.<br />
<br />
I will also readily admit my 54 paly would not have gotten his FFBSS without the 63-65th level tanks helping out.  I have never heard anyone mention that working together is a bad thing - I actually had a great time slaughtering undead for j/s xp for a chance at getting the belt. <br />
<br />
Bah, now I am rambling - still feeling the affects of sleep deprivation.</div></div><hr />

Youre not getting the problem with lists.<br />
<br />
Player 1 gets to the camp first.  He has a worthy force to attack the mob.  He does so and he gets his loot.  No harm done.<br />
<br />
The problem lies in player 2 who approaches while player 1 is waiting for the mob to pop.  Player 2 brought jack shit.  He doesnt have a friend on the server willing to help him out.  He didnt bother ammassing a raid force.  Instead, with an MTV generation sense of entitlement, he stands in line and thinks thats earning his loot.<br />
<br />
See, heres the problem with lists:  if the list didnt exist, player 2 would be shit outa luck.  He cant kill the mob himself.  So in the world of no lists, as soon as player 1 is done the camp is free.  Fair game.  So when player 3 approaches, the cmap is open for him.<br />
<br />
But the list does eist - so player 3, whos capable of killing the mob, has to wait behind player 2, who is not.  Player 2 doesnt deserve the loot.  Not because he doesnt belong to an uberguild.  Not because he doesnt have time gear.  Because he doesnt ahve enough people to kill the mob.<br />
<br />
With no lists, it would take a full group to claim the camp.<br />
<br />
With lists, any moron who can stand in line for 16 hours can claim the camp.<br />
<br />
And thats plain fucked up.  <br />
<br />
bullshit, someone expecting to get it in 1 hour before someone who has been there helping the people in line before them for 37 hours has MORE right by far, if your so uber there are other options that give just as good or better items.<br />
<br />
its all about being behind the commoners, and if ya went out and explored first you wouldnt have to wait in line.<br />
<br />
the way i see it as differnt people comming togeather for the common cause</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">think i need to explain how the emar list works<br />
<br />
lets say we have 3 groups, 18 peps<br />
<br />
a<br />
b<br />
c<br />
d<br />
e<br />
f<br />
<br />
g<br />
h<br />
i<br />
j<br />
k<br />
l<br />
<br />
m<br />
n<br />
o<br />
p<br />
q<br />
r<br />
<br />
and then those waiting to get into raid <br />
<br />
t, u, v<br />
<br />
&quot;a&quot; showed up first but didnt have the force, the raid formed around him(because people are helpful on emar) so the next one that drops is his, he gets his after 3 hours and leaves, so &quot;t&quot; (in the waiting to get in line) takes his spot, and they continue on like this untill everyone gets a drop in the order that they showed up in, there are more people waiting to join then there is loot, so basically the raid never runs short of people, i only feel sad for the last 2 or 3 peps that join before the servers go down that wont get theirs.<br />
<br />
but basically none of these people could get their own raid force togeather, so none of them would see a better haste item than the time people could get.<br />
<br />
so really, those that have the 60 person guilds need not worry to much, but people under that, this is basically the last haste upgrade they will get unless they add more items.<br />
<br />
btw, the entire 50 hours i spent doing this crap, we have not seen ONE KS, or ONE ninja loot, it takes the headache out of it for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">There's a reason for these lists.   Because the playerbase sees this as a limited opportunity.   If they were made permanent, then the sense of urgency would decrease dramatically.  I think the fabled mobs should stay.   They've breathed new life into the game for a lot of people, and have made semi-challenging encounters for the people who would use the gear as an upgrade.  Zones that weren't really used are now being used extensively, and casual players are having a good time.    <br />
<br />
I say keep the fabled spawns, a lot of people are having fun.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I don't know by which moral authority people feel that they have with which to deride time geared players, but I'll tell you this much... I killed the Froglok King for a Fabled Mith 2h.   I actually USE the damn thing too.   Why?  It's simple, there's a mob that I can kill with a couple people that drops something that I don't have to pay for in DKP for something that's of limited value, like a low aggro 2h weapon.   <br />
<br />
Hell if I'm gonna pay hard earned points on a fish sword, when I can save em for something that's remotely valuable, and go to a fabled camp and snag a little Mith Sword and still pull respectable DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">did not say you wouldnt, but a know a few peps that did the fabled item camps for the heck of having the item as a trophie to link to others.... i dont like people that do that, its assnine</div></div><hr />

 The only problem with that is that people who want to bring toons that could gain xp from the camps would lose the camps and most likely eat a death the moment that a Fabled spawned. It would be better if they could instance the dungeons as to whether you wanted Fabled or not. Once enough people have farmed the Fabled anyways, the dungeons will go right back to being underused.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'd love a fabled jboot( but with the exception of the fabled quillmane i have better then all the other stuff )but SOW is always good <br />
<br />
the only thing these fables mobs have done for me is to allow me to /cheer the guys that NEED the drops that actually got them and p*ss me rifght off because i am still looking for a levitation item with 0 charges that a warrior can use , <br />
<br />
so i got the firework staff , Nagafens cos i been playing too long 8)<br />
<br />
but the gear is nice , j boots especially so , list on CT seemed to be about 14 hours waiting , needless to say no one in my guild got them we were too busy killing stuff <br />
<br />
but GL to those that got and the patch today sticks recommended levels on stuff , i hope it doesn't effect too many twinks :P  <br />
<br />
now perhaps people will bugger off and give me another shot at finding the NORMAL quillmane so'as i can get me a LEVI cloak <br />

GL ALL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Fabled Quillmane is no more camped on veeshan then normal. Also he now drops the new cloak + old loot table chances at legs/old cloak. I guess too many people were petitioning for cloak swaps for epics and it was overly taxing their 2 GMs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">all the fabled mobs can drop an item from the normal named's loot table as well as the fabled items.  The Fabled Kobold Noble I killed had a fabled Staff of Writhing and an old-school one as well.  Sadly I looted the old one (to sell to a vendor) and let the fabled one rot hehe.</div></div><hr />

I thought Sony did a neat thing to bring strangers together but most are just twinking out alts. Oh well... EQ just isn't for the casual player.
