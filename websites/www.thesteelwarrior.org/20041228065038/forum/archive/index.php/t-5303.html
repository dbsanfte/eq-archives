<br />
what it does is, provided your right next to the person your shielding, to transfer the damage done to that person to yourself. if im not mistaken i think the formula is that they take 50% of the damage but in transferring it to you you take a bit more than what they take. <br />
<br />
what some warriors do is to hotkey it. and when you start a group you put the persons name in, so you dont have to target them. e.g <br />
call the hotkey Slower<br />
/shield (insert name of shaman ench etc...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess that's what happens when you take over a year vacation from the game. I will make that hotkey as soon as I log in.</div></div><hr />

You got some 00's to admit that you were lvl 65 and dind't know something about this game.   I wish more people could be like you......   <br />

*cheers for Payne*<br />

P.S.   I don't feel so n00bish now :P</div></div><hr />

I'm not aware of it being documented anywhere else officially in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's nice for people who never read that patch/who are new to the game :P<br />
<br />
I don't feel as bad now for not knowing about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its an ok thing.  There have been some folks that absolutely swear by it and other that think its a piece of crud and a sop to us.  Tknee don't get too wound up over it.  If you are lucky and find it works for you, great.  One of our guild warriors uses it alot when he is boxing his druid, other than that it does not get much use.  Personally, i've not had much luck with it as usually the person i'm trying to /shield moves out of range.  <br />
<br />
Best thing to do Tknee is search through the boards here and see the discussions on it and see if there are techniques you can take from the threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many threads on /shield do we need? /boggle<br />
<br />
Personally I like to use it when taunt fails and the mob is bashing on someone more fragile than I. My hotkey is as such:<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 4<br />
/shield<br />
It assists the mob I was just trying to taunt, waits a short moment for the target to change, and /shields. I don't have to change it everytime I join a different group. You can also just type '/sh Bob' real quick. The first few letters of someone's name is sufficient as long as it's unique to the targets around you. <br />
<br />
I like to think /shield is handy sometimes, maybe it's saved lives, maybe not, but I use it pretty often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a /shield user.  One of the things it has served me well with is that the folx used to grouping with me are now willing to stay near, when I need to re-capture aggro.  Which happens much less often these days, since Incite - I've popped shield a few times just to feel useful when somebody else was tanking. :D<br />
<br />
There are plenty of threads about it around; here's one of them: /shield? More like /HERO! (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2481)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's situational at best.  Mainly because the range on is seems to be about half a micron.   (and alot of times people in robes tend to run around like their heads are on fire and their asses are catching if they get aggro) I did manage to save the MT with it in the BoT group I was in the other day.  The Cheal was gonna be late, so I shielded him.  He appreciated not having to wait to be rezzed and rebuffed. :)<br />
Another good use for it is if another plate class tank steals aggro alot when you're MT just keep /shield ing him until he gets the message and stops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use /shield alot when 2 boxing wuth my shaman. I have also found it usefull in LDoN when not the MT. If the MT has 2 or 3 mobs on him I will use it to take some of the damage so a CH has time to land.</div></div><hr />
