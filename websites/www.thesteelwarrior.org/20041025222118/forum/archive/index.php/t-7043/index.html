Not talking about stats or dps, just pure aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pure aggro in terms of &quot;hate&quot;, that would be easy,, DB and BF<br />
<br />
but comparing hate to any outher proc that has no numerical hate value is hard to do , if not immpossible to do without some assumptions in teh methodolgy.<br />
<br />
outher aggro producing influences could hypotheticly be but not limeted to:<br />
<br />
delay/damg<br />
lvl mob and pc<br />
proximety<br />
ac/stats<br />
skill lvl/aa<br />
buffs<br />
mobs innate stats/ac/mitigation/resistance<br />
<br />
im sure there are countless outher influences and variables ivolved into the final hate calculation, all of which are derived off of a random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Due to the proc rate mods and the amount of pure hate from the procs, I would have to say that for pure agro generation you can't beat DBotW/A3+BF/A3. That's a lot of EB/Anger procs going on there. With WA5 you could expect an astounding 10.75 ppm before adding any imbue procs. That's pretty friggen amazing agro. If you add in 2 imbues, you would end up around 13.75 ppm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Imbues supposedly aren't affected by WA5, so 12.75 PPM. That's still a proc every 4.7 seconds on average!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know Minet that there is more to say on aggro than just the procs, jos has far better dps, but normal proc rate, any out there that has had both Bf and it offhand and know which would be most? Got all aas that would affect this, and 30 combat effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BF outagros JoS by quite a decent margin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Speaking theoretically.<br />
<br />
I have the Orb of the Sky out of Vex Thal that adds that 35dd+Stun imbue effect.  Since it isn't affected by WA5, it really doesn't go off that much, but there have been times where I've turned a mob to my attention on its proc.<br />
<br />
Now, say I get a Symbol of the Planemasters off Saryrn in Time a few months from now.  Will I be able to stack those imbue procs or will the Pestillance Shock effect overwrite the Call of Sky effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=3861&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
All buffs in that list dont stack with each other. You cant have two proc imbues up at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moobley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can stack any of those with Night's Dark Terror, but you will only get one imbue proc. Buff order or cast order or something determines which one is active.</div></div><hr />
