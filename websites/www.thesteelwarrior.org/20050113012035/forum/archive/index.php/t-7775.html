<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Figg</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was doing a Mistmoore lvl 55+ normal adventure.  I know uber loot doesnt drop on these, but why can't something useful drop?  This belt dropped and I cannot see why any class would want to wear it, especially a warrior.  Especially at lvl 58+.   <br />

At first when I saw it, I was like &quot;Cool.  Some more agro.&quot;  But after looking at it longer I could not see myself dropping my Soulscream for it.  Couldnt they at least have put a couple extra aug slots on this so that it has the possibility of being useful?  It is so rare that anything that drops on these adventures are of any use to me at my level.   In my opinion they should maybe make the named mobs a little more rare and bump up the quality a little.  I also think it would be nice if they changed the loots on a monthly basis.   Nothing sux more than getting all excited about having 3 named show up on the ranger track and all three of them drop the same damn drum.  I do like the LDoN vendor items.  Would like to see some more variety on weapons though.  I know I am just bitching, but sometimes I just get so frustrated with this game.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

I TANK LDoN ass. Tanking isn't all that it's cracked up to be if you have a decent slower.<br />

Jesus, I hate people who are ignorant about rangers.</div></div><hr />

but yeah, my druid had one of them belts. some dude gave it to me and said 'seeya'. i guess it was some kind of cruel joke; like handing out Velium Swiftblades on Kael Raids. Booby Prize !!</div></div><hr />

Considering where it came from... that's a good item. And tradeable.</div></div><hr />

6AC? Jeez, i can fart 10AC.</div></div><hr />

Only when they don't jolt =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i notice the belt is all/all. i agree its not a great item and its been a long time since i upgraded with anything looted by a single group encounter. but all/all items do not usually appeal to warriors anyway. unless they have haste or something. that belt would probably be equipped by a caster. a poorly equipped one actually.</div></div><hr />

Shik, I dunno about you, but my war was my first toon and warriors are not really great at farming plat, so I had to get every piece of armor I could, and I could not buy much at all, at lvl55, a 30hp 6ac belt, it's not absolutely horrible, of course there are tons of things better, maybe too many, but everything is relative to the person judging it's use, of course I wouldn't use it, cause I think my belt is better, but like I said, maybe someone with a haste cloak, has a belt that is somehow worse than this. And btw, I rather have 4 less AC and have 30 more hp  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Figg</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess its the recommended level that really got to me.  If this was a lvl 35 item that could be different.  But a recommended lvl 58 with such crappy AC and pretty useless stats for a tank just blows.  And as far as trying to sell this in the bazaar, I would feel lucky to get 100pp for it.</div></div><hr />
