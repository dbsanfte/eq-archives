<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's update time again soon, need feedback on replacing item #2, and possibly item #5 (bandolier solves this nicely) and possibly #9 due to Chaotic Strike augments.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
The current &quot;Top 10 list&quot; is:<br />
 <br />
<br />
1.      Taunt.   Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable (currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning<br />
<br />
2.  LDoN, Hate Augments, and Warriors:  There really needs to be some dropped hate generating weapon proc augments.   It's not only mobs who hate us after having spent days/weeks grinding out obsolete, unsupported expansions to &quot;complete&quot; our weapons.  Our guilds do too.   All other augment types found in LDoN are found elsewhere in OOW or even tradeskilled, even some weapon augments are dropped (Such as Taskfiend Caikip's lifetap augment).  (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
3.     Endurance Regen:   We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items.   Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit.  Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.   (currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning<br />
<br />
4.   Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines.   (currently being evaluated) -- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning<br />
There's a few issues:  <br />
<br />
A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high<br />
<br />
Update:  At the Fan Faire, during the Q and A, Rytan said that he'd be willing to look into this when discussing how the endurance system was created when he pointed out that the costs on the older discs to justify not adding endurance regen into the mix of things, but the new disciplines are significantly more costly with a lower &quot;return&quot; than the older discs, and their costs needs to be looked into.<br />
<br />
B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks.   Please consider &quot;suspending&quot; them rather than dispelling them completely. <br />
<br />
Update:  Warriors report that it's not firing as often as they would expect, particularly for the Endurance cost<br />
<br />
C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs.   If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD) effect, or a &quot;defensive&quot; hate inducing proc, or something along those lines.   As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best.  <br />
<br />
D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.<br />
<br />
Update:  Please let us know if the &quot;Cleave&quot; effect is working with Savage Onslaught.<br />
<br />
 <br />
5.   Range attack while pulling (currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning<br />
Note: The proliferation of ranged items which eliminate the use of a bow or thrown item without awkward item swapping, it is requested that the 'Throw Stone&quot; skill be unlinked from the incite line, and a longer range placed on it (100ish feet)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
6.    The following adjustimets to /shield to make it more useful.  (New)<br />
Since it already has significant limitations to it's use (duration/reuse/no disc usage) please reconsider the &quot;damage penalty&quot; aspect, to make it 50/50, or based on the warrior's mitigation, not the target's. <br />
Assist shield:  Please enable the ability to simply assist the NPC we're fighting to perform the /shield operation.  The current process is too clumsy. <br />
Give it a real hotbutton, not a text command.   <br />
 <br />
7.    Mob Summonning Issues:  Please make it so that mobs summon rather than in the exact center of their hitbox, in front of them.   Being summonned &quot;out of melee range&quot; and turning the mobs all over the place is incredibly frustrating, or better yet make mobs who have been attempted to have been taunted in the last 10 seconds stop summonning.   The concept that we're standing in the face of a mob attacking and taunting should be clear indication that we're not trying &quot;to evade&quot; the mobs.  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
8.    Melee Focus Effects:   The current level of melee foci are too limited.   There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear.   The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci.   (currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning<br />
 <br />
9.   &quot;3rd attack&quot; which performs a melee interrupt which is not subject to the weak kick miss rate, such as &quot;Crippling Strike&quot; (At-Will Crippling Blow once per 6-12 seconds or so) when using a 2 handed weapon, or 2 hand bash.  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
10.  Increase the pushback on &quot;Press the Attack&quot; and the chance to interrupt on it. (currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dharwin</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's update time again soon, need feedback on replacing item #2, and possibly item #5 (bandolier solves this nicely) and possibly #9 due to Chaotic Strike augments.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think 9 is also solved by the bandolier, allowing the use of a macro to swap in a shield, bash, and swap back to tanking weapons nearly instantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hadn't thought of that use for bandolier yet, Dharwin.  Will bash interrupt high level mobs that we'd be hunting at L70?  <br />
<br />
I agree, #5 is not an issue.  Solving it with throw stone wasn't something I wanted to see anyway.  Who wants to have to chuck a little rock at every mob that comes in anyway?  Bleh.  Having a nice quick way to swap my bow in/out is fine with me.<br />
<br />
By the way, do we need 10 things that we think are &quot;broken&quot;?  :p  Wouldn't it be bizarre if some EQ class's players actually said, &quot;we're pretty happy with our class.  We could only come up with 6 things we thought you should look at...&quot;  You'd think beastlords could at least manage it.  <br />
...<br />
nah! pffft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what about adding:<br />
 * removing Jhiru nerf.<br />
 * giving a hate component to aura of rune (as much as a standard rune) and to shocking defence (as much as a stun).<br />
 * giving us a skill that would give to the first primary proc 100% chance to fire on next swing. But it shouldn't increase our ppm, just trick the luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jearom</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not think that #2 should be replaced.  In a years time It's not only mobs who hate us after having spent days/weeks grinding out obsolete, unsupported expansions to &quot;complete&quot; our weapons will apply to DoN as well.  Crystals may be droppable but so are BoC and no one seemed to think having to purchase that was a viable solution.  Unless I am there are augs I do not know about, only yak augs drop in OOW.<br />
<br />
I think that warriors should push for trade skill +hate (or +stun) augs.  With the proliferation of weapons with procs like Planar Stun and Yak it is harder and harder for a warrior to maintain agro.  As an example most Monk and BeastLords I know use a Stave of the Eternal (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70214).  <br />
<br />
There should be some relief for the mid 50s to mid 60s warrior.  I usually group with a BL who uses one of those staves and there are times when the procs on my CHoS and SotBS are not enough to keep up.  Granted the BL's dex is maxed out and mine is not but still.  There should be some more options available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious Bash - With /Bandolier making it worthwhile to swap shield in and out, it would be nice to have FB do something significant.<br />
<br />
Agro augs - There should be more than just the 50dd/yak aug from BF.  Yeah, DoN adds more selection for augs you can buy, but I feel there should be an alternative to buying all our augs.<br />
<br />
DoN/Single group agro weap - I Feel like there has been little progress on the quality of agro weaps available without raiding. Omens and DoN added more QUANTITY to our choice of weaps, but the QUALITY is just more of the same BoC/GBoS ballpark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuddar Raddut</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">#2 needs to stay. I agree, pumping out LDoN/DoN missions to get weapon augments when there are tons of other type of augments droppable/craftable is a glaring hole in design.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with removing the others. I'd like one of the issues to be replaced be the removing of the defensive nerfs on the two GoD trials. I think it's usefulness is past now.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">has anyone thought about the effects that fixing this list would have on class balancing?<br />
<br />
yeah sure lets make it easier to hold agro BUT, think about what giving us more agro then we have realistically does<br />
<br />
Firstly   other classes will now be able to do more DPS , <br />
Secondly  healers slowers debuffers etc will be able to to work more effectively <br />
Thirdly this would make agro generation easier, apart from the above it Cheapens the balance of a raid or group , meaning that mobs will take more damage at less cost , IE nukers can open up more , mobs will die more easily <br />
<br />
<br />
this means mobs = easier kills = less challenge = ultimately newer mobs or nerf / revamps being designed to 'deal' with the problem <br />
<br />
mosat classes can , if they're stupid enough to want to , overagro warriors anyway , so why ask for abilities that will effectively ruin the challenge of the game , and lead to other classes asking for similar bonuses to their class abilities<br />
<br />
EQ made that mistake once before when they increased mitigation for all plate wearers to be similar , and that lead to warriors being rarely able to get groups because Knights were as capable in non raid situations and better at everything else, if anyone remebers the 'Warr= one trick pony' posts where the only thing a warr had to offer was Defensive and none could get groups in POP <br />
<br />
so as a cautionary measure, yes of course everyone else gets more agro , but it's up to the warriors to tell them 'if you get agro you die ' and to tell the clerics don't heal people who either deliberately steal agro ( as a Beastlord i used to know would regularly do to show how 'uber 'he was despite the fact that he had 1000 ac and 1400 hp ) becuase on a raid the healers need mana , and use it a damn sight more effectively healing Warriors then gimp manasponges who steal what they cannot handle <br />
<br />
<br />
yes , we don't lose agro WE HAVE IT STOLEN , keep that in mind , TELL the slowers not to slow the mobs on incoming, a personal hate of mine is hitting riposte disc to have the mob just go charging after the idiot that slowed it as it hove over the horizon <br />
<br />
the real key to all of this tho , agro WHATEVER , is COMMUNICATION , if the raid knows what you are going to do , IE riposte, moving mobs, turning them , or just waiting until the pretanking ranger dies, we'd be a damn sight more successful , to quote Absor , albeit now far too late <br />
<br />
&quot; classes are not out of balance &quot; at least not by much these days  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Then your aggro is doomed anyway. If Im not in a raid, I don't even use Bazu Bellow, because WA5+Any weapon with 2 procs is gonna proc soon.

<br />
/derail<br />
<br />
every post i have ever seen you make has been presumptious and elitist. i sometimes wonder if you search threads looking for someone to critisize.<br />
<br />
im glad you feel the need to brag about your agro being so solid. im happy for you really, now back to the topic we're trying to discuss..<br />
<br />
the question is not wether WA produces enough procs for agro. SK's get their huge agro spells and pallys get their stun spells. its about class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surely, im Elitist! oh my.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Surely my aggro is solid, because, I know what the hell im doing. Unless a SK or a Paladin is TRYING to steal my aggro, they won't. Even when I had a BoW, SK/Paladin with weapons x2 better than mine weren't pulling aggro, because of a few factors.<br />
<br />
1.) WA5 makes a huge difference in aggro, especially if your weapons are augmented for aggro output(Stuns or Pure Hate).<br />
<br />
2.) If Im raiding or grouping, I can get aggro pretty much instantly(If taunt works) by Taunting+Bellow. Most common misconception I see, is people thinking Bellow+Taunt is more aggro(Only case in which it is, is if warrior is pulling, and Bellows before anyone does anything to the mob.)<br />
<br />
Now, back onto subject really.<br />
<br />
Yes WA5 produces enough procs for solid aggro. Anyone who uses Dual wield(Or BoW/MSC/FoF/etc) should be able to gain almost instant aggro if they want, provided taunt doesn't fail. No, we may not have the &quot;instant&quot; aggro that sk or a paladin does, but within 30 seconds we should have decent aggro, and if you have WA5, within 1minutes should have aggro lock. I did a little test!<br />
<br />
First time I did Primals, I was using a GBoS and a BoC, both with Anger2(3pure hate, 1 stun), and only WA2. I held aggro, but it would ping a little, and I would have to taunt it back. Everyone was 65, and using Time+ Weapons, but me. 50ish person raid.<br />
<br />
Last Night was doing Primals. Fleshbiter/EoE(One with EB aug, One with a3(2 Pure hate, 2 stun), with WA5. After a minute, I ran to the store to get some bread and milk(Since I was out). I came back, and never had lost aggro.<br />
1 Shadow Knight(Queen Sword+Chaotic Strike IV aug)<br />
1 Bard ( Chaotic black Scimitar, Songblade of the Eternal.1 lifetap, 1 stun aug)<br />
1 cleric (Chain CH+quick heals)<br />
1 Enchanter (Chain Nuking+Crippling+Slowing)<br />
1 Druid (Chain Nuking+Off healing+debuffing)<br />
Me (Fleshbiter and Edge of Eternity with EB aug, and Anger3).<br />
<br />
I never lost aggro, and I was gone for around 8minutes. That means no taunts, no bellows, no AET, no cyclone blade. I kept aggro off of a Shadowknight(Who was casting taps,etc) who has 2x my DPS(With WA5+DD and Stun proc). Chanter who was slowing,crippling, and nuking, and a Druid who was spot healing, chain nuking debuffing.<br />
<br />
This goes to show, that WA5, has a great deal to do with our aggro(Because, you really can't say. Wow, your using a 34/30 and 20/20 instead of 15/20 and 14/18. Thats all DPS Aggro, even though some of it is). Clearly, WA5 is good enough, shouldn't complain about it. Remmber the days before augs and Weapons Affinity!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I answered that. It was gonna long and drug out, but, i answered it. And my First post.... the one you called me an &quot;Elitist&quot; for posting, was on topic! Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jearom</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Detheb please read #2 again.  Notice the<br />
<br />
It's not only mobs who hate us after having spent days/weeks grinding out obsolete, unsupported expansions to &quot;complete&quot; our weapons<br />
<br />
Balance that against If you have a problem grinding out 285 points in DoN, sorry for you, because, really, its not that hard. How about if I change 4 letters. If you have a problem grinding out 1150 points in LDoN, sorry for you, because, really, its not that hard.<br />
<br />
Both statements are true however one was deemed inappropriate.<br />
<br />
Lastly the anger augs in DoN are required level 70.  Believe it or not people play warriors as tanks for 69 levels prior to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really a top ten item, but just wanted to highlight something that I've noticed when trying to find means of maxing out my aggro. It seems that there are a total of about 3 or so self buffing aggro proc clickies in EQ. This I got from my thread in the bunker here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=10747&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15).<br />
<br />
The clickies are to be found in the high-end zones of the particular expansions (PoP and Luclin). What I would like to see is that we have the option to find more similar clickies, possibly without the need to be end-game geared to get it. <br />
<br />
For the sake of balance, the procs need not be anything uber like chaotic strike augs and such, just a simple debuff + 30DD would suffice. Also, it would probably be best to make sure that such clickies do NOT stack with other similar clickies. This effect can be easily implemented like the Form of X self clickies that seems to drop a lot from Potime (Screech component cannot stack with itself).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lastly the anger augs in DoN are required level 70.  Believe it or not people play warriors as tanks for 69 levels prior to that.'<br />
<br />
I had no idea! Point being is this, even if you can't get enraging blow(Because your not level sufficient), you can get Choatic Strik III for 180 iirc? which is a whopping 5 Group missions! and thats &quot;Low end&quot; groupage. Also, 1150 LDoN and 285 DoN are completly different. For one, being a level 70 if you wanted to, you could have that many points in 6 mission, 50 minutes a peice, whereas 1150 points LDoN would be atleast 11 LDoN missions, at an hour+<br />
<br />
<br />
Bakc on topic. WA5 is very sufficient for helping us with aggro. period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vilicontus, I agree with you, and think it's would be great to give to all warrior a third aggro proc since AoRune isn't aggro at all.<br />
BTW, don't worry, spell proc never stack: if you get a second spell rpoc buff that fits into another slot then only the first (in buff slot order) will actually fires, and AoR overright them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some /shield improvements would be nice. particularly with respect to makeing it easier to use on the level of getting on the player you want to shield, as indeed the current methods are a little clumbsy. I'd almost as soon it lasted longer than it damaged me less if a change in its power were contemplated.<br />
<br />
I also think the whole aggro aug issue does need a comprehensive look. Clearly the trend for warriors and their weapons is that aggro augs are a bigger and bigger part of the game. Yet the LDoN grind is not popular, to put it mildly.<br />
<br />
The combination of poor experience and low point rewards makes LDoNs pretty dead, and I think the issue is actually worse for characters who are lvl 30-60 than it is after that. The reason this is an issue is that LDoN looks like it was designed as a place to gear up in a single-group, non-raid (or pre-raiding) environment, which you would think would be of benefit to pre-60s toons, but the way the cost/rewards are structured now, there's little reason to do LDoNs at that level, and, of course, no one wants to do them, those that do do them do as few as possible, and as far as I can tell there aren't a whole lot of classes that &quot;need&quot; as many points as warriors. (Note I say &quot;cost&quot; not &quot;risk&quot; because the two big risks in LDoN are that you'll spend hours trying to get a group together to do a bunch of them, and whoever you get to go with you will really wish they'd never met you long before you get the points you need. the actual mobs are the least of your worries.)<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure that SONY is all that interested in making &quot;old&quot; expansions more attractive, however. There's a much stronger pattern of addressing unpopular paths in old expansions by making the same or better gear available in new expansions. I like the idea of making LDoNs a functional part of the game, at least at some point in a character's progression, and I like the idea of working toward upgrades in a single group. But if SONY wants to let LDoN die (that is, if they want to keep it as it is) then droppable augments need to happen elsewhere, I expect.</div></div><hr />

So with WA5 and two unaug'd weapons I should have no trouble holding agro?  <br />
<br />
I believe this is an on topic discussion.  Do warriors as a group believe that #2 has been fixed or does more work need to be done?  I believe that #5 and #9 can be taken off the list.  The bandolier solves both of those problems nicely.  But I think more work needs to be done towards #2.<br />
<br />
As for what to replace #5 and #9 with, well I think Yoda had an interesting idea with giving us a skill that would give to the first primary proc 100% chance to fire on next swing. But it shouldn't increase our ppm, just trick the luck.But balancing that would be very difficult.  I would like to see HoTT as an AA or something similar.  Sometimes you get in a group where the leader does not have that ability and they wish to remain leader for whatever reason.  But it would be so nice to still have that ability available to me when I tank.<br />

Check vs 1st Buff Proc = Fail,<br />
Check vs 2nd Buff Proc = Proc, end;<br />
<br />
<br />
So multiple buff clickies would sort of &quot;stack&quot; in that if one failed, the second could back it up.  No, you wont ever get 1 and 2 on the same swing, but as long as theres a proc, does it matter?</div></div><hr />

Not what I was getting at. If Your too lazy to get the augs, but still have enough time to get WA5. The problem is you, and not the aa. Simple as that.<br />

 I would like to see HoTT as an AA or something similar.  Sometimes you get in a group where the leader does not have that ability and they wish to remain leader for whatever reason.  But it would be so nice to still have that ability available to me when I tank.<br />

Detheb is evaluating the availability of aggro augs/AAs from a different perspective. So is Frodlin, or he wouldn't be starting from the point that #2 be struck from the old list.<br />
<br />
The point system in LDoN and, in a somewhat different fashion, the mob drops in OoW suggest that the game is not generally designed for lvl 60 warriors to have  a lot of access to aggro augs. This might move a little bit with DoN; I'm not sure. <br />
<br />
Also not sure that the problems experienced by warriors in their 50s and early 60s are going to make a top 10 list, although I wouldn't be surprised if there were a pretty high attrition rate among warriors in that range precisely because there can be some problems at those levels doing your job.<br />

You could do what I do when it's too irritating to work like a dog to do your job in an exp group: hop on an SK for an evening of easy aggro.</div></div><hr />

Detheb, my highlighting your comment about WA5 is that you were talking about WA5 with agro augs which is irrelevant to the issue of agro aug availability.  So it is not a solution.  <br />
<br />
Brabble I never have a problem with grouping.  If I am feeling ambitious I can 4-box so grouping is not a issue for me.  And if some dummy is stealing agro, I am that dummy.  :p  The downside of multiboxing is if you should happen to miss time a CH the odds of your guildies letting you live it down are pretty small.</div></div><hr />

I can understand why SoE would make these augs with a high required level, but 70 is not where I would think they need to be.  Level 67 or 68 would be sufficent if you want my opinion.  <br />

Lol, I was argueing back witrh Sarcazzam. &lt;3 the drama. Aggro augs are plentiful. If you have the time to do the work to get them. For instance, 510 LDoN points is pretty easy for a 100dd Ykesha(Although may take a bit to find people to do LDoN), etc. There are many stun/pure hate aug(7 pure hate augs... like 12-20 Stun augs) In the game at this time, many avialable for those under 70, some for under 60. It more taking the time to get them, then having no availability.</div></div><hr />

Adding augments that are actually mob dropped (the only &quot;aggro&quot; augment that is droppable is the one from Bloodfields as far as I know) and are significant aggro procs (stuns, frostbite style procs, etc) would be a good way to address this issue in a lasting way. DoN, while good in that it is not that hard to get them, is only a temporary fix. If more expansions come out, no one will want to do it even with the allure of the progression rewards. It would end up being obsoleted like LDoN was (eventually).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally, I both support and respect this point of view.<br />
The problem is, I suspect that for the 60 &amp; under warriors, there's a very large gap between the theoretical availablity of the &quot;pretty easy&quot; yak aug from LDoN and actually securing that augment. I went to magelo and checked the top 40-ish lvl 60 warriors, sorted by AC, to see what augments they had.<br />
Yak augs: 0<br />
other aggro augs: 0<br />
heated blade: 2<br />
icicle strike: 2<br />
some random hitpoint augments: 2 (both on the same guy)<br />
the magelos of three of the warriors weren't working, btw.<br />
<br />
Some of these folks have a lot of AAs, so not all of them are only 3 week-old pl twinks (though a lot of 'em are twinks, heh). It looks to me like aggro augs are effectively unavailable to warriors at this level; if on a functional level people could get them, at least somebody would have one. Yet none of those warriors do. There are, no doubt, a lot of reasons for that: Guk is one of the least popular versions of a lonely expansion; it's very likely now that to do LDoNs you go with the first 4-6 toons who show up, which means no single pullers/healers/crowd control fairly often, which means in many cases that a hard is not the most efficient option. So, at level 57 a normal win = 22 points. That's 24 guk adventures for the yak. Sure, the lvl 60 warrior gets more points, but the level 52 guy (and you'd better have started at lvl 52 if you want the aug) gets fewer.<br />
The speculative list of why people don't have a piece of gear that in theory is &quot;plentiful&quot; would be pretty long, at least in this case. But ultimately, since the percentage of warriors at this level with aggro augments approaches zero, the real question is not &quot;are these augs available&quot; but rather the questions are:<br />
1. Are these augs supposed to be part of the game at this level?<br />
2. Is the lack of an aggro augment at this point in EQ's history a difficulty for 60ish warriors?<br />
3. Are problems for 50s-low 60s warriors of sufficient severity that they ought be part of a warrior top 10 list? (subquestion: even if low-level warriors have a problem, do they as a group matter enough to the warrior community to be included on a top 10 list?)<br />
If the answer to any of these questions is no, then the question is moot as far as the second item in the old list goes. If the answer to all of the questions is yes, then the second item on the old list should not be struck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I had my first anger aug at 57. Had 2 of them by level 59. Both were anger2, but still, I had them.<br />
<br />
2. Is the lack of an aggro augment at this point in EQ's history a difficulty for 60ish warriors?<br />
<br />
Shouldn't be too much of a problem to be honest. Copper Hammer of Striking, and Sword of the Bloodsworn, should keep aggro even without augs, at a level 60ish group. Many &quot;better&quot; aggro weapon than Sword for bazaar even. Augments surely help, but where dps isn't to big at level 60ish. The stun procs should be enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Are problems for 50s-low 60s warriors of sufficient severity that they ought be part of a warrior top 10 list? (subquestion: even if low-level warriors have a problem, do they as a group matter enough to the warrior community to be included on a top 10 list?)<br />
<br />
Any &quot;real&quot; problems is caused by their lack of grouping. They could easily go to bloodfields and get the stun aug from there, etc. Its really a matter of them wanting to spend the time to do it. <br />
Should they be included in the top ten list? Not really. Alot of the frustrations i see arise from level 55-65 Twinks that feel everything should be handed to them as their gear was. Unfortunetly for those with low play time, this hurts them. Alot of people don't take many &quot;Level 55-65&quot; rants too seriously, because, they are mostly twinks wanting more stuff.</div></div><hr />

We all know that you could prolly be out getting an aa or two in the time it would take to get enough people that would actually want to do an ldon with ya.  The DoN augs are mostly level 70 only.  What are people suppose to do for augs other then these Deth.  I am just curious as to what augs you are saying these folks should get.

My 57 war has an icicle strike on his GSoT and I can tell you that while there are times when that proc goes off and I wish it were Anger III, there are far more times when it doesn't go off, and when it doesn't fire, it's every bit as useful an aggro boost as an Anger III that doesn't go off.<br />
Pre max dex and WA, augs might not be as much help as you might wish for.<br />
that said, if LDoN were more popular/revitalized (or anyplace I could MT my way to a yak/anger III augment that wouldn't be perma camped by folks looking to twink their alts), my 57 guy would be happier. What I wouldn't be interested in is hiding behind a bunch of people until they kill a level 68 mob, then looting the rotting Anger II aug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might be nice for warriors to have an ability that allowed them to grab and hold (or slow way down) a fleeing mob for a tick or two. Even if it were on a long timer and I couldn't otherwise attack the mob while the ability was engaged. Would be even nicer if I could use it on any moving mob, but that might be overpowered: a fleeing mob would be enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example being, puller has a mob inc, you dont have a bow and thus dont pluck an arrow on inc you simplu use bazu bellow and that get the mobs attention but it seems like its almost no hate, neutralized by the fact that you didnt get on the mobs aggro list before using the bellow.<br />
<br />
When people have no means to tag on inc, the mob tends to plow through the warrior and past him, chewing on the puller until the warrior gets in range and starts wacking.  Incite line can be used to intercept but like I said, it negates the initial hate on the bellow and works almost as you just shot an arrow at the mob.<br />

#3 Every mana class has endless choices for mana regen, mana regen items are so common you need zero cash, no guild, zero flags to attain a very high lvl of mana regen.<br />
<br />
We have zero items, and its only fair if they update it to (ADD) + endurance regen to (EXISTING) items.<br />
It does not help us if they give only + endurance regen augs, which we will have to loose hp/ ac augs as the only path to gain endurance regen.<br />
<br />
The endurance users: War Monk Rogue is Way unbalanced atm.<br />
We have endurange regen aa's which has helped, but mana users have aa's to raise their mana regen above the old FT cap with items, were way far behind.  It's time to finish the job and be fair about things.<br />

Thanks for taking the time to work on this and take suggestions. Here are a few I'd make to your list and adjustments as well:<br />
<br />
**Echo of anger line of augments**<br />
<br />
Currently EoA is only available in the form of high end content. Help the little guy out a bit and create 2 augs and put them in DoN. Give the lesser one a 5 point multiplier and the other a 10 point multiplier and leave EoA at the 15 point multiplier (according to EQ spell info via Magelo).<br />
<br />
You could add this in your 2nd point of the Top 10 list.<br />
<br />
**Press the Attack**<br />
<br />
The day they released the OoW AA's I bought PtA. It had a HUGE range and was GREAT for pulling. I'd PtA a mob then tag it with Incite on the way in and it worked great. Along with the other fixes to PtA you also discuss increasing the range on Incite for pulling. Instead, request they stick it here on PtA to make the AA worth buying.<br />
<br />
You could add this in your 10th point on the Top 10 list.<br />
<br />
**Revamp Shields**<br />
<br />
SoE has given us some really cool stuff with shields but so far it is hard for us to take full advantage of them. I propose 2 fixes to solve this problem and a 3rd suggestion to improve upon them.<br />
<br />
1) Allow all warrior usable shields to be equiped in the back slot.<br />
<br />
Firey Crystal Guard (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20941)  currently drops in Time and can be used as either a Back slot or Secondary. It is a great concept but should be taken to the next level for tanks or even all tank classes.<br />
<br />
Possibly consider showing the ingame graphic for tanks back sides as the shield when it is equiped as well.<br />
<br />
2) Warrior only Shields equipable in Range Slot<br />
<br />
Give us the range slot for our shields. When they are equiped in the range slot give us the FULL USE of our Shield benefits including the AA's AND skills such as Bash, /shield, and focus effects like Furious Bash. Further, when equiped in the range slot have the in game graphic show that shield along with the main hand equiped weapon.<br />
<br />
Along with this implement a few new warrior only shields in the lower and middle end of the game content to help out the little guy.<br />
<br />
3) Give Shields an extra Aug Slot<br />
<br />
Enough said about this. It would really make shields the added benefit they really should be.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Your top 10 list looks pretty solid. Those fixes would greatly benefit the Warrior class. Plz consider mine as well.<br />

I'd prefer Special Attacks that adressed some of our most glaring soloing shortcomings (some can't be addressed this way):<br />
<br />
1. Can't split pull.<br />
2. Can't reliably stun a gater or DoT it and nuke it should it threaten to gate.<br />
3. Can't reliably root or snare a mob that is running.<br />
4. Can't self-buff.<br />
5. High downtime when trying to regain lost HP's<br />
6. Difficulty escaping especially when deep in a dungeon crawl - can't root a mob and log, DA, or FD.<br />

I think the dispairity in soloing capability and groupability needs to be addressed, but carefully handled so that justified Knight superiority as raid add tanks and plow tanks and melees with useful raid utility isn't eroded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Along with this implement a few new warrior only shields in the lower and middle end of the game content to help out the little guy.<br />
<br />
3) Give Shields an extra Aug Slot<br />
<br />
Enough said about this. It would really make shields the added benefit they really should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
On top of the fact this would change the way the game has been since Pretty much day 1, its not worth it.<br />
<br />
Yes, I would love a 100ac, 350hp 6 shielding back slot. But, yeah, why would you want a backslot that is better than you BP? If yOu want a shield on your ass Get a Loyalist Shield or Fiery Crystal Guard and be happy.<br />
<br />
Shield in range slot, with full bonuses would be way over powering. WAY OVERPOWERING. Thats pretty much simple as that.<br />
<br />
Giving shields an extra augment slot would do what? Give it more ac, more hp? Thats about it. If your using a shield to tank, it should be a decent enough shield anyway, without an extra augment slot.</div></div><hr />

Nor should we be able to do all these things.

Our class is in such good shape we have a hard time coming up with 10 good issues for out top 10 list, wining that we cannot do everything just makes us look silly.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing I can rally think of I would like to add to the top 10 list, and it is very minor, is I would like warriors to get the Endless Quiver AA.  Even with it, our range damage would suck, but I would happilly pay the AA cost for the convienience(WTB, spell checker for this board, I know I spelled that wrong).</div></div><hr />

<br />
this isnt so much a warrior issue, but an ogur issue...can we have plate graphics for our pants back please?<br />
<br />
the endless quiver concept i believe encroaches too much on rangers bread and butter, but an AA the produces a summoned (1-3 dmg, 150ish range) endless supply of arrows wouldnt be out of line...we start having the ability to use 13 damage arrows w/ eq and rangers will be torqued with reason.</div></div><hr />

I wish there was a mechanism in place to help keep Plate Quest Armor components under control.  <br />
<br />
I have 2 friends still working on their Omens Tier one stuff. One is a plate wearer, other is a chain.  The droppable pieces for Tier one chain can be found at any time of day in bazaar for next to nothing (like literally a couple hundred plats).  The Plate still sells for 20-60k on CT depending on piece, making it several times as difficult to get your plate stuff as it is to get chain/silk/leather.  Its ornate molds all over again.  Partly related to how dependent on gear plate wearers in general are.  Partly dependant on drop rates of parts, etc.. <br />
<br />
Anyway, it shouldn't be 10 times as hard/expensive/time-consuming to quest one kind of armor over the others.</div></div><hr />

We'll just have to agree to disagree. Paladins could enhance their survivability with clickies - Soulfire, their Epic, Prayers of Life, etc. AND enhance it with numerous spells and disciplines - stuns, heals, LoH, etc. They hardly needed to equal or exceed Warriors in solo and single group content AND have additional utility.<br />
<br />
Like I said. We'll have to disagree. I don't think you can focus on one facet of an archetype class like tanking and grant a Dual-class parity in any environment unless you alter in turn alter how narrowly focused the archetype class is on what was intended to be their area of superiority.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry you see it as class warfare Redhenna.<br />
<br />
I saw Knights needing a 12-18 second autoparry (Paladins)/autoreposte (SK's)  discipline with a refresh perhaps even a little shorter than Defensive to handle named mobs in groups and enhance their preference to add tank/plow tank in raids. That's unfortunately not what they got.<br />
<br />
They should IMO petition to get their new discipline changed to exactly what I had suggested starting over a year ago. It scales, meets the &quot;Uh oh&quot; need, helps with group name mobs, and with a shorter refresh than Defensive could help cement an add tank/plow tank raid role preference.<br />
<br />
I see Warriors needing something like the Opening System SoE contemplated and tested for the Phase 2 Update they scrapped to enhance Wariror groupability (a question SoE found worthy of investing time and money in attempting to address) and now with the amount of soloing in DoN perhaps better yet Special Attacks.<br />
<br />
Just because you (or Paladin posters on their board) don't aggree with someone doesn't make them guilty of class warfare or either of you right. In both cases, a 12-18 second autoparry/reposte discipline for Knights and Warrior Special Attacks, I'm convinced the game would be more balanced not less.<br />
<br />
OMG LOZ, BB-Zeb suggests we should get a 12-18 second autoparry/reposte discipline 1111!11. He must be trying to preserve Wariror tanking superiority. Class Warfare, Class Warfare!!!<br />
<br />
Waving the class warfare flag when you disagree with someone is not a terribly persuasive argument.</div></div><hr />

2:  Whenever knights get something good, you panic and say warriors are screwed.  You do it here, and you do it on the EQ Live boards...that is class warfare.<br />
<br />
3:  The whole reason the opening system was scrapped was because it sucked.  Please do not even suggest we go back to a system that sucked.  Offensewise, we are in great shape, defensivewise we are in great shape.  Giving us a whole ton of utility would be overpowered.  Utility classes need a reason to exist, and if you give those utility abilities out to everyone, what are you going to give those classes to make up for it?</div></div><hr />

It might work in another game, but there are some obvious problems with all though features attaching themselves to one class in this game.<br />
To me, the glaring glitch for warriors right now is the END regen thing. the idea of a limited pool of anything is to force you to make choices about what to do, but it seems to me that the regen issue, coupled with a lack of regen buffs, produces a very narrow bottleneck. In some ways we could do worse than repeat &quot;Give us some help with END&quot; three times rather than come up with a couple things like &quot;give me a big self heal and a insta gate spell.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Shadowknights (and Paladins, and essentially any class which can either refresh their own health or not be forced to absorb melee damage) enjoy a *massive* unbridgeable advantage in the [DoN] task system which is soloable over any of the 3 classic melee classes, and in some cases berserkers too, but berserkers being the strongest soloing &quot;pure melee&quot;, it's not as bad for them.<br />
<br />
This advantage isn't a small one, pure melee (warriors, monks, and rogues) are completely and utterly pathertic in the task system.<br />
<br />
If you have better methods to help Warriors solo and enhance their groupablity please suggest them (kick stun capable of stunning any mob that can be stunned for up to 2 seconds, health returned by bandage wound AA's increased, ToD and Silken Whip effectiveness extended to cover the highest level mobs encountered soloing DoN quests??).<br />
<br />
I can manage the solo tasks asking for help where needed, but the majority of Warriors don't raid and are mediocre in the group environment and kinda suck when soloing. No one raised soloing as a serious issue until SoE made it one in DoN progression.</div></div><hr />

EQ was never meant to be like this, and warriors are in a hell of alot better shape now than they ever were before.  class balance doesn't mean all classes should be equal at everything.  warriors have ALWAYS been one of the worst classes for soloing, and now because of some lame tasks you think they should be able to solo as effectively as hybrids?

Sitting is clearly refraining from combat, and it's aim is lowering downtime, something that even the most Machivaellian opposer of warrior soloing cannot really argue against.   <br />
<br />
The risks of soloing aren't THAT bad, it's the rate of kills that really sucks donkeys.   <br />

Incidentally, Red... the opening system FAR from sucked... it was phenominal, and it's a damned shame that people who had zero experience with it chose to be opposed to it.</div></div><hr />

Rather than dwell on past differences, wouldn't be good to look for areas we can all agree on now? IF the openings system was awesome then, why wouldn't it be awesome now?<br />

Maybe Cyclone Blade presages Warriors Special Attacks. IF we are going to start seeing this kind of thing it might be good to have some input on the kind of Special Attacks we think we might need.<br />

Even if warriors got EQ, we would still fall far behind in damage compared to range DPS classes.  I doubt very much you would see warriors standing back shooting a bow over meleeing(with the exception of ranged type encounters).  Would we be able to do too much damage?  Dunno for sure, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Bloody Ancille pouch is awesome, but I still have to carry around all the crystals, have all the arrows, and truth is, with all the potions, clickies, stat food, different weapons and such I carry, I lack alot of spare room.  Further, I find it very annoying when I find out that I have run out of arrows as named mob is inc.  Warriors getting EQ would take nothing away from rangers, who still do far more ranged damage than we ever would, and would give me an AA that I would find very convienient.  Not a huge big deal, and it shows how good of shape our class is that we are actually struggling to find many good issues for our top 10 list.</div></div><hr />

An AA that summons an infinite quantity,low (1 is fine!) damage arrow...<br />
<br />
No, warriors are never going to compete w/ rangers for dps w/ bows, and i have no desire to.  I do think its silly that with all the &quot;ranged only&quot; encounters in the game, a warrior, the master of weaponry...has to stop to click his bloody ancilles pouch to summon more ammo.  There is nothing unbalancing i can see to an infinite 1 dmg arrow, its far less effective than the 10+ dmg arrows the rangers use with their true EQ, and yet a million times less annoying than what we deal with now...hell make it 15 AA's, 20 even...id buy it. Make it in levels...level 1 = 75 range, level 2 = 125 range, level 3 = 175 range...even if that total cost was 30 aa's, id still buy it.<br />
<br />
I want to not be at the mercy of my available space in inventory as to how long i can participate in an event im not the MT for...i want to be able to pull with my bow and not have to stop every 30 mins to summon more arrows, and hope i have enough crystals on me...<br />

Personally i dont care if the other non-ranger archery classes get the same aa available to them...</div></div><hr />

Most new warriors who are lower levelled tend not to know how to manage aggro, or even what aggro is all about. So I was thinking, since there already class trainers that we visit to raise our skills and such, why not make them spew forth wisdom that helps warriors to manage their aggro? <br />
<br />
Things that we have often taken for granted, like arrows for pulling, proximity and taunt usage, could be made into [keywords] that are then explained by the trainers. If we were to expand the concept, each class trainer could also have the same design. The basic tutorial that they made is very general, and does not go in depth into each individual class's role in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rest of the dps melee classes dont have to worry about channeling since they dont tank that much.<br />

Warriors job on the other hand is to tank and it would be nice to be able to cast some of the shorter casting time buffs while tanking whithout having it interrupted.  For Gods sake 0.5 casting time gets interrupted a whole lot while tanking.<br />

For all melees:<br />
Extended Defense: increases the duration of defensive disciplines with a duration of 60 seconds or longer.<br />
Extended Offense: increases the duration of offensive disciplines with a duration of 30 seconds or longer.<br />
Endurance Preservation: decreases the endurance cost of all ablities.<br />
<br />
Specific to warriors:<br />
Burning Aggression: increases the hate over time of incite line.<br />
Improved Aggression: increases the initial hatred of incite line and cyclone line.<br />
<br />
Rogues, monks and zerkers would get similar class specific foci. Class specific foci would be on class armor and/or augments. While All Melee foci would also be on generic plate, chain and leather items.</div></div><hr />
