Doesnt it seem silly that melees are arbitrarily capped at a certain haste level since Kunark, while casters mana regen rate has gone through the roof.<br />
<br />
Seems an easy way to help balance melee classes would be just remove the haste cap.  Would give us 9% more haste (SoV 68 + 41) helping with aggro that extra bit.  Tune the line of haste spells accordingly until you achieve &quot;balance&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It would be nice if haste items stacked, cap was higher, and all that other jazz dealing with haste. <br />
<br />
But what would be better is if at 65 you didn't miss as much as you did the day you capped your weapon skills. (talking out my ass, but you get the piucture, I'm sure).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get the most benefit of high haste with slow 1hders.  The higher the haste the slower the delay you can have on a 1hder.  It doesn't really matter for 2hders because if you get a 2hdr with low enough delay you hit the min cap, you also have a 2hdr with almost no damage bonus.</div></div><hr />

Find a 16 (Probably would be less of a pain in the ass if it were a 14 or less) delay  weapon, slap max haste on the wielder, try to find an instance where it swings three, five, or more times in the same second (depending on who is wielding it)?  Or has this already been done?</div></div><hr />

that was at level 60.<br />
offhand doesn't triple originally.<br />
logs showed 3 attacks at 1 timestamp.<br />
if there is a minimum delay, it's lower than 10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More like Apple, Apple, Orange.  How are mana regen and haste different?  Both regulate damage output over time.<br />
<br />
You can argue mana regen can be applied to other things, but lets limit this to a DPS / aggro discussion.</div></div><hr />

Twig used to be 3dmg/5dly so thats .5 seconds for swing and haste cap brought that to I think .09 or something that the system couldnt handle and it went caplut. <br />
<br />
Least I remember something along those lines.<br />

bixie sword blade was 2/6 PAL only if anyone remembers that one... got changed to 2/16 as it is a quest item for some PoS (literally) pally thing. allakhazam even has the old 2/6 screenshot of it :p</div></div><hr />

Our parse was quick and dirty, but with a high delay weapon (Lance of Thunder), there was a countable difference in number of swings over time at 68+36% haste and 68+41% haste. If I ever get the chance, I'll grab a chanterbot with SoV and do a several hour parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the problems with melee right now is that turning on attack punishes the player.  Making a player attack at an even faster rate invites two problems as a class that desires to tank:<br />
<br />
- DS are a drain<br />
The best example of this is in Sol Ro.  Monsters there have damage shields which chew through Monks and Rogues which I simply shrug off because of my slower lower rate of attack.<br />
<br />
- Reposte/Enrage is killer:<br />
If you want to rudely wake people up, turn off attack and Taunt right as the monster goes Enrage.  Your DW who aren't paying attention drop dead.   This is kind of harsh but shows the problem.  Fast attacking classes kill themselves in the face of something that has a high reposte rate.  The big issue behind 2H vs DW has this problem at its core.<br />
<br />
I apperciate what you are trying to accomplish but at the moment player melee is dangerous.  While it is still very true that speed kills, it is a very sharp double edge sword and now more than ever it cuts both ways.  Uncapping haste is just as dangerous as it is helpful.  I really do think that the low end of the melee DPS spectrum is too low.  I don't see haste as a way to solve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The haste cap in the original game was a technical limitation...I'm fairly certain that its a functional decision now (I had thought that certain pets break that 100pct cap now anyway...aka burnout/haste/muzzle at high lvls?).<br />
<br />
The Twig was nerfed because for its era i(Kunark) t was incredibly unbalancing.  There was a great deal of talk about min delay in that era (3 years ago).  I remember a friend having it and using it w/o crashing zones....however that doesnt mean it didnt have that impact as well. <br />
<br />
As far as lifting any haste cap to resolve pure melee inblance...avoiding any deep analysis wouldn't hybrids get the same benefit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 'Zone Crashing' use was, as far as I am aware, an isolated occurance that happened when a monk on Brell attacked a Sebilite Juggernaut using a Moss twig and a Efreeti War Standard (3/10, Sec only), and countered the Jugg's Enrage with /disc whirlwind, the monk version of Furious. Needless to say, the 2-4 new riposte chains every half second was a bit more than particular zone set could handle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild never had any crashes using the twig.  They axed it for balance reasons at the time.<br />
<br />
Sigh... those were the days.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeka, I couldnt disagree with you more.  :)<br />
<br />
DS's and ripostes have always been part of the game.   You still have to use your brain when you hit autoattack.<br />
<br />
Arathena I would love to see your results.  Im contemplating tossing out my earring of endless speed for LDON haste gear with more HP.  Wouldnt want to do that if the haste cap didnt exist.</div></div><hr />

True the haste cap hasn't been raised, but there have been a lot of innate ATK gear and buffs that have come out. There were only a few Aura of Battle and other ATK items in Velious - now we have lots of Vengeance and higher order Aura of ___ atk/regen items. <br />
<br />
Lots of the current ATK buffs weren't always around as well. Hybrid buffs only started to come out in Velious; just like worn ATK gear there are updates in PoP (SoN vs SoT, CoP vs SoP,  Avatar vs Ferine Avatar, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point, Taminy.   However, the ATK gains only address the DPS issue, not aggro.   <br />
<br />
The latest parsings seem to imply that aggro is generated on a per-swing basis, regardless of whether that swing hits or not, or how much damage it causes if it does hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with that. If your dual wield/double attack skills are maxed, but you have a pathetically low weapon skill (let's just say 2hb for the sake of argument). All things being equal, I've found that at level 60 (when I was still skilling up some things like 2hb) I would hold aggro far better with the skill maxed than at 100. Same amount of swings... just far less hits and damage per hit.<br />
<br />
Granted I can't really parse this, but aggro is pretty hard to parse.<br />
<br />
In any case, in addition to ATK increases... Luclin added a couple of items that add a dd + knockback or dd + stun proc to your weapons. PoP added another one. LDoN added dd + stun and pure hate proc augments to your weapons. Plus they've added a new line of enchanter and SK spells which increase aggro.</div></div><hr />
