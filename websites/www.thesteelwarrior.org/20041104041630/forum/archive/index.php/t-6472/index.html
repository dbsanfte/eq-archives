<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ixoye1213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been bazaar hunting and tearing through allah's for a few weeks now and am still not quite sold on what to do about my shoulders<br />
<br />
I am currently usuing the Tattered Mantle (12 AC 20 HP) and am curious about what i should upgrade with<br />
<br />
Few things i have seen<br />
<br />
Spike Shoulder something or other (about 30 something AC and 65 HP).  Nice stats, but not worth droping 70k on.<br />
<br />
Kylong Darkmail Pauldrons:  Nice Item again, but pain in the neck to get to and camp, and never see them for sale in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I thought about doing the Wracked Cords or the Fussion of Elements quests, but both very time consuming and need people to help<br />
<br />
What are some other options out there i am missing to fill my shoulder spot.  I am willing to drop abouit 10-15k.</div></div><hr />

They drop in PoValor off of named lightcrawlers, though rarely. You can occasionally find them for sale too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, the Draconic are nice.  Only reason I bought Crystalized Acid was because my STA is always maxxed with buffs (almost maxxed without) and it's nice to have the hp's.</div></div><hr />

You can do the shade with 2 groups, we do him with 7-8 peeps easy.   Look at my magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Barbed Rubicite Pauldrons (or Chokidai Hide Pauldrons) are best bang for the buck, as someone above stated.<br />
<br />
Others that are easy to get are Platoon Leader's Pauldrons (outta HoH Trial 1 - Crazed Norrathians).<br />
<br />
Obsidian Plated Pauldrons (see my magelo) - Drop in Solro Tower of Galremos, a splitting lava mini named guy on the way to Arylixir... can be done with like one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doesn't that Nurga quest require that the specific slave is up and if he's not up, don't you have to kill other slaves in order to get him up?  Pretty long and difficult quest and those shoulders aren't that hot...  but might be fun to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gothmaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All the Nurgan slaves have been freed.  All you need to do is gather the quest items - all are droppable and can be found from time to time in the bazaar - and hand them into the quest NPC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The Forged Shoulderpads mentioned earlier sell for relatively cheap due to being warrior only.  I think I paid 7k.  At that price there is no contest compared to all of the other suggestions in this thread.  Buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wo, cool about the Nurga slaves quests, I didn't know that.  Well all the slaves are not freed on my server...  Stromm.  I wonder if the one that the shoulders quest from has been freed...  I'll have to check.  I just happen to have spent a bunch of time camping taskmasters and have at least 3 whips and the items off the named mobs also.  But I already have Crystalized Acid Pauldons, I guess I could sell them and upgrade another slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gothmaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, the Nurga shoulders aren't nearly as good as Crystallized Acid Pauldrons.  But they're basically free if you can get lucky with the drops, whereas the CAP will run around 40k.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what level the original poster is.  If you're in your 40s/low 50s, take a look at Nurga.  It's a great experience zone, and the free-the-slaves quests can net some very respectable items.  40hp and three +10 saves for an item you can get yourself.  The nice thing about Nurga is that there's something there for almost everyone, so you might be able to get some friends to go along.  Plenty of name mobs with decent mid-level drops, and the quest items have something to offer for virtually every class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Can anyone confirm that once the slaves are freed you can do the turn in multiple times?  I have tons and tons of quest items I have kept from Nurga and am just wondering if I can do the quests for the already freed slaves.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the great imput so far!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
other diety stuff will be like 30 hp 30 mana, and maybe flop some stats around. prolly wont break the bank either. if you have to can prolly get intouch with a smith in your servers market channel and have some made if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Another option is the Bonespur Mantle, check my magelo.</div></div><hr />

Pauldrons of the Deep Flame, takes some patience, but WELL worth it in my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok, you are correct, you can do the item turn in after the slave has been freed.  Pretty cool.  I had the nurgan taskmaster whips and the dagger of the sneak, so I went and did the quest for the dingy pauldrons.  Unfortunately just about a week ago I purchased the crystalized acid pauldrons, but that is ok since they are quite a bit better.  I have a nice backup shoulder item to put in the bank for CR's.  :)</div></div><hr />

Yea, I did that whole quest in about 3 hours with a group.  Of course it depends on how much the mobs are camped on your server.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure of the race of the original poster, but my OGre cultural armor is nice.  The shoulder slot is 22ac and other stats, and it only cost me some Blue diamonds and a little plat from a nice blacksmith.<br />
<br />
I would take that plat you intended to drop in the bazaar and shout around for a blacksmith.  You probably would come out with several items instead of one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although not bazaar droppable, and requires some help to get it, I've been happy with them for quite awhile and haven't had the itch to upgrade them yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Slighted Pauldrons (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=32310) <br />

  Not amazing shoulders, and they do take some camping or luck. I looted those ages ago in ME. If you happen to be camping shards for VT or something, I think the named that drops these spawns in the goranga camp near AR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Check my Magelo. Takes less than a group (60+) to get, drops fairly commonly in Plane of Mischief, easy to get to. (No mobs along the way besides the named see invis, and there is a safe pull spot.)</div></div><hr />
