<br />
I have come here to ask one question: how do you guys handle the AE rampage? We visited Hate B last night - for the first time since the revamp - and while we hadn't had much of a problem along the way - even Maestro, who was a cake - but soon found ourselves banging  our heads against a wall of steel. <br />
<br />
The merchant version of Inny was but a joke. It was the second version of Innoruuk that had this nasty AE rampage, and while many people have warned about the massive trains, we didn't even live long enough to SEE the train coming. I think we got wiped out in the first few minutes. After a few futile attempts against him, we called it a night. <br />
<br />
It was a brand new encounter for us, since we're just coming off from Vex Thal, (we farmed VT a few weeks now.) and I know for a fact that AE rampage is something new in PoP. No boss mob pre-PoP dishes out AE Ramp. <br />
<br />
Can anyone of you out there enlighten us? How does this AE rampage work? We know how NORMAL rampage works, and we know how to handle that part of the problem. <br />
<br />
Also, if you guys can chip in a bit of your tale or info, it would be appreciated greatly - and a great help in our adventures ahead of us. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

If you are are max melee range, you can do damage to an AE rampager while being outside his rampage range, by about 2 feet.  There isn't much margin for error, and your melee need to backup and get &quot;do not see target&quot; messages to ensure they're at max range.  That said, Inny's AE rampage is the weakest I've ever heard of.  He quads in the 700's and his attack is pretty low (so not all max hits).<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you range attack inny as you are able (with rangers/casters) and use your other melee for other things, at least for certain parts of the fight.  (Casters have to be inside melee range to land spells by the way, can you hear the devs laughing?)  Once the CC is locked down and if you have some extra healers, certainly monks and rogues can probably engage in melee.  The trouble is inny has some knocking around as I recall, and you don't want to wall/corner him so your rangers can take him down.  So, it's hard to keep inny positioned well and still, which means melee will be taking some damage.  But again, it's not that bad as long as you don't zerg every melee at him at the beginning.  Certainly, not before he's slowed and crippled. . .<br />
<br />
One time inny's AE rampage kindof bugged out on us.  It seemed to be affecting some people, but not others who were able to just stand right beside him.  I still have no idea how or why this happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mobs with AE rampage must be avoided by meleeing at max range, because if the mob does any reasonable amount of melee damage there's just no way you can keep people up against AE rampage for any extended amount of time.  The only exception is Saryrn and it is obvious that you're supposed to take the AE rampage from her.  Mobs do not necessarily have to have a melee range &gt; rampage range, but on all mobs with nontrivial AE rampage, you can usually melee outside the AE rampage range.<br />
<br />
Actually there are various degrees of AE rampage.  Fennin Ro for example only hits about 6-8 targets when he does an AE rampage.  Of course most AE rampagers just flat out hit everyone.  You can usually get an idea of how many target it hits by the number of swarm pets that died.</div></div><hr />
