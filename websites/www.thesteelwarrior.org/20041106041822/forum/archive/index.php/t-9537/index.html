<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, this could probably be in a different forum, but come on..this is me we're talking about here.  It's likely to end up here anyway.<br />
<br />
Okay, so, been back in EQ for a couple months now, mostly from the allure of obtaining 8khp unbuffed.  It has come to my attention that AC is once again, MASSIVELY important in the game again, and required to progress.  I look back thru GoD upgrade threads, and thru OOW &quot;max warrior&quot; profiles and I see one distinguishing factor in all of them.  Sure they've got some nice HP, but they have absolute crap in the AC department.  <br />
<br />
Now, when I quit EQ, we had a different group setup, and basically I was sitting at around 8khp and 1400ac buffed every nite.  Things were difficult, but doable.  Now that I'm back, with some gear modifications, I sit right around 8300 or so with the buffs I choose to use, and 1650 ac.  The difference is astonishing, flat out ridiculous.  I'm talking about before I quit, needing a CH before the slow on a Kriger in BoT, to tanking one to death without a heal at all.  It's very clear to me that an extra thousand or 2 HP isn't going to make nearly as much difference as more AC.  Nowhere is this more clear as surfing the web, with high end people touting near 3k ac unbuffed.  <br />
<br />
So, here's the task.  I've created a new magelo, which is essentially me, with Sturdiness maxed out, AC augs maxed out, and the 2 pieces of doze loot that I'm missing.  It also has all of the upgrades that I can basically see as reasonable in the future (finishing up Kizraks, etc).  Find me some ugprades.  The upgrades must be single groupable, or tradable (reasonable).  6hp = 1ac.  ... which means I won't be shifting to all this new OOW fucking garbage with 100hp and 16ac.  Caveats --<br />
<br />
No Loyalist shield.  Fuck SoE, fuck their camps.  I don't want them, I don't need them.<br />
No AoW helm.  I wore a SSB for too long, I'm not going back to it.<br />
No Crystalline Acid bracer.  Things are fucking stupid rare on CT, impossible to find.  I'd wear one in a heartbeat, but there's just no chance of getting one.<br />
<br />
Also, the upgrade has to be &quot;Worth it.&quot;  meaning that I'm not going to ugprade for less than 20hp, or 5ac.<br />
<br />
I honestly think I'm at the end of the line here, this is as good as a non raider gets.  You can pack on all the HP in the world, and it's not gonna mean shit if you can't take a punch.  My clerics don't have a 9k mana pool to be chaining Supernal light all goddamned day, this needs to be efficient, and HP isn't efficient anymore.<br />
<br />
Here's the magelo -- have fun with it.  Prove me wrong.  I'm more than willing to work for my shit, but it doesn't look like there's anything worth working for left.<br />
<br />
Non Raider (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1133870)<br />
<br />
Edit : I know about bracer of the heartstriker.  That should be in there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will see giant AC improvements if you work towards the tier 1 oow armor quests.  So far I think only gloves, bp, and arms have been discovered, so your magelo will probably end up being a 'work in progress' and you can put those pieces in there as they appear in magelo database.  The arms are something like 46 ac and the gloves are something like 45 ac.   <br />
<br />
The very last part of your post you said 'I know about bracer of the heartstriker. That should be in there too'.  Jhiru and the tier 1 armor pieces arent even on the same page for the difficulty to obtain (not counting legs and bp pieces).  So if a heartstriker bracer is obtainable and fits the criteria for your magelo, then the oow tier1 armor definitely does.  The named mobs that you have to kill are typically no different than a normal mob standing next to them.   I have the arms no-drop piece, and am at kindly, but my router died so I cant pump out the last bit of faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Meh, another 10ac in a couple of slots (cuz lets face it, they're not gonna hand out BP/legs to anyone without a raid), is only gonna net another 75ac modified at best.  This is still not even close to acceptable when tanks are gonna be over 3000 in a few months.<br />
<br />
SOE -- pay attention.  Nice job correcting the HP gap, now can we fix the AC one please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would you concider XTC to be doable by your group?  If so throw in a Hategiver.  I noticed you have ToV quest gear, are any of the NToV mobs doable by your group? Another might be the earring from the Guardian of the Seal.  Along with the magnetic stuff, Royal Attendant tends to better AC wise than Ornate.<br />
<br />
I think you're right Haass, the HP gap has been fixed for the most part.  AC is all that is left worth raiding for it seems like.  Fine by me cause I really enjoy raiding and there needs to be something (imo) gearwise to make raiding worth the effort.  Im not talking about EP's and Time, more like NToV &amp; Ssra.<br />
<br />
In the aug department:<br />
- 50 AC from LDoN<br />
- 30 AC from the 2 Ferubi augs<br />
- 10 AC from Ruined City<br />
- 20 AC from MPG<br />
<br />
I didnt look at all your augs, but it looked like you had the LDoN 10AC augs already, but there is still another 60AC to be gotten augment wise from drops (i think there is another gay droppable AC aug thats like 4 AC or something too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">-Loyalist shield is the best one you will find this side of time.  Saying no to that is just plain ridiculous unless you have haste on your back (which you don't).  30ac tradeoff for about 40-50hps ... most warriors would agree this is worth it.<br />
-AoW helm is the best helm before raex.  At 21 more ac and 40 more hps it would be silly of you to say no to this one as well.<br />
-Though i'm not sure how easy/hard Seru would be for your small group, he is doable by 6-man teams and trivial these days with more.  He has 3 upgrades: earing  necklace (move your charm to wrist) breatplate all with nice hp/ac upgrades.<br />
-15ac augs out of Ferubi (2 of them) plus a few others<br />
<br />
Gear alone you could add over 60 raw ac (over 100 visible), but for some reason you don't want option a or b. Add in augs and you could technically add btw 110-150 raw ac total.  I agree, though, there is a serious lack of ac gear for the non-raider.  Upgrades are hard but there are a few out there.  Level 70 also raises the defense cap to 270 which adds a fair amount, and the new aa's are very very nice.<br />
<br />
I know you don't want you here me talk ... feel free to ignore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spaztic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I understand what your saying. I don't raid, will never raid.. and I want 2k unbuffed ac, but its just not available right now.<br />
<br />
Not trying to sound like an ass, but what do you care anyways? Aren't you gone with WoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oh yea, dont forget about the extra 5 levels of defensive skill ups you get by going to level 70 and the easier time you'll have against the same mobs that chew you up at level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, are you looking for gear?  or trying to make some kind of petition to SOE about gear balance?  Cause if you're trying to prove a point about non-raider AC, leaving out the AoW hat becuase you don't like the graphic isn't gonna make your argument very convincing.<br />
<br />
Personally, I loved the SSB look.  I'm wearing a no-graphic elemental hat now and I swear I can't fight half as well without horns.<br />
<br />
For an upgrade, Warclasp Earring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30500) from MPG is an upgrade for your tear of the rainmaker, unless of course you still don't have OoW and all No Drop OoW stuff is out along with the other restrictions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both :) That's why it's in the outhouse.<br />
<br />
Leaving out 2 slots doesn't change a thing.  The AoW helm and the Loyalist shield aren't worth playing this game for.  I'm not camping that vampire in a green zone, and there's no way for me to drop the AoW, and I got way better things to spend money on than a 250k helm.<br />
<br />
If I can't upgrade the rest of the slots, then there's no point anyway.<br />

<br />
I don't have OOW..but one piece of gear isn't worth buying it for.  Everything else I've seen coming out of there is either tradable (hence obtainable without owning it) or just complete ass on AC.  If that holds true for the vast majority of the gear in said expansion, then I know not to waste my time buying it.<br />
<br />
Edit -- that ended up being more harsh than I wanted.  If it ends up that this whole thread gets filled up with 40hp upgrades, then I know that there is a future for me in this game.  If it fizzles out, and everyone says &quot;Ya, you pretty much need a Zek helm and a Loyalist shield&quot; then I know where to go with my money again.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but LDoN is such a drag.  I could get 40hp augments for all slots too, but we all know where that would lead....the room with the padded walls.<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't think so...I think I'd be screwed with OOW.<br />
<br />
All of the OOW loot I've seen is just asstastic AC, in exchange for a few HP.  Is it not?<br />
<br />
Why would I drop my Doze pauldrons for a 16ac 140hp mantle?  Why would I drop my doze neck for a 120hp neck with 17ac?  This is the loot I see from 1 groupable areas of OOW, and it's not compelling me to purchase said expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My question is what are you gonna do with all this AC you are looking for... where are you going to fight if not in OoW/GoD.  Its doubful you'll get beyond Tier2 of GoD w/o EP gear or a Raid force.  Omens gives you a few more zones to play in that are comparable to the EP's (MPG and RS).<br />

Good question, why would ya?  There is better gear than what comes out of the 1 groupable OoW camps available in previous expansions but always at some kind of trade off (you want HP's or AC?) and your selection is limited enough that you cant afford to be as choosey as you are being and still end up with what you want (ie the Loyalist Shield, LDoN armors, the HoRZ).<br />
<br />
To gain more of a selection you will need more friends to be there with you.  I know thats not something you like, but that is the way this game is rigged.</div></div><hr />

Kill bigger things, of course.  Same thing you do with AC.<br />

 It'd be easier for you actually, since you hydra. Especially if you know what you're going for and where to get it - no having to worry about the healer wanting only MM adventures or the BL really needing that pet aug. With your gear level, you can easily do hards, and no one to turn you down for them, either.</div></div><hr />

There is more now for you to do with a 6 man group, but you will have to be less selective.  You will need to buy OoW, at the very least, for the increased level if not an increased selection of bigger things to kill (named in MPG come to mind)</div></div><hr />

Drops seem to come from exp zones, and only a couple slots have been completed, but judging from the Gloves (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70744) and Breastplate (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70746) they would be very nice upgrades for your ornate slots (and some others probably).  Not clear on how hard this stuff is to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It is ironic that HP is probably less important than ever, with AC and AAs dominating how well someone tanks, but we are flooded with items fat with HP, atk, and regen.  Is it my imagination that players also seem to be more obsessed with HP than I have ever seen in my time playing EQ.   Not saying HP is not important, but HP is the only question I get asked now in group situations.   It has been months since I was asked AC when getting quized for a group invite, and can count on one hand the number of times I have been asked about AAs.  (For raids, I often get asked these questions.) (Sorry Haas, do not want to derail this thread into another whine about hp, ubers, etc..)<br />
<br />
In regards to the Loyalist Shield.  I believe the best way to get the vamp ashes is not to continuously camp it.  There is no methodogy to the spawning of it.  I made a level 1 rogue that had a bag of invis potions and sat him down outside the vamp castle in view of the balcony.  I made a point of logging him first every time I logged into EQ.  It took a while, but one day the vamp was up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are aware of course, that the more you upgrade, the more you can do with 6 people?<br />
<br />
Tell someone 3 years ago that you took 5 friends and cleared NToV.  He'd tar and feather you.  The game hasn't changed.<br />
<br />
I'm always going to be behind content.  I know that, I don't care.  I just want a progression path.  if I can upgrade my gear to the point where I can start taking down stuff that Time+ geared people do with a single group (probably not as easily...i'll die a few times trying), and then get upgrades off of that, then I'm pushing forward.<br />
<br />
Guess I'm confused as to why this is a foreign concept to you.  It should be fairly self explanatory.  You don't slog thru the elementals just to sit on your ass in Time do you?<br />

Please dont assume that this a foreign concept me, I understand perfectly what you are attempting to do.  I think its pretty cool for the most part, but I dont think you'll get what you want (a progression path) with out buying the new expansion.  While I'm no were near EP flagged, nor am I in that big a hurry, seems to me you'd goto the EP's to get Time flagged, to get better gear, and then move on to the next level which is GoD raiding (you are already raiding if you are in time).  Correct me if I am wrong.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you will run out of things to kill with a 6 man group.  But with OoW you get MPG and Riftseekers open to you w/o needing a raid.  Accomplishing anythign once you are there will be interesting to see.  I know I wanna know if you can hang there w/o raiding for gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Doesn't that Marsinger gem involve killing Innoruuk?  Thought he was quite the badass these days.<br />
Nope...the quest is easily obtainable by a single group though it may take some going.  ALL of the drops required come off the minis though Maestro and Innoruuk also have the #3 and #4 gem quest items on their loot tables. HERE (http://www.guildseofon.com/raidinghate.html) is a great guide written by our GL that details where all the named placeholders are.  Tier 4 Hate is also one the best pre-elemental XP spots in the game - 2-3%AA/trash and 9-10%AA/named.  But...I've already said too much...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here's what I'm saying, simply, since the first post.<br />
<br />
OOW Doesn't appear to provide that path.<br />
<br />
It provides HP, but not AC to go with it.  I'm not going backwards on AC.<br />
<br />
the quest is easily obtainable by a single group though it may take some going <br />
<br />
And these are the words I wants to hear.  I've never been a fan of boring shit...bring the pain and make me work for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OOW Doesn't appear to provide that path.<br />
Level 70 doesnt count in your eyes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Christ dude, put down your uncle's bong.<br />
<br />
I'm far beyond buying expansions just because of the fucking gimmick of the week.  Level 70 has just as many downsides to the non raider as it does benefits.  If you like spending the rest of your days in ONE single expansion, because that's the only place you can make your XP bar move, then by all means, get level 70 and have fun.  It's never been about that for me, and probably never will.  If I can't go to a different place every nite and actually accomplish something, then the game isn't worth playing.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not trying to sound like an ass, but what do you care anyways? Aren't you gone with WoW?<br />
<br />
2k unbuffed is possible without raiding with a lot of augs. Riftseekers is the answer to the non-raiding AC problem. Can put 20 or 25 AC in every visible slot. I don't raid either, and my goal is 2000AC, 10,000HP unbuffed, and I think it is doable.  Sure it is nowhere near high end raid numbers, but it is more than enough for anything that you may be attempting with a raid.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I ground out a shitload of ldon when it first came out and was also prepared to do those long boring camps for for gear such as loyalist shield etc, but the ldon gear is slowly getting replaced now as I progress.<br />
<br />
Oow does help, level 70 alone adds a few hundred hp and 50 ish? ac, the tanking aa while not stellar individualy do add up and make a difference and there are some nice single group drops in MPG and above WITH decent AC. Level 70 is also allowing me to dabble in KT and Inkz(sp)? trials successfuly with yet more single groupable upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am not yet sure how far I can go but I am guessing 2.2/2.3k ac  and 12k hp is achievable by the dedicated none raider? But I do agree ac is far more important than hp once close to 10k hp!<br />

Just set some goals.  Beat vxed and tipt.  Enter KT and go right to the Ikkinz trials.  Those are incredibly rough for non raiders but the rewards are well worth it.  <br />

Now granted, doing all this wont magically poop you out 2k unbuffed ac, but it's a big start.

<br />
The only downside is that at level 70 you can no longer effectively level up on BoThunder.  The new OoW zones are 100% better anyways, and Tipt/Vxed/KT are amazing xp AND loot.<br />
<br />
You talk about doing more with less yet negate the value of 5 more levels?  Heh ... nobody 1grouped NToV or Ssra or Seru at level 60 ... thats the honest truth.

Meh, another 10ac in a couple of slots....<br />
<br />
That's the way the game works. Incremental upgrades. If you aren't raiding, you can't expect to get some 20ac 100hp upgrade from a single item. It's the net that's important, and considering you're doing single group things I don't see the downside to getting a small upgrade, then another, then another.

If you've got the energy to get yourself to level 70, riftseeker's is the place to jack your AC up.  It's far from an easy zone, but considering that you don't have sturdy 5 (possible AA cost change coming soon) or level 70, and that you'd gain a good 1000+ hitpoints just from completing both, at minimum...  a few gear changes, and this could be a pair of zones you could handle.<br />

if you can handle krieger's, you can handle most of the mobs in these trials already.  the nameds are a bit tougher, sure, but still in the realm of doability.  They've actually provided a progression map for casual players gear wise.  farm up the stuff in wos/mpg/rs, then hit these trials for your top notch loots.  pair em with some of the random trash loot from yxtta/kodtaz, and you can get some serious results.  70hp augs, 50/50/50 augs from kt/yxtta, 2 20ac augs in KT, 1 20ac aug in Yxtta, 4 20ac augs from rs, 4 25 ac augs from rs, 1 20ac aug from mpg... that's 260ac raw in augs right there.  add to that the 2 50/50's from yxtta/kt, 4 70's from rs, 4 65's from rs, a 60/60 from mpg, a 55 from mpg...  that's 755hp raw, and that's just from a those 4 zones alone.  oow provides a ridiculous amount of solutions to gear issues for casual players, it's just a matter of knowing where to be, and having the patience to camp them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">OoW is a worthwhile xpansion to get.  it is prehaps the most none raider friendly xpansion since velious.   some will argue LDoN being more none raider friendly xpansion, but i would argue that the nerf in xp gained and the sheer amount of adventures you have to do to improve your gear puts it out of range for alot of casual players.  with OoW, you can get half way decent gear, then maybe aug it up with ldon.  but either way, IMO it's the 1st time that you will see signficant improvements over velious gear w/o raiding.  there are a few peices of gear you refuse to get which i disagree with.  loyalist shield is NOT that hard considering the reward.  park a ranger there and keep an eye out for the vamp spawn.  check the spawn often and you WILL get it.  I know I did.  as for RZ helm.  that is just a no brainer.  shell out some PP and you too can have a near EP helm.  I would recommend you look into the OoW quest armor.  it's very much like velious where it's not the best, but it's a stepping stone for most people looking for upgrades.  the tier2 quest armors are still 1 groupable except for bp/leg so it's WELL worth looking into.  if you have access to a good GM smith, you should look into farming cores for charged magnetic armor to bridge you over from some of your weaker slots.</div></div><hr />

If I were you, I would pick up OoW. Head to WoS or RCoD and start farming the pieces for the quest armor. Once you get the pieces, head over to MPG, get the drops, levels, and faction there. Then head back to GoD and farm your way through Ikkinz. Then head back to OoW, aug up in Riftseeker, then head over to the MPG trials.

Are those augs available to non-raiders?  If so, then don't discount the fact that they exist.  Since the introduction of LDoN, augments have played an equally important part of this game as new gear has.  They're an integral part of everyone's &quot;everquest&quot; these days, so don't try to pretend that they dont exist and/or are not important/relevant.<br />
<br />
OoW has been the most ac-friendly expansion to non raiding warriors ever.  It was a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Basically, I think you are crazy to dis OoW if your point is to obtain single-groupable upgrades.  There are many reasons to dislike OoW (mostly relating to the fact that there is insane single-groupable upgrades), but the upgrade path isn't one of them.<br />
<br />
There are items that are upgrades to pretty much every piece of your present gear.  In particular, just the visibile upgrades available through one-groupable (great exp) content in OoW would make a huge AC upgrade.  This tier 1 OoW gear isn't laughable, it is a significant improvement above Kizracks:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=armsmaster  Basically, all pieces come with better AC than what you currently have - and by A LOT.  You also wouldn't need to upgrade to RZ helm because the armsmaster's helm is  similar in quality (a couple less AC, a few more HP) but without the graphic.  Moreover, the BP nodrop piece IS single-groupable if SoE would just fix the fucking Tiopat script.  Currently, the legs only drop from a pre-EP raid-level mob, but there are multiple mobs that drop all other pieces and I expect another mob will drop the leg piece to - it just hasn't been discovered yet. <br />
<br />
Finally, if you and your group is as fucking bad ass as you like to tell all of us you are, then you should eat the muramite proving ground trials whole once you've upgraded the group with tier 1 gear and some drops from OoW/GoD.  The MPG give single groups:<br />

And these are only the warrior upgrades.  If you care to, take a look at my magelo.  I've included a &quot;Doable&quot; profile that is my target.  I get 9443HP and 2114AC - I could go higher but I've chosen to put the 40HP augs in most visible slots instead of the 25AC.  Everything in that magelo is obtainable through a group except for the epic and the ring of force.  MOST of it is obtainable through OoW.  The VP quest items listed in the magelo are actually out of date because of single-group encounter drops in OoW but I just can't make myself set them aside yet. <br />

If you think you are stuck, you are way wrong.  You just aren't willing to purchase the expansion to get you out of the muck.  Which, admittidly, is your choice and I don't blame you for thinking it could be a total shit expansion.  In truth, I think the expanasion has completely and utterly fucked mudflation and itemization - but in a way that is good for nonraiders so it's pure stubborn asshole-ness that might cause a man like yerself to overlook the benefits.</div></div><hr />

Yup, that's pretty much what it is.  I don't buy expansions anymore until I've heard from numerous people that it's worth buying.  Luclin and PoP pissed me off in more ways than I care to count.  I thought LDoN was shit before I bought it, and I think it's shit now that I have it.  Last thing I'm gonna do is be running to Best Buy on launch day for SoE products anymore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">under the fairly small chance that i choose to renew my account in december i would buy omens. after all its only a one time purchase cost. but my issue really comes down to that i think its suicide for me to level up to 70 because two of the last three expansions have had too much lag for me to find viable (ykesha and GoD). ldon lag was acceptable. this means i have to buy oow and try it out at level 65 to see if the lag is acceptable before i dare level up.<br />
<br />
which brings me to the question.<br />
<br />
how does lag in oow compare to the lag in god? im talking about the computer performance challenged here like me. if you have no lag anywhere and you also have no lag in oow then that does not tell me much about what to expect on my own machine. but you may also have friends who have dinosaurs like mine who have told you &quot;these zones are too laggy for me but those zones are ok&quot;. what are they saying about oow?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Haass, bro, I fully know where you're coming from when you say you absolutely refuse to rush out and buy a new expansion.  Luclin had a lot of the great lore that everybody loved, but overall, it was completely and utterly unfinished.  How many people here know that Emperor Ssraeshza actually responds to hails, even while you're fighting him?  How many factions can you raise and destroy in Luclin that ultimately lead to nothing?  How many quests do you think were planned in the works for Luclin, but were simply never implemented?  I can tell you now, there was a fucking LOT.  I think the original designs for Luclin were unbelievable.  I think, had they not been so fucking hellbent on releasing an expansion every six months, that Luclin would have been, by far, the best expansion ever released, even better than Velious.  Sadly, while I admit that, overall, I enjoyed Luclin for what it had to offer, the majority of my feeling firmly plant themselves on the bitter end of my toungue.  <br />
<br />
PoP changed the way we play Everquest, period.  There is no one here that can deny that.  With the introduction of PoP, it was obvious the way the developer team really had envisioned the way they wanted EQ to be.  I remember reading extensively how the playerbase wanted to veer away from insanely long, boring fights that characterized Velious and especially Luclin.  Mobs in PoP hit harder, died faster, and overall were just more plain fucking kickass.   From a raider's perspective, who here remembers the first time they engaged Blazzax the Omnifiend?  Imagine this giant fucking red balrog charging your raid, leaping into the air and turning your warrior tank into a goddamn bloodstain, then turning around and sending a shockwave of &quot;HOLY SHIT&quot; 's through your raid with his powerful AE.<br />
<br />
THAT WAS FUCKING COOL!<br />
<br />
Or that first time we all charged Tallon Zek in PoTactics, only to be blown back hundreds of feet by this badass motherfucker with a big, giant bow?  PoP was the epitomy of the word &quot;grand&quot;.  From the grandiose fights with the giants in the Agnarr encounter,  the all out chaotic war in Rallos Zek's pit, the proving of your character with Mithanniel Marr, the testing of the machine with the Manaetic Behemoth, all the way to the epic battles with the head of Fennin Ro's armies, the personifications of Xegony herself, and the epic encounter with Coirnav, the Planes of Power was, by far, the best expansion to date.  I only wish the non-raiders could really enjoy PoP for what it offer so amazingly well.  It's downfall was that it didn't.  Do you know what it's like to finally defeat Rallos Zek the Warlord, having worked on his script for so long?  Do you know how it feels to finally achieve the victory of all four pantheon gods?  Of course you don't, and I don't say that to down you in any way.  How is a non-raider truly supposed to appreciate an expansion having never explored even a fraction of what it had to offer?  I know I certainly could not.  PoP changed the way we play Everquest, however depending on the way you look at it, you could argue some points that not all the changes were for the better.<br />
<br />
Introduce the Gates of Discord.  My old guildleader said it masterfully well that GoD is the gamer's expansion.  GoD takes PoP to an even bigger level in that mobs are considerably more dangerous as well as vastly more complicated.  I fully expect casual guilds to finish the PoP expansion.  Even now, &quot;family&quot; guilds have reached the elemental planes and have begun reaping it's awesome rewards (exp and loot).  Eventually they will enter Time, if they have not already, and they will defeat Quarm.  What I don't think I will ever see, and I say this with utmost confidence, is family guilds to ever defeat the GoD expansion.  In order to really enjoy GoD for what it offers, you have to have a completely new mindset, and not only that, everyone around you must share that exact same mindset.  It's the same kind of mindset that enters a highly competative Counter-Strike player's head when they're competing in tournaments that yield $10,000 in the end.  No, you don't play GoD to have fun, you play GoD to fucking win.  It's only when you win that you feel proud of your accomplishments.  Uqua is not a very enjoyable experience, but when you win, I'm sure the smile on your face is almost as large as the first time you ever had sex.  GoD is the gamer's expansion, and unless you can get yourself into that type mentality to win, win, and only win, there's nothing in GoD that will catch your attention.  I will admit that whenever I think of the GoD expansion, that opening sentence from A Tale of Two Cities always comes back to me:<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.&quot;  (Charles Dickens)<br />
<br />
In short, I think with the Gates of Discord, the playerbase, as well as the devs, have never been so mixed in the direction they have envisioned EverQuest to go.  GoD has a shit ton of content to offer for the single group bite into, but unless you're the raider type with access to all sorts of raiding gear, the apple is tasteless.  It's simply not there.  The expansion is, in no way, lacking in the raiding department, but unless you're willing to essentially sacrifice your soul to win, there isn't much to really bother with this expansion.  I find it hard to describe.  GoD is the gamer's expansion.  It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
And you're probably wondering where I'm going with this goddamn novel. ;)<br />
<br />
There was a part of me that said &quot;Wuoh&quot; the very first time I entered the Riftseeker's Sanctum.  Surrounded by the marvels of color, granduer, and for fuck's sake, GEOMETRY, my vision was assaulted by the awesomeness that epitomizes the OoW expansion.  Riftseeker's Sanctum isn't just your next tiered zone.  It's a fucking work of art.  It, alone, is worth buying OoW for, but it sure as hell isn't the only reason either.  The truth is, OoW offers more to the casual player than any other expansion to date.  I understand your reasons for not rushing out and buying into the hype.  I explained it with my thousand+ words written above.  I do think, however, that if you're unwilling to use OoW in your &quot;plan&quot;, you're cutting out what could argueably be the most fun you ever had in Everquest.  Overall, I think OoW is really the answer to all the mistakes both the player base and the developer team made with PoP and GoD, and as people begin to further explore the lore, the quests, the items, and the mobs, a more broad appreciation for OoW will envelope us in general. <br />
<br />
Why do you play EQ, Haass?  It's fun, isn't it?  Honestly, I love the game.  I think every single expansion has something great to offer - something I wish others could always see, but unfortunately, not everyone looks around under the same light. ;)  I don't think you will achieve what you are looking for unless you're in OoW.  I'm no spokesman for SoE singing sales mantra left and right, but I'm no idiot either.  OoW is the best expansion to date for players like you who simply aren't the raiding type.  With the available quests that are being found and solved daily, there's far more progression paths that you are looking for that could ever be achieved by limiting yourself to PoP/GoD alone.  <br />
<br />
And, not only that, level 70 and the AAs that go with it will really allow you to appreciate GoD for what it has to offer.  GoD is tough.  It's not designed for the non-raider imho, but the content is still sound, and that feeling of victory will always put a huge smile on your face. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Also, one more thing, Haass.<br />
<br />
You are right about many old zones becoming essentially worthless as far as exp when reaching level 70.  Even the Plane of Earth, once a fruitful jungle of endless pulls and insane experience, is now complete and utter garbage at level 70.  BoT?  Don't even laugh, because the experience rate is simply disgusting.  But, I have heard this argument before.  How many people protested about the grind from 60 to 65 when PoP came out?  How many swore up and down that leveling to 65 would ruin their EQ experience, and that their exp bars would never move.<br />
<br />
Well fuck, since when did the enjoyment of this game become entirely measured by the movement of one's exp bar?<br />
<br />
Oh sure, that's easy for me to say.  I have 455 AAs at the time of writing this.  I even have all of my new OoW defensive AAs completed.  I just finished them up tonight.  The humor in it though is that everybody thinks I'm totally hardcore about exping.  To be honest, I'm not, and I even have a little story to share about that. :)  I play EQ primarily with my best friends.  I play a Warrior and Cleric.  My other friend plays a Rogue and Shaman, while the last two play Wizard and Bard (two seperate people, single boxers).  We made the decision to try and farm out the loot that we could get out of the Ikkinz trials.  As we were nearing the end of our farming spree, my wizard friend pointed out that he wanted to exp (exp slows down @ 70 in Ikkinz/KT), and specifically pointed at me, because I had over 400 AAs and he didn't (bit of jealousy here, haha), that he wanted to grind out some AAs.<br />
<br />
The irony of it all?<br />
<br />
It's a real rarity that I ever exp outside of my close net of friends, and I'm sure this is a behavior experienced by many, many others throughout this game.  I could only laugh to myself that here is one of my best friends pointing fingers at me that, while I'm eager to help others farm out Ikkinz without any regards really to how much exp I get, he's accusing me of being comfortable with my AA levels and unwilling to venture on to other zones where the exp bar moves a lil bit faster.<br />
<br />
Where do you think I got all these AAs you nincumfuck?  Rofl!  I only wanted to scream at him.  I'd be willing to wage the ownership of my car keys that the rate at which I exp bar, being that I almost never, EVER group unless it's with these guys, moves at the same fucking rate as his does.<br />
<br />
So, summing this all up, exp comes over time bro.  Just play.  Who really cares if it moves 2% per kill or 6-7% a kill like it does in C2 Fire or Riftseeker's.  How fast your exp bar moves does not measure the enjoyability of a zone.  If you put your mind to the progression of your character, you will come out having far more AAs than you expected. <br />
<br />
Here I am, 455 AAs total at the time of writing this, and I really stopped caring how much my exp bar moved after I got my PoP defensive AAs (90ish or so).  You'd be amazed how fast your exp bar moves when you concentrate on simply having fun. <br />

<br />
I mostly play EQ because I have quite a bit of time on my hands, and it's simply the most efficient time sink for my money.<br />
<br />
However, I don't really fit the description of &quot;not the raiding type.&quot;  I'm plenty the raiding type.  You can ask all my friends, I don't play games to have fun, I play to fucking win (which is probably why no one plays games with me anymore :)). The only deal is that alone is not enough in EQ.  With bullshit like weeklong spawns and content geared at 30+ players (which, admittedly is getting better) a guy like me who just wants to load up EQ and kick ass for a few hours on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday after midnite CST (when I'm not working, and awake) really has no place in the game.  I'm forced to stand beside fucktards who can't even spell &quot;Cool&quot; correctly and sit in the same zones where random trash mobs drop Elemental + quality loot for no real risk.  That's not really what I want.  I've always wanted to do more, and experience the same things you have (IE : RZ kill, Fire, etc), the problem is that I can't do that with new expansions...I have to stay 3 expansions behind the curve to do with 6 what you guys did with 40 three years ago.<br />
<br />
So, I kill Dozekar when he spawns, I clear HoT with a friend playing a chanter and a cleric, and the occasional LDoN until I realize what a worthless excuse for an expansion that is.  Other than that, what am I left with?  Sitting with 100 other retards in MPG fighting over the same trash, just like BoT was, just like Maiden's Eye or The Grey before that.  Not really what I like doing with my time.  EQ isn't a social game for me anymore.  The population of the world is growing dumber by the minute, and to think that these people can actually make a computer function is disconcerting enough, let alone the fact that I'm incapable of smacking them upside the head when they persist to annoy me.<br />
<br />
So, I keep hoping that something is gonna change and I'll be able to do what I want.  Doesn't look like it's going to before WoW comes out, but who knows...WoW may not end up being what I want either, and by Sony's timeline, there should be another 2 expansions out by that time, making GoD and OoW content obsolete, and I'll be able to enjoy myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the plan is to do all the alternate quests...currently I have PoJ and BoT.  <br />
<br />
I'd do tactics, but Storms is really fucking boring, and making the last Diaku spawn so we can flag a group is semi annoying.  It's definitely doable, but not real high on my list for 2 ac and 10hp.<br />
<br />
Ditto for the rest of the quests.  My time is more productive elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Haas, what you need is an instanced server.  <br />
<br />
This is definitely true.  If SoE released software that would allow this game to be played over a LAN, or hosted server...even if it were only a few zones at a time...I'd fuckin pay 50 bucks for that.  Keep everything the same..week long spawns, ridiculous camps and quests, as long as you get all of the fucking people out of my way, I'd be a happy man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, if you look at it as a 2AC, 10 hp, +1 to all stats for everyone in your group, it's pretty worthwhile. Tactics alternate entry quest is much easier to do then, say HoH. Crypt of Decay alternate entry quest is fairly doable too, but it's probably faster to do a /shout LFG 12 other people to take out Grummus.<br />
<br />
I did the Tactics alt entry quest 3 times, flagged 14 people. Three or four were alts; we'd have two people loot medallions to try and use up some of the duplicates. About six hours or so total, we never had more then six people exping in the desert at a time.</div></div><hr />
