It is a bit confusing the way he tells it, to be honest.<br />

<br />
Anyhow, I figure this was the perfect time to ask him to acknowledge our class board. I know he will read the post, I don't really believe in a reply. Who knows?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, this is what I posted, I figure I better copy it here before it is deleted by some evil wizard admin.<br />
<br />
 Wow, it is pretty neat to see Absor post stuff on a class board. I invite you to visit my class board @ http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/index.php</div></div><hr />

Click on members in the top right, look down the &quot;A&quot; list, and you see someone named AbsorEQ.  Here's a link to it, where it shows he has posted once.<br />

Not an avid poster for sure, but he has recognized that this is the warrior board now.  It would be nice if he would make his presence a bit more known, and do the same to inform us of happenings that he does for some other classes, but truthfully the maturity level of this board has dropped substancially.  Combine that with a very stressful and angering situation for most warriors and you are left with a population that is difficult to deal with.  I know that if I was in his place, this definately wouldn't be my favorite place to visit.  /shrug, just my opinion</div></div><hr />

He's a PR guy, he has zero say in what goes into the game.  All he does is take suggestions that players made (Lets say...broken doors in freeport) and tell them to the devs and then they decide whether they want to fix it or not (in the case of broken doors, yes).<br />
<br />
There is only two possible scenarios going on.  The Devs either already know what is going on with warriors and don't give a shit, or they don't know how their game works and don't give a shit.  Either is equally possible at this point.<br />

Furor linked this item on the FOH boards...you tell me what you think of the people who make this game now --- <br />

<br />
Typed in a 112 in the &quot;effect 1&quot; field instead of 121... or something along those lines.<br />
<br />
The item designers may not understand what the warrior community wants or needs, but I would expect that they are competent enough to know what skills apply to a class.  Poor QA for sure though...</div></div><hr />

He posted like 4 times in the same thread there and was very patient w/ the confused wizards, and some of them even seemed pretty rude about it.<br />
<br />
I figure just let him know we still got questions too. It is a bit of a boost to the morale when someone from SoE posts here, even if he says things we don't want to hear it shows that they check us out. Either way, i just figured I would speak up a bit, politely.</div></div><hr />

Whats wrong with those boots taunt mod and stun resist?  <br />
<br />
It used to be round kick.<br />
<br />
I thought it was a bug and supposed to be normal kick heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just read that thread. I can see why people are getting confused.<br />
<br />
Absor uses the word THEME, but does not explain his meaning of the word. I think just explaining that would spell it out better...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 5 dungeon themes. From those 5 themes we've made more than 40 dungeons. Each of those dungeons can be &quot;instanced&quot; and filled with different populations depending on level and the type of adventure.<br />
<br />
Absor said that. And it's easy to comprehend.<br />
<br />
Next post says:<br />
<br />
So are there 200 areas (40*5) or 40 areas (5*8)?<br />
<br />
Which makes me think, wtf?~</div></div><hr />
