<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's a stun so yep. not as good as 4 procs but it will work. since you can't realy ever use it for dps why not.<br />
<br />
if you havent done the quest yet the living stone lancet would be better for agro since you could dw and get 4 procs.<br />
<br />
either one would be great though and up to you how you feel about dw vs. 2h</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taarna Sunseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was thinking about doing this quest also.  The only problem is that I read somewhere on the Safehouse that it does not have any augment slots.  That is the sole reason I haven't even attempted starting this quest as it would be a lot of work for something I wouldn't use (since no anger 3 augment).<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this quest and can confirm if an augment slot exists?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't make this quest, but without proc, it should be already under the GSoT (and above the GSo4W) so if you can get a GSoT, then go for it cause it's a better aggro weapon and that you are sure to be able to aug it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sandro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I prefer 2h over dw and bow isent exactly something im gonna see heh. I looked it up on lucy and it does not appear to have any aug slot... If thats the case I'm not gonna bother with the quest.</div></div><hr />
