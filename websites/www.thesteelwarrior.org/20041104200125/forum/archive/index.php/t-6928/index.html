<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>psmoses</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have already known that the spawn time of pre-palacekey gate is 30minutes.<br />
And the spawn time of the hall between prepalacekey door and northkey door is also 30miniutes.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know the detail spawn time of each wing to tvx and that of the places behind the northkey door such as blob1 and dxx, dxxt. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
All named are right about 6 days +/- 12 hours.  The only exceptions to this are the TVXs, which are 3 day spawn times.  Usually, however, once you see Blob1, they start popping in consectutive order they were killed very shortly after (like they're linked).  If you kill Blob1 and DXXT isn't up yet, then 99% of the time he will have popped by the time you clear to him.</div></div><hr />
