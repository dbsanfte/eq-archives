<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">loganstorm</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in my 36th season as a Barbarian Warrior and really never worried about plat. But now as I am getting into the high mid levels I know I will need some good money to buy some better equipment. I did go to the aqua goblin camp in BB a few times but thats about it. I have heard they are closed now and do not offer the same loot for plat. Where can a warrior go fo good plat at my level. Im looking to update all my equipment so i will need some real plat to do it. any suggestions will be helpful.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately as a class I dont think we have any means of making great plat in the way that other classes do.  But if you are in dire need of cash heres a couple of things you could try:<br />
<br />
Fine Steel weapons: Find a dungeon you can solo in reasonably successfully and collect back packs of fine steel weapons to sell at a vendor.  Best to go somewhere like runny eye where vendors are only 1 zone away.<br />
<br />
Hill Giants: Might need a healer for these guys at your level, and could be hard competing with tracking classes, but they drop the best plat per mob you can find.<br />
<br />
Tradeskill supplies: Plenty of rich tradeskillers out there either working their skill up for trade skill quests or to make funky items or just cos they are bored.  Lots of these guys can't be bothered farming the things they need for tradeskills so try farming them for them to sell in the bazaar.  Some good ones are:<br />
- Leather padding (Spiderling silks and low quality pelts) Blacksmiths love to buy these by the stack.<br />
- Velium blocks (from Cystal Caverns) Need lots of these for the 8th Shawl<br />
- Acrylia blocks - time consuming to farm so can charge a good price for these<br />
<br />
Edit - another thought...<br />
Mammoth tusks from everfrost sell for a decent amount of plat and are probably solo-able easily at your level.  Will you're there you can also offer to be a 'banker' for people hunting the ice giants - you give them 50pp and they give you 590gp, 700sp, 3000cp and half a dozen FS weapons kinda deal.</div></div><hr />

There are merchants and a banker inside runny eye, it's very convenient.</div></div><hr />

You can fix this faction by hunting in the Gorge next door though killing muddites and Minotaurs and possibly evil eyes (not sure on eyes).<br />
<br />
The evil eyes aren't bad as well as they drop minor gems and items that sell for several pp each and are a 6 minute spawn with two spawn points.  So one eye every 3 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />

I always forget that other warriors don't have hide and sneak too. :( <br />
<br />
Another good place to get money at that level is probably the lizards outside of CT, but you would probably need to bring a friend or two to help.</div></div><hr />
