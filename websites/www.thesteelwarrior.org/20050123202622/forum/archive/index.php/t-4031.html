<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teldarr</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so GBoS has Slot 1, type 4 for augment.  I know I saw this somewhere, but what does that mean exactly? <br />
<br />
 I'm wanting to get an anger aug for it, but since I need kinda quick I was going to settle for anger 2.  Now I saw on the LDoN merchant list that BB has an anger 2 augment.  I decided to go for that since its easiest to get a group there.  Upon further looking at the list (http://www.rpgexpert.com/330.html) I noticed that the anger 2 from BB is &quot;aug 8&quot; whereas the one from everfrost is &quot;aug 4&quot;<br />
<br />
So I look at my GBoS and see type 4.  Question is am I screwed over with BB aug or no?  And what exactly does slot x, type x mean anway -_-</div></div><hr />

Will just answer the question no coments :D <br />
<br />
In a type 4 slot u can only add type 4 augments. Most 1h weapon have a slot 4.<br />
<br />
In a type 8 slot u can only add type 8 augments. (dejavu?) Most 2h weapon have slot 8.<br />
<br />
Now each piece of equipment can have up to 3 slots that are named slot 1,2 and 3 if present. Every &quot;old&quot; (aka pre LDoN) equipment will have only one slot while purchased LDoN equipment usually have 3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, that was some pretty fast misinformation. The types must match, for sure, but type 8 is Plane of Time items, NOT 2 handed weapons. All pre-time weapons, minus a few special items (primal for one), are type 4. The slots are just the specific spot for an augment of that type. IE a weapon could have slot 1 type 4 and slot 2 type 6. So basically, yes, you're screwed for the hate augment. You need to go to Everfrost and run missions there for anger 2.<br />
<br />
EDIT: spelling is for wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The BB anger aug is type 8, only PoTime gear has type 8 slots ( 1h or 2h makes no difference ). You need the one from everfrost to use with your GBoS.</div></div><hr />
