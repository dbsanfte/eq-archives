Some of that crap is straight from Star Wars Galaxies ...<br />
<br />
Yet in SWG, it's FREE as part of the interface.<br />
<br />
So now we get, REGULAR XP ... GROUP XP ... RAID XP ... where we have to acquire points to buy NEW AAs ... Raid Leader Abilities ... Group Leader Abilities ... and the whole time we're still acquiring ADVENTURE POINTS.<br />
<br />
How many slices is my XP pie going to have to have? 16?<br />
<br />
That's getting perilously close to being a game I don't want to play, simply because I can't ever make any headway. Kill a mob, and have its XP go into 25 different pools, bit by agonizing bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The amount of hoykeys required for our balancing combined with all this stuff is staggering. I barely have enough room on my first bank of keys to exp group, and I sometimes have to swap between banks during raids. <br />
<br />
I just hope they give new selector buttons for all this stuff. Also, I pity the new people coming into the game. I've been playing for over 4 years now, and this will take me a while to get used to.</div></div><hr />
