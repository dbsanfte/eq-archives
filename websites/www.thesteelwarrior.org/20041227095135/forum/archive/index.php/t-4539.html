<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuggditup</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I've been having a bit of trouble with the beginning quest in Gukta. Basically, I've been running around doing all of the tasks but I'm stuck at this point. Any info on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm not even sure what the reward is, but it seems this is linear and I can't progress without this.<br />
<br />
***Zok Gribbl says 'I was wondering if you were ever going to show up, it's about time. I am Gribbl, one of the resident blacksmiths here in Gukta. Blacksmithing is one of the more challenging, but ultimately rewarding professions one can choose. I'm always looking for new ways to cure and accentuate my armor, and I have recently found that certain fungus remains can add a great deal to the way a piece of armor looks. That is to be your training from me: to seek out and retrieve some fungus remains and return them to me so that I can further my processes. Hurry along, this is most crucial.' ***<br />
<br />
Now, I have tried: <br />
<br />
*liquid fungus <br />
*a spore mushroom <br />
*black fungus (paraphrase) <br />
*ball of (something) fungus <br />
*fungus spores <br />
and about 6 other things all throughout Gukta that I've bought and gone back with. NOTHING IS WORKING. <br />
<br />
I find it astounding that none of this 'newbie' quest stuff is listed anywhere on the net. I've done about an hour of searching and I can't find squat about how this goes I've heard people mention I'll have to kill some troll later, but again, the rundown is not detailed anywhere. <br />
<br />
Thanks and I hope someone can help!</div></div><hr />
