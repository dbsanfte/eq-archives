<br />
Yes 5. <br />
<br />
With absolute maxxed taunt skill, against one of the Diablos in VT a few nights back. I was utterly disgusted. I always suspected taunt button was less reliable than the Hindenburg near naked flame, but 5 in a row is really silly.<br />
<br />
You know, if Sony just made the taunt button work a whole lot better there may have been no need for endurance skills like Incite etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lirelle</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't fight anywhere on par the mobs that everyone else does (being only lvl 37), but last night in DSP I failed quite a bit.  One streak was 6, one streak went 8, and the rest seemed to be about every 3rd or 4th.<br />
<br />
It just amazes me how SOE continues to make Warriors rely on the RNG so much.  I can't think of a single thing that we do that doesn't rely on it.  Heck even tanking relies on it as far as determining how much dmg the mob is doing per hit.  <br />
<br />
It seems to me (from my limited exp) that the RNG is the boon or bane of the warriors existance.  Get a good streak and things can be gravy, but land a bad one and even greenies slaughter you.<br />
<br />
Man, what a rush.  Living and breathing off of something that you have absolutely no control over.  I guess its a good sign that I love to play my warrior when I see the RNG not only annoying as heck, but also as a rush.  Come on all, admit it, while we all hate being so dependent on it, we all secretly love the tingle in the back of your spine you get when waiting on that much needed proc, taunt, or crit.<br />
<br />
I guess that's what separates the true warriors from the fluff, choosing to stick out that tingle and risk dying, cause that's just your job.  And by the way, try not to beg for a heal when your sweating it out at 5% life left, it's really not becomming :D .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually, it's just a fairly even trade-off between successes and failures (there's prolly more failures overall, like 60/40 split), but there are certainly streaks in the system.</div></div><hr />

SOE - PLEASE PAY ATTENTION ------------------&gt; FIX TAUNT TO WORK A LOT MORE OFTEN PLEASE. If you fixed taunt, you may not have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on developer research on an additional taunt tool for Warriros, not to mention the costs for coding, testing, debugging etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen that happen too even with trying to taunt off a caster who didn't hit the mob with spell after I taunted, hasn't DoTed the mob, and didn't just try to sit down.  If taunt works, it should put me just above that caster on the hate list immediately.  But every now and then, despite all the conditions I just mentioned, the mob doesn't turn.  I wonder why?</div></div><hr />

That is almost certainly due to mob level, i purposely used taunt every time it refreshed when tanking Pyronis and Blazzax this weekend.   I managed 3 succesfull taunts out of 37 clicks. :/<br />
<br />
My experience so far now that we can see failures is that Taunt has around a 25-35% success rate on blue cons.  That is pretty sad.</div></div><hr />

What I find extremely interesting is that some ranger friends of mine were saying that they succeed like 90% of the time when taunting... Something I find very odd there, dont have any parses but will see what more I can learn.</div></div><hr />

Odd...  So far, I parse out to 2365 taunt attempts, with 999 failures, so that's 58% success.  Clearly I am the uber taunter. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I am curious...some of these posts did indicate that the failed taunt streak was when they didn't already have aggro, but some didn't indicate one way or the other.<br />
<br />
I know there was some debate some time back as to whether Taunt should be hit every time it pops or not (I follow the NOT theory).  So I ask some of you with long fail streaks....are you taunting while you already have aggro?  On the occasions where I have hit taunt while I already had aggro (Like when the shammy canni's without saying anything and I think for a half-second that I've lost aggro and twitch and hit taunt) I consistenly get a failed taunt message.   <br />
<br />
I have also had the occasional &quot;Successful&quot; taunt where the mob didn't turn back to me.  Personally, I think the notification is just as broken as the taunt function itself. (which is why I ignore it...it doesn't tell me if I have aggro or not...only the mob smacking me can tell me that)</div></div><hr />

The ranger was lvl 12-14 and fighting avocets and all sorts of other red con mobs.  My taunt started at 1 and went to 27 skill.  Strangely I almost never got a taunt failure message.  I am unsure if I had been successful or not all of the other times.    In four hours i probably had 3 messages saying taunt failed.  And all fights were against redcon mobs.<br />
<br />
If it was successful all the other times it is strange that taunt becomes so unreliable at high levels.</div></div><hr />

Tanking in UP a few nights ago I noticed a mob didnt turn on a success too - this was after a run of 10 failures<br />

very strange and a little annoying :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being in an LDoN hard adventure and having to wait 30 seconds for 5 failed taunts before you can break mez and attack something is totally lame.  Incite isn't enough because it will ALWAYS be slowed and thus have a lot more hate against the caster than a wimpy incite will do.  So you end up wasting a ton of time, when a hybrid could just grab aggro instantly and keep the DPS going....<br />
<br />
It happens all the time and is real frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys claiming 70-90% failure rate need to do some parsing.  5 failed taunts in a row is extremely frustrating, but it is also very rare on blue-cons at least.  I also have a hard time believing these 20+ taunt failure claims.  Not to say that it couldn't happen, but considering how rarely you actually taunt something 20 times in a row, it seems unlikely that you would get a streak like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think one of the reasons that a MOB sometimes do not turn to you on a Taunt success, is that the person it's wailing at have a larger Hate modifier than you, so while you may have as much Hate as him, your modifier is still lower - Which means that you are probably close in aggro and will get it's attention a few hits after theTaunt success.<br />
<br />
Y'know .... Aggro = (Pure Hate + Hate from Damage) *Aggro Modifier<br />
<br />
Pure hate = Hate Procs, Hate spells, Provoke Line.<br />
Hate form Damage = DUH .. from damage and the likes.<br />
Aggro Modifier = Sitting Down, Low Health, Current Target, and whatever other modifiers there may be.<br />

Quite possible - Though I have seen no conclusive parses / maths on those.<br />
But then, they are also a hard thing to quantify.<br />

Either way, doesn't really matter if it's a multiplication or addition, it's problems for us either way.</div></div><hr />

That is 78.9% of taunts failed!! :eek:<br />
<br />
USually 4-5 taunts on mob inc failed...I got success with mob at 40% health on average..<br />
<br />
Only thing that kept me agro was BOW with anger aug and incite..<br />
<br />
No wonder there was no taunt message before these became available</div></div><hr />

I had aggro the entire time but wanted to see if I could get a successful taunt. Never happened. <br />

On high reds, taunts are bullshit. On high blues I get about a 30% success rate.<br />
<br />
One time, being bored in POV I tested the 10% taunt mod I had on the helmet from Grieg's end. Used Worms in POV that were not aggroed and hit taunt until it aggroed. I got about 30% success without it and 35% with the mod. I hit taunt about 70-80 times each test, so results arent exactly the most reliable but was enough to satisfy me that the taunt mod is worth having but not at the expense of HP, armor, stats.</div></div><hr />

Red cons i'm gonna guess success rates are going to be bout the 10% or less range, not even going to bother parsing that crap.</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't your success rate be dependant on how high your taunt skill is? To have a maxed skill and then to have 7 (or more) failed in a row is just f'ing stupid. Why bother have the skill to increase if its just gonna fail 70% of the time?  This needs to be fixed and until it is fixed, revert back to the way it was before when you didnt see any failed messages. It's just GD depressing and I find myself getting pissed every time i see 3-4 failed in a row. <br />
Doesn't add any &quot;Fun&quot; to playing the warrior class. <br />
