<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if these have been posted yet cause I've been out of town for a bit but looking on lucy there's some nice new weapons coming out of most likely chardokb/droga that fill in the gap between WC/FB/epics and TB/EB weapons, especially new one handers with 0.0 sec stuns sound real nice similar to GSoT(planar stun) but one handed, could work well I'd assume.  Here's a few:<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62188) <br />
<br />
Sarnak Spine Dagger  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=55201) <br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62186) <br />
<br />
All look like promising weapons with nice ratios/stats but sort of a pain cause most are ranger/rogue usable, but provided they aren't that difficult to obtain(guessing one groupable like Veksar type deal) these could provide a nice upgrade for the people wielding WC/FB type combo and looking for an upgrade lacking the force to obtain TB/EB weapons or just the rarity of finding a GSoT on their server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used the sword of the bloodsworn for a couple months until the other night when I got a GBoS.  Very nice weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balthizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use the greatblade of storms and the copper hammer of striking changing it back and forth with my primal for  avatar and have to say the combo rocks for aggro I am very impressed with the hammer and will vouch for it. I bought the hammer for 30k today in the bazaar was wanting to give it a try figured it was worth it and im glad i did. I heard the hammer drops off King Dronan in Droga or something like that. If anyone can confirm this plz post it as many other friends of mine would like the hammer for offhand being that its all/all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A friend of mine obtained that hammer today and said he got it from the King in Droga which was one groupable with the right lvls/classes.

I figured it was a new item with revamps but I guess not.</div></div><hr />

Means it wont physically stun them, but the aggro generation is equally the same regardless if it lands / resists / does not take effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did have a 65 Shammy in the group and I am not sure if they were massively debuffing the mob, even if they were 1/2 procs during a fight was enough to keep the mob glued to me. Also had a 57 Rogue with nice gear and they commented on my excellent taunt.<br />
<br />
Let me know who else has used this weapon and if you found it to be better than GoT for taunt also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why is SoE throwing us these piercing weapons now all the sudden?  I know the 240 cap actually makes little difference compaired to 250, but come on, just make it 250!  :P<br />
<br />
Yes, I use Nevederia's Horn (Piercer - 10/15 20ac Procs 75dd -20str -20agi 11dmg/tick Debuff/DoT) in my offhand and it's actually a mighty fine agro weapon.  Lady Nev, however, is pretty freaking hard and NOT one groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't know if they're necessarily throwing us piercing weapons, if you look at that dagger it has a +backstab mod with a bunch of other usable classes on the list.  All the weapons above are usable by various other classes which could be annoying when rogues/rangers start picking up these weapons, but eh hopefully they just refrain from them cause they realize how much aggro they would draw.  I still have to talk to my friend about how the hammer worked for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Back to the Droga weapons, has anyone herd input on how agro works on them?<br />
<br />
Part of the reasons SoD generate so much agro is cause 288 dam + stun. <br />
<br />
Anarchy also comes with added 400 HATE(what ever that is) so these will not be as good as SoD but still curious as to how good they are.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 273 (L34) to 288 (L39) <br />
2:  Stun(0.00 sec) <br />
 <br />
Does not add 400 hate.  The droga weapons (or the sword anyway) is a very good aggro weapon...not as good as an SoD, but decent dps, solid proc...pretty good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Server economies differ and all, but I the average price on BCA on Innoruuk has already dropped to about 200pp, so you may be able to get one fairly cheaply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Balthizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can say the Greatblade of Storms and the Copper Hammer of Striking together are good solid aggro that I have noticed. Im very happy with these 2 weapons especially when i have avatar on me its like a proc fest. I would say the aggro is right below 2 SoDs but having the Greatblade of Storms is more DPS aggro as far as pure damage cause its 14/18. I dont think anyone would be disappointed with either of these weapons.</div></div><hr />

I was able to pull taunt with a single Hammer procs right after 2 EB procs from the other warrior.  Continually throughout the night it was snagging agro as soon as it would proc.  Need more testing but it seems like an excellent agro wep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rubbish. Its stun + dd. Phat agro but no direct hate :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ranna Swiftpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's rather low aggro as it's also only a tier 1 PoP rogue made poison.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2411&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
<br />
The tier 2 (which is also the Stanos pants right click) has a higher DD component (75) and even on a crit, is low aggro.<br />
<br />
In general, the highest aggro PoP poison I've used is Rage of Incapacitation (-60dex, -150 aggro) which tends to get resisted so much it's darned near worthless.  ALL of the DD poisons they added are so low, you can use them all the time without worry.<br />
<br />
You can try it, but I'm willing to bet Frostbringer will get better results, and a Yak will definitely grab aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
I messed around with Gomdurig on both my rogue, and my warrior in offhand, and I wasn't too impressed.  The proc rate was low (that's with max haste and a bard in group no less), though it did stick on SolRo mobs.  I didn't bother getting the Sarnak Spine Dagger because it's really aimed more for rogues or rangers.  It's not as much aggro as you think. <br />
<br />
<br />
Of those listed, the Sword of the Bloodsworn, and the Copper Hammer of Striking get my vote.  I've XPed on my rogue with warriors using a GBoS + Hategiver combo.  I can draw aggro easily, but I can lose it easily as well.  If the tank had the dagger, I'd go look for another group.  Even one with a poorly equipped knight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amazingly (to me at least) the price on hammer has plummetted in the past couple of days on E.Marr. been available for 28k all day today. I paid 40 a couple days ago and thought I scored a mammoth deal :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I got the 1h sarnak daggar last night.  I'd put the proc rate on par with the frostbringer in the off hand.  stun &gt; debuff.  Helluva an upgrade from the frosty.  with a sarnak warhammar in my main hand in the dagger in my off i have no problems with aggro.  of course if someone just WANTS to get beat on, they can do that still =O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Rubbish. Its stun + dd. Phat agro but no direct hate <br />
<br />
The listed proc use to show 400 hate. I can quote min close to dozen other posts from various messages boards to this effect.<br />
<br />
I will not speculate as to why it was changed but anyone who has played an enchanter and wiz classs knows Anarchy has WAAAYYYY more agro than any of the Wizzie dd+stun line.<br />
<br />
Maybe this was removed I do not know. <br />
<br />
It was changed in the last two-three months (last time I saw it listed was about April or so when I was thinking about buying SoD and it showed 400 hate).<br />
<br />
If the hate effect was removed I would like to know cause the price on SoD would plumett greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have the copper hammer, it procs ok and the agro is damn insane.<br />
<br />
Having seen a SoD in action long time ago I am not sure, but it appears to be equal to it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">About the Sarnak Spine Dagger, I put that on my rogues offhand.  Procs do generate a bit of hate, but not too much.  I didn't have to evade much more than normal.  Also, the proc rate seemed a bit low on it, only procing once every other mob about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Just to dispell any thoughts ya'll might have about how uber the hammer is now, the SoD still blows it away...both in DPS and aggro.  The hammer proc is resisted far too much, and while it still generates aggro on resist, the aggro isn't quite as solid as SoD aggro.<br />
<br />
It's still leaps and bounds ahead of what we had 2 weeks ago for weapons tho..which is the fuckin frostbringer and a crafted yak.  Good quality weapon, but not top of the line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Anarchy has never had +hate attached to it:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=71&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
If the SoD had +400 hate in addition to a stun+288dd it would still be the weapon of choice for any warrior without a RZ blade from Time.<br />
<br />
Just curious Haass, why would the hammer be more resisted than SoD? Neither has a beneficial resist check. I do agree however that the SoD is better purely because it will have higher DPS due to ratio and more damage per proc. The difference in agro between an SoD and a CHoS will be the difference in DPS and proc rate don't you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly have no clue...I dual wielded SoD/CHoS for a day and I think I saw about 4 procs from the Hammer total land, whereas SoD landed damned near every time.  SoD also seems to proc more than the hammer too.<br />
<br />
It could be a leftover relic from a time when Enchanters NPC supposedly had an innate bonus to having their spells land.  Remember when Enc NPC's could charm a level 60 PC no frigging problem, no matter what?  Could be the same thing.  I can definitely tell ya tho that Anarchy gets resisted WAY less than the force shock does.  Why it does, i don't know, but it definitely does.  I passed down my CHoS to the next warrior in my guild, and I didn't see many procs from him land when we did the rounds in ToV that nite either..but there was plenty of Anarchy going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">resisted too much?

<br />
I'm guessing your slower was tashing/malo'ing.  My shaman doesn't malo anything in droga, and the resist rate between Anarchy and Force Shock is VERY apparant.<br />
<br />
Even so, the resist rate on anarchy there is FAR less than 20%.  Probably under 5.  I actually see more resisted slows from my shaman than I see resisted Anarchy's/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">yes, a 52 shaman has to malo to slow in droga :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ya, see...you got a debuffed mob, you could land anything on it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Unless you're gonna parse it for a week I don't buy that it's resisted more.  It's easy to see resist adjustments in Lucy, and force shock doesn't have one.  I use a GBoS mainhand (same proc) and SoD offhand and I don't notice any difference in resists.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't argue that the SoD is better than the hammer though, it's faster, better ratio, bigger DD on the proc.  That's a better weapon.  It's probably not a huge upgrade though.  <br />
<br />
I have tried swapping the GBoS around and from what I can tell 14/18, 179 DD + stun &gt; 12/18 288DD + stun for both aggro and DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">well I got to use the Copper for a few hours today in veksar.<br />
great zone btw for mid 50 fighting, many go to PoN for that, we wont again. The mobs in there have roughly 1k hp less on warrior mobs, and up to 3k hp less on caster mobs compared to the standard blood ravens in PoN.<br />
<br />
However, my DPS got upgraded from 27-32 to roughly 38-45, and I barely EVER lost agro with it througout the fight, parsing summons (everything there summons) most of the time I was summoned due to repositioning, a few times the shaman, the cleric ONCE in 4 hours of fighting.<br />
<br />
actually the resist ratio was 498hits to 42 resists (92%)<br />
no idea how many of that were pique and forceshock :P<br />
<br />
<br />
oh this is sad. total damage by myself, 56 war was 350k, the 55 monk was at 308k :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Is there any reason to prefer the copper hammer over the sword of the bloodsworn? I guess the proc is more DD and affects a wider range of mobs? And I suppose 13/20 is slightly better than 12/19. Do these differences actually mean anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I prefer the copper hammer because.. you know... I have one.<br />
<br />
Also forget everything I parsed about resists and stuff, the enchanter kept me under pemanent garoo.. I have like 200+ hits unresistable lifetap in that parse :/<br />
<br />
<br />
And well if I had a bloodsworn I would have it mainhand :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Got a parser that can read resists Brutul?  I'd be happy to try it.  Don't need my BoC for XP groups anyway.<br />
<br />
I just can't find a parser that is useful in any way, shape or form to read spell damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">This may be contrary to what some of you may be thinking, but I think the Hammer is a better weapon than the Bloodsworn. It has a slightly better ratio and the DD portion of the proc does over 100 more damage. Sure the planar stun will land on higher level mobs, but in this case the agro difference between a resisted stun and one that lands is basically negligible (keep in mind that Force Shock is a wizard spell, I cast this spell thousands of times levelling up back in the day.)<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget that the stun and the DD portions of the procs are on seperate resist checks, so the DD portion can still land on an mob that is stun immune.<br />
<br />
I was going to get a sword to go with my hammer (the hammer is considerably easier to get), but I got my hands on a dragon rib club. I think I will give this combo a shot before I spend the time camping Droga for a sword.<br />
<br />
The more I use the hammer, the more I like it. The proc rate is better than GSoT and it produces very good agro. I spent several hours in Chardok and ChardokB last night tanking for a group of 65s and I had very little agro problems, even with the enchanter slowing very early in the fight. I was also able to get agro away from the healer and chanter when they would get adds stuck to them. A single proc would turn the mob, and in the event that I didn't get a fast proc, the DPS took over rather quickly.<br />
<br />
It may not be an SoD, but it's damn close.<br />
<br />
I would say that:<br />
<br />
GSoT &lt; Bloodsworn &lt; Copper Hammer &lt; SoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Oh, don't get me wrong, it's pretty damned awesome, but as usual, we got an itemization issue.  It can never be balanced correctly from the start, SoE has to fuck it up.<br />
<br />
Now you've got a hammer that's one rung down from a SoD for under 30k in the bazaar, and it's only gonna drop furher.  Windblade all over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Got the hammer last night. Way to easy of a camp if ya ask me but..../shrug  Seemed to proc at a good rate. The hammer will be very cheap soon with the difficulty of obtaining it. We couldn't have been there more than 45 minutes. Being an all/all droppable it will definitely replace the WB on the most wielded list i would imagine. Maybe not since it's a 1hb.
