<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dexie</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made this (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=29326.topic) post on The Safehouse regarding an idea for changing EQ's discipline system.<br />
<br />
Here is the thread quoted, let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
Proposal for discipline system:<br />
=======================<br />
<br />
*Remove duration and re-use limits from all disciplines.<br />
<br />
*Make all disciplines stack. (with penalties, see below)<br />
<br />
*Add new low-cost +ATK disc<br />
<br />
*Add new high-cost +ATK disc for burst DPS (much more +ATK)<br />
<br />
*END use scales with player actions (less used while sitting, more while in combat)<br />
<br />
*Special attacks/abilities (i.e. Flying Kick, Bash, Backstab) instantly remove an amount of END based on a fixed number (unique per ability) times END use per second at the time that ability was activated. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ideas to change current discs:<br />
=======================<br />
note to SteelWarrior: my primary character is a Rogue<br />
<br />
*Focused/Healing Will should work in-combat.<br />
<br />
*Remove Twisted Chance's &quot;deadeye&quot; component and raise crit rate to 100%<br />
<br />
*Discipilnes should not break hide/sneak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion / Summary of ideas:<br />
=======================<br />
*Pure Melee will be able to 'throttle' DPS/tanking, reducing dependancy on high-uptime scenarios<br />
<br />
*Pure Melee have true 'combat' advantages over other classes.<br />
<br />
*Melee power and these new abilities can be balanced very easily by adjusting END per second costs of discs.<br />
<br />
*Disc stacking can provide impressive 'variable' power to Pure Melees, while easily balanced via END/sec cost penalties which increase per disc active beyond 1. <br />
Thanks for reading! Please consider /feedback if you like these ideas.<br />

<br />
And maybe a lessor endurance cost too. I can get a rez and use this with my 58% or so endurance left at that point and get to about 56% health before it fades around the time my end bar does. It's really quite worthless in its current form when I would be better in a group waiting for the cleric to get 400 mana and being able to click on defense while they med up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dexie</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In other forums, the point was brought up that the 'throttle-ability' melee would receive via this would step on the toes of Wizards. I feel it's important to address this point here as well.<br />
<br />
Even for a backstabbing Rogue, running at &quot;Wizard-level&quot; DPS would run us OOE much faster than a Wizard doing comparable damage runs OOM. Of course this is extremely gear dependant, but I'd like to emphasize that balancing these would be as simple as modifying the END/sec cost of the discs under the proposed system. <br />
<br />
BTW, totally agree, Firth, my idea is that HW should restore a fixed % of your total HP, similar to Monk Mend.<br />
<br />
Actually, 25% doesn't seem all that unreasonable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have some interesting ideas. Though it's hard for me to imagine the devs springing for another reworking of the discipline system, with the way disciplines and melee skills are implemented now the changes required for something like what you're proposing wouldn't really be all that drastic. Change some stacking variables here, adjust duration and endurance costs there and voila!<br />
<br />
With everything completely unhooked and stackable and all, the endurance costs vs. endurance pool vs. endurance regen would make for a monumental balancing act though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dexie</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the key to balancing it is in the exponentially-increasing END cost penalty for stacking multiple discs. For example... let's say a Warrior can use &quot;defensive&quot; for 5mins before he is OOE and he can use &quot;fellstrike&quot; for 45seconds. If there were no penalty, stacking these 2 disciplines would probably burn up all of your END in about 30-35 seconds. WITH a penalty, it would burn all of it up in ~20 seconds.<br />
<br />
So sure, you can stack aggressive, riposte and fellstrike all at once, but you're going to burn all of your END in just a few seconds... So yes, you have the ability to be a &quot;hero&quot; and really go into an ass-kicking berzerker rage, and you can do so without being ridiculously overpowered, as the short duration limits the &quot;overall&quot; impact on the group/raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fabel</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea. plus:<br />
<br />
* I want some new discs with every expansion same way casters get spells<br />
<br />
* I want to go to Pok and  /ooc Any End3? or /ooc Any End5? in the same way casters /ooc Any C3?<br />
 <br />
* I want to solo like a Magi/Necro/Bard/Chanter/... Dont wanna be the best just wanna be able of.<br />
<br />
Did you try ever at lvl 55 to solo a Pile of Bile in PoD? I did, man gotta love RS3<br />
<br />
I can go to Velks, kill some spiders.. 1? 2? 3? highly dependant on gear... bind wounds til 50% and then sit forever.... How many spiders has my Magi friend killed by then with his C3? or C5?<br />
<br />
I bet rogues would love it too, even monks altougth they at least got FD and Mend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there are some good ideas but incorporating all of them would be unbalnacing.<br />
<br />
I particularly like removing re-use timers; the key constraint on disc use should be END nothing else.  IMHO if a player wants to blow all their END in 1 min so be it...there are downsides to it as well.<br />
<br />
I disagree on healing will in combat; unless it adds a susceptability to being hit (otherwise it becomes a skill with no downside).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dexie</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a skill with no downsideEndurance drain, of course :)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking many of these would have variable costs for different actions (standing, sitting, running, fighting) you could make it so healing will consumes a disproportionately large amount of END while fighting...</div></div><hr />
