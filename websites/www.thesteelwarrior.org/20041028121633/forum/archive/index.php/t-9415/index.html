<br />
Which would you mainhand ?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll be mainhanding the epic 1.5 as soon as I complete it(only dragorn champion and Krekk to go). The bloodfrenzy may proc a bit more, but the FAR superior ratio of the epic will outaggro the BF in any situation with 2xA3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i'd have to see both parses...i think either way it's a win/win tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It'd be damn close ... and you get more dps w/ the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Main hand the cooler looking one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bloodfrenzy &gt; Epic in looks :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Epic looks like shit  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Does the epic have a proc modifier like the bloodfrenzy?  I'd take the bloodfrenzy mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even if it had an innate proc mod, it doesn't affect the augs and there is no innate proc on it, so it wouldn't matter (unless they've discovered a way to get it to affect them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the opinions...<br />
I tried both and mobs didn't seem to be too impressed with the epic mainhanded.<br />
<br />
When waiting the usual amount of time my bud's chanter and shammy were<br />
back to pulling aggro with debuffs like when i was chos/sotb.<br />
<br />
The almost always earlier procs when I mainhand the BF, off-hand the epic,<br />
and use AHR gloves won out over the epic ratio and 2xAug slots.  I guess it's<br />
hard to argue with 20 delay and a proc mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, I'd go BF mainhand.Epic with two augs sounds decent too tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drozan_RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I will be in this same dilemna here soon I hope. I use BF mainhand atm and normally have no probs with debuffs goin in early.  Quick suggestion to see what you folks think about this. (I plan to get my epic soon I hope)  Maybe put duel 125 yak procs in the epic and switch it to mainhand once you solidify agro at the start. I would think the better ratio of the epic and 2 of the nice dd procs might up your Dps without hurting your agro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barangi~E'ci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Been using Epic 1.5 mainhand since I got it dual aug'ed and like it alot. Never had a Bloodfrenzy, so can't say if that would be a better choice in main hand aggro-wise, but the higher delay works wonders for ripostes, as in alot less of them.<br />
<br />
Sure, if I don't get a proc early on, the aggro isn't massive, but that's where Incite comes in handy.<br />
<br />
Currently using Hategiver in off-hand, but hoping find a suitable upgrade soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bloodfrenzy main. <br />
<br />
besides, im left handed the cooler looking weapon always goes in secondary :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">id go bloodfrenzy mainhand unless you have a problem with reposte damage. the combat effects on the bf would go off way more due to the proc rate increase on the item.<br />
<br />
either way its a win/win id say though. I use a CHSD  with a sludge covered shorty offhand, both with only anger2, and i have no agro problems on raids or else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have neither but i would consider them close enough that its pretty toMAYto toMAHto ... either will work pretty much equally imo ... /shrug.  Only time the BF is gonna help you hold aggro better through initial debuffs is when the extra 1 proc per minute happens to land in the first few critical seconds.  With as many procs as you have running constantly ... it shouldnt really be an issue.  No matter which one you mainhand, ideally you'll be getting a strong proc within the first 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
BF probably is more aggro over time, but not to a degree that it would matter most situations.  They're both very fine weapons.<br />
<br />
Shame the epic is so f'ugly  :(</div></div><hr />
