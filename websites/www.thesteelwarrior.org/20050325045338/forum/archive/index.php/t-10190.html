Right now when I can't find a group I usually go and solo in Velks for awhile to get AAXP.  I have a feeling once I turn 62, most of the mobs are going to go LB to me.  Are there any other zones where I could do this with my current equipment?  My magelo is on the left.<br />
<br />
Also, what zone/camp should I look at to farm platinum?  There are a few slots I really need to upgrade and need some platinum to do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

AA experiencing + plat farming is kinda slow. plat per hour is best made by normal experience grouping and selling high end items if you want to play the bazaar trader game.<br />
<br />
if you want fast plat though a good way is tradeskill items. i used to make a killing selling spider silks and i underprice everyone in the bazaar. i average ~ 1000 silks in a little over an hour and make about 4K in the first hour in trader mode.<br />
on average i would kill seafuries and including gems i made ~1K in the same amount of time as farming silks.<br />
<br />
just a thought.</div></div><hr />

Hey Shikarii.  Mind sharing where you go to average 1,000 silks an hour?  Best place I know is EK, but even on the best day with lots of craigs all dropping the max amount of silk I never see anywhere near this.  (There's just not that many craigs out there).<br />
<br />
If I could find some place where I could actualy get 1,000 silks give or take per hour I might take up my silk business again.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I would pull every spider I could find ( average 10-15 spiders, sometimes more ) and with my trusty Earthshaker would PBAE the whole lot...rinse and repeat.<br />
I did this too a week or so ago and got a screenshot ( altho I gave my Earthshaker away, now I just /disc furious on big pileups )<br />
<br />
I think I was just really lucky with silks, i'd say at least 50% of all the spiders I would kill had 6+ silks on it and respawns of crag spiders were never a problem ( would gank a few HG's and Tarbul as well ).</div></div><hr />

By low, sell high, etc, if you have the patience / interest in that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could also take yourself to Crystal Caverns and slaughter Miners for velium blocks.  Go kill spiders for crystalline silk while you wait for repop.  Everything will be all green, but the zone has a bank and you can buy bandages and such there.  Velium sells well in the baz as well.</div></div><hr />
