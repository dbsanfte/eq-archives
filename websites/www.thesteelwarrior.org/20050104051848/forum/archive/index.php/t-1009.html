<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bardimus</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all you fellow warriors, i have a few questions about the skyshrine quest.  If I want to do Skyshrine armor (Myrmidon Armor) i have to kill a bunch of giants to get the faction up with CoV...pls correct me if im wrong...but, the unadorned stuff that is part of the guest drops off of Dragons in ToV, more specifically HoT. Correct? If that is so, wouldnt i be hurting my faction with CoV by killing dragons in ToV, ultimately ruining the faction that i worked hard for to be able to talk to the quest NPC? Pls help me out and i appreciate all responces. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it like the monsters there are TESTING your skills. Hence the name.<br />
<br />
The dragon kin are ok with you battling the denizens of the Halls of Testing. It's what it's there for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually thats pretty much the story line: the denizens of the Halls of Testing have offended Veeshan some how and are sentenced to serve as punching bags by those who wish to prove their worth. <br />
<br />
Just remember: <br />
1)  dragging your corpse is a bad thing unless you are FDed (in other words not 95% of this board) and <br />
2)  NToV isn't on COV, so you will be KOS there, no matter what but they will gve you negative COV as a &quot;bonus&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Get a partner (druid preferred), go to Great Divide. Pull 5-8 wolves at a time, hitting each one. Let thorns beat them down a bit. Have druid AE, rinse, repeat. Took me like 5 hours of this to go from max KoS to Allied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">easier way. arrows on 2 ring wars. fun quick and maybe even l00t. you need to be ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah. I built my factions up by farming Giants in Kael and WL for plat and crappy solo XP way back when.<br />
<br />
Not to mention following raids as they entered the zone and &quot;tagging&quot; along till they hit entrance to arena, and then feign flopping my way back to Beserkers and starting over, and waiting for the next raid.<br />
<br />
Course, back then, Kael was actually a popular place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I got one level of faction towards CoV per Kael raid (bout 2-3h nights)<br />
<br />
After only 3 kael raids and never hunting any giants I was 'amiable' to Skyshrine residents (we only did outside the Throne Room and some arena).<br />
<br />
And I agree the Ring War is great ^_^<br />
<br />
I tagged along &lt;Shadow Council&gt; last Sunday on TT after a 4th Kael raid, as I was leaving Thurgadin, and stayed till Narandi's fight.<br />
<br />
My Coldain faction got boosted two more levels, and my CoV faction one level, so that after the Ring War I was able to turn in a Corroded Plate Bracer in Thrug (kindly), and was able to start quests in Skyshrine (warmly) :)<br />
<br />
PS: the main problem when you tag along the Ring War is to avoid using the F8 key.. you're very likely to target a Coldain defender of some sort and then the Coldain Archers start to pepper you with their arbalests :D</div></div><hr />
