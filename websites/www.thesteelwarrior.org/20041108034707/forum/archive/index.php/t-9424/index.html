<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone completed a normal level 65 ldon and gotten adventure  points at level 69 or 70? I did one this afternoon with 5 level 65 friends, and was supposedly awarded 51 points, but they never were added to my total points. I petitioned and naturally the gm said they couldn't do anything about it and to /bug it.<br />
<br />
Very lame. Hello chain /bug /petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did one with 5 level 70s and a 63. Ended up in what used to be hard ldon, and got 105 points. Nfc if it matters but a lvl 70 grabbed the adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>overlordbarreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">doesn't matter who gets the ldon's now really .. if you have someoen under 65 than you can do a normal or hard adventure, but if you're all above 65 you HAVE to get a normal adventure and it's just an old hard ldon adventure, same points, same mobs, same loot etc.  They haven't made hard adventures for 66+ folks yet, not sure if they ever will.</div></div><hr />

So 5 70's and a 65 could get a normal 65 adv?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you get it by the average level of your group.  If your average level was below 63 in the old system you got a level 60 adventure, so I imagine if you want one of the old 51 point level 65 normals you need your group level average to be below 67.  Otherwise you're going to get the level 65 hard.  And no I don't believe they are going to put in a level 70 hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But you guys have been getting your points just fine, even doing level 65 normals at 70? Grr I got screwed. I wonder if I'll get points next time.</div></div><hr />
