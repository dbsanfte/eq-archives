<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont ever really post replys here, but I was wondering something.. and being the most broken melee I was just curious.<br />
<br />
After this  Here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=3702) <br />
What would SoE have to do to get you to cancel your accounts? Melee balance was 'once agian' but on the back burner and SoE is basicly thinking, &quot;They wont quit&quot; thinking you're to invested to actually stop paying them for doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Note: I feel this language is abit strong.. but thats all thier actions translate to. With the lack of communication, and no apologizes of anysort. At least they could say, &quot;Look, this is what we're doing, please hold tight.. and heres the timeline.&quot;  BUt I can see how posting a paragraph is cheaper then doing it.<br />
<br />
So what would be the final insult that would stop you playing?<br />
<br />
I cancelled my acount and I think I'm going to play FF Online till WoW comes out. But its like, I like EQ but if SoE is going to be this way... I want then to do bad, I want them to lose alot.. just like the years I invested into my class were lost. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i wish i had FF online :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
SOE? Nothing.<br />
<br />
But Cryptic Studios, they have all the power over me right now.<br />
<br />
If City of Heroes becomes a reality ... and actually is fun to play ... bye bye monk. Helooooooo superhero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">woah, someone else has heard of city of heroes.<br />
<br />
I thought it looked cool, friends and I were thinking about checking it out.</div></div><hr />
