5% chance with ferocity to double<br />
5% chance with PB to double.<br />
<br />
Does that allow you to have 10% with 2h?<br />
<br />
Disreguard the 5%, i have no clue on percentages, i just wanted to make the point clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ferocity makes your main hand double attack more often.<br />
<br />
For instance without ferocity you double attack lets say 60% of the time.  With ferocity you now double attack 70% of the time. (those numbers are made up to illustrate what it does).<br />
<br />
Punishing blade adds the chance at an extra attack per round.  For instance on every round of attacks with a 2h wep, you get a 10% chance at scoring an addtional attack.<br />
So without punishing blade, lets say you:<br />
Single attack 25%<br />
Double attack 70%<br />
triple attack 5%<br />
<br />
after punishing blade<br />
Single attack 15%<br />
Double attack 72.5% (70% + additional 10% of single attacks which get changes to double attacks)<br />
Triple attack 12% (5% + additional 10% of double attacks which get changed to triple attacks)<br />
Quad attack 0.5% (0% + additional 10% of triple attacks which get changed to quad attacks)<br />
<br />
The numbers are just made up, not accurate, just to show you how each of these work.  They do stack, they do appear to feed off each other and they also seem to feed into flurry which only goes off on triple attack or better rounds.</div></div><hr />

Or does it just raise your chances of a double or triple attack ?</div></div><hr />

With Flurry, you can pull out 6 hit rounds.</div></div><hr />

With Blade of War, PB3 and Ferocity 2 I notice a huge increase in DPS as well as a chance to proc. Must have for anyone with Blade of War or those who just want to increase their dmg output with a 2hs. <br />

The offensive AAs are definately worth getting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monkish DPS, with insane agro. <br />
<br />
You see a difference, its like 20 30% more dps in total</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing is, with these skills your DPS is spikey. You have lows and highs. In tactics the other week I was parsing about 20dps under the rogue on my highs and occasioally on the lower end of the group. Best run was 197dps.<br />
<br />
Im still missing all Ferocity and FoTA AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;3 Raging flurry 3. I don't know just how big the increase was but it is alot over just standard flurry3, for me anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;They do stack, they do appear to feed off each other and they also seem to feed into flurry which only goes off on triple attack or better rounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have to triple to get flurry to go off?  Ouch.  I didn't know that.  If it's just a chance to go off when you get 3 or more attacks in 1 round, that's pretty low.  Does that mean if you duel wield, greatly increasing your chance of getting 3 or more attacks in 1 round, that it will go off much more often?  And not just because 1 handers are usually faster weapons... hmm... <br />
<br />
I almost always use 2 handers, so that's important to know.  Flurry already seemed very expensive to me for how little I've heard it goes off in the past.  I have Ferocity 2 and PB2 right now.  I've also added Combat Fury 2 recently.  The fury line seems to be a very minimal dps gain for the points spent.  Of course it's a prereq for flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is true, but personally when I worked flurry there was only double riposte and uh warcry to work pretty much. I'd say flurry isn't worth touching untill you're done with your defenses, but that's just me. It's a decent aa, tho for 42 points it does seem underpowered (12cf3 18flurry3 12rflurry3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah flurry &amp; critic are soooo streaky.<br />
<br />
I parse from 100 to 160 in PoF xp group, 1st castle<br />
And thats 100 to 160 like every day all the time (more with ranger/bst)<br />
<br />
I've had 6 flurry, 7x 528 critic on my best fight so far.<br />
(And the EQ record of a Critic Flurry  4x528 in a row)<br />
<br />
And on some others zero critic zero flurry.<br />
<br />
Still i say with confidence, no AA to full AA is a good 20% dps gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ferocity<br />
Punishing Blade<br />
Combat Fury<br />
Flurry<br />
Flurry of the Ages<br />
<br />
right?<br />
of course that is after defensive aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Tagg that is what i have done, After all my defensives AAs are done. Now working on Flurry 2, I have PB3,Ferocity3 and such.. I use a Norgetal atm.. Still waiting for a BOW &quot;dream some day&quot;..I have noticed a big difference in my dps. Before i was doing about 89 to 95 dps.. With just having Flurry 1 it has jumped up from what i can tell i have not pharsed it yet but i will soon..</div></div><hr />

Your confusing what these skills do.<br />
<br />
Ferocity makes your main hand double attack more often.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Are you sure that it only makes you double attack on your MAIN hand more offten?<br />
<br />
From the AA description: <br />
  This ability gives the melee character an increased chance to perform a double attack in any combat round.<br />
<br />
This can mean a large increase in DPS if you are quadding more often. <br />
<br />
Where there tests done to prove it's only a main hand increase?</div></div><hr />

Easy way to test...just get two different weapons (say a piercer and a slasher), before ferocity parse them...get ferocity, parse again.  Only have to count swings (remove ripostes).</div></div><hr />

Close.. Change flurry of the ages to Raging Flurry.<br />
<br />
Fury of the ages increases crit hit chances</div></div><hr />
