lol I wondered why it took so long to get cross posted here. ignore it, follow it, whatever, im having enough fun on there as it is. Unfortunately I wont be able to answer posts for a few hours, ill be out till about 10:30.</div></div><hr />

Say what? Where did I say that monks should be superior to knights in tanking? Just because I think knights tank a little too well doesnt mean I want them brought down to lower than monk status. I dont want to kill them off for crying out loud!</div></div><hr />

If you had a spectrum, with underpowered on the left, overpowered on the right, and balanced taking up 60% of the centre of the spectrum, knights (especially paladins) would be in the area just past balanced and heading to overpowered.<br />
Monks would be left of the centre, but still in the balanced area, and warriors and rogues would be right near the middle. Rangers, they are just cannon fodder, so I don't really care where they fit. :-D</div></div><hr />

At this point it looks like paladins in OOW will be taking less damage than any equal geared warrior, stunning everything up to 70 at level 66, healing as well as a druid at 65, with all the missing nice warrior aa's.<br />
<br />
It is wrong on so many levels to make paladins so strong that it takes defensive to get 10 to 20 percent tanking lead on paladins.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking strongly of hitting up the KC basement with my Fabled Ghoulbane and Instrument of Nife. Not only can I grab 4 fast levels, but ideally I should get enough AA's for SU/Holyforge. Then it's loot a Cleave bracer, smear the undead LDoNs, and finish up hauling in experiance with a bucket in the tunnel to InkTa'Tu. Seriously, follow the Yellow Brick Road. Special zones are tailored just for your class from level 46 onward. What group won't want a Paladin PLing them?<br />
<br />
The good news is most level 65 Paladins have less than 6000HP's unbuffed. Pbbbt, that's not even competition. So, don't complain - twink instead. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Paladins are a lot of fun to play, all Warriors and Clerics should make one.<br />

I can't wait. /ooc 65 not gimp Paladin /lfg!!<br />

Ok what does this title mean?  You promised to rat on him to SW (only interpretation I can see)?  /shrug I'm pretty sure most of us dont care what someone else posts on Monkly Business..</div></div><hr />

Yeah I dont get that either. Someone else decided to post a link to that topic on my server board too. Makes me wonder if they went into my post history and decided to try to &quot;embarass&quot; me on every board I regularly post on. Im surprised they havent posted a link on the druids grove yet.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a grudge. It's not an attempt to embarass Traab. I don't need to attempt anything... he did a fine job of it himself.<br />

Traab requested it. I said I would. I did. Simple.</div></div><hr />

 Actually, I said I was surprised noone had yet since it was already on my server board. I figured the two FIRST places it would get linked to where the seperate knight boards and tsw.</div></div><hr />

U are kidding right? Not even gonna address this one. If I thought it was true (and I have seen the spell and AA lists) I wouldnt be stripping my 65 paladin with 275AAs as we speak :)<br />

And even then hes not tanking, hes just playing stun monkey stunning the mob till its recharmed.<br />

I dont think Pallys are the superior tank that they used to be, as long as I can hold aggro, Im the better choice. Except for playing  stun monky.<br />

The sky isnt falling.<br />
Well not yet anyway, who knows what OoW will bring.</div></div><hr />

No kidding, I guess you have a &quot;grass is greener&quot; problem.  I know what it is like today based on playing a paladin and grouping with a paladin.  I have read the new AA and discs.  This will produce a huge boost to the paladins that isn't copied to warriors.  You can try to deny that fact, but most people will not agree.</div></div><hr />

Ya gotta do what suits ya.<br />
<br />
Paladins have an important place in raids at all levels. Each and every Paladin that shows up is a major contributor.<br />
<br />
My Paladin is level 53 (was 50 when retired shortly after Kunark). Let me tell you - KEI, FT, focus effects, Instument of Nife, my gimp Fabled Ghoulbane, etc are AWESOME. Paladins are the best combination of melee power and a spellbook in the game. I enjoy directing battle like a conductor leading a symphony orchestra<br />
<br />
If you are a Paladin and expect to tank just like a Warrior in high level raids, then you better have some serious meat on your bones. If that's too much for you to handle then you will not be happy.<br />
<br />
Gimmie level 65, 275 AA's, a Hopebringer, Qvic armor, PoTime accessories, all the spells please please. I would have tremendous difficulty logging out even to sleep for months.<br />

Jebus: YOU POSTED A LINK AND &quot;ENJOY&quot;.  <br />
<br />
 See more of Dobbanz in this thread. <br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont play the &quot;you didnt read my post crap&quot; game YOU NEVER PROVIDED ANY CONTEXT AT ALL (caps are for increduality not anger).<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;Traab&quot; needing you to post here; odd I see Dobbanz post here all by himself quite often.<br />
<br />
I'm calling BS. This is a troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archonfire</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course it's a troll, Flair.<br />
<br />
I think you've missed who I was trying to troll though.<br />
<br />
As to not putting any context into my post... which one? TSW? I didn't need to, the link is right there. And why would I put context when the post was created solely for one person, who I can assume read the origin for this thread in the first place?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ahahahahahahahha! I see now! You thought when I said my first post, I meant the first post in this thread.<br />
<br />
My bad, my first post refers to my first post in the thread I linked.<br />
<br />
Now, here's the kicker: the reason you misunderstood what I said is because the post you quoted first (Read my post. Again. All the way through) was aimed specifically at Traab  (n o t  y o u  o k ?), and therefore assumed that he would know what I was talking about.<br />
<br />
Which he did, btw.</div></div><hr />
