Furthermore I'm hoping tonight will be the night that I finally complete my EPIC quest.  Only one more fight to go which is one groupable and should only take 15 minutes at most. (Queen in Chardok)<br />
<br />
I've also been spending a little time in Everfrost doing adventures and will soon have enough points to get 3 anger 2 augments.  What I am debating at the moment is putting a anger 2 augment on the cord hilted spike driver and although I know this sounds slightly nuts an Anger 2 augment on the 2hander version of my EPIC.  Im curious to how people think this will hold up in regular experience groups.<br />
<br />
I am loathe to put augments on any other weapons atm due to the fact that the guild I am in is rapidly advancing through content and we should be hitting VT very soon.  I wont even think about Anger 3 until I have weapons  that I feel confident will last me a least well into the elemental zones.<br />
<br />
So here is the question is my thinking way off the mark?  Is putting Anger 2 on EPIC 2 hander a waste?  Maybe I should be putting it on the red blade and offhanding it to an augmented Cord Hilted, I dont know, thus I put myself before my peers for suggestions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have some nice dual-wielding low delay DPS weapons but I wouldnt MT with them. Get yourself a GSoT, put anger 3 on it and you will have an MTing tool. It will last you a long time and is pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like I said I really dont wanna use anger 3, for the points that one anger 3 augment will cost I can get 2 anger 2 augments.  These weapons wont last THAT long.  The way things look at the moment its possible I will have a Bloodfrenzy in the next couple of weeks if it decides to drop and if not ill be looking to upgrade to some sort of 2hs instead.  All I really need is a weapon thats sufficient to lock down agro in group situations in the mean time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">510 Points Ykesha stun aug is just as good if not better than Anger II imo.<br />
<br />
I have both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm wager the problem is that the epic 2H simply does not have the ratio to compete for a potision as a MT weapon.  The delay also hurts the weapon for MT duties.  <br />
<br />
I'd take a GSoT any day over epic 2H unaug'ed.  The GSoT has a superior damage ratio, which means when you're not proc'ing you're going to be generating better agro.  It's also faster, meaning more swings, thus more agro.<br />
<br />
So the point Ragnarz is making is, why augment the epic 2H with an anger augment, when you can stick the same augment on a 100pp weapon and get superior results?<br />
<br />
GSoT + Anger 2 &gt; 2H epic + Anger 2  in every way I can think of, except if you're trying to impress the hotties with bling-bling.  We all know we look silly wielding that GSoT :)<br />
<br />
If you want to get some milage out of your epic, the only real option you have is hate-augmenting your red epic and offhanding it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for the points that one anger 3 augment will cost I can get 2 anger 2 augments <br />
<br />
Hmm Interesting idea.  Does anyone have a feel for the value of 3 over 2?   If an Anger proc2 is likely to keep aggro, then having one in each hand is clearly an better.<br />
<br />
Of course, you don't want to get to the point where there is nothing left to buy without replacing hard-won augs, so it could be that you want to wait for the points for Anger3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I've decided im going to augment one of the EPIC blades for my offhand.  Now the question is which one?  Now I know this sounds clear cut in that you augment the red blade because then every proc is increasing hate.  However this will be going in the offhand and I am not sure what the procrates for offhand weapons are.  Would I be better off maybe with the effect of the blue blade with an anger 2 augment added to it?<br />
<br />
More to ponder :).  It sure is nice to have choices</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the only reason you would offhand an epic blade is for the proc so therefore you should only consider offhanding the redblade.<br />
<br />
The blue blade has a worn effect that increases dex, ac and atk by minimal amounts.  Its simply not worth using in an agro setup and you have better DPS weapons for your nontanking setup.<br />
<br />
Either go CHSD + red epic for agro with anger procs on both or get a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't suggest augmenting your epic.  Before long your gonna get something MUCH better and kick yourself for wasting the points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;The blue blade has a worn effect that increases dex, ac and atk by minimal amounts.&quot;<br />
<br />
55 Dex and Vengance VI is minimal? Since when?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">30 atk is not going to compensate for the DPS loss of having a poor ratio weapon offhand.  55dex is not going to compensate for having one proc on the offhand instead of 2.  The extra 15 stamina from the red blade might make your hp total look a bit nicer ofcourse though.<br />
<br />
If you want the proc use the red blade, if you want DPS use something with a decent ratio like bonechiller, and if you want the dex get better buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh I agree with what you're saying above there.<br />
<br />
But that's not at all what you originally said.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldn't use the Epic for anything more than fashion.  Get the GSoT, slap Anger 2 on it.  Hell, don't bother wasting the points, it does just fine as is.<br />
<br />
Seriously, gratz on getting the Epic, very commendable, but just because you have the bloody thing doesn't mean that you should use it.  Only the red blade has any real use and that is only as an offhander to a CHoS or CHSD.  With the weapon set that you have, there is simply no reason to ever use the Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But that's not at all what you originally said.<br />
What I originally said was:<br />
<br />
The blue blade has a worn effect that increases dex, ac and atk by minimal amounts. Its simply not worth using in an agro setup and you have better DPS weapons for your nontanking setup.<br />
<br />
which as far as I can tell is acurate.  After you disputed how minimal the atk and dex were I clarified with:<br />
<br />
30 atk is not going to compensate for the DPS loss of having a poor ratio weapon offhand. 55dex is not going to compensate for having one proc on the offhand instead of 2.<br />
<br />
The 2nd statement justifies the 1st, but the 1st still stands correct on its own IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">put the anger2/ykesha on the CHSD and the bonechiller, wait until you have a better 2h to augment. by the time your ready for elemental planes you should have decent 2h weapon. outside of elememntals duel wield is better, you get more procs and ripo damage isnt that big of a concern. not many mobs will hit for over 1k and even then, half of those wont hit over 1k after defensive. as a warrior, there arent a whole lot of 2h weapons outside of elementals that will hold agro very well nor are the few that exist easily atainable. your best bet is to stick it out and wait, or drop a cheap augment on soemthing like GSoT<br />
also, if you dont have the great blade of storms i suggest you convince your guild to hit up the towers until all your warriors have one. very easy to get as well as a great proc and an outstanding ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK first, why was I considering the blue blade.  Well it isnt for the dexterity.  I'm currently at 199 dex with no buffs and never enter a raid without capped dex and rarely enter an experience group without the same.  I think the main question I am asking is does a weapon in an offhand have the same proc rate per minute as it would in the primary.  If the proc rate is the same then it kind of becomes a mute issue as the answer then becomes obvious if the proc rate is reduced then in my mind its a closer call.<br />
<br />
Zynth, I must admit I have wanted a Great Blade of Storms for a while now.  But there is no way in hell that I will bid on one now.  Right now I have my eyes on a MUCH bigger prize in a Bloodfrenzy.  The guild I am in has only been around for around 2 months and in that time we have taken down Cursed 8 times.  We have also killed Emporer Ssra twice and VT is looming on the horizon.  This means I am being VERY careful with what I spend points on atm.  I wont even bid on an item unless I feel it will last me to at least the elemental plains.<br />
<br />
The other downside is I just get no time to do anything other than raid (not really that bad a thing in my book).  I'm currently like number 5 on the tank list and I REALLY dont want that to last.  I just need something that will give me good solid agro in groups in the meantime and will let me raid tank on those rare occasions it is required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In regard to anger 2 vs anger 3.  I made the same decision and aug'd GSot with anger 2 (going cheap on LDoN pts).  I now wish I had used Anger 3 (not that the agro is bad...its great but I just subjectively wish I had more).   But my context may differ from yours; I'm not in an uber guild and the likelyhood of a significant upgrade is way in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Two anger 2 augments are not more agro than one anger 3 augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Two anger 2 augments are not more agro than one anger 3 augment <br />
<br />
I am sure there is some logic too that ... just for the life of me can't seem to grasp this concept...<br />
<br />
/scratches her head<br />
<br />
All this talk tho we have evaded the original issue , BAG THE FOOKING EPIC !!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Still makes me wonder though why putting a Anger2 on main and off &gt; one anger3 on main hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It works like this:<br />
Anger II main hand x 2 procs per minute = 800 hate<br />
Anger II off hand x 1 proc per minute      = 400 hate<br />
Total hate per minute =1200 hate<br />
<br />
Anger III main hand x 2 procs per minute = 1200 hate<br />
Total hate per minute =1200 hate. <br />
<br />
Now, we could argue all day about the early fight proc distribution and relative merits, but on a hate per (time) basis, they're equally valid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">^ Correcto!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks Arathena, wasn't arguing.. hope it didn't sound like I was.. Just trying to understand the logic.  Thank you very much ))<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">OK Thank you Arethena, thats exactly what I needed to know.  The next step in this equation is this and im looking at this with the basic premise of 2 procs per minute as standard.  I know this isnt exactly right but I THINK its good enough for a comparison to be made.<br />
<br />
2 x 1handed Weapons, both have in build procs producing some sort of agro.  Both augmented =<br />
<br />
4 seperate procs<br />
Main hand will proc 4 times a minute<br />
Off hand will proc 2 times a minute<br />
total number of hate procs 6<br />
<br />
1 x 2handed weapon<br />
Procs 4 times a minute<br />
<br />
Over the course of a minute roughly the same amount of hate is generated.  The 2 handed set up gives you a more steady build up of hate and the 1 hander gives you better burst damage and hate build up.  Which would you want?<br />
<br />
I would think the chances of an early proc on a 2 x 1hander setup is greater than it would be on a 1 x 2hander setup<br />
<br />
Is this right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's correct. Given two weapons of identical delay, 2 Anger IIs have 1.5 times the chance of going off on any given combat round compared to a single main handed Anger II, but there's disadvantages to spreading your hate over two procs:<br />
<br />
1:  The 400 hate has a larger chance of being insufficent to overcome early debuff aggro. I'm not entirely sure how it all stacks up myself, since I throw my raw hate via terror. <br />
<br />
2: What happens 22 adventures down the line when you want to upgrade your hate setup? That's right, you've gotta destroy an Anger II and rep it with a Ykesha or a Anger III. Then you've gotta destroy the other Anger II 22 more adventures down the line. That's a ton of wasted points.<br />
<br />
Given this, if you really want to be a tightwad about points, I'd probably go with two of the 75 dd Ykeshas over dual anger IIs, but take this with an entire shaker of salt, cuz I'm not a warrior, I just like to play with maths.</div></div><hr />
