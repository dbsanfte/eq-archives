<br />
really for most part their wars ,and arent a threat to us since their chain,they'll have a place for dps, since you only need 4 or so main wars on raids and usually have least 5-6,can field a few zerkers now instead</div></div><hr />

 Literally all of their disciplines under 60 are exactly ours. I know this is subject to change, but why exactly should a DPS class have evasive? Not an emergency survival one, but a 3 minute duration lower DPS for better tanking one... &lt;shrugs&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes i saw those.. keep in mind this is still beta data, they could simply have copied the warrior AA data over as a template to the test server, which makes it available to Lucy to parse.

Their &quot;spells&quot; all say &quot;Focuses mana into the form of a brass choker that sometimes allows you to cast a spell without consuming any reagents. This item works on spells up to level 12.&quot; in the game description.  Obviously mages will be useless now as well when this new super class comes out!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't worry about them copying your discs. Beastlords copy monk discs.<br />
<br />
What I'd worry about is them having NEW abilities granted to them 6 months into the game, to give them a raid role, which ends up making them a better choice to have than either warriors or monks.<br />

Much like beastlords with their frenzy/ferocity/paragon/whatever.</div></div><hr />

With the coming addition of berserkers as a class, we will be changing the name of the berserker armor to bladesman armor.  We hope that this will avoid any confusion between the armor and new class (although I am already confused).  This change will occur in the next update which is tentatively scheduled for February 10th.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />

Omg, it seems this new class is nerfing our armor names! DEATH TO CHANGE! Bladesman armor indeed. I'm not a bladesman, I'm a big pile of hitpoints and armor. Why not Ye Olde Pile 'O Rustin' Death armor? I'd almost take armor named that over a RZ axe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?searchtext=discipline&amp;classes=ZKR&amp;sort=class<br />
<br />
Of note:<br />
<br />
Burning Rage = Aggresive<br />
Battle Focus = Fortitude<br />
Blind Rage = Fellstrike<br />
Focused Fury = Precision<br />
Reckless = Furious<br />
Cleaving Rage = Mighty strike<br />
Inspired Anger = Charge<br />
Battle Sense = Evasive &lt;--<br />
Cleaving Anger = 1 min duration, crit crip disc<br />
Indomitable = ? add a stun proc or something maybe<br />
Sprint = add 70% movement rate<br />
<br />
What is interesting is this is no longer cut and paste. This is changing the names of stuff as well as the levels. I mean that the warrior disc and zerker equivalent are not at the same level.<br />
<br />
Obviously this is beta, but damn. Another class getting evasive is kinda the suck, even if its a chain class!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Maybe I am just being silly, but It just agitates me a little bit about a number of things with berserkers. For instance, the ability to use a berserk ability which gives them a big attack boost, some hp and hp regen seems just like something warriors should have had, since we afterall have going berserk as one of our innate abilities. I dont forsee berskers really tanking anything obviously, but they do get evasive and again get special abilities to land critical hits (another ability of ours given out to all classes) and now crippling blows as well. I just feel the entire concept of this class is something which could have, should have, been included in with warriors.<br />
<br />
Berserkers are going to get some group rally cries and stuff, another ability which was once toyed around with being added to the warrior class. I suppose I just always saw warriors as big badasses that could kick ass and take a beating. While we can take a beating, and can perform some nice dps, I just think alot of the abilities berserkers are getting would have worked well for warriors.<br />
<br />
Im not crying for nerfs on a class which isnt finished, and when berserkers go live I will happily play one, Im just a little disheartened. But then again, I cannot say I have honestly had fun with warriors in a long time. They lack variety and stuff to do. Tanking is fun, only having so much you can do with a character gets boring after 4 almsot 5 years. Wish they would give us more diverse skills and things to play with, and who knows, maybe they will.<br />
<br />
Playing a bard and warrior at the same time is money though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ya know, I really agree with you there.  Some of the berserker is what I wanted in a warrior.  Rally crys, useful berserk, using giant swords and axes to kick ass.  In fact, since I hear they are getting all warrior skills too, just kinda saddens me.  Only difference is they don't wear plate / don't have mitigation discs, along with their own skills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I kinda feel bad for the Berserker class at the moment.  It seems like they'll have sub-par dps, mitigation, and not even bring anything really special to a raid or group.  Sure, they'll be able to fill in when there's no snarer, but they coulda just rolled a Ranger instead (with EQ, too, instead of piles of summoned axes).<br />
<br />
I agree with an earlier poster, though, in that they'll probably give them something good to give them a place at raids (probably something like AE warcry instead of just a group version, and hopefully one that lasts a little longer).<br />
<br />
Time will tell, of course.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Throe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I see this class as a hybrid.  Not sure what *of* yet, but its a hybrid.... kinda thought of it as a ranger without mana at first, but from what I've seen here maybe some of this has changed.  I'm thinking if EQ2 wasn't slated to come out, Sony would keep making up new classes for new content.  As it is painfully obvious that they've exhausted much of the ideas for new stuff to throw in to keep people addicted.  We would eventually have cross-classes so intermingled that there would be wizard/warrior hybrids that had manaburn, and defensive/furious(i.e. the best mix of both classes).<br />
<br />
Personally I'm thankful that Sony has found something else to focus their &quot;new-ideas&quot; on.  Now maybe they will stop making new unneeded classes that mainstream players don't need or want in the game.(afterall, who can say that they haven't been annoyed at one point or another when a Paladin/SK was picked as a better tank because they could hold agro better(even though they had horrible AC/HP in comparison)).<br />

<br />
Only thing i can say is that i would rather be grouped with a monk.  They seem to have the same dps and ability to generate agro though the dps, but monks can fd while berserkers can't and just take a beating pretty bad.<br />
<br />
When i was able to tank the mobs from full health to death, i would require only 1 heal, while the berserker needed 2-3 heals.  Guess this shows their lack of ac.<br />

Also according to the berserker, their snares only last about 2 seconds and arent really good for much except getting the mobs attention.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">They seem to be rangers who can kick ass in melee.  Grouped with a 65 'zerker on a normal LDoN and they seem to dish out the pain really good.  They are like 100% offensive warriors. They got our hitpoints but they cant take the damage we can.<br />
<br />
Mmmm more dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Unclebong summed up zerkers pretty well with these two words... &quot;offensive warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
DPS is higher than a warrior, aggro generation ability and tanking ability is lower than a warrior.  With a tiny bit of utility added.  But aside from the minor utility they possess, they are pretty much just an offensive version of a warrior.<br />
<br />
HPs are about the same as Pal/SK.  Obviously mitigation is nowhere near as good due to the chain armor.<br />
<br />
My berserker is up to level 52 and I have been tanking for groups since I was a baby 'zerker.. but I see those days coming to an end.  As it is now, I tank great in normal LDoNs... I'm OK as a tank in PoJ, but I'm more of a drain on cleric mana than a real tank.  And in PoI I can tank in an emergency but I require too much healing to be an efficient tank in a group there.  As I move to zones where the mobs hit harder and harder, the lack of mitigation will beome even more important.  So, no need to worry about a 'zerker taking over your spot as tank in a group.  We will most likely make good offtanks and emergency tanks when the real one dies - but not a threat to compete for the job.<br />
<br />
As for aggro.  I have been able to hold aggro without any real issues in every group I've been in that asked me to tank.  The only trouble comes when breaking mezzes.  One stun isn't enough, and I have no taunt key.  And with a 12 second reuse time on the stun, who has time to wait around to try it again?<br />
<br />
The other side of the aggro coin... I can also lose aggro as well.<br />
<br />
Only thing i can say is that i would rather be grouped with a monk. They seem to have the same dps and ability to generate agro though the dps, but monks can fd while berserkers can't and just take a beating pretty bad.<br />
<br />
You were playing with a lousy berserker.  Berserkers get a &quot;distracting strike&quot; line for aggro reduction.  It gives an immediate drop in aggro, and also reduces aggro over a duration.  If you had a 'zerker constantly taking aggro from you, they weren't using this ability.  Personally, if I am not tanking I use it early in the fight, and depending on the aggro generation of the group's tank, I refresh it as necessary.  The only time I have ever had problems with unwanted aggro was one night in PoJ with a warrior who had no aggro procs (not even 1) and who did not use incite.<br />
<br />
Also, the stuns DO generate aggro, but it doesn't seem to be on par with pally stun (I have a 52 berserker and a 54 pally, so I can compare pretty directly).  It also seems that the snare is less aggro than ranger snare (based on the fact that when grouped with a ranger who was particularly forgetful about snaring mobs, I would snare them and never take aggro, and on the rare occasions when he did snare, he always got a love tap or two in return).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Lomack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Ok, I realize that Zerkers are ment to be a higher DPS class than the warrior class.  I don't play a War or a Zerker as my main character but I got a gander at the zerker epic today.  Seems like it might need a bit of tuneing, downward....<br />

<br />
The first thing that struck me was the ratio.  Now I know zerkers are ment to be a dps version of a warrior but dang....  That ratio puts it on part with the upper end NToV drops, or better.  Not to mention that it has 25 more hps than the Warrior 2h version of their epic.  Granted the war epic has some added functionality when you split it into two weapons.<br />

I realize that most warriors skip right over their epic these days.  I'm just wondering how easy this epic is going to be to obtain.  Because it looks way above average compaird to the other epic weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I guess they had to make their epic a useable weapon or all the zerkers would just go buy windblades.  If you consider the warrior epic as being a kunark quest weapon and the berzerker epic as being a GoD quest weapon it should make more sense though.  I think its good that they made an epic worthy of being used rather than putting a quest in for a sub bazaar weapon that people would do just for the sake of having it and then bag when they leave PoK.<br />
<br />
As for difficulty I did the Berserker epic mob in fear with 2 groups of 65s and its a crazy encounter, giving almost 2 groups of elemental geared 65s way more trouble than any warrior epic fight could have.  Fun though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">The difficulty (sole difficulty, apparently) of the Zerker epic quest is the mob Eoden mentioned. Tough little booger; I'm sure it would take quite a bit of Kunark/Velious geared folks to take him (which is the &quot;age group&quot; to which the epics are aimed). Still think it can be done, though, with adequate preparation. <br />
<br />
They ought to go back and modify the other damned epics. How about subtracting ten delay from our 2h and 5 delay each from our 1h?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I don't mind the rest of the stats, nor the effect...it's the ratio that pisses me off.<br />
<br />
I wonder what a dev thought.  Maybe during the melee tuning, they thought &quot;You know, it would kick ass if we could make this warrior be offensive instead of defensive.  Lets limit them to 2handers for the dmg bonus, add throwing abilities but give them stuns and snares for them as well (because I played a ranger for a bit after Luclin, lets make the throwing damage actually good), some warrior disciplines, and that berserker rage ability (but actually good and decent this time).  Hey wait a second, this would make for a good class.  But I want a kickass epic I'll use for a really long time, not those wimpy ones the rest have.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is almost no reason for the berserkers to have that ratio.  That Fear mob is not as hard as people seem to think, my guild took him down first try, and we're nowhere near elemental level (we're lucky to have BoT keys even).<br />
<br />
I see no reason for such a good ratio weapon.  Welcome to the new twink class I guess though.</div></div><hr />

When the warrior epic was introduced, it was the best weapon a warrior could get.<br />

It would be pointless to make an epic for a new class and have the epic be worse than easily obtained (i.e. bazaar dropped) items, starting from the day it was introduced.</div></div><hr />

Thats true but they could very easly add a quest and let everyone else upgrade theirs. I dont think they will ever do irt but it would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">There is no justification for making a weapon that is equivalent in purpose and in difficulty of acquisition (in theory) as the Kunark era Epics that is so far superior to Kunark era Epics.  The berserker Epic is arguably significantly less difficult to acquire the other 2h Epics (war/pal/sk) and totally blows theirs away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">The only thing more &quot;difficult&quot; about some of the other epics is crapy drop rates and insanely rare mobs.<br />
<br />
The difficulty of the fights is equivalent.<br />
<br />
The rare spawns and rare drops were the result of a flawed quest design.  This design has been significantly improved (see BL and now BER epics).  <br />
<br />
I don't think it is a bad thing that the designers pulled their heads out of their arses and made these quests more about being able to marshal the forces required to kill the mobs than about endless camping, and about fighting with other people over rare and contested spawns, and then hoping that the piece you need drops.</div></div><hr />
