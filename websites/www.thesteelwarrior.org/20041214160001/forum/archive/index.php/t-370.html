<br />
Warriors are not monks. Almost ALL of their pertinent gear has STR and STA on it.<br />
<br />
The &quot;hardest&quot; stat to raise for a warrior (and for a monk, oddly enough) is Agility.<br />

Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

With Avatar all my stats are maxed except AGL.  There's not a lot of decent items for warriors which carry a high AGL bonus.  My STA is still maxed at 285 without any buffs.  I think my STR is somewhere around 270 or so, and DEX around 200.  I think I get a total of like 12-20 ish AGL from all my gear :(</div></div><hr />

I messed up terribly on mine, and I survived, and am now doing very good.  You will have a bit less hps than others who did sta, but it's not like you get a lot of hps from sta until later.  But then it still doesn't make a big difference, since they will be caping sta and you will be close.  So don't worry, and just play and have fun =)</div></div><hr />

If I had to do it over again, I'd either keep it the way I did it or dump them all into AGI.<br />

I did the same thing you and put all my starting points into strength because it was the accepted thing to do back then.  For a while I regretted it but just with some simple choices in gear I find myself with my unbuffed stamina only a bit less than my current cap, and a simple raid buff puts me at my cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talmonious</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not much in this game is worth re-rolling a character over.  Not everybody has to follow some stereotypical path of what a warrior should be.  I wouldn't have put 10 str and 5 each in sta, dex and agi when I created my human warrior years ago if i'd followed what the guides said.  Of course as a human I don't have to worry too much about maxing stats unless i'm just loaded with buffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To not answer your question, I would suggest that you make a magelo of your charater and warp your charater to level 65 with full elemental armor, all sta aa's and pick out some random items for all the other slots.  I think you will see yourself buffable to 305 sta.  Also remember that shaman sta buff at lv 65 is 60 sta points... so you only NEED to get to 245 sta.<br />
<br />
To directly answer your question, I have maxed my sta at 305 with a shaman buff and my equip is about VT level now with some pop and ntov items in there.  Also, when i created my charater, I made a barb and i also put all into str and the rest into sta.</div></div><hr />

you don't need to re roll anything unless you like to proclaim your l33tness on messageboards :D you're gonna be fine !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are right about the AGI being the hardest stat to raise most of the time. I do have 203 AGI unbuffed right now, but that's all thanks to the one VT item I have... Cord of Midnight... +50 AGI on a belt is priceless!<br />
My stamina is at 230+ unbuffed, and I still have slots that have no stamina on them, and with my ornate planar legs, I can get 266 stamina with no shaman. It's nice to have... but I made the mistake of having a meer 90 base stamina. I put my first 6 AA's into Run 3 and Innate Stamina 3.  It has helped a lot.<br />
<br />
As far as starting all over... don't bother unless you can give ALL your equipment to your new warrior without having level restriction problems. Also, if and ONLY if you are willing to reinvest the time in all the noob grinds.  I just wouldn't recomend it. I know I wouldn't start over my warrior for anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was about level 55 I re-rolled an ogre and made it to level 6 before going back to the half elf.<br />
<br />
Depending on how far you want to go in this game, race and stats can go from very significant as a low level warrior when your base stats are pretty close to your equiped stats, to very insignificant at the high end where gear + buffs will max your stats regardless of what you chose at character creation.<br />
<br />
Just wish I hadn't chosen agnostic tho~</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you plan around xp groups, nice to pump up sta since you arent always going to have a shaman around.  several classes can buff strength, dex worthless without a high dmg proc weapon.</div></div><hr />

Re: On determining AC<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok I finished the agility table. <br />
Here's the full formula for AC: <br />
<br />
Avoidance = (T from table) + trunc(Defense * 16/9), but never less than 0 <br />
Caster Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/3) + trunc(Defense/2) + (Equipment + 1) <br />
Anyone else's Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/4) + trunc(Defense/3) + trunc(Equipment * 4/3) <br />
Displayed AC = trunc( (Avoidance + Mitigation) * 1000 / 847 ) <br />
<br />
Caster means Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Wizard. <br />
Defense is the character's Defense skill. <br />
Equipment is just the sum total of the raw AC from everything worn. Don't forget the range slot. <br />
Buffs is the sum of the bonuses from all buffs. You'd have to check your spdat file to see those numbers, but for reference Skin Like Wood adds 15 and Skin Like Nature adds 55. <br />
T comes from the agility table below, use the column corresponding to the character's level. <br />
trunc means truncate, to remove the fraction; keep only the integer part of the value. <br />
<br />
Some qualifications: Iksars get a bonus, I'm not sure how much but I suspect it might be adding (Level - 1) to Mitigation. The formula hasn't actually been tested on Beastlords or Vah Shir yet. The formula doesn't work for monks because of the weight limit thing, but it should work if they keep their weight under the limit. There is a 'never less than 0' issue with Mitigation too, but it only matters if you get hit with an AC debuff while wearing little or no equipment... it won't affect most people. The formula doesn't work right if your character has been drinking but it works in every other situation, including illusions, hunger, thirst, drowning, encumbered, low health, low stamina, stacked buffs and debuffs, and resurrection sickness. I have no proof that these are the actual Avoidance and Mitigation values, there isn't even any proof that Avoidance and Mitigation are ever used seperately in actual combat calculations... I just know that the first few factors are rounded up to 0 and are the same for all classes, so it seemed like a sensible division. <br />
<br />

(Korak)My own personal observations:<br />
Agility does not add to the &quot;mitigation&quot; portion of AC.  So, in theory, it should allow you to avoid more hits.  The mitigation portion being factored into an equation to determin n=1to20 in the DB+(1-20)DI, and the avoidance being factored into an equation to determine if you are hit.  I believe the special skill checks (block/parry/dodge/riposte) are done sepatately and distinct from either of the other two computations.  I can't link anything, but iirc testing has shown that riposte rates were constant regardless of mob.  I really wish the two numbers were still displayed separately as that would allow for easier analysis.  With carefully controlled and recorded tests (and a bit of math) it could be determined what effect agility has on hit rate.  I suspect it is rather small, on the order of 1% in significance, since you are only talking about a 25pt increase in avoidance AC for going from 75agi to 240+ (unknown to me how it scales after 255).  Therefore, situations might dictate that there are better uses for your buff slots.  I still have too many other goals in the game to pursue such testing.  Perhaps someone else will take up the banner.</div></div><hr />
