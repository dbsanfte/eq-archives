I've had people tell me it's safe, I've had people tell me it's not, and I've had people tell me it's safe but only for short periods of time  :p <br />
<br />
Any feedback is much appreciated  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had one incident though, late at night comming in from the bar, i tripped over the end table and hit my head on the corner of the tv. I dont blame the tv though, it was all the endtables fault!</div></div><hr />

I think it is ok as long as you dont leave it on pause overnight you should be fine, something to do with static images causes the images to be burned to the screen like the old computer screens that is why they invented screen savers.  So as long as the images keep on updating it should be fine.  But better be safe  than sorry so call up the place you bought it and asked them or send an email to the company that manufactured it to find out.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much, yes.  As long as the entire screen updates, you're fine... but if you play like a racing game where there's always a speedometer in the exact same spot, etc, there is a risk of burn-in during long sessions.  I've seen projection TVs that have been used for heavy gaming marathons with no issues, and I've seen TVs that get burn-in just from the black boxes around widescreen DVDs after a month of use.  It's not a garaunteed &quot;THIS WILL RUIN YOUR TELEVISION,&quot; but the risk is there.<br />
<br />
And that's only for rear-projection TVs... the newer LCD and DLP models don't have the same type of problem.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing PS2 on my 48&quot; JVC and havent had any burn in problems. <br />
<br />
Maybe if you beat a game and you were saving it to show your friends who wouldnt believe you  ... and they were on vacation for 2 weeks</div></div><hr />

When you aren't using it make sure to change it to a channel without a news ticker or logo in the corner.  <br />
<br />
This will &quot;break in the screen&quot;  helping to prevent future burn in from high contrast viewing/gaming.  <br />
<br />
I have no issues gaming nonstop on my widescreen.   :cool:</div></div><hr />
