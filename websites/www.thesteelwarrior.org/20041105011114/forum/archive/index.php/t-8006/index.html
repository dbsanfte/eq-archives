ARGHHH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you try to teach them that :<br />
1. we can keep aggro only from our weapon because we have no spellbook.<br />
2. stun proc are great aggro.<br />
3. the GBoS has a stun proc<br />
4. because it is linked to a great ratio it creates one of the best 1Her aggro weapon (in the top ten :) )<br />
5. that it was an upgrade for you<br />
6. that if you gonna have it, you will use it all the time till you have a BoW or better.<br />
7. that when the ranger will use it, he will have a big pb in not getting more aggro that you.<br />
8. that if he gets it you want him to tank since he has a better aggro setup, and thus that you are planning to use your DPS setup to to let the DPS of the group don't fall to much even if he is better than you at DPS.<br />
9. that you don't see anymore biaised reason to get it but that you still want to change their decision.<br />
10. that you are getting very pissed off.<br />
11. that it's getting to be a ruined day.<br />
12. that you want now to log out and wait few days before playing again to let the nerves calm down.<br />
13. that the 13th reasons is 'da best'.<br />
14. that you can't fnd a 14th reason.<br />

Great big ball-licking suckage, very sad day indeed.<br />
<br />
/mourn the loss of yet another good agro weapon to a DPS class...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most loot council decisions are made with more than simply what class the item is best for in mind.  All things being equal maybe you got a raw deal, but I'm sure they also consider things such as how much loot each person has received previously, how active the person is etc.<br />
<br />
A GBoS serves a guild better in the hands of a ranger who raids 5 times a week than a warrior who raids 2x a week assuming the ranger knows how to manage his agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it serves the guild poorly when the ranger uses it 5 times a week and even more poorly when he uses it 6 times a week. stun procs do not become a ranger. he could have gotten a velium gemmed longsword for 14k (veeshan price) and it would have served him just as well without the annoying stun proc. good raid attendance is no excuse for giving an item to a class that has no business using it. my sympathies to you.</div></div><hr />

Most competent Rangers will be more than able to work around the stun proc - the class has a history of having to manage it's aggro.</div></div><hr />

All he needs to do is off hand it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My name is Jolt. I was introduced in the kunark era. I'm really great for keeping hate low, so when an item like stun goes off, I can make sure the ranger doesnt get agro! &lt;3<br />
<br />
if he got an eb weapon there'd be a big problem, but there is a dd component to this item, and it is a nice ranger 1hs, I used mine til I destroyed it thinking it was a tactics trash sword. :o</div></div><hr />

;;!;; for all the warrior who are waiting to get their GBoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&lt;--- has a ranger with a GBoS.<br />
<br />
<br />
I used it.  I bagged it.  I apologized to the warrior who lost it to me on a pickup.<br />
<br />
Sure, it has nice dps, but these were the problems i as a ranger had with it. <br />
<br />
1. While swinging it i was forced to mem jolting blades (jolt proc) versus Cry of Thunder (150 dd proc) to manage my aggro.<br />
2. Even with this i occasionally had to take time out of my meleeing to jolt.<br />
3. LDoN augments were not out yet, therefore i was limited to grouping with paladins/shadowknights.<br />
4. It has a nice ratio for a 1hander, but its dps does NOT stack up with the tower 2hander (GSoFW) ... it really isnt even close.  Once you train the proper aa's they are in completely different ballparks.<br />
<br />
So, speaking as a ranger.... If you want to use your bow, equip your epics and have at it.  If you want to do melee dps, grab a GSoFW (much more common than GBoS) and have fun with it.   You'll get a greater degree of dps for a lesser overall hate, thus allowing you to use some other spiffy tools including nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Look at the brightside, at least it wasn't a BoC</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are missing the point. the agro problem adds to the other problem ... which is that for a ranger it isnt a very good weapon. its at best only comparable to the velium gemmed longsword and at worst outclassed by many 2handers that can be picked up relatively cheaply in the bazaar. the need to jolt is an added nuisance which i presume reduces the effective dps to less than that of the longsword. raids (even easy ones like this) shouldnt be conducted just so that a ranger doesnt have buy such affordable weapons.<br />
<br />
as for &quot;a history of having to manage its aggro&quot; this is one good example of why a ranger has to &quot;manage his agro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good grief, you lost out on a piece on loot. Get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It can be a decent ranger weapon: we farmed the Towers a while and most of our rangers and bards have them (we were looking for BP molds and kept getting the damned blades). Obviously you are in a situation where you are with people who can kill Eindride, so just kill him again: bet you see more blades than BPs :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Blades for us were always really rare .... 1 in 6+ kills generally.  We usually always got BP's and shields .... fucking shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">back when i did the towers, blades were VERY common. i even recall getting 2 in one kill once. usually we'd get mantel and sword, less commonly sword/mantel and BP, and only once have i ever seen a shield, when it dropped no one even knew it was on his loot table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">what about the good ole CHOS/SOBtS combo that seems to be the mininum for warrior's agro?  Let the ranger die, and get over it.  Everyone loses loot.  The more you stress is, the less fun the game is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Whats this jolt you all speak of?  Honestly, I don't personally know any ranger that has even memmed jolt in the past year... I'd rather die than jolt... seriously =p<br />
<br />
In all honesty its a pretty nice ranger sword.  The stun proc, while yes it adds agro, shouldn't hold up to 2-4 agro procs from a decently equipped warrior... and our base melee isn't really all that much higher than yours at that stage of the game, even considering you guys are tanking.  Who knows, maybe he likes to tank on occasion.</div></div><hr />
