=====================================<br />
<br />
A few notes:  The Shinai procs a -50 atk debuff.  Torrin swung more because of flurries.  I gave them both that crappy offhand to give them the same weapon delays.  I left Coral's 45% haste item on because I figured 4% more haste would be negligible in terms of more ripostes.<br />
<br />
For those of you who say one hour is a small sample size, I'll just say that the extra few minutes I trimed off to make it one hour exactly had a rather long stretch of the monk taking very little damage.  I'm not going to sit here CHing myself more than an hour at a time though.<br />
<br />
I'll probably do another parse w/o the shinai later.  I forgot about the debuff until after I had already started.<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
<br />
- Strikethrough is bugged on warriors.  This shit is broken like stun resist for us.<br />
<br />
- Mobs seem to dodge, parry, and riposte monks more than warriors.<br />
<br />
- Monks tank damn well.<br />
<br />
edit: on second thought, given that monks seem to get dodged, parried, etc more, the strikethrough numbers become more reasonable.  TM may still be lowering it some though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. The average hit on the monk is higher, but he had much better avoidance. Probably due to the +45 avoidance?<br />
<br />
But the +avoidance mod is also alot easier to get for monks(and they can get alot more than the +20 or so warriors can), so it is a relevant comparison imo.<br />
<br />
If you run the test again you should probably use the same mob though if possible, and not 2 different ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The regen on the guards is too slow.  They are all the same level with the same max/min hits though, so I'm 99.99% sure they are all the same.<br />
<br />
The leather legs from Rallos have 25 avoidance on them alone.  The time tunic has 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 45 Avoidance would be vastly more than made up for by the four hundred AC gap, I would think.  Since the only Avoidance parse I have seen was here, and decried as total bunk second-hand, I tend to lean towards the school of thought that Avoidance is still not properly quantifiable.<br />
<br />
Is this a test of itemization, or a test of innate modifiers and combat skills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't like the -atk.<br />
<br />
How many hits were for max on the warrior and how many for max on the monk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a fairly biased test if you don't use gear with the same +avoidance on both. -50 atk won't affect the hit/miss but will show up in the damage distribution, and on a mob that low level already will probably skew it further than you'd expect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that it's a fairly biased test.  Is the mob really that unaccurate?  Normal exp mobs hit about 45-55% of the time.  Or does your 10 avoidance really make the mob miss 10% more of the time, I doubt this.  It's likely just because the mob.  Maybe try without avoidance mods, just for a baseline on the mob, and use the same NPC, or try another NPC that hits like a normal exp mob (yeah I know running the test then will be hard/suck).<br />
<br />
The 'warrior mitigation' and shielding do seem to work as your avg hit was quite a bit better than the monk.  But it also looks like monk avoidance works (better) as the monk took less DPS.<br />
<br />
I think the strikethru data is incredibly inaccurate as the parse is too short to get any useful data on that.  Maybe run the test 10x and then combine your strikethru data.  Looks like some bad rolls just skewed your data.  I've got 5% strikethru and some fights I get none, some fights I get 2-3 in a single combat round.  The only thing broken about strikethru is that it doesn't stop ripostes from hitting you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In this parse, the monk avoided 14.5% more hits (1 - 33.55/39.26), while the warrior mitigated 12.6% more damage per hit (1 - 76.5/87.55).<br />
<br />
Not counting hitpoints (if you have a non CH healer) the monk tanks 1.145/1.126=1.7% better than a warrior.<br />
<br />
fully buffed warrior HP is 9450+330+544=10324<br />
fully buffed monk HP is 7713+330+544=8587<br />
<br />
HP ratio is 20% more HP for warriors.<br />
<br />
End result  Warriors tank (1.2)(1.126)/(1.145) = 18% better than a monk if you get full CHs.<br />
<br />
End result is, this test needs to be repeated to see if the results remain near the same.  Its great data though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't the results biased a bit based on level of mob and era/attack of mob (luclin)?<br />
<br />
Basically, aren't you seeing diminishing returns form the AC gap<br />
as a 1600 AC ((especially with an Attk debuff)) is more than enough to get a high percentage of minimum hits?  While 2k AC is so over the top, to not have enough value.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean you could test both against a train from Mistmore ((and no not the ldon one)) and common sense tells me a 65 time geared monk going to do better because its going to be minimum hits regardless and still the monk will be missed more.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see this test done vs mobs with better attack that are more normal xp/killed mobs by a char of this level.<br />
<br />
at least ldon mobs, or tier1, or better if you did tier2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About strikethrough:  I have 10% strikethrough normaly, so I tested the difference between 5% and 10% once.  I ended up with 98 vs. 228, but in that time I also increased my CE by 15.   So if CE affects strikethrough, I'd say the effect is bugged on warriors like stun resist.  Keep in mind I also had 25 CE during this parse.<br />
<br />
Strikethrough also goes off less if the mobs parry, dodge, etc less.  Attacking through enrage will give you a lot more strikethroughs.  This would explain why the monk got more, but does it explain the entire gap?  I think TM may be screwing with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps it's just me, but when I look at all these parses lately, especially this one, it's pretty much meaningless to me.<br />
<br />
You can't really draw any conclusions as far as comparing between the two classes really because there are numerous variables here.  <br />
<br />
For example, warrior has 400~ more AC, and I'm unsure a SH guard would be represent that as good as more recent NPCs.  Then you have all the skill issues such as the monk has 35 more avoidance.  It appears the monk avoided more hits, but is that because of the avoidance or because of something else?<br />
<br />
I realize people want to see real world setups but when there are so many variables and even things we don't fully understand, it seems relatively pointless to try to draw any conclusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its an interesting parse.<br />
<br />
I do however think that most of what is said in the thread is pretty true.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be thinking to myself as a monk..woot I can tank well, off of this parse. I knew that as a PoTime monk I could tank fairly decently against 2 expansion old content already.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
<br />
If you used a Blue con Mob from PoInnovation...Tin Guard from Factory entrance.<br />
<br />
Would that be more likely to use the higher AC then a Luclin Era mob?<br />
<br />
If so I would suggest you use that mob.<br />
<br />
Firstly, I used this mob as parse data to see if there was any difference in 0 avoidance and +25 Avoidance. I noticed when I used this mob that I did not have to CH myself.<br />
<br />
I sat a cleric on a horse and used Sup Elixir. And could go from 60 to 100 health whlist it was on me. The cleric remained FM the entire time too.<br />
<br />
The added bonus of this, is the fact that the Sup doesn't have any aggro, so you don't have to attack.<br />
<br />
Therefore ripostes will mean nothing, as their won't be any.<br />
<br />
Hell you could even stand sideways on to the mob, this way even when you riposte, you won't get riposted back, and yet all your defensive skills still fire off...dodge, block and riposte for Monks.<br />
<br />
Put yourself in a corner too so you are not knocked out of range.<br />
<br />
Whilst the difference in Avoidance is important, I would honestly say that if Avoidance is that much easier to come by for a monk, which I think it is, then it should be a part of the test.<br />
<br />
You should not try and normalize that. That is a part of the game now, if Monks are more likely to have a higher rating of Avoidance then include it.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand, you have not taken Avoidance items that you could have, that would match the monk, then you should normalize it.<br />
<br />
If you are going to normalize the Avoidance, then really, you must also normalize the AC value, as you are not looking are real ingame situations and are just testing the difference in damage taken to hits avoided between the two, and everything must be normalized.<br />
<br />
As it is, leave the avoidance, leave the warriors Extra AC and you will see a 'real' ingame scenario between the two classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lythe</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*BZZZZT*,  not correct Solinar,  you've added the unmitigatable minimum hit into the mitigation calculation.  In a situation where the average hit is well less than twice the damage bonus of course mitigation doesn't look very effective,  but that situation really isn't representative of real world content.  Now,  lets look at it properly. Defining:<br />
<br />
Mitigation coefficient = (avg - min) / (Max - Min)<br />
<br />
C_Mnk = (87.55 - 46) / (157 - 46) = 0.374<br />
C_War = (76.5 - 45) / (156 - 45) = 0.284<br />
<br />
So actually,  the monk is mitigating:<br />
<br />
(C_mnk - C_war)/C_war = 31.7% worse than the warrior....<br />
<br />
And this is in the so called &quot;diminishing returns&quot; regime where both characters aren't that far from minimum hits....<br />
<br />
Now,  this mob has a DI/DB of 111/(20*46) = 0.12. I.E.  if you were tanking this uber mob (add a zero on the end of all the damage!) you'd use EVASIVE,  not DEFENSIVE :p.<br />
<br />
Take a more &quot;normal&quot; PoP type mob with a DI/DB = 0.25  and high enough atk that warrior mitigation is about ~40%, and predict.....<br />
<br />
monk mitigation = 1.317*40% = 52.7% <br />
<br />
(Yes,  this is a guess,  but its probably biased towards making the monk look better than he really is...  the warrior is further from the distribution tail of diminishing returns now.)<br />
<br />
Now,  lets compute the ratio of average hits:<br />
<br />
War = DB * ( 1 + (0.25*20) * 0.4) =  3* DB<br />
Monk = DB * ( 1 + (0.25*20) * 0.527) = 3.635*DB<br />
<br />
So....  on average the monk gets hit 21% harder every slap.<br />
<br />
Doesn't look too rosey does it for the poor old monk,  and remember,  that's a fairly conservative estimate of the difference in mitigation.  <br />
<br />
Also,  we haven't touched the most important aspect...  the probability of lethal damage spikes,  which is massively greater for the poor monk (and that would still be true even if monks avoided alot better than anyone else, which they don't except for the extra from block!).  Or the difference in HP etc...<br />
<br />
Anyway,  that just shows what we all know,  monks (*without a chain of clerics permabuffing them with bulwark of vie and 6 quarm loots/full phase 5 gear!) get slapped a sodding lot harder than any other hybrid or melee.<br />

<br />
Overall Id say that monks defensive capabilities are pretty ok now, considering they can still beat warriors at tanking in rare circumstances.<br />
<br />
Now their offensive capabilities on the other had, need some help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think we really do know this. It would be interesting to see the same parse for, say,  a warrior, a paladin and a beastlord with the same displayed AC as the monk, and another one where they are wearing the same amount of worn AC (which will lead to a different displayed AC, of course).<br />

<br />
Soru: take a look at the ACs different classes have on EQ rankings or somewhere and you'd see that comparing classes with the same displayed AC number hasn't been valid since Velious/NToV era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be interesting to see though.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't tell us anything about how well a monk tanks compared to a warrior in the game.<br />
<br />
It would however tell us if the Monk Mitigation equates to more damage then the monk skill Block.<br />
<br />
For example, in comparable AC models, would the monk skill Block save him from more damage then the extra he takes from having a mitigation penalty.<br />
<br />
That would be interesting to know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What encounters to monks tank better than warriors?<br />
<br />
I'm curious.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that Shadowhaven guards aren't really an &quot;encounter.&quot;<br />

And everything I've seen indicates Warriors do pretty good at tanking Fennin Ro anyways.<br />

So what stuff out there are monks &quot;better tanks than warriors?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You actually think monks tank LDoN normal missions BETTER than warriors?<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
That's funny.<br />
<br />
Can a monk tank LDoN normal missions?<br />
<br />
Of course they can.<br />
<br />
Do they tank them better than warriors? <br />
<br />
Not even close.<br />
<br />
I mean, I guess a Time level monk might be able to do a comprable job to a VT geared warrior or something like that.<br />
<br />
But you take one representative of each class at about the same level of the game and the warrior is the better option.<br />
<br />
You're all warriors. Why am I even having to explain this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time level monks tank significantly better than Time warriors for all practical purposes in LDoN missions due to Mend/Stonestance.  Since the chance of dying is practically zero for both characters, a monk can use Mend/Stonestance as often as it'll refresh since there's no point to save them for emergencies.  This means, even without slow, you're looking at a monk not even taking damage around 20% of the time.  Now what happens when Mend &amp; Stonestance are both down?  Usually the monks just go back to 'chain pulling', and even if not, it's pretty trivial for a monk to pass the aggro to any other tank.  Since tank classes are dime a dozen a monk can pretty much always not tank when he's actually going to take damage.  <br />
<br />
So for all practical purposes Time monks never take damage tanking in LDoN normal.  If you actually slow the mob, the % of time a monk can tank without taking any damage goes way up.</div></div><hr />

If you're a time geared monk and you do LDoN normal, you're a pussy. Go try and tank some hard as a monk and come back to tell us how it went.</div></div><hr />

<br />
90% of my guild does nearly exclusively hard, I can't bear to do normal anymore, I'd rather not play than mow through another piss easy dungeon with weak mobs where you can go by with a shaman as main healer and main tank. I like the better time / point ratio that hard provides as opposed to the meager hp won by upgrading your stone. To each their own I guess.<br />
Anyway, my point being that the fact that a monk is better than a warrior on normal is moot, since a ranger, a shaman, hell a Time geared chanter would be a good hard Main Tank.</div></div><hr />

Dont sit there and ask what encounter a monk can tank better than a warrior at when this thread is about an encounter where a monk arguably tanked better than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Get your head out of your asses for long enough to stop whining about monk defensive abilities to realize most warriors are ok on your side in thinking that monks need a little help.  Just not in the defensive area.<br />
<br />
Warriors dont have much, is us being the best mitigating tank in almost all situations and just about nothing else (no ultilty, low DPS compared to damage classes, etc) too much to ask?  All warriors have is the ability to tank and even have to struggle to do that (due to shitty aggro).<br />
<br />
If you think monk mitigation needs a boost on top of your better than warrior avoidance, you need to be trolling somewhere else.  Your not gonna get any sympathy from this board on monk mitigation concerns after that parse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;after that parse&quot;?<br />
You are joking right?<br />
<br />
You want to use a parse against a lvl 55 mob that doesn't have its offensive skills maxed (this means avoidance will give a large increase) to say monks tank ok.  Or how about that the mob had a -50atk debuff on it when the monk was tanking.  <br />
<br />
I have a parse (though small) of a monk and pally tanking a skeletal scholar on hard in a couple mira adventures.<br />
<br />
I had 1800ac buffed and 40 avoidance.  Paladin was at 2100ac and 10 avoidance.<br />
<br />
Mob hit pally 50.5% of the time.<br />
Mob hit monk 47.5% of the time.<br />
<br />
The average hit was 11.4 DI for the monk and 8.5 DI for the pally.  I mitigated 34% worse.  Or the pally mitigated 25% better depending on how you want to look at it.  What is more important is the hit distribution.<br />
<br />
18% of the time I was hit for DI1-5<br />
36% of the time the pally was hit for DI1-5<br />
<br />
32% of the time I was hit for DI16-20<br />
21% of the time the pally was hit for DI16-20<br />
<br />
This is why monks have a hard time taking damage.  I didn't even say tanking.  If you think warriors have it hard tanking try it as a monk.  It is very hard to take agro as a monk.  Once we get it, we can keep it ok.  <br />
<br />
Obviously my parse was no where near adequate.  I just wanted to give you an example.  10-20% difference in damage intake doesn't sound bad at all.  Until you get those 4 hits in for DI16-20.  Which is FAR more likely to happen to a monk than any other class that melees.  Every time I die, it isn't because I was slowly beaten down.  I get to 50% health and then get one rounded, 4-6 hits for 1000+ and it happens nearly every raid.  <br />
<br />
Time monks are fine defensively.  We finally get more avoidance than other classes which means we finally have a meaningful avoidance advantage that monks were ALWAYS supposed to have other than block.  But other than that I just don't give a rats ass about tanking.  I just don't have the tools to do it.  At the very least I would need taunt.  Otherwise I can get on a loose mob in a raid and beat on it for ever while it is killing casters and finally a taunt class will step in and take it.<br />
<br />
But please don't try to say that this poor parse (albeit well meant and other than the atk debuff fairly good) is enough to say that monks tank well.</div></div><hr />

If anything they're very unfavorable to the monk because mitigation matters a lot against their high attack ratings.<br />
<br />
This also suggests that monk never tank worse than 25% than a Paladin outside of LDoN because nothing in PoP has remotely comparable attack rating.  Note that while the Paladin always tank 25% better (assuming equal amount of AC gives equal amount of benefit), there's no real difference between no problem tanking or 25% better than no problem hence lower attack mobs makes monks tank better.</div></div><hr />

The trivial trash mob I was refering to was the shadowhaven guard :).   Be careful to separate &gt;&gt;&gt;tanking&lt;&lt;&lt; from mitigation though,  as we all know its a completely different kettle of fish (or else warriors wouldn't have problems with knights etc... in the first place!)  However,  when pure melees main functions are either <br />
1) being hit or <br />
2) hitting things,  <br />
Getting hit e.g. 25% harder while having less HP and no spellbook is still quite significant compared to the advantage of being hit 4% less often and so on, especially given the current state of *overall* ingame DPS.  Anyway,  draw from this what you will, but please no more extrapolations to monks being ubertanks based on forgetting about DB/DI ratios and Avg/DB ratios!<br />

I have actually seen nothing to support mobs over 60 having radically different attk ratings.  Xegony has the same hit distribution of trash mobs in earth.  Emp Ssra has the same hit distribution of Xegony.  Saryrn has the same hit distribution as Emp Ssra.  Same as Avatar of War, etc, etc.  Mobs that aren't/can't be debuffed are an exception.  Fennin for example.  Druids can't land their fire atk debuffs on him.<br />
<br />
I think the attack of any mob over 60 is directly related to 250 + mob level.  Though I have no way to prove this.</div></div><hr />

I dont think that this parse is exactly definitive and the end all be all of monk/warrior AC comparisons.  My first response basically looked at some numbers and then said that this parse should be repeated to get anything relevant out of it.<br />

I do however feel monk tanking abilities are not as out of whack as they think they are.  Play a warrior. Its not like things dont hit us.  You might be suprised how much damage a warrior feels like he takes while tanking.<br />

I parsed myself against an orc pawn and with block it missed 99% of the time.<br />

Whereas on a PoTime warrior you see it only missed 96% of the time, whilst we both recieved the minimum hit of 1 whenever we were hit.<br />
<br />
So over the course of about 3 hours, the warrior took 5 more damage then me.<br />
<br />
So you see in THAT encounter, a monk tanks better.<br />
<br />
See he was talking about a single mob, of whatever level anywhere in the game.<br />
<br />
So technically, he could spew forth rubbish like that and be correct, but we all know that is not what was implied in the statement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, Quarm certainly doesn't.  I have a log (I was playing a warrior) of just over 1,000,000 damage from him and he only hit me for max 10% of the time.  Which is farily typical.  I have never tanked RZ so I dont know about him.<br />
<br />
I do however feel monk tanking abilities are not as out of whack as they think they are. Play a warrior. Its not like things dont hit us. You might be suprised how much damage a warrior feels like he takes while tanking.<br />
<br />
I have played a warrior, though not extensively.  And from what I have seen monks take about 10% more damage over the long term compared to warrior.  However, that extra 10% comes almost solely from hits for max damage.  I think how damage is distributed in EQ is screwy as hell.  For the most part you get spikes at min and max.  With most everything in between is evenly distributed.  So in making a class tank worse by just a bit, they tend to spike a ton making them a far worse tank than the 10% more damage over time would indicate.<br />
<br />
I don't care if they if they change our mitigation to match warriors.  It wouldn't fix us.  Monks don't have the skills (taunt and agro on demand ie spells) to be a tank.  It just pisses me off that they felt the nerf was needed in the first place. I just don't want people to see that monks are hit 10% less (ie 45% hit rate compared to 50% hit rate) and mitigate 20% worse and think that monks are really good tanks.  What you fail to realize is that extra damage comes from taking hits for maximum damage INSTEAD of taking that same hit for minimum.<br />
<br />
If hit distribution had a gaussian distribution then mitigating 20% worse and avoiding 10% more wouldn't mean that much at all.</div></div><hr />

PS Brodda thepp, this post is not in response to your statement at all.  BTW, I think I agree with you on hate capping now.  Did some looking at logs and I think hate might be capped at some percentage of current damage done to the mob.  I have procced 4k hate in the first 5 seconds against a time trial mob, and not had pull aggro off another melee who had nothing but proximatey hate on that mob.</div></div><hr />

Encounters.<br />
<br />
Leading any joe shmo warrior who happens to click on this thread to think &quot;OMG, there's raid ENCOUNTERS where monks are BETTER tanks than me!&quot;<br />
<br />
When in actuality, this ENCOUNTERS was simply a monk and a warrior standing in front of a GUARD in Shadowhaven ... a mob that you would never have any REASON to engage except out of boredom.<br />
<br />
It's like saying that monks are better suited to tank the gnome in innovation that doesn't hit back.<br />
<br />
LoL!<br />
<br />
When I ASKED what &quot;encounters&quot; do monks tank BETTER than warriors, you did not answer.<br />
<br />
You did not say, &quot;Well monks are clearly better tanks against Agnarr&quot; or &quot;Avatar of War&quot; or even &quot;Gimp_Mob_01.&quot;<br />
<br />
You simply decided to say An ENCOUNTER is anytime you engage a mob in combat.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm sure the game is broken because a MONK will, over the course of 10 hours avoid a slight bit more damage than a WARRIOR against a Shadowhaven guard that no one will EVER &quot;encounter&quot; in a combat or raid setting for any particularly GOOD reason.<br />

I chose that mob specficaly to get a longer parse.  I can't sit there and parse 900 hitting mobs for an hour.  Honestly I think people overestimate how much lower the atk is on this mob vs. later expansion 55s, if its lower at all.  I doubt my wizard could aoe 10 unslowed 400 max hit normal risk mobs without an enchanter in LDoN if they had some huge atk.<br />

If your sure of that, then go post it to the dev boards, nobody here cares what your sure of no matter how sarcastic you are.  Nobody here called for a monk nerf due to this parse.  Nobody here said monks are overpowered.  I simply said that here is a case of a blue mob that in some circumstances a monk can tank better than a warrior.  Monks are an offensive class compared to warriors.  You do considerable more damage in the end game with time equipment than a warrior does.  Warrior = tank. Rogue = pure DPS. Monk = between warrior and rogue in both tanking and DPS.  That so hard to understand?<br />

Any time avoidance becomes the primary method of damage avoidance on a mob, a monk will take less damage over time.  However, it STILL doesn't mean he is a better tank.  It STILL doesn't mean he takes damage better.<br />

That mob is lower level than the shadowhaven guard.  Meaning a monk would probably do even better.  Really would want a lvl 60 mob.<br />

I disagree to the term many.  There are a few times where warrior DPS can surpass monk DPS, but almost always, on equally geared/AA characters, a monk will outdamage a warrior.<br />
<br />
Whether its monk epic fists vs warrior epics, fangs of vydrza vs a bloodfrenzy, shinai of the ancients vs darkblade, or staff of transcendence vs a vanazir, typically equal level weapons for a monk will outdamage the same level warrior weapons.</div></div><hr />

Look at the &quot;elemental&quot; level.  Monks do not get a single pure<br />
upgrade for 2H at the elemental level.  Fiery Staff of Zha matches Ornate greatblade.  The Sol Ro Mini staff is no better than a Caens.   Warriors ((actually any 2Hs)) has more options such as BOW &amp; Sews.<br />
<br />
Look at the &quot;bazaar twink&quot; level.  Warrior weapons are much much cheaper for equivlent gear.   Windblade 10-15k BOT Staff 60-80k.   Greatstaff of Power under 1k.  There is nothing close to that itemization wise for a monk.<br />
<br />
At POT level = itemization is pretty good (either can use Van<br />
both have 1 other option))<br />
<br />
At Ssra Level = its okay for though i'd say theres more warrior upgrades than Monk<br />

Fiery Staff of Zha is 35/20 compared to ornate greatblade at 35/23.  Thats a straight 15% (same dam, 23/20 del ratio) increase in weapon melee DPS from warriors (and zhas proc is like 1 more DPS than OGB's).  Id say thats an advantage.<br />
<br />
The problem that you are perceiving is that caens was very overpowered for where it dropped, and you expected that DPS gap that it created to increase through expansions, and it didnt.<br />
<br />
Same problem exists for the Blade of War.  Its simply too high of a ratio for the area it drops in.  Top 2h in the game for a warrior is only slightly better than it.  That doesnt mean, however, that we should significantly buff all warrior weapons post BoW to make up for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Average DPS is a lot less important than how rarely you hit a spike, expecially with tanking in PoP, hence why people are so concerned about riposte, not for the very moderate increase in DPS taken, but for the increase in frequency in spikes.<br />
<br />
VZ - the highest DPS mob in game does 1900 DPS or so, meaning a 5 second line would work on a tank in theory - however what kills people are the 10k DPS spikes he puts out.<br />
<br />
Assuming a monk takes roughly equal damage, but takes it in a much more spiky form it still means that they are unusable for tanking hard hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />

For something that'd require more mitigation... Tallon Zek comes to mind with 800-3000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The interesting thing about Fennin is ...<br />
<br />
While all the focus right now seems to be on the 2 monks from AO that tanked Fennin, it's like we all forget that warriors could and did tank Fennin long before Plane of Time was ever entered.<br />
<br />
So, are monks &quot;better&quot; tanks for a Fennin fight? <br />
<br />
I'm inclined to say no. Not better.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between being just as good as ... and better.<br />
<br />
And the best a monk can hope for is being just as good a tank as a warrior once the plane of time has been utterly pillaged.<br />

Any time avoidance becomes the primary method of damage avoidance on a mob, a monk will take less damage over time.  However, it STILL doesn't mean he is a better tank.  It STILL doesn't mean he takes damage better. <br />
<br />
Actually that's exactly what it means. If over a given time period character A takes less damage than character B, he is a better tank. Simple as that. It makes no difference HOW he takes less damage. The only reason a monk isn't a better tank than a warrior, assuming this parse scales to other high end mobs, is due to the hp difference between monks and warriors. It all comes down to how much healing attention you need IMO.</div></div><hr />

  <br />

I have 2 parsed evasive fights vs saryrn, one she did 950ish dps, the other she did 1100.  Thats far lower than i ever parsed vs fennin evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will say that I think time monks are just fine defensively with the introduction of avoidance.  This is the avoidance difference monks always should have had.  I wish they would remove all avoidance mods and give all monks a flat 60 avoidance though.  The monk ac bonus sure doesn't seem to be avoidance based.  Which is a shame.<br />
<br />
I took two parsings of myself tanking Vindicator and a pally.  While they were only 4-5min long I did take slighly less dps.  (502 vs 515 dps)  However, I took nearly twice the percentage of max hits that he did. (16.4% max for monk vs 8.9% max for the pal.)  So I was more difficult to heal due to spike dps.  This is a paladin though.  A warrior would take slightly less hits for max compared to a paladin.<br />
<br />
Of course the ability to take damage is just a part of being a tank as warriors well know.  I can be the first to see a loose mob in camp and start trying to agro it only to have a ranger or beast lord step in 5-10 seconds later and get agro.<br />
<br />
Actually, time beasts are probably the best group tank in the game atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You take less damage from Saryrn because Saryrn melees for less than Fennin Ro.  How much DPS a mob does does not determine what disc you should use.  If Quarm hits for 3800-3801 it'd obviously be a good idea to use evasive over defensive.  If Quarm hits for 0-6000 then obviously you want to use defensive.  Min hits cannot be mitigated, ever, so the bigger the min hit is relative to the max hit, the more useful it is to avoid a hit then mitigate a hit.  <br />
<br />
For a more practical example, Doomfire Darkfiends hit somewhere around 1000-1300.  Now let's say warrior gets hit 50% of the time, and our mitigation is so good that we always get hit for min.  So we take 1000 damage 50% of the time, which means we take on average 500 per hit.  Now let's say we have a monk, they don't mitigate anything and always take max hit, but they only get hit 40% of the time.  On average, they take 520 per hit.  As you can see in this example, the monk not mitigating anything at all didn't put them that far behind the warrior that mitigated everything, because the min hit was high enough that the saving from avoiding more hits outweighs mitigation.</div></div><hr />

How exactly would it be better to take a class that gets 15pct (made up number) more damage spike rounds / kill in one or 2 rounds, just because theoretically that class would over time take less damage.<br />
<br />
Sorry but I take the warrior for hard tanking over a monk any day of the week.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spikes are a flawed argument.  You have DI to deal with the spikes.  We are at the days of 10K HP monks.  A warrior's extra 2K HP doesn't protect you from one round kills anymore than extra avoidance.  I don't know how many times I have died and thought 'if I avoided an extra hit I'd have lived.'  This isn't Luclin where you can have so much HP that it not only takes one but actually 2 (or more) rounds before a boss can kill you even in the worst case scenario.  Quarm's maximum one round damage is 3800 X 4 = 14400 which means theoractically it doesn't matter who's tanking because you'll all get one rounded.  Of course this doesn't actually happen, because mitigation and avoidance exists.  Sure you can still get one rounded with all the mitigation and avoidance in the world, but it's also extremely unlikely. <br />
<br />
If I take less damage than you on average, I tank better than you.  It's not like you're having a monk tanking with 5K HP and avoiding 90% of all hits anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dmg spikes are a valid counter point, however the longer it takes for mobs to kill you, the less damage spikes are a bad thing.  I would disagree monks are better tanks, even if they do take less damage over time.  The hp gap, even though less than 2k hp now a days, would make CH less efficient on a monk.  Combined with spikes, it's more than enough to counter the small less damage over time they take.<br />
<br />
However its still retarded that monks take less damage over time than warriors vs ANY mob.</div></div><hr />
