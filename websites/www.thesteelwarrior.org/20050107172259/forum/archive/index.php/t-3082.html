I'm wondering if warriors have anythign sort of like Mantle of the rainmaker actually. I've had a 3 of these drop on greed raids I attended and I actually won the rolls and had to sell looting rights for 10kish :/</div></div><hr />

They are -10 str some small AC but 55 hit points and 15 Stamina.<br />
<br />
So for a level 60 warrior that is 155 hit points in that slot assuming you dont have Stamina maxed.<br />

It takes one group to fight down there and camp then.<br />

Its a very do-able quest, with perhaps the exception of the drop now found at the bottom of the new Hole.  When I did it, I was able to complete the entire thing with 4 friends and 2 bots.  I think the Hole may now need a slightly bigger force but I honestly haven't done any research on it.</div></div><hr />

How does raw hp &gt; sta hp if in the end I have less hp total because I go with raw hp please explain to me the mathmatics behind this equation.  Simple, STA is capped, raw HP are not. Once you get to the point that you can max STA with buffs, all other STA is wasted (other than to free up a buff slot). Look at it this way -<br />
<br />
Warrior_01:<br />
6500hp unbuffed, 305sta unbuffed, +2000hp raw from items<br />
8902hp raid buffed, 305sta raid buffed<br />
<br />
Warrior_02:<br />
6500hp unbuffed, 255sta unbuffed, +2200hp raw from items<br />
9102hp raid buffed, 305sta raid buffed<br />
<br />
While these numbers are made up, they are pretty close to accurate. If you are in a position where you are maxed STA now, but you can trade 50 STA for 200 HP raw, you'll end up with about the same HP unbuffed, but 200hp higher once you get buffed. You will always be better off in the long run by going raw HP over STA HP since STA is capped.<br />
<br />
As for good shoulder choiced, there are quite a few good options:<br />
<br />
Forged Shoulderpads<br />
AC: 16 STR: +5  DEX: +5  HP: +60  SV FIRE: +10<br />
<br />
Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates<br />
AC: 31 DEX: +5  WIS: +8  INT: +8  AGI: +10 HP: +65  SV COLD: +8  SV MAGIC: +8<br />
<br />
Crystallized Acid Pauldrons<br />
AC: 25 STA: +2  WIS: +4  INT: +4  AGI: +3  HP: +50  MANA: +50  SV DISEASE: +6  SV MAGIC: +6  SV POISON: +6<br />
<br />
or if you are on a tight budget, these can usually be found cheap -<br />
Matchless Dragonwing Mantle<br />
AC: 15 HP: +65  MANA: +65</div></div><hr />

So considering I'm at about 211 sta normally I -think- I'd rather just get sta hp right now as I don't always get to bring a shaman around to buff me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chokidai hide is probably the easiest to get for your time.  If you have any kind of half decent group at all, Chardok is cake. <br />
<br />
And if you're looking for a challenge, Barbed Rubi from CT is a decent upgrade from Chokidai.  It's basically the same, but a lot less negative stats.<br />
<br />
However, you're wrong here<br />
<br />
Str of elements was my goal for a long time but the sad fact of the matter is that 10 sta and 30 hp is almost as much as 100hp is not more <br />
<br />
1 sta = 6hp at it's best.  So 90hp is still less than 100, not to mention the fact that eventually you're going to have max stamina and want to start dropping some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry I don't think seearching for Yael is worth 5 hp (Yael is the only drop I need for it). As I said before, I'm not near the sta cap and since I'm not in an elemental guild I don't think I'd have to fear hitting it for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's seriously not that difficult, especially now with AAs and LDON STA augmentations.  I remember when I thought 200STA would be impossible, but if you are smart about bizarre buys its just not an issue.  Now getting slots with good HP on the other hand....</div></div><hr />

I would gain sta AND hp from Zek gloves, face shoulders and helm. But since I can't wear them, there's realy no warrior eqiptable item for that's even decent for a mid to high end warrior. <br />
<br />
I think it's insanely funny that pallys/sks are already babied enough through itemization and get nearly everytyhing we do but they ALSO get a 100hp 12sta shoulder piece from the BoT towers. I've looked through Lucy at everything &gt;= 10sta and &gt;= 50 hp, there's not one item that exists outside of a massive raid force and I'm upset about it.<br />
<br />
I demand a revamp of tunare diety armor /cry</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about the rest of the slots (you can do an ally search as well as I can), but Skyshrine armor &gt; FH for gloves. <br />
<br />
And just FYI none of the FH slots you mentioned actually have STA in them so the point on stamina remains the same....</div></div><hr />

Okay, I just ran the Str of elements through magelo, without it my base is 5333 (I don't have my charm on because I'm too lazy to edited to the proper setting) but with the Str of Elements, I have 5338...  The Magelo numbers are deceiving though. While your unbuffed HP may only go up by 5hp, when you toss on buffs and get that 10sta back you are losing, you will end up with closer to a 70hp increase in buffed HP, which is what you care about anyway.<br />

As I said before, I'm not near the sta cap and since I'm not in an elemental guild I don't think I'd have to fear hitting it for a while.  Good news is that you don't have to get Yael any more. There is a new boss in the Hole and the report is that his guards drop the piece for SotE quest. Even more good news is that you don't have to be in an elem guild to max your STA anyway. Assuming you haven't gotten PP yet, your STA cap at 65 is 280. You can easily get a single shammy buff for 50 STA, so you really only need 230 STA to hit the cap. If your shammy has Primal Essense, then you can add another 20 STA, bringing your unbuffed minimum down to 210 which is not all that hard to hit.<br />
<br />
My twink warrior is a dwarf with a base STA of 110. Right now I think he is hitting around 260 STA unbuffed. While it would cost a fortune, every single piece of armor he wears can be bought in the bazaar. If you would rather loot the items, the only tough mob that drops any of the items I've got is the AoW. Other than the helm, everything else can be obtained with a lot less than elemental geared people. If you toss in a few 6 STA augments, it only gets that much easier to get up high enough to max your STA.<br />
<br />
Posting your Magelo would be a great help, there might be some easy HP/STA you can pick up if we can take a look at what you are wearing.</div></div><hr />

I had posted it a while back but on an old board name I had and forgot, heh. Helm of Rallos would be a huge Upgrade for me. So would boots of the storm, sadly enough I quested my ornate boots when the price of storm were at 120k and now they're down to like 60k, oh well. One other item I was loooking towards was velium encrusted gaunts perhaps. I'd like to get acid bracers, but, they're not many on my server and they're expensive as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, just saw you posted your Magelo. You have a pretty good set up as it is, it's not like your gear sucks. I don't really know the level of your guild, but you're wearing a Vindi BP so I'll assume you can do Vindi+. You also haven't commented on your cash situation so it's tough to recommend some stuff that you might not be able to get with your guild.<br />
<br />
Finish the Strength of the Elements quest since you only have 1 piece to go. It might not be a huge upgrade now, but when you pick up some sta, it will be better.<br />
<br />
I would also try to get these items (in order of biggest upgrade):<br />
<br />
Helm of Rallos Zek<br />
Stonewood or Featherwood Compound Bow<br />
Boots of the Storm<br />
Velium Encrusted Gauntlets<br />
Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
2x Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience<br />
<br />
It's probably not realistic to get all of those items quickly, but if you could get all of them, you would see an increase of 30 sta and 265 raw hp. You should be able to get the boots and the gaunts with your guild. Flags are a bit of a problem here, so you would have to buy the bow, the earring, and the rings. Good news is that prices are dropping like crazy on those items so you should be able to get a pretty good deal on them. It doesn't look like your guild has done AoW yet, but on my server you can pick up a Helm of RZ for about 100k now. A few weeks of farming LDoN for plats and spell research/trade skill items should net you a 100k at a pretty good pace.<br />
<br />
I would also swap out the Bracer of Fortitude for another ornate bracer and try to get ahold of a couple of +sta augments to make up the differnce.<br />
<br />
That should give you something to do for quite some time. Who knows, maybe you'll be able to get some nice LDoN plate items if you do a lot of exp/farming there.</div></div><hr />

ALL of the shit on there is 1 grpable,  cept for maybe my BP,  and gloves.... and I know yadda yadda 1 grped Yeli + vindi,  who cares.   and... the stuff I bought..... like my pants... which are technically soloable....  Now admitedly you can't get helanic tundra,  but still,  just take a look,  and my stam is maxxed at 65,  damn near maxxed without buffs.<br />
<br />
Just have to keep your eye's peeled on other wars gear,  and see which pieces are an upgrade for you, then go do it.  Hell,  the Va'Dyn isn't even a challenge anymore,  just TIME CONSUMING<br />
<br />
Best way to do that is just go from post to post clicking the magelo link button,  piece you don't recognize?  go look it up.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND ESPECIALLY with LDoN,  you can just adventure with friends for a few weeks,  and BAM improve your gear,  lemme show you something..... Theoretically,  <br />

Currently there's nothing that my guild can raid with a -good- chance of beating that can give me an upgrade. I joined my current guild because it gets lonely powering through AA until you can join a guild a little higher up.<br />
<br />
As for my cash situation, sad to say it's low. I've got about 20k banked and I'm never sure when I could see more. I've been trying to sell some very decent spec spells in Bazaar for weeks now and all they've done is get lower every time I log on. Also, I used to be able to get one BoT towers greed raids, but the person(s) who ran them stopped so I no longer have the chance to win a plate BP and have some insant cash (which is how I bought my Ornate arms) And I traded looting rights on mantle of the rainmaker for ornate boot mold. Very sad about that because boots of storm are now 10k under the boots mold, but oh well. Live and learn I guess.<br />
<br />
Sorguran for the most part my gear is better than yours in relatively every slot. Your charm is set at 100% of the power so I can't actually tell what your real setup/stats are like. <br />
<br />
On a side note, I don't normally check my stats with food mods because I generally keep regular food above hp/sta food unless I'm tanking named and need a little bit of extra power. Why do I do this? Because those foods get expensive and I don't normally have the time to make sure I'm eating my normal foods instead of wasting the good stuff. Also, I'd rather have my magelo reflect a lower number and then log in every day and be pleasantly suprised rather than disappointed. One last thing, I don't really have AA t spare to waste on metabolism I'd rather get innate wis first, wtf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And my charm is at 100% because my bio is always bugged,  if I set it at below 100% it goes to zero.  My hp at current is 5600 ish,  somethign like that,  I haven't been unbuffed since the last time I looked,  but it's not a huge difference between the current hp.   <br />
<br />
IF you are in a really shitty guild,  get them to do kunark dragons,  sell haste items,  and buy yourself a HoRZ.  Also,  for shoulders,  get your guild,  if you can to do HoT quest shoulders, DO.  Only hard part of that is Doze,  and he is easily 1 grpable if your not completely incompetent.<br />
<br />
I'd also reccomend you spend the four hours in Tactics (If you have the flag?) the upgrade your earings.   And at the same time camp another ornate bracer,  that would put you at.... uh..... prolly close to 6k ish,  I dunno I'm not gonna take the time to figgure it out,  but yeah none of the upgrades that would really help you are that hard to get.</div></div><hr />

But this wasn't a pissing contest on gear,  I was merely offering a little help with your gear,  and in the end the upgrade on stats is pretty important on the BM earrings.<br />
<br />
Please note also,  I said signifigantly,  try putting in the BoB or my greaves ect into your armor slots,  you'll see minor differences,  if any at all in any place other than the stats.  The only effects on ornate that are worth while are on the arms and bracer,  and if you are blind like me,  the helm.</div></div><hr />

Can we actually kill the guards without aggro the boss?<br />
<br />
Nope, just went there last night and found that out for myself.  <br />
<br />
None of us could split hit guards from him.  On top of that, the door leading into the room locks when he is agro'd and stays that way for 5-10 minutes afterwords.  The Guardian of the Seal runs much more quickly than his guards, so you'll get him all the across the room in short order.  The guards themselves are wizards, so one of them will probably cast.  We tried leading the Seal Guardian across the room and tagging one of the gargoyal guards that stayed back and casted.<br />
<br />
That didn't work.<br />
<br />
The Seal Guardian immedietly came charging after the rogue who tagged the gargoyal, even from opposite sides of the room, and the rogue had to escape.  And it's not like you can just offtank the Seal Guardian either.  He definitely triples for 980 and is unslowable.  <br />
<br />
While this part of the quest isn't a rediculous zerf fest like it was fighting Yael, it looks like it requires *MORE* people than it did before.  Unless I'm wrong, which a lot of times I am, I'm almost positive the guards cannot be split from the Guardian of the Seal.<br />
<br />

<br />
There probably is.  I won't deny that.  There are two differences between The Guardian of the Seal and Kunabyr Hailstorm though.  With Kunabyr, you have the entire sand wing to work your magic.  With the Seal Guardian which we'll just call TSG as an acronym, you don't.  Once TSG is agroed, the door leading to the chambers is locked and the only way you can open it is with Eye of Tallon/Zomm.  On top of that, the two hard hitting gargoyales that protect the chambers respawn after about 1 minute.  <br />
<br />
(That trick will also open the door to The Plane of Underfoot as well. ;))<br />
<br />
On top of that, TSG runs pretty quickly and has a pretty damn large melee range because of his tremendous size.  While it looks like you do, there's simply not enough room to train him around either, especially considering he practically one-rounds your monks.  <br />
<br />
I hope I'm wrong.  I hope to god I'm wrong actually.  <br />
<br />
The only way I can really think of pulling this off is to use someone who agro TSG and run up the hallways after a mage with Eye of Tallon/Zomm has opened the door.  The only problem I'd see with this that TSG is huge and probably won't fit up there, so he'll warp instead.   Considering hit hits for 980s, you won't last but a few seconds against him unslowed.  I was wrong, btw.  He is disease slowable.<br />
<br />
Only time will tell, I guess.  I just hope I'm wrong in the fact that you need a raid force capable of a BoT level encounter to finish the Strength of the Elements quest.  :(</div></div><hr />

&quot;1 sta = 6hp at it's best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Funny, when I take off my wars valorium ring of gallantry he loses 128 HP. 65 of that is pure HP the other 63 is from stamina. There is 8 stamina on that ring, thus I am getting almost 8 HP per stamina point.<br />

<br />
The reason your ring gives you seemingly 8hp per stamina is because you have some level of Natural or Planar Durability, which I've never seen anyone take into account in gear decisions because 10% is 10%.<br />
<br />
It's the same reason I don't call the Strength of the Elements 117hp shoulders....because it wouldn't be the same for everyone, and thus incorrect to say so.  I'm happy you have some ND done, but truly, 1 sta =6hp at level 60, up to 255 stamina.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I just ran the Str of elements through magelo, without it my base is 5333 (I don't have my charm on because I'm too lazy to edited to the proper setting) but with the Str of Elements, I have 5338... <br />
<br />
Sorry I don't think seearching for Yael is worth 5 hp (Yael is the only drop I need for it). As I said before, I'm not near the sta cap and since I'm not in an elemental guild I don't think I'd have to fear hitting it for a while.  <br />
<br />
Who's Yael? :)  He's since been removed from the zone and been replace with a new boss and I think 2 guards or so.  the guards can drop the ore....at least thats what I have been told.<br />
<br />
Also, the guards require a small raid force, think vindi.  But they dont DT like yael did.</div></div><hr />

As for my cash situation, sad to say it's low. I've got about 20k banked and I'm never sure when I could see more. I've been trying to sell some very decent spec spells in Bazaar for weeks now and all they've done is get lower every time I log on. Also, I used to be able to get one BoT towers greed raids, but the person(s) who ran them stopped so I no longer have the chance to win a plate BP and have some insant cash (which is how I bought my Ornate arms) And I traded looting rights on mantle of the rainmaker for ornate boot mold. Very sad about that because boots of storm are now 10k under the boots mold, but oh well. Live and learn I guess.  <br />

I think I mentioned it was a GREED raid. See what you do in a GREED raid is you kill the named mobs and then everybody rolls and the top rollers win and decide what the do with the item they won. Now being the reasonable person I am, I said, /rsay &quot;Highest bigger gets Mantle of the Rainmaker, send tells with offers&quot;, instead of just looting them and destroying them.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, if you see something wrong with selling looting rights to a No Drop item that I can't use even though I won the item fair and square, please let me know.</div></div><hr />

I never heard of anything like this before.  I'm assuming a lot of people on your server dont like you, cause I know I sure as hell would never group with you after seeing something like that.<br />

Rolling for &amp; looting &amp; destroying an item you cant use was even an option to you ? thats freaking unthinkable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest its even less of a decision now: add a +10 AC (Brilliant Blood Ruby of Prowess...all aug) AC:+10 from MM to the shoulder for 510 some odd pts and Ta Da a revamped chok shoulders of 15AC.  Not a bad option over spendin more pp on Rubi.<br />
<br />
But then again you could buy Rubi and upgrade the +10 and have something still more uber *or* you could buy a Rujarkin Shoulder thingy for 660pts add to it a 10ac, a +6 sta and Veng 3 to get a 18ac, 9 agi, 6 sta, 50hp veng 3 thing a ma bobby.  Lots of fun things to think about.</div></div><hr />

I agree, that is absolutely insane.<br />
<br />
I mean, I can understand the concept of a greed raid where people who are allowed to use an item can random on it, or allowing everyone to random on droppable gear, but allowing people who cannot WEAR a no drop item that is not multi questable roll on the item so they can sell loot rights is beyond horrible.<br />
<br />
If anyone tried doing that on RZ they'd probably end up kos to half of the server - or at least the guild of the person they tried selling the MQ too.</div></div><hr />

Since I couldn't use the item I won, I offered to sell looting rights. There's nothing wrong with that at all.<br />
<br />
Hell I even paid 20k a pop to loot a Great Blade of Storms and a Wicked Shank on these raids. (This was after I won a BP on the raid before, sold the ornate BP for 125k and had money to throw around).<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not -very- hated on my server, I'm sure there's people that don't like me, but not because of this. Many people did/do this an we just accept it as commonplace.<br />
<br />
Really folks, it's not THAT big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I think you will find that most peope here are going to find that behavior very &quot;suspect&quot;.<br />
<br />
That said, I would probably leave these details about how you would rather destroy an item then let someone else who shared equal responsibility to get said item have it. Especialy when you are trying to tap into the knowledge base of this board.<br />
<br />
You want us to offer you free advice and whatnot, when clearly you are not the personality type to return the favor.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I did post a bit of info on HoT the other day. :p<br />
<br />
Also yes, destroying something that somebody else could use would be a consideration, see the little raid window let's me know who's on the raids. When people send me tells if somebody on my shitlist is trying to get the item, it's considerably harder to convice me to sell to them over a lower offer from somebody who's neutral or say a friend.<br />
<br />
Somtimes there's people on a raid where I'd rather destroy it rather than helping them out. Doesn't your server have it's share of twinks?<br />
<br />
Ours does and some are so insane. And it's even worse when they claim that they're not a twink. And when I say twink I'm not talking about a crusty bp at 50. I'm talking BoC, SoD, Helm of Rallos, Crystalized Acid Bracers, Boots of the Storm, Velum Encrusted Gauntlets and a few other things at level 15. <br />
<br />
When I know a warrior was twinked out that much, I will not group with them (in LDoN where 2 tanks is reasonable) nor will I suggest my group replace me with said person because I know they didn't spend the time getting their gear or their levels so it's not safe for my group.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you don't think it as advice, but it is. If you're doing greed raids and people need that godly item but they only offer like 5k for such awesome shoulders. Yeah well, it's supply and demand.. if you want more money next time, destroy them this time, just be sure you win next time too, heh. <br />
<br />
(Note, it also helps to destroy them a few times before you get decent offers.)<br />
<br />
So there's my advice, take it or leave it, love it or hate it. But don't say I didn't give it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, note to self, don't play on fuckin Torv.<br />
<br />
How does destroying shit you can't use help you?  I'll give you a clue, it doesn't.  Rolling on no drop shit just so you can sell the loot rights on it doesn't do a goddamned thing for anyone, other than convince the rest of the world that there's a bunch of jackasses on your server.  When you fuck people over (IE : making them pay to loot a no drop item they should get in the first place), how can you seriously expect ANYTHING less than being fucked over?<br />
<br />
If there is nothing that you can use on said raid, and you have no ties to that raid via guild or friends or whatever, why are you going?  Just to remove no drop loot from the world is not the right answer.  &quot;Greed&quot; raid or not, that takes pathetic to a whole new level.  I can't believe people associate themselves with that nonsense, both in the sense of putting up with it, and being a big enough piece of shit to participate in the idea.</div></div><hr />

I know a warrior was twinked out that much, I will not group with themSo because one person can buy the items to make a better equipped warrior than yourself, you wont' group with just because they're a twink?<br />
<br />
That and the fact you rolled on an item to sell loot rights is fucking insane. I even thought that our public elemental raids didn't have the best system ever, but holy shit, I believe what you did takes the case.<br />
<br />
Greed raids don't justify your choice of action.</div></div><hr />

But that doens't say much for skill. If a friend said hey this person is actually a good tank/player, I'd be more willing to consider it. But in the example I used, the player isn't.<br />
<br />
And just to clear things up. It's not like I looked at the shoulder item and then rolled, we got a list of the 5 items that dropped, everybody present rolled, top 5 rollers win/pick. And that was what I ended up with as leftovers. Just because I can't wear it doesn't mean my roll is any less of a winning roll.</div></div><hr />
