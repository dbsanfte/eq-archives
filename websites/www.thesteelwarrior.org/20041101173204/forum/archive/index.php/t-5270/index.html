<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KeitaroSaryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I am currently a level 44 warrior and I am wondering where I should go next equipment wise.  I am in large guild that is about to start HoT raids and I can get 5k at most for equip upgrades at the moment.  Thank you in advance for your suggestions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 44 I'll assume you're not high on the list for HoT drops.  If your guild raids it seriously, though, you'll be choking on lessor armor in about a month.  Might take you a while to get a BP.<br />
<br />
You could be wearing the Baliff's boots.<br />
<br />
I'd use your cash in items you can't get in HoT.  This includes another 6/65 ring, a grimling contraption for your face.<br />
<br />
In all reality, you're doing great.  Keep racking up levels. You're in that crappy 10-level-no-skills area.  I'd hit the bazaar and replace the orc-fang earring just as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bowedup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nm on the DLB get an elite soldiers blade (think that is the name) for off hand 13/20 and stats.  great offhand for your lvl and so coomon it is cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get a set of resist gear.  most guilds had a 100 resist minimum in fire, cold, magic iirc <br />
so that may be a good place to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The guild I was in a while back wouldn't even let me go to HoT raids until I was a)Dubious or better to CoV, b)100 in MR/FR/CR, c)level 50.<br />
<br />
All of which is advice I would pass on to you.<br />
<br />
It sucks being a poor warrior. I was there bro. Work on HP and AC for your gear, and try to scrape together a separate suit of gear mainly for resists. Unless you're going to be MT for your guild, resists are key for doing HoT.</div></div><hr />
