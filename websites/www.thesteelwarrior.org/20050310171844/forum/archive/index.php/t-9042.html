<br />
The concept looks much...pointier, Maybe it's just his graphics settings. Judging from how close to the concept arts the other epics look, I'd be pretty disappointed if that's not just a settings issue.</div></div><hr />

I know as a warrior, I will be much better off with an extra 25cha.<br />

Still probably the best wep that I personally could obtain at this point, but I'm a little less than thrilled with it compared to the other classes.<br />

It's good to keep in mind that being a very short race really screws with the scale of weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would hope that it's a bit heftier looking.<br />
<br />
But I like the concept art. Then again, I always liked the LoWs--simple, clean, sword-like. The trick is to get those qualities into a weapon that looks unique.<br />
<br />
without making it, you know, pink.<br />
<br />
Really though, I'd use a good weapon if it were shaped like a wok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, given that short races weilding *any* of the other epics would still catch your eye, I'm tremendously dissapointed with our graphics.  Did they just run out of time and say &quot;Well, guess we'll just copy the Rusty Longsword graphic and throw a slightly-less-boring hilt on it&quot;?  C'mon SoE, people were complaining about the look even before OoW went live... you think you could make our epic look, well, epic?<br />
<br />
We'll probably get more &quot;What's that you're weilding?&quot; questions from our 1.0 epics than the new ones.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I would like to see it on a bigger warrior and with spell effects turned on (if the person on Prexus had them off).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's better.  If I looted that off of a mob I would probably say &quot;ooh, cool graphic&quot;, but it sure ain't the best looking epic.  It does look better on a DE than the halfling though, looks so tiny on him.  Hopefully the 2.0 will have a particle effect or something to make it a little flashier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good, clean, functional looking weapon.

I think a few of the epics are a little over-the top (SK) and this could look really good with the right particle effects.  Of course, I'll probably never own and epic 2, but oh well I'll be happy with the stats from the epic 1.5 and a mediocre looking sword.</div></div><hr />

I don't like the SK sword much, it doesn't look like a sword, it looks like it's made of rock or something.  Ours looks like it could use some bronze polish on the hilt for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took a little while for the look of Innoruuk's Voice to grow on me, at least until I read through the storyline of the quest. Once I had, I realized that it would be out right wrong for it to look like a normal sword. It's not just a weapon, it's a living, thinking creature birthed of hatred and darkness. It really ought to do the sick, disturbing pulsing with hellish life thing that the growths on the walls in Doom 3 do, but EQ just can't support that~. Innoruuk's Voice being just another sword would have been really disappointing.</div></div><hr />

It's not gaudy, it looks antique.  It has style and class without being flashy.  You know if a sword's been around that long to look antique, it's gotta be well made.  So maybe it could use some polishing, but that doesn't detract for me at all.</div></div><hr />

Getting the 2.0 could include a better texture, plus nice particle effects, because the quest involves fine-tuning the weapon you just put together. (It seems to radiate the &quot;work-in-progress&quot; appeal)<br />
<br />
As for the size and everything, it looks to be about as big as other weapons (see the DBotW that many pictures show warriors dual-wielding with it).  Not counting textures, it does look to be a pretty solid weapon with a more royal warrior-type style to it.</div></div><hr />

Being a warrior I tend to get dirty.  No prissy looking weapons please, as a matter of fact, it would be better if there were entrails and eyeballs clinging to the 1.5   :eek:</div></div><hr />

..I don't post much, but after my initial reaction of &quot;this thing sucks&quot;, it sort of begins to grow on me. I still think its ugly..but its not as bad as I first thought.<br />
I'd suggest to make it a bit larger, make the sword tip pointy, not looking like a frickin stick on a rusty hilt and revamp the texture to improve quality. Work the coloring a bit. Give it some polishing..I didn't run all over, dealing with snobby elves and shizo dwarves  to wield a rusty broadsword with a fancy hilt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how the heartwood blade was made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jim how is the ranger epic coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, how does &quot;Heartwood bow&quot; strike you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim you DUMBASS don't you check your email? we are giving them a blade now you dumbass.... god what a dumbass this goes live in a week.. dumbass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up already, easy fix! *backspace**backspace**clicktyclack*..... see? heartwood blade! all we have to do is go back thru the item database and delete the &quot;ow&quot; and paste &quot;lade&quot; on the end&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the ranger epic went live, and the bow hating rangers that live soly on the private dev boards (when the devs say ALL rangers wanted a sword and not a bow) happily proclaimed that a bow was never the intent, or was just an idea that they were kidding about... and all was golden in the lands....<br />
<br />
Until a ranger had an enchanter cast the identfiy spell on the wood and metal used in the epic and the lore said<br />
<br />
&quot;a fine metal that can be shaped to make an almost invisible bowstring&quot; the now useless heartwood the tree ent gives is even more proof... still sony insists they did not just throw in the sword.<br />
<br />
*laughs* oh well, up to the rangers to fight their battles with sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is how they designed our epic:<br />
<br />
1. soe hands a monkey a pencil and some paper<br />
2. soe takes back the paper after an hour<br />
3. they give it a name and make it live<br />
<br />
its simple and it involves no thinking on the part of soe...except the people in the so called 'customer support' area, they have to think of ways to dodge complaints by the warriors...</div></div><hr />
