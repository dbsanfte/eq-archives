<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has killed MM twice now, and wiped about 5 other times on MM. Couple times was poor timing of the camp spawn. Couple other times it was bard dying, or people (*cough* rangers using bows *cough*) agroing adds during the fight. But one of our biggest troubles is positioning him.<br />
<br />
Our first fight he ended up dying on a corner pillar and the Planar Projection spawned too high and no one got flagged. That was probably our cleanest kill. Since then we tried fighting him against a flat wall and we push him around, agro adds, have people taking ripostes and getting low health agro. Is there a way to pin him in a corner without him being pushed on top of the pillar? It's really frustrating wiping to a mob we've killed before so I'm hoping the experts can help me out.<br />
<br />
Lately we've been killing the right 2 mobs in his room, then clearing all the rest of the junk. Letting those first 2 respawn, killing them then pulling MM so we have max amount of time to kill him without adds. We got unlucky and our 1 bard took a couple ripostes and got low health agro and died. The fight went down hill from there. We have the basis strat down, it's just execution and positioning that are killing us right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">corner him till 10%..move him along wall till door at 10% and finish kill with a pin making sure clerics move with mt. whoop de do, proj doesnt spawn on wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everytime we've killed him, he dies on the pillar, but the projection always pops in the corner (at the tank spot). <br />
<br />
Did you try having someone aggro the Projection and FD once its moved? Not sure if PPs can be aggroed or not, so it might not work; just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Corner MM.<br />
<br />
Once he's at 5-10% depending on your DPS have the MT<br />
run out of the corner (i mean NON STOP) sooner or later<br />
he will get far enought befor the summon sequence is refreshed<br />
and MM will follow and die far from the pillar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just tag the projection and drag him down.  Get a mage to summon your monks one of those right click dispell staves and drag him down with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or you could just teach your melees how to push properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Corner pin everytime, never had the PP show anywhere but behind the pillar where MT stood, sounds like bad luck to me /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We have a bard chain harmony the two mobs near our corner so they don't become a problem, then just pull him to the corner and commence to beat down.  He dies in the pillar but the projection always spawns behind it where the tank is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just bad luck, heard of it happening before though. its not always easy to move him out of the corner either as he sometimes roots the MT, but we have walked him down the wall for a kill or two, MT just needs to call flipping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So are we the only people that have always wall pinned him instead of corner? Let's rangers stand in corner and use archery, always seemed to work goof. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We corner him 100% of the time, never had a problem with flags/projection. Sounds like bad luck.<br />
<br />
Ignore the advice to tag/move the PP. You haven't been able to attack, cast on, or oitherwise aggro that PP for a while now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We have always cornered him as well and while he may die on the pilllar, every time the PP has fallen on my head in the corner I tanked in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rangers could still hit him when we pinned in the corner with pillar /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Patch addressed this issue today, Maybe they got it right, so he can die anywhere again.<br />
<br />
Even though it would really be great if pallys would learn you don't have to cast those stunns just because the gem is refreshed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">spawning in the middle is kinda a pain in the ass if you ask me, now you gotta kill all the room repops in order get to the pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why, cats dont see invis, PP does, so invis up, hail projection, problem solved.<br />
<br />
P.S. was just informed that my first statement isnt true.<br />
Cats outside MM room dont see invis, but those in his room do.<br />
<br />
Only possible alternative i see now would be bards lulling the cats in room as bard lull (silent song of quellious) has a considerable longer duration than pacification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">assuming he's pulled to one of the corners near the door, there should only be 2 spawns there. if your actually doing MM than i'll assume you can do the emp encounter. on that same line of logic your enchanters should easily enough be able to keep the dogs mezzed. the mobs in that room have what? a 5 min respawn time? it would be far easier to keep them controled then to kill them and wait for them to respawn and probably kill 2 or 3 people before a tank can get to them and grab agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Killed MM yesterday after the patch.<br />
<br />
PP does spawn in the center of the room, closer to the throne.  <br />
<br />
I had no problem running up uninviz and hailing him...but, uh, we offtanked like 5 cats during the fight because some asshat flag-share momo ran to the raid late. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if its accurate to say the cats don't see inviz.  I didn't test the cats inside, but the cats on the WAY see inviz.  It would be strange to have the harder cats near the throne immune....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I just edited my first post, cats in room supposedly see invis while those outside dont (was told by raid leader, but will ask trackers).<br />
<br />
I just know for sure that the cats that spawn around the GY dont see invis, same as the human guards.<br />
Might be level dependent though, most cats are blue cons, but a bunch (even outside MM room) are yellow cons that are unmezzable as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">All cats can spawn either yellow or blue.  As far as I know, all cats inside mm room are see invis, all outside are non see invis (i've only checked this 3 times so I could be wrong - it could be that yellow cats outside room do see invis).  I've never seen a case where someones alt or whatever couldnt get to mm room from zone in after the kill using invis.<br />
<br />
Yellow cats are immune to mez + all cats have ridiculously high MR, which makes mezing them a poor option imo &amp; makes lull/pacification a gamble at best.<br />
<br />
For our 1st mm kill, we kept the nearby cats lulled &amp; killed in a corner, every kill since then we have simply killed them all &amp; pulled mm &amp; killed him prior to respaw.  <br />
<br />
Cats are on a longer timer than 5 minutes &amp; you can fairly easily kill all the cats on the floor, split the 4 throne cats from mm, kill them, rekill the respawn in the corner you fight in &amp; then kill mm before the corner respawns again &amp; you have to worry about chain agro from respawns pulling all the other cats in the room to you.</div></div><hr />
