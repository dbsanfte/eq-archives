And really 30% loss in proc rate doesn't seem that bad, especially stuff is coded to resist Anger aren't they?  I don't have a DBoW so I can't verify it first hand but seems like a lot of Qvic+ mobs resist Anger a good deal of the time, and if it's resisted you should lose the +hate effect, so aggro from proc isn't as big as it appear to be.</div></div><hr />

resists create the same amount of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">resists create the same amount of aggro.<br />
<br />
  That's not entirely true. STUN resists generate the same aggro, and possibly DD spells as well. From everything I've heard, however, the epic proc does NOT generate much, if any, hate when resisted. If you resist any hate component spell, you very likely do not generate the numerical hate aggro. Anger will still generate the stun aggro, but not the added hate.<br />
<br />
  EDIT: Clarified my writing.</div></div><hr />

concussion seems to work even when resiested,and its neg pure aggro, would follow in some lines of thought that +agro worked similar</div></div><hr />

similiar to tash<br />
<br />
stun/dd effect of anger may be resisted but i suspect the hate is landing <br />
<br />
like symbol planesmaster effect,, or orb of sky , some times single components are resisted</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are guilds 'beta testing' GoD end zones on the test server.  Most likely came from there.</div></div><hr />

Clicking a link with the item collector active will submit it to Lucy, no? This would include clicking a mined link or a link from a different server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The named of who submited to lucy doesn't mean anything. There are plenty of items we first discovered that have been submitted by other guilds. Lucy updater running + link in chat and the item is in the lucy database.<br />
<br />
Edit : I suck at reading, this has already been posted :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You know how stuff gets submitted to lucy, right?<br />
<br />
If you're running the autoupdater, any link you open from any channel gets uploaded if it's new. You don't actually have to possess the item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If resisted +hate or -hate effect still goes through it's got to be a bug.  It doesn't make any sense to make -hate effect resistable at all if it doesn't even make a difference whether it lands.<br />
<br />
Obviously the DD &amp; Stun part of Anger has full aggro, resisted or not, but I'd think the +650 hate part shouldn't work if it's resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That would make the War only Weapons the ONLY weapons that don't have hate on Resist... doesn't seem to make much sense to me if they did that. <br />

 I see your point but thinking about it that way it really doesn't make much sense.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yeah that's my point, if a resisted concussion doesn't lower you hate (effect minus hate whatever) then why would a resisted anger with effect +650 hate have the +hate part work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">well, this is my thinkin<br />
<br />
has anyone ever seen a compound spell,, one with more than a single atribute have a single component of that spell land. i know i have, symbol of planesmaster, orb of sky are 2 that come to mind ,, but there are outhers as well <br />
<br />
either stun or dd part of above would be resisted but the complament part would land.<br />
<br />
<br />
now has anyone ever seen a simple + hate proc resisted .. <br />
what i mean by simple is ,, EB, TB or anger 1-3 .. one that has no outher atribute outside of + hate. i dont think i have<br />
<br />
<br />
soo if  this statment is viewed as true.<br />
<br />
a~  multi aspect spells can have single components land where the complement components resist<br />
<br />
b~ EB,TB, and Anger 1,2,3 are unresitable <br />
<br />
then it could be possible that the  + hate part of DB proc is landing  on a resest of the DD/stun<br />
<br />
i have no first hand experiance with - hate effects and thier behaviours. but i would be suprised if they are coded differently than + hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Personally, I'd rather see them add procs that actually do something useful in addition to just adding pure hate.  Start putting stuff like a DD or lifetap + something useful like snare, stun, malo, tash etc that also has a high aggro component rather than just raw hate.  I've always hated being so reliant on pure aggro procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">as near as I can tell EVERY spell generates a ammount of hate innately but I have no proof, I always pictured concussion as 1 hate then minus xxx hate if succesful and I haven't in 3 years of playing that wizard found anything that led me to believe otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Concussion/Jolt lower aggro even when resisted.  Was proved awhile ago, think this is the link to a thread proving it http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18638</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Even if Conc/Jolt didn't work on resist.  Think of it like this Slow has some innate hate number, if they happen to make Anger's innate hate the same as it's hate on working then it doesn't matter if it was resisted or not, because on resist you get the innate hate and when it isn't resisted you get the non innate hate.  <br />
<br />
Now because in reality most things do not have a seperate &quot;innate hate&quot; and &quot;working hate&quot; they most likely just coded the innate hate and then tell you what the innate hate is in the description, and since we know that innate happens on resist it's easy to deduce that unless they did some extra special coding just for these war procs that we're going to get the same hate on resist as we did otherwise.  This is backed up by the fact that the concusions work the same way, most likely it is because their innate hate is negative (ie they didn't make some special programming condition for it they just adjusted the innate hate to negative)<br />
<br />
That's why it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You will still gain agro from a full resist of &quot;Anger&quot; from the Darkblade. This is due only to the stun component; it has nothing to do with the hate portion. Since it was a full resist, the pure hate did not go through but with the stun component present, it will still draw agro. With Anger being -400 resist to MR, it's hard to find mobs that will actually resist it fully... but it's fun finding them.<br />
<br />
This was fairly proven to be the case back when Epics were practically useless in Revamped Cazic Thule due to the lizards being fire resistant. You would get a full resist of Rage of Vallon, which doesn't allow the hate to stick if it's resisted. We (Warriors) even figured out that they broke taunt in that zone heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Resisted spells create the same amount of hate as a landed spell in every circumstance. If you don't believe me, here's a simple test. Find a resistant monster and attack, and incite/bellow it for a few seconds.  Then have a wizard nuke until they get agro, and after that, have them cast concussion on the monster.  After a few resisted concs, the monster will change back to you. oooooook great. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>tasdamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">i know that pure negative hate procs can be resisted.  whether the negative hate goes through or not, i have no idea though.  dagger of distraction used to get resisted quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Resisted epic proc gave very little aggro.  I suspect the pure hate portion of Anger is the same, no aggro if resisted.  The stun and DD portion should still generate aggro though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how can you tell? &quot;perception&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">If you could no longer hold aggro with you Darkblade even after multiple procs in a row, I think it is safe to believe this &quot;perception&quot;. Those epic procs were basically worthless when resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Daydreamer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I had an enchanter tash and slow a mob.  After a successful taunt the enchanter cast Boggle (Decrease Hate by 500).  With a resist the mob would switch to the enchanter.<br />
<br />
Spells have an innate agro.  Spells incur agro regardless of resist and the modifier only occurs on a success.</div></div><hr />
