<br />
You learn allot of interesting things if you sit down and test them.<br />
<br />
For instance, if you taunt to pull a non-kos mob it gives you less aggro than when you pull it using an attack. This makes sense mechanic-wise because taunt simply puts you on top of the hate list + a small amount, whereas if you get the initial contact against a mob it generates additional hate.<br />
<br />
You also get to learn nifty things such as how mob hp relates to spell aggro, the less hp a mob has the less aggro they get from spells. <br />
<br />
As a bonus you may get to see a druid get beat up by lower level mob as you sit around for 5 minuets disarming said mob. :D<br />
<br />
Some tests that need to be run is take a few mobs of similar/same hp totals in different zones and use those +hate spells Vs the high aggro spells such as snare, stun, tash, ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, dunno about aggro but it can initiate attacking.<br />
try disarming something; when it fails the mob sits there; where you've completed a successful disarm ( doesn't matter if a mob has a weapon or not ) the mob hits you and goes to either the threateningly or scowls status of /con.<br />
<br />
taunt does the same thing. so i believe hitting disarm does something. don't know about aggro as in a &quot;top of hate list&quot; but..hey, it's something and usually works more reliably than doing the same scenario as with disarm. <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats what I did heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Violent5</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK here is my dumb test.  My unarmed druid smacked  a few armed orc pawns, then I just hit disarm until it successful.  My disarm skill was 99.  In 87 attempts to disarm one orc turned his attention to me on an unsuccessful attempt.  However I did receive 16 disarm skillups.<br />
<br />
Next I walked up to 2 different orcs and attempted to diarm them unsuccessfully and they aggroed on me. <br />
<br />
Then I let the druid aggro a few more using an unarmed melee attack and attemped to taunt them off.  With a taunt skill of 200 it took an average of 7 taunts before the orc would turn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never believed that disarm does anything to create more agro.  If it does, it is insignificant enough that I no longer bother whacking the disarm key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if it does or not, and honestly it doesn't really mean a lot to me.  I'm one of those person that still manually turns autoattack off, begs, then turns it back on again, even though I'm wielding agro weapons... it's just the principle for me, plus gives me somethin to do :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it give some aggro? yes.  Is it a very small amount? yep.<br />
It's small enough it probably doesn't matter, but I still use it anyway /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it because I can use any agro I can get =)  An important principle for a warrior =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this would be the same as the /shield thread.  take a nonkos mob and disarm untill succesful.  Shadowhaven guards might be a good mob.  Once the mob loses its weapon then see if it aggros.  Try a similar test with mobs that have no visuable weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the belief that both beg and disarm add some aggro my taunt hotkey is set to:<br />
<br />
/attack<br />
/do 3<br />
/attack<br />
/do 4<br />
/do 5<br />
<br />
On my Abilities Page (not combat, abilities) 3 is beg, 4 is disarm, 5 is taunt. <br />
<br />
Why do this?<br />
<br />
Well if I am not top of the aggro list then the instant I am about to hit taunt I want to get as close to the top as I can so taunt has the greatest chance of working. Therefore I always bash/kick then hit this key which begs and disarms before taunting. I can only provide anecdotal evidence to support any belief that it works but I do honestly believe I am getting aggro from mobs that are not on me easier than I was by just taunting.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing to remember is that if you have a scripted defensive or evasive button (like one that counts down the time left on the disc) then while it is running you cannot use another scripted hotkey, however you CAN use a scripted social. So keep your social panel handy at all times!<br />
<br />
Oh, that trick can also be used to AETaunt while in a disc. Make a social button (but not hotkey it) with the correct /doability #. Which one it is I am not sure right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, the problem with beg, is that as your skill rises you get less aggro.  Beg only gives aggro on a critical failure.  Go to a non kos mob and beg, you can usually fail quite a few times before they attack.  As you gain skill, chances of critical failures decrease, thus the times it aggro's decreases.<br />
<br />
Also, I have disarmed mobs with no weapons and it aggros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does disarm add hate?<br />
<br />
The answer is yes.   It most certainly does.  This is easily seen by walking up to an indifferent mob and hitting your disarm button... armed or not, it will attack you no matter what.<br />
<br />
The next question is.... how much?    Don't know, haven't tested, probably not a lot.<br />
<br />
Beg on the other hand, doesn't cause aggro *except* from mobs coded to aggro on critical misses.   These are humanoids in cities.  No other mob is aggroed by beg.  It is also true that as you increase in skill the chance for critical miss exists.<br />
<br />
Taunt to pull mobs..... this is a good way actually to test taunt effectiveness if you have some time, taunt an indifferent mob.... when it turns on you, it's because it was successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps you all are missing where I said I disarmed a mob repeatedly and the mob did not turn to aggro me when someone else was just standing there doing nothing but getting beat on?<br />
<br />
<br />
The only aggro disarm seemed to generate was when I used it as the first contact against a target and that was only because of the + hate from said first contact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Varaho, I did miss that part.  Upon reading it, I decided to test for myself.  First, I got my rogue to put a non weapon in main hand, and just a fist in off hand and attack a mob (reason for his set up is that it was very low aggro).  He hit the mob for 4 points of damage, and a miss.  I then disarmed about 30 times, mob didn't turn.<br />
<br />
So I tried again, first I had warrior kick, then rogue did just enough weaponless to get aggro barely.  I proceeded to disarm about 20 times with no luck.  So I think you are right, that it only gives aggro if you are non aggro, after that, nothing.  Now, I didn't try too many times so there might be some even if very very little, but really, if 20 disarms aren't enough to out aggro hitting for 4 points, I don't think it's worth it anyway.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention, one less button needed on my hotkeys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem. :D<br />
<br />
Sometimes you just have to see things for yourself before you can find the facts.<br />
<br />
I still need to run those test to see how much aggro is modified by mob hps/zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Violent5</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you guys think its odd, as stated in my earlier post, it took at least 7 taunts to get aggro off my druid after he hit an orc one time with his bare fists?  I know this wasn't a definitive test but I did do it many times, always with the same result.  It always took many pushes of the taunt button, not 1 or 2,  the get aggro from my druid who hardly touched the mob.   My 48 warrior with 200 skill in taunt could hardly get an orc to turn using only the taunt  button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No -- it isn't odd -- it is math.   Taunt works a set amount of time based on your taunt score.  Even if you had a 99 percent chance of getting agro with taunt you still could fail seven times in a row, it would just be akin to winning the lottery.  Since the success rate is actually much lower than 99 percent, you just did something unlikely, but not impossible.<br />
<br />
I have had days where taunt worked on the first or second try almost everytime... and I know that is also highly unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think Disarm alone is going to really get a mobs attention, except in a few, limited situations.  I use it right after taunt, just as a little reminder to the mob that I am there.  Sometimes it helps to reinforce taunt, sometimes it doesn't.  Just another tool in the arsenal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am of the theory that I have not tested it but since it can't hurt I do it anyways.  Not doing it will do simply nothing at all.  Doing it will at the least bring my disarm score up.  Why do I care?  I don't really aside from the fact that its at least doing something else.  You never know when skills might get changed and having it all the way up might be a good thing.<br />
<br />
I also beg with my taunt.  It helps sometimes and it gets me a couple of plats from NPCs I don't like anyways. :)</div></div><hr />
