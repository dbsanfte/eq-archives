Howling Stones NPCs have always behaved using different aggro rules. They go after whoever is closest, regardless of who is or isn't on their hatelist. I used to pull there, and would try to drop the sepulcher skeletons on my groupmates so they'd eat the Harm Touch. Good times! <br />

Most guilds have lost so many people we see Elemental guilds falling back to VT (or further back!)<br />

What will happen when WoW comes out with Devs working at SOE with an attitude like this about bugged content?!</div></div><hr />

So instead of answering the question properly for the player, a Dev for a major corporation should answer it sarcastically? The guy reminds me of a lot of the 12 year olds playing this game &quot;so I wiped us 10 times, its just a game&quot; attitude.  Some got the point, some didn't.    :) <br />

I wonder if Emerson was bipolar or something. One minute he sounds like Thomas Hobbes and the next he sounds like Shirley Maclaine.<br />
You know, as early as 1550 Germans were using wooden rails in some places to run wagons and even &quot;trains&quot; of wagons, because running the wagons on rails was more efficient than running them in rutted dirt roads. But it wasn't until 1789 that an Englishman named William Jessup invented flanged wagon tires specifically to allow such wagons to keep a better grip on the wooden rails.<br />
Needless to say, his simple yet elegant invention greatly reduced the number of derails.<br />
Until now.<br />

So, just because you're an elitist fuck and can't stand dying at all, you have to force that belief on everyone? Some of us enjoy the humor of wiping with good friends, and they can laugh along with it. Are the devs not any different?</div></div><hr />

Please don't discuss your e-peni and analizing the developers. This IS the outhouse, but there are limits even here. (Did you mean analyze sir? Or did you really mean analize? nm, I DON'T want to know...)<br />

You shut up, and I am subscribed till WoW then outta there! I did quit the Time flagged warrior account though, but you don't know anything about the zone anyway. Game sucks none left on, FoH gone, Afterlife gone, heck the game died after Velious for 90% of the REAL EQ players. BTW, don't feel bad you wasted the last few years of your life on a third rate game, we all knew the end was coming when the original programmers left.<br />
<br />
nm, I DON'T want to know...) &lt;----haha, okay<br />
<br />
BTW, 30 days played on my chanter, Time flagged, deep in GoD, and how far did you get in EQ Haass?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A - Since when do I care if FoH and Afterlife leave the game?  Do they make it any more or less fun?  Or do you bring this up because if they leave it means you absolutely must follow suit?  If so, I have a bridge near my house I've been planning to jump off - you go first!<br />
<br />
B - Any time spent on any game, third rate or no, is a waste of time.  That's what a game is.  A distraction from the things that actually mean something.  The fact that you actually made that statement just shows how silly you really are.  If you don't like the game, please feel free to do something worthwhile with your time and stop posting here, which is also a waste of time.  BTW - I've been playing since Kunark came out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
C - Sounds like you really do need a life.  Maybe the fact that you are Time flagged and knee deep in GoD in 30 days is exactly why you don't like the game, did you think of that?  Most of the people I know who have stuck around are still not Time flagged.  It keeps the Carrot dangling in front of us, I think.<br />

LOL, nevermind.  I learned a long time ago not to try to point out the obvious to a 2 year old.  This is the best rant you can come up with?  How sad.  There are so many much more important problems with the game that this piddly crap you are ranting about is laughable.<br />

Hang in till Time at least see that, can't say I would stay around for GoD though. OoW is maybe worth it if your guild hangs together that long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Playerauctions refuses to cooperate with Sony, Ebay pulled the selling when asked. What sucks is when a /report is filed, now nothing is done. Verant actually took action. <br />
<br />
You missed the early days of EQ. We had a well know Monk trainer, banned with a zone wide ooc by the GM explainging his banning! This was followed by server wide celebration by the players! That was great!</div></div><hr />

It's unpleasant, it's ungraceful, and it's generally pretty pointless.  Besides, what makes it even more humorous is the fact that it's one retired EQ player argueing to another.<br />
<br />
Also, who cares if people buy toons?  Server communities usually weed them out anyways.  How many ebayers do you think really continue playing the game after two months?  ;)</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, World of Warcraft, where already people are complaining because it went by too fast, content is too easy, and, this one's the real kicker, warriors have too shitty aggro!<br />
<br />
That's right, if you ditch your Everquest account, buy WoW, and pay for their monthyl subscription, you too can go back to the way Everquest was, aggro problems, bugs, loopholes and all!<br />
<br />
Man, don't you have something to do other than come to this board and try to parrot Furor and shoot your little antics about SOE cheating you because you suck at this game?  If you're so pissed that this game works the way it has been for five years, quit, I have this severe doubt anyone's going to cry over the loss.<br />
<br />
Game died when the original devs left?  Yeah, I really wanted a remake of Shadows of Luclin didn't I?<br />
<br />
Nah, the new devs are incredible, but you wouldn't believe that, because you've already got this mindset of &quot;Screw everything, I died in Howling Stones as a Time geared warrior so this game is obivously broken&quot;.<br />

<br />
The original programmers kind of sucked actually.  Clearly the best raid content in EQ is PoP forward.   Gates and Omens raids destroy Velious/PoP raids any day.  The &quot;original EQ developers&quot; culminated all of their development finesse with Luclin then left with shitholes like Modrod 3's, CH Rotation snoozefest mobs, and for &quot;events&quot; that shithole called Ring of Fire and Back Acrylia, with broken keys and the works.   <br />
<br />
The almost religious devotion to uncreative programmers is amusing.   The best thing to happen to EQ was the current dev team, who makes some pretty damn top rate content, and leading the pack is... Prathun.   That guy is a content genius, he's the guy responsible for Inktu'Ta, universally accespted as the best content in GoD, also the MPG trials, and a whole slew of great raid content in OOW.    <br />
<br />
Kendrick was the only good content designer from the former team, the rest were pretty pathetic.  The only part that the original EQ team owned the new team was in lore.  The rest, particularly content development was sheer crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we all understand by now that the basic fomula is:<br />
Us -&gt; impediment -&gt; reward<br />
<br />
There has to be some variety in the impediment of the game gets stale. But I think designers need to make the impediments consistant with the game world and not break the illusion.<br />
<br />
Static guardian shouldn't giving birth to adds like a clockwork machine - when we get it to 80% the first adds spawn - all made *cough* realistic by a zonewide emote &quot;Drop your Wheatibix children, Daddy needs your help!&quot; Nor should mobs activate when you get the mobs to 80%. I can accept certainly a mob calling for help and others running into a room to assist. But not spontainious generation.<br />
<br />
Mobs hardly ever think to run up the tunnel and get reinforcements. I can hear the orders now - &quot;Guard this gate. If you see anyone, don't call for help - we can't hear you. Just fight and die even if there's 50 of them and 1 of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you need to seperate into two groups and kill the Red and Blue Panda at the same time at two different locations the reason should not be arbitrary. It should be so they can't come to each other's assistance.<br />
<br />
I see some of the puzzle stuff as assinine and very arbitrary. No way does an advancing army split up into 6 groups and have 6 individuals say &quot;Blah blah&quot; at the same time. There is no need to put David Ahl's &quot;101 Basic Computer Games&quot; Codebreaker stuff into unlocking a door. &quot;You hear a ghostly voice entirely in your mind, 'Use the Silver key - the Silver.....'&quot;.<br />
<br />
And it's always a &quot;test&quot; or a &quot;trial&quot;, never a &quot;real&quot; fight. &quot;Having bested my Spanaird, let's see how you do against my Giant!! Muwahahahaha! Muwahahahaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, the current developers advanced encounter design. But they've also used every arbitrary &quot;must kill 4 sub-bosses and put their hearts in this box and return it to me to advance&quot; hackneyed puzzle mechanism I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
There's a more complex formula, but it's still obviously a formula. The trick is hide your limitiations and never ever break the illusion.<br />
<br />
I suppose in 40 years the kind of design artistry I want to see in this kind of game will exist. I know WoW and FFXI doesn't have it nor probably EQ2. That btw is why I'll continue playing EQ - encounter design in the new MMoRPGs has not advanced sufficiently for me to want to start over as a n00bie. Graphics, voice, different class balance.... all fluff - it's the group and raid combat system and the believability of the world that gets my $$. <br />
<br />
The new designers haven't focused on lore and believablity as much as they should have - but it's not sufficient yet for me to reject the product.<br />

<br />
 Considering how little of the content has been used by the majority of their playerbase, I've got to say that this is the case only if you're a solid progression guild with a single focus. For anyone else, PoP was pretty much a disaster, and GoD flat was a disaster for everyone. OoW is nice.</div></div><hr />

It's East Commonlands with different scenery, monsters, and equipment - nothing special. It's EQ lite with everything of value stripped away.<br />
<br />
Thus far, I'd have to say GoD was the high water mark. It was too difficult IMO but all of the raid encounters were clever.<br />
<br />
I understand Partha that you may not raid. But without raiding and/or dungeons to crawl open zone grouping is no different than it was in East Commonlands camping Orc 1 or Camping Chef in Sebilis - a snoozefest. The MPG trials are a bit better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Point was, the majority of PoP was locked away, and so was the larger portion of GoD - if not necessarily behind keys, behind content too hard for all but hardcore raiders. In GoD I can understand that, because it was designed for level 70 toons. However, that makes it's failure even more criminal in my eyes because they left it like that rather than retune it so that folks could get use from the expansion.<br />
<br />
 PoP had some notable flaws, especially at release - very few upgrades in Tier 1, especially for melee classes. Many of the flagging mobs were designed around the idea that most folks were in VT and extensively geared to that level, especially with resist gear. They finally saw the mistake they made and opened Tier 2 to 'casual' players, but it's telling that only now are a significant number of 65/70 toons actually in EP's, forget about Time. GoD? It's even worse, and if you were closer to my level of play than yours, you'd know it. (And, fortunately or unfortunately depending on your viewpoint, there are a lot more like me playing EQ than there are of you.)<br />
<br />
 If PoP/GoD was such a model of success, they would not have had to go back to the old model of expansion in OoW. What they realized was that the game is splitting in two, and they were spending the majority of their time designing for one group, and that group was also the smaller in terms of profit. Like I said, if you're into 'raid, raid, raid, and more raid', those expansions were great for you, and that's good for you. If you weren't, however, except for levels, spells, and AA, they were a waste for the majority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the new devs stink. they doubled the performance requirements for equivalent graphics but wont admit it. they tell us the real problem is we need to upgrade the BIOS on our computers. their idea of a collision detection systems is i constantly get stuck on vendor counters. they cant even make a counter work? even after a whole year? after a year they still have trouble detecting my graphics card. wait .. you said the devs were incredible. ok yes, they are incredible.<br />
<br />
no programmer should ever be allowed to graduate college who still writes bubble sorts. dont even get me started on polygon count. they are inept at rendering multipolygon scenes. a wolf 2000 counts away does not have to have every single polygon sent to the graphics card. and why isnt my mouse interrupt driven? why do i click on things and my clicks are ignored? eq is the only application ive ever used in my entire life that did mouse polling.<br />

yes the devs are indeed incredible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As someone who wrote their own Interrupt Service Routines, Device Drivers, Ansi math libraries with trigonometric functions, and graphics functions all in assembly language and always cycle counted everything, you new guys are so amusing.<br />
<br />
Why even polygon count can be dealt with by building the initial model with 3x more polygons than necessary and then reduce with a topigraphical analysis tool - a simple &quot;packing&quot; problem, Right Rysing?! (for you programers out there [that would be not you Rysing], &quot;packing&quot; problems are fairly intractable. I'm not saying it CAN'T be done, but it's waaaaaaay beyond trivial).<br />

<br />
you are quick to criticize my lack of coding experience considering you have no idea what i do for a living.<br />
<br />
oh whoop de doo you cycle count your assembly language and write interrupt drivers. you arent doing anything i havent done before bb so you arent going to impress me with your job description. you might impress me if i can see your coding in action. i spend too much of my time at work fixing both the hardware and software problems of cards bought from vendors and integrated with our systems. its an interesting engineering problem breaking warranties on purchased hardware because they never bothered to bring the interrupt lines to their bridge chips. weve rewritten vendor drivers signing nondisclosure agreements on their software because their drivers crash or hog bandwidth. <br />
<br />
i know bad coding when i see it. i see the same mistakes over and over again. problems usually fall into one of several catagories:<br />
<br />
1) resource hogging: also known as &quot;why would anyone care if this application hogs the resources because we know our software is so awesome that you would want to devote an entire system to our application alone&quot;.<br />
2) n-squared algorithms instead of n-log-n algorithms because most programmers wont pick up a book to save their lives.<br />
3) failure to glean out irrelevant data. it took eq five years to stop rendering mob names on mobs halfway across the zone.<br />
4) failure to profile code. this is a debug technique for finding which code uses how much bandwidth. very few programmers seem to do it. the result is time and again the most bandwidth is used by some obscure piece of code which should run in trivial time.<br />
5) failure to trap errors. the result here is that even the programmers are blind to what is crashing their code. debugging is brought to a snail's pace as a result.<br />
6) glitter &gt; performance and the bug statute of limitations. once a bug or poor optimization is more than two months old everyone conveniently forgets that it exists and loses interest in fixing it. this is why they will never fix your collision problems. they are more than two months old you see.<br />
7) blaming the user: why if my bard goes afk i can get a warning. hey is it my fault i forgot to turn off bard song when i went to dinner and got a few singing skillups?<br />
<br />
if i had not been given the opportunity to work with some truly talented software writers maybe i wouldnt be so sensitive to poorly written code. because ive seen good code too. i know it can be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the new stuff isn't better than the old stuff, then most people must be totally stupid to keep on buying new things that aren't even as good as what they already own.<br />
<br />
Even most of GoD is pretty interesting so far as from an encounter point of view.  Maybe it isn't necessarily worth the effort (Uqua comes to mind) but not all encounters are created equal in EQ.  Some are meant to be tougher than others without any good reason.<br />
<br />
As for the lore, I think the lore in new EQ is pretty good, as good as you can expect with a game of this longevity.  I mean really, after a while what excuse do you have for stronger beings still popping up?  No matter how you spin it, it's about as believeable as Dragonball's endless progression of superpowers.  I mean, what do you think is going to happen to WoW in say 5 years?  Is Onyxia the Dragon and Thrall the Warchief still going to be the most powerful beings in the world (assuming they don't get revamped)?  Nope, you're going to see like Greater Super Skeleton from some world somewhere stronger than 3 current WoW dragons and superheroes put together.  Heck, just look at Diablo 2.  On Act 4, you got Oblivion Knights, who are like the pinnacle of Undead power, the very Servants of the Prime Evils.  On Act 5, you got Reanimated Hordes, which is like a skeleton, but it's slower, and yet Reanimated Hordes give you a lot more XP than an Oblivion Knight even though I'm sure more people have died to Skeletons than Reanimated Hordes let alone Oblivion Knights.  At some point, lore simply breaks down because things have to keep on get more and more powerful to keep up with players, and eventually your excuse, no matter how well planned, will just be 'they're stronger just because'.</div></div><hr />

Obviously there is no reason to buy either EQ2 or WoW or upgrade your computer, because video games achieved perfection (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/arcade.php?do=play&amp;gameid=6) in 1987 and that game can now be played for free with a very outdated computer at www.thesteelwarrior.org!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here, let me quote from the thread announcing the new collision fixes, that cound be found here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=development&amp;message.id=1987) .<br />
<br />
For those wondering why this hasn't happened sooner, the main reason is that after the DX9 collision system became relatively stable we wanted to just leave it alone for a bit - partly because we wanted to avoid risking unexpected bugs during the Omens beta/release timeframe, but it was also (mostly) so we could become more certain about the nature of the remaining problems in the collision &amp; movement system.  <br />
<br />
You throw a hissy fit if they rush things too much, and then you throw a hissy fit if they take it slow and try and get it right.  Basically, you are going to throw a hissy fit no matter what.  Please, go find another game, and throw your hissy fits there...and you will, because you are that kind of person.  There is a huge difference between finding valid issues, and pointing them out to be corrected, and mindless temper tantrums.  One actually has a chance to accomplish something, the other just makes you look juvenile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the problem with your argument tho.  They aren't taking things slow, and fixing them right.  They rushed into DX9 without a shred of fucking testing, and then justify the bugs that have existed for TEN FUCKING MONTHS by &quot;We're taking our time and fixing it right?&quot;  That's bullshit.  I'm sorry you can't see it, but nothing should ever work one day in a game, be broken the next deliberately, and then stay that way for almost a year.  That's ridiculous.  And something as absolutely important as appropriate collision between your characters and the world should have utmost importance over anything else.<br />
<br />
EQ when it started was VERY stable.  They've done absolutely nothing but fuck it up ever since, just for the sake of eye candy.  That's unaccaptable business.  If you don't agree, that's your perogative, but it's not &quot;Whining&quot; or a &quot;Hissy fit&quot; to point out massive issues caused by retarded priorities.</div></div><hr />

The old adage, &quot;measure twice, cut once&quot; also applies in software development.  It is far easier to justify a delay so that a product is a quality one, than to ship a piece of crap that just causes additional aggravation because it's so buggy.  And then to use the excuse that you want to take your time and fix it right, just really doesn't fly.  It shows that they're more than willing to be rushed when immediate dollars are to be made.  But when it comes to actually making the product work right, they take the leisure route.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly let me say that OOW rocks, I've enjoyed myself more in the past few months than any other time in eq. Their is a few problems in anguish that I must bring up though.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the mob hate list. What in the heck did you guys do? This is what happens, when a mob is aggro'd it will come after the person on the hate list. Then when you get near another player the mob will do a check to see who zoned into the zone last and come after that person. Now that you ninja patched last night mobs summon making it a complete disaster. Another example is if I'm fighting a mob, i have generated 15,000 hate and it's at 40% and Bob zones in and gets within proximity aggro of the mob. The mob will summon Bob. WHY? (FYI if i am on the hate list and i run past another PC it shouldn't add them to the hate list unless they cast a detrimental or beneficial spell, that is where it's screwed up. If a mob is already aggro it shouldn't be adding people to the top of the hate list for proximity aggro.)<br />
<br />
Next you ninja nerf aug drops and don't say a word about it ANYWHERE. Why not put it up in some announcement that their is a change or is that for summit forums only? They know about the fact that these augments are becoming NO DROP next patch but you don't tell anyone else about it do you.<br />
<br />
Next the Feedback Dispersion AOE has a recast time of 30, why can the NPC chain cast this on my ass over 4 times in a row doing over 16,000 damage INSTANTLY to anyone within range.<br />
<br />
You take the zone down to nerf drops and make mobs summon but when it comes to fixing things that are broken nothing happens. Good idea, make mobs summon, now get their hate list right and we will be in business.<br />
<br />

    Howling Stones NPCs have always behaved using different aggro rules. They go after whoever is closest, regardless of who is or isn't on their hatelist. I used to pull there, and would try to drop the sepulcher skeletons on my groupmates so they'd eat the Harm Touch. Good times!</div></div><hr />

Bingo.  The one constant throughout the history of EQ...lots and lots of whining.  Do something to make one group of people stop whining, and another one will start, and some people (a lot of the ones with high message board post counts) will whine no matter what you do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the problem with your argument tho.  They aren't taking things slow, and fixing them right.  They rushed into DX9 without a shred of fucking testing, and then justify the bugs that have existed for TEN FUCKING MONTHS by &quot;We're taking our time and fixing it right?&quot;  That's bullshit.  I'm sorry you can't see it, but nothing should ever work one day in a game, be broken the next deliberately, and then stay that way for almost a year.  That's ridiculous.  And something as absolutely important as appropriate collision between your characters and the world should have utmost importance over anything else.<br />
<br />
EQ when it started was VERY stable. They've done absolutely nothing but fuck it up ever since, just for the sake of eye candy. That's unaccaptable business. If you don't agree, that's your perogative, but it's not &quot;Whining&quot; or a &quot;Hissy fit&quot; to point out massive issues caused by retarded priorities.<br />
<br />
I did not play when EQ first started(I started playing early Velious). so this is not from firsthand, but from what I have been told, EQ was very rough and laggy at first, and after a few months it improved(kinda like the DX9 changes).  And therein is the problem with your argument.<br />
<br />
Changing to DX9 was a huge thing, and involved some rather massive changes to what is rightly described as 'spegetti(however the hell it is spelled) code' that is, what, 5 to 6 years old about.  Test server is sadly underpopulated for what it is there to do(and this is not entirely SoE's fault, as they do encourage players to spend time there).  They ran into huge problems(duh, I think we can all agree on that), and in light of that, probably should have done more testing.  Course, it is easy to say that since we already know the result(hindsight 20/20 thing).<br />
<br />
SoE rushed thru trying to get this fixed, we had frequent patches, some helped, some hurt.  Things got to a point where it was much better, not perfect, but better.  Personally, I have not got stuck on geometry in a very long time.  Collision seems to work pretty well in most cases, and things where stable.  Now they step back, take their time, and hopefully get the fixes right(could it be, learning from past mistakes?).<br />
<br />
No one is sayingthey did not fuck up when they made the change to DX9...they did.  I rather suspect some code people paid for it with some massive long hours for awhile.  Truth is tho, that with the huge changes that where being made at the time, it is to a certain extent understandable that there where problems.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no other game as large, with as much code, that has been changed as much, over so long a period, as EQ.  Shit is going to happen, and it did, and does.  Hopefully, the next generation of games will benefit from having EQ as a model to look at, and see what worked and did not, and learn from all these mistakes.<br />
<br />
You talk about how SoE has 'done absolutely nothing but fuck it up ever since, just for the sake of eye candy'.  Do you honestly want them to never work to change and improve EQ?  Every time they go in to make any change, with the state the code has to be in, they run the risk of troubles.  Test server can only do so much to catch these problems, so a lot of them are going to make it live.  There are 2 basic options, let the game stagnate, or work to improve it, and take the chance of fucking something up.  I hope they do keep working to upgrade EQ, even if, every time something creeps in, as it is going to, some people are going to throw a hissy fit and whine about how fucked up SoE is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what Brutul?  Fuck you.  I'm happy that you're happy with this game, but when there are major issues that involve me not being able to do something as simple as getting my fucking character out of water for a solid minute and a half, there is something wrong with the game.<br />
<br />
And since it's been that way for almost a year now, it's quite obvious that they're not too motivated to fix it.  You can sit there and believe all the &quot;Oh, we're working on it&quot; bullshit you want, but that doesn't change the fact that it fucking sucks, it shouldn't be there, and they're lazy bitches for not doing anything about.<br />
<br />
God forbid anyone call EQ's errors out while you're still fucking playing it.  If I ever get stuck on a fucking rock in WoW, I'll do the same exact shit.  I'm not gonna pay for that kind of lazy craftsmanship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not gonna pay for that kind of lazy craftsmanship.<br />
<br />
So don't.  If the game sucks, stop playing it.  It's kinda simple.  Everybody knows that it sucks when you can't get out of the water.  Me, the devs, everybody.  Posting big long rants on message boards doesn't change anything about that, it only makes the board less enjoyable to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So don't.  If the game sucks, stop playing it.

<br />
First of all, I did stop playing it.  Second of all, it doesn't change the fact that it's a valid complaint about their product.  Third of all, this is the &quot;Working as intended&quot; crew, where they deny anything is broken, ever.  Whether they are aware of the problem or not, has always been dubious at best because they refuse to admit it's a problem.<br />
<br />
And fourth, since this is an actual problem with the game, and not some bullshit &quot;Paladanz R overpow3rd!&quot; rant, or fucking monk mitigation rant (which I never get involved with), I'm getting kind of fucking sick and tired of your covert attacks on me about what I choose to bitch about. Everyone knows you love your life, and your server and your guild, and everything else about EQ.  No one says a fucking word about the class balance or mitigation threads that pop up, but I suppose they're a little more important than making sure the game actually functions correctly, right?<br />
<br />
Yeah, right.</div></div><hr />

You are the one that decided that I was referring to you.  It was just a general comment because Redhenna's posts could have been written by me at just about any time in the last 3 years on this board (well I probably wouldn't have used the term &quot;hissy fit&quot; but otherwise it's dead on :)).  It was nice to hear someone else expressing the same sentiments, not necessarily anything to do with the specific content of this thread.  As far as monk mitigation, well I have several posts in that thread along the same lines as the ones here.  Class balance?  Gave up on that long ago.  I just don't read that forum anymore.</div></div><hr />

Brutul, before getting back on your opinion, edit your post. Because right now, your post #88 is undoubtfully slaying Haass as whiner.<br />
 your only implicit reference to Redhanna in your post #88 is here &quot;Posting big long rants on message boards&quot;. So don't expect anybody to understand you if you change of subjet whithin a paragraph without explicitly naming it.</div></div><hr />

As I said, my comments were general, not referring to this thread necessarily.  I didn't say &quot;all people with big post counts are whiners&quot;.  No need to get defensive as if this is some sort of personal attack.  All I was saying was that EQ message board posters whine too damn much.  Don't read anything more into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
so if we keep playing and complain we are labeled hypocrits and told &quot;why do you still play&quot; and if we complain and dont play we are told &quot;why do you complain but not play&quot; and gd pretends to /ignore but obviously is not ignoring.<br />
<br />
i think people wont be satisfied no matter what we do.<br />
<br />
but i do still play and will continue to intermittently play until my account expires in december. last night i had a heck of a time logging on. it would log me on but the mouse wouldnt work. actually the left click worked but the right click didnt. then id camp out and come back but have no graphics. then i closed the app from the task manager and logged on again and it ld'd me on entry. then i rebooted and logged on but it said i had an active character (the reboot only had me offline for about 5 minutes; not enough to drop my character from the server right? then i tried again and i got the message &quot;unknown error&quot; whatever the heck that's supposed to mean, then i did it again and it said &quot;you must log off before logging on&quot; (/rolls eyes) and tried it one more time and i was on.<br />
<br />
and 3 people are going to post and say &quot;rys the devs are awesome and glorious! the problem is obviously with your attitude.&quot; to those who say this i say you are way too easily impressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a big difference between constructive criticism and whining.  I have no problem with people who say that 'This should be done different', or 'They screwed this up'.  The people who get on my nerves are the ones who say things along the line of 'EQ is shit, the devs are shit, yady yada, whine whine'.  If EQ is such shit, go away.  If the devs suck so much, go away.<br />
<br />
No one is claiming EQ is perfect, that the dev's never blow something out there ass(DX9 was a good example of this, SoL release was an even better example).  The difference is how you handle it, and how you present your complaints.</div></div><hr />
