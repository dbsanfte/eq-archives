<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question regarding this message on last patch:<br />
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone.<br />
<br />
I finished trials, have vxed and tipt to get KOD access.<br />
<br />
So my question is if I get KoD acceses (do trials 1-6), I can take a raid past somewhere new?<br />
<br />
http://www.harmonium.net/filespace/Fawy/GoDmap.jpg<br />
<br />
that map does confuse me where  Ikkinz zonein is .. if it is KoD, don't see how I could get a raid into trial if they can't get into zone that you zonein from.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sence, since I am semi confused :-).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 1 person needs to be able to start the raids though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok that is how I thought it was.<br />
<br />
Guildie was trying to say only 1 person needs to pass sewerss/vxed and Tipt, which I figured was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rofl, yeah my guildies have been saying the same thing.  Quick look, now everyone can get gimped into Kod'Taz?  Wait....no.  I think the point of that was so that although everyone has to work to get into KT, guilds don't need to do 4 backflagging raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials.

<br />
By &quot;seventh Ikkinz trial,&quot; they mean the 4th (Destruction) raid. Or more specifically, Sliver of the High Temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont mix up sewers / vxed / tipt trials and ikkinz trials. Everybody needs sewers 1 - 4 (or smith) + vxed + tipt in order to enter Kod'Taz. <br />
<br />
In Kod'Taz itself are 3 single group trials + 4 raid trials. These take place inside Ikkinz and are triggered from kodtaz. In order to trigger such a raid you need to pass single group trials 1 - 3 and some minor farming in Kod'Taz. Only one person needs those single group trials, that person can trigger raids for the whole guild then.<br />
After successing the first 3 raids, any person with those 3 trials can trigger the 4th raid (SoE calls it ikkinz 7) for the whole guild. Prior to that patch every person needed raid1 - 3 to enter radi4. <br />
I hope that clears things up :)</div></div><hr />
