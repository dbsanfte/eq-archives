<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picked up a Willsapper on a DN raid a week ago, and wondered if anyone had any suggestions on how agro compares with the CHoS.  <br />
<br />
For my dual wield combo I use CHoS/SoBS.  At 63, most mobs I fight are becoming immune to the CHoS stun (that means no agro right?).  So I've been looking for a nice replacement for it for that reason.  As I understand, the Willsapper's proc will increase agro even when the mob is slowed by a higher slow.  Is the agro from that better than the 179dd from the CHoS?<br />
<br />
Basically, which would you use mainhand for agro?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoyed my wilsapper, back in the day when aggro weapons were almost non existent, it was godly.  I remember slowing all kinds of trash in ntov way before the shamans could land slow.  Its pretty outdated for today's standards though.  Also, it's piercing so your atk rating is lower, and it's mainhand only which always bothered me.  Your CHoS will likely generate more aggro and will increase your dps with the dd.  Resisted stun still generates aggro by the way.</div></div><hr />

I would guess the CHoS is probably nicer for aggro, but the sapper is nice to have in your bag when you need a slow and you don't really have to give up a ton of dps or aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the input and suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slagfest</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My sapper had a tendancy to proc 3-4 times after the mob went below 20% hp...i found the ChoS superior...shame sapper aint offhand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sapper was awesome in velious, a nice upgrade to the blue epic.  Once luclin came out, it was fairly outdated.  Luclin has been out a long time now. . .Anything with stun procs, or better yet, a nice ratio 2h with anger3 will cream it.  The utility of a 30% proc slow does sometimes have a use.</div></div><hr />

Our guild made an effort to get their MT's this lovely jewel back before the stuff that exsists now (the stun stuff).  Stayed as my mainhander all through luclin, and into my time in pop, finally retired the nub of a weapon to the bank bag of fame when I got a GSoT (for 50k), was/is a fine weapon and I thank vaniki for dying so handily to get it for me.</div></div><hr />
