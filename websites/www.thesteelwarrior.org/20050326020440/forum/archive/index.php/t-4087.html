<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all.<br />
<br />
There was an interesting line in the patch message that mentioned an NPC named Verrell Cogswin who can help convert Red Scales to Green Scales.  Having another source for Green Scales would tremendously help those searching for the warrior epic tremendously.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know who this NPC is?  Where can we find him?  What quest does he offer to convert the scale?  <br />
<br />
I've done a quick search on Illa's Beastiary and could not come up with anything.  I also searched google for &quot;Verrell Cogswin,&quot; but failed to get any hits.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
And I realize the warrior epic is not nearly the uber weapon it once was.  And I know many people will say the weapon is not worth the effort.  However, it is something I've been after for so long, I would like to finally finish the quest.  Plus, it looks so friggin cool!<br />

It would be sad though as epics are RoK era and not everyone has PoP. But PoK sounds like the best place to start your search until someone confirms his/her location.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to check my NPC journal though to verify.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So anyone with real information on Cogswin? Nayr Cogswin wanders PoK and is for a magician spell quest, Pellillo Cogswin is in The Hole and talks of his lost brothers, Tani Cogswin (Chardok) and Stiggle Cogswin (Dragon Necropolis).</div></div><hr />

[Sat Nov 08 11:20:53 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Sorry Barbarian but I am a very tired gnome. I am returning from a trip to Halas but this desert heat has worn me out and for some reason my gate spell keep failing. If only I had some water then I could make it to the wizard portal and wait for my brother Pellillo to pick me up.'<br />

<br />
At this point, give him a Flask of Water, just one is needed...<br />
<br />
[Sat Nov 08 11:21:03 2003] Verrell throws back his head and empties the flask of water in one gulp. . . 'Thank Brell your kindness will not go unnoticed. I am eager to get back home I have been in the cold environment of Halas for so long I thought I was going to turn into a snowgnome. I am just glad we finally figured out the [recipe] for that concoction.'<br />

[Sat Nov 08 11:21:16 2003] You say, 'what recipe?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 11:21:16 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'My old shaman friend Shamus Felligan has been working on some way to change the color of items. He was very close to completing it but for some reason everytime he applied the mixture to something it would change the color temporarily. So he asked me to come down and help him. After a few months we realized what the problem was and we are now capable of changing things from red to green and from green to gray. I kept a sample for myself so I could turn my friend's red drake green as a surprise, but I would like to test it on a [red scale] first.'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 11:21:25 2003] You say, 'what red scale?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 11:21:26 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Yes the red scales of a dragon would be perfect for a test now that I think about it. Do you know anyone with a red scale that would be willing to let me use it in the pursuit of magical studies?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 11:21:41 2003] You say, 'I have a red scale'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 11:21:42 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Yes the red scales of a dragon would be perfect for a test now that I think about it. Do you know anyone with a red scale that would be willing to let me use it in the pursuit of magical studies?'<br />
<br />
Now, I didn't actually have a Red Dragon Scale as I have already turned in that part of my epic, but by the looks of things, it doesn't cost anything to have the transformation performed by Verrell.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you guys out! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny, if I actually did Takish adventures I might have found him hehe<br />
<br />
Good to know<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Okay, I took my cleric over there and found out you need to be a warrior, the gnome says &quot;Leave me be, I have a very important meeting to get to and must conserve what energy I have to finish the trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I took a lvl 11 warrior there and he said the same thing, except he also said &quot;This matter is far too advanced for you to handle...come back after you've killed a few more large rats&quot;<br />
<br />
So it's not only class restricted, but level restricted...looks like I have to get a guildie to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Augh!  DO NOT TURN IN YOUR SCALE!<br />
<br />
Apparently he messed up..it's not red to green...it's red to grey, then grey to green.  It also split into 4 pieces, so he needs to make an adhesive before he can return it to normal.<br />
<br />
He needs items (who didn't see this coming?) for a glue powder.  He needs a Fractured Centaur Hoof from Centaurs in Karanas, a jagged permafrost shard from a chilling terror in Permafrost, and Fire giant embers from fire giants in &quot;the caverns of exile&quot;.  Looks like that means the fire giants in SolC (lvl 60 mobs, I believe).<br />
<br />
You combine this with a Deep Barley Brew in a container he gives you.<br />
<br />
This is made by combining Deep Fungus Mold, Barley, and a bottle of distilled spirits.  Continuing to work...I lost my red scale, might as well keep going and possibly end up with a green one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, even if there is a bit of work between Red and Green Dragon Scales, certainly a lot easier for some than having to kill Sev for it.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, it will help a lot of newer warriors to get their epic at a level when they could actually use it effectively.</div></div><hr />

Any one got an idea on what the drop rate of the items for the red to green scale conversion are like?<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

I got the centaur hoof in South Karana off of the chargers.  Took me 3 chargers to get one.<br />
<br />
The permafrost shard is off of a chilling terror, dark blue to level 62 and is a necro.  Has 500 hp AE stun, turns PC into skeletons.  (Didn't get hit with AE when behind him).  Hits between mid 100's and low 300's even with defensive up.  My group wasn't big enough to drop him so not sure if it drops every time.<br />
<br />
Haven't been to Sol C to see what drop rate is on the embers.  When I get more info I'll post it.<br />
<br />
As far as the brew materials, they can be found in PoK at the vendor in the brew barrel house.  The fungus mold is expensive, 67 pp a shot.  Not sure what trivial is yet as I am still working my brewing up and failed one combine already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grobsmashprexus</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what people are complaining about so you have to do a few more kills to get your green scale.  As far as the quest goes it makes scence for you to have to do a sub quest to get the green scale.  If you dont like this way you can still go camp sev.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but you can fail grob, over and over again, kinda silly when ornate has no fails</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnawbone</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The barley was trivial to my cleric who has a skill of 156, so the brewing combine isn't that terrible. My warrior currently has a brewing skill of zero, so I'll post a better idea on trivial when I get a chance. I'm assuming the barley is not MQable.<br />
<br />
Hating that red scales have now jumped up to 25k.</div></div><hr />
