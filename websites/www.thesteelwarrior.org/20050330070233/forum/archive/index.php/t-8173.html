<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At your current level, in your current kit, BoT mobs will rape you, so I doubt any groups will want you to tank for them, and your dps is fairly low so unless you have friends that will carry you through it's probably not doable right now.  I'd say xp in droga and get a chos and sotb.  The mobs there aren't tough, they're damn good xps, and you are in desperate need of some aggro proc'ing weapons.  They'll make a huge difference in your groups ability to do damage as well as allowing slowers to debuff/slow much, much earlier without getting their ass handed to them.  And the mobs that drop them are, as mentioned previously, very nice xps.  <br />
<br />
Once that's taken care of, you should easily be able to tank in tier 1 PoP zones.  Try PoI, and if that's easy enough, try hobgoblins and gargoyles in PoN.  Those are good xps till about 61-62 iirc, and at that point you should be much better able to handle tanking in PoV and BoT.  Try them in that order.  If PoV is too hard, BoT will be too much for you to handle.  Also, since you're agnostic, ornate and ldon are probably going to be the best armors you have access to for a while, depending on the progression level of your guild, and the xps in ldon aren't too shabby either.  I'd upgrade the boots, helm, champs bracer and vambraces with either ornate, EF (760 points), or tak (1452 points) armors.</div></div><hr />

They are actually great exp. if you have a decent group.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you got just /tell me.</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />

As far as xp goes, a good group in PoI or PoN will be just as, or more efficient than PoV or BoT.  The xp per mob will be less, but your mob death per player death ratio will be much better.  I was fortunate enough to have a regular group to hit PoN and PoI with in my mid and upper 50's and the xp went relatively fast.<br />
<br />
One other spot that is great for xp is the factory in PoI.<br />
<br />
Don't discount LDoN's, hards are good xp in the 50's and regulars while not great xp will allow you to start working on both dropped and AP bought gear.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone could comment on some GoD zones for xp?  I'm not sure as the extent of my GoD experience is about 3 hours in Natimbi.</div></div><hr />

I found a nice spot for aa exp and reg exp in the PoI factory.  Also I have recently aquired my Sleeper's Tomb key and I hope to get some loot from there to beef my armor up.  Again Thanks and any help or hints are greatly appreciated.  Also I have done the sewers (Non flag or trial) just slow crawling along and the exp there was awesome.  Just again my level hinders me.</div></div><hr />

PoHate tier 3/4 area is a really good xp spot. <br />
<br />
It can be camped at 65 with a shaman as healer. &quot;Trash mobs&quot; gives 3% aaxp each and 6-9% aaxp for named mobs.<br />
<br />
This is for tiers 3/4 with a 65 group. As a level 60 you can hunt in a lower tier of the zone or try tiers 3 with a good group.<br />
But, don't expect to find a group there being LFG.<br />
