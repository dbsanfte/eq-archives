<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before I give you my review, let me tell you my experiences.  My very first MMORPG was Everquest.  I started as a ranger and later changed to a warrior which I leveled to 50.  After getting bored with Everquest, I changed to DaoC where I began with a berserker which I leveled to 50, and then later leveled a warrior to level 50 and RR5.  After that, I played SWG and maxed out a melee oriented Swordsman (with other melee oriented skills).  Getting bored with SWG, I returned to Everquest a few months ago, and have now leveled my warrior up to level 65, where I am begining to enjoy some of the PoP and Luclin end game content now.  Needless to say, I am committed to a melee class, and when possible, a warrior.<br />
<br />
     I entered WoW beta with doubts from the very beginning.  Firstly, with the exception of EQ (and maybe the Atlantis expansion of DaoC), I have yet to find a game with enough content to support more than a few months of playing time.  I am not ready to commit to a game that will not hold my attention for more than just a few months.  I am coming from the point of view that social relationships are what makes a game enjoyable firstly, then game mechanics.  There is too much invested in social relationships for a game that basically ends in a few months.<br />
     I was fairly surprised at the content of WoW.  I purposly picked a race that was isolated (Night Elves) and therefore, would have limited content just to get an idea of what the worst it might be from the early levels.  Even from the start, there seemed to be a wealth of things to do.  I did not realize I was being forced into quests everyone else was doing too until I got to level 10, but I was extremly happy with the content I was encountered.<br />
     The content becomes even more varied upon leaving the Night Elf island, where more difficult (and rewarding) quests require grouping.  The content seems rich and varied, however, the quests are in actuality rigid and structured.  To summarize, although there is a lack of content in the first 20 levels are so, you are so immersed into what you are doing, that you would not notice.<br />
<br />
     As far as warriors in WoW, I have a surprise for you-- They can solo!  Well, they can solo at earlier weapons, and if you want to gimp your grouping skills some, they can even solo at mid levels semi-decently.  However, where the warrior shines is in grouping (as with every other game).  The warrior seems to have more tools, and therefore, more variety in the group role than in previous games.  The warrior can play the part of main tank well, but additionally, he or she can function with a high level of dps, and even offer groupmates a buff or two via the battle shouts.<br />
     The downfall of the warrior seems to be in gear and training.  Maybe I just do not know where to look yet, but I am having a hard time finding any decent armor (although weapons seem to be everywhere).  Warriors also have to spend money to purchase skills for battle, as well as purchasing training for different weapon skills (you dont start being able to use 2-hand weapons, you must travel to find a trainer and the buy that training).  This money adds up quickly, and it seems that warriors will be perpetually broke, at least until the end game content.<br />
<br />
     Battle skills are fun.  There are more than one option for pulling (I use either bow and arrow, or a charge skill depending on the situation; I assume guns are an option for warriors as well for pulling).  Battle shouts allow a small attack buff to groupmates.  Hamstrining a MoB will slow it when it runs away.  There is an AoE effect that reduces the attack speed of MoBs and causes a small amount of damage.  Warriors have bleeds at their disposal, as well as some special moved with more extended damage.<br />
     Additionally, there are three stances warriors have to choose from.  The defensive stance seems to be good for functioning as the main tank in a group.  The berserker stance seems to be better for being in the role of DPS in a group.  The other stance (I forget the name) seems to work well for soloing.<br />
<br />
     Where is the negative side of WoW.  Well, the game is now in open beta, and it appears that there are a lot of people coming to the game who either have no idea how a MMORPG works, or who are griefers, l33t d00ds, or just damn annoying.  I am hoping (praying) that when the game goes live, the social atmosphere will change.  However, WoW can do something to help with this.  Chat options SUCK.  They SUCK BAD.<br />
     Lets see, what else...  Well the game is remarkable complete for an open beta.  The only game that seems to have gelled all the classes and grouping options together, etc as well as Blizzard has would be DaoC.<br />
<br />
     Summary statement:  World of Warcraft offers a surpising and fresh new look at the warrior, in a beautiful enviroment with rich content.  The game mechanics are amazing, the quests mesmerizing, and the variety of roles for the warrior is unique among MMORPG's.  There are some downsides to WoW, and I do not expect the game to ever be perfect, however, my experiences with the game were inciting enough that I will be playing this game starting at release, something I have never done with any other game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A: Taunt is broken.<br />
B: Warriors are about to get a massive change.<br />
C: Way too early to review the Warrior, as many have said before, its still in Beta. If you think just because its Open means its ready to ship, your crazy. Vivendi is just putting them on an insanely tight schedule, and as a result they're having to combine a lot of last minute testing with Open Beta (Most of said testing requires large amounts of high level players, so I'm not implying that Open Beta servers have to test it, it is essentially 'Free Trial' for them, just saying, its not done.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, not at all a good time to review the WoW Warrior.  It's currently too broken and unbalanced.<br />
<br />
In addition to what Ful posted, my Warlock from lvl 1-20 hit mobs in melee about 90% of the time, maybe closer to 80% at lvl 20.  But my warrior from lvl 5-11 so far hits mobs about 60% of the time.  For mobs that are 2 levels higher, I hit about 40% of the time.  Stuff that is trivial for my warlock at the same level (without a pet even), I will die if I get a few misses in a row.<br />
<br />
Then there's the balance issues in PvE and PvP, currently with Paladins and Shaman getting talents, they are both way overpowered and put Warriors to shame.  This should be adjusted the next patch.<br />
<br />
Also the next patch should adjust Warrior aggro generation especially in defensive stance.<br />
<br />
I'm just leveling mine up now in the hopes that this next patch will be a good one, since we don't have much time left to beta test with....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll agree with most of what Dented said.  From my experience playing a warrior to 51 in the closed beta, I never had a fully up-to-date weapons/armor suite.  Then again, I didn't worry about it too much either.  Even without top-notch gear I did just fine.  Learning weapon skills is generally cheap (most are 10 silver, a few are 1 gold).  The class skills can get expensive but given my experiences with a hunter, warriors have it much easier on money.<br />
<br />
Being able to solo at any level is awesome.  I didn't play my warrior after the two most recent patches, was spending too much time with friends on the open beta servers so I can't comment much on taunt, beyond saying that my druid's growl in bear form, which works exactly like a warrior's taunt, worked just fine.  Some of the warrior's abilities don't scale all that well, especially Thunder Clap (AE damage and 10% slow).  Some of them are just great, especially Battle Shout.  The stances are less distinct after the recent changes which is both good and bad.  There is less of a difference between them which kinda sucks but on the plus side, Berserker stance was finally finished which is just great.<br />
<br />
The class has some good quests, which can be interesting and fun with good rewards.  The talents are pretty good although I still think that there is not a whole lot of difference between a Fury spec and an Arms spec, both are high-dps killing machines.  I consider the Protection talents to be kinda weak overall although there are some nice gems in that talent line.<br />
<br />
For the EQ players, you all will need to make some mental leaps when you come to WoW.  First, you don't need Holy Trinity groups (warrior, priest, mage).  Some people will tell you that you do.  They are wrong.  Experiment and you will have a lot of fun.  Second, tanks stack in groups.  You could conceivably let a druid in bear form be MT while you do snares and it would work.  An EQ group with a warrior and 2 paladins would be seriously gimped but in WoW it could be nasty.  Third, assassination quests work for an entire group.  i.e. if you have to kill Mob X and loot its head in EQ you would have to do it 6 times for the whole group.  In WoW Mob X dies and everyone in the group that has the quest gets the head.  Fourth, you don't have to spend 8 hours a day grinding to get anywhere.  There are tons of quests of various levels of difficulty and it is much better to do quests than mindlessly grind.</div></div><hr />
