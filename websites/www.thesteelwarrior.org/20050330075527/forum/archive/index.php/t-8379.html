<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm in a guild atm that's killing Quarm, and progressiong through GoD. (Ikkinz 3 was our last success)<br />
<br />
I currently have Cranial Bludgeoner, greatstaff of the 4 winds, Greatblade of Storms(A3'd), and the gay hammer from Sol Ro (A3'd)<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
<br />
With our days in Time numbered, and my weapons lacking, should I pick up a VDD or EoE? Assuming DBotW is out of the question (since my guild's like 0-10 on RZ kills, and there's many tanks above me)<br />
<br />
Is VDD worth A3ing and usuing into GoD? Or should I go for EoE and JoS?<br />
<br />
Or should I just A3 the Cranial Bludgeoner and wait for the deep in GoD 1 handers that replace DBotW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothin wrong with a JoS + EoE combo with both aug'd, I think you'd be happy with that setup, I used it for a while.  Personally if I were you(having no shot at all at a Darkblade), I'd pick up a VDD, put anger 3 on it, then hold out for better 1-handers from GoD.  VDD is a great tanking weapon with Anger, and can also be a great DPS weapon if used correctly when you get better 1-handers.  Fleshbiter + Demerix or JoS, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so should I blow off EoE?<br />
<br />
I'm hesitant to pick up EoE because of the delay. Riposte seems like it would be a huge problem... and let's face it, with LDoN, aggro's the easy part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an EoE sitting in one of my bags(use it ocasionally for LDoN's or casting mobs for stun proc.)  It's a good weapon, but with GoD there are better.  EoE isn't junk by any means, but if I were you(not having a shot at Darkblade) I'd shoot for Fleshbiter, JoS, Demerix, etc.  Snag a VDD to tide you over until you can get the above weapons.<br />
<br />
And yes it has a fast delay and is gonna get you more repostes.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Was gonna suggest aug'ing your Cran Bludg and using it for tanking... but with that DoT proc I dunno, DoT procs make me nervous(and chanters.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the question should be more like :<br />
1. can Cranial Bludgeoner+A3 compete with VDD+A3 ?<br />
2. can GBoS+A3 / Flameforge Hammer+A3 compete with the answer of #1 ?<br />
3. can EoE+A3 / GBoS+A3  compete with the answer of #1 ?<br />
4. can JOS+A3 / EoE+AQ3  compete with the answer of #1 ?<br />
<br />
and I would reply :<br />
1. the DoT is far lesser aggro than the DD+dispell, but the ratio of CB is far better than the one from VDD so it isn't an easy answer. I would say it's an even fight, especially with the A3 augment that smooth the proc diff.<br />
2. this time the 2H may win easily, FH is not a fabulous weapon, only the dual A3 make me doubt.<br />
3. not quite sure, the GBoS is good, but not as much as the Time+ weapons, so I would say it's an even fight again, with maybe a little advantage for the DW.<br />
4. well this time it's easier, the DW combo with its decent DPS and the 8ppm will beat the 2Her and its bigger DPS but not enougth proc hate per minute.<br />
<br />
But let see what other think about it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cranial Bludgeoner&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;VDD<br />
<br />
Speaking from firsthand experience. My girlfriend has both and had them both anger aug'ed. The CB drew much more agro. She eventually just banked the VDD.<br />
<br />
Repostes simply were not an issue in GoD like they were on some mobs in POP. Plus you are still getting 1/2 the repostes with the CB than duel wielding.<br />
<br />
That said, she now uses JoS and Aranini's rage. Agro has now become trivial. Duel wield now seems to be a good bit ahead of 2H again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VDD is a perfectly usable weapon at this stage.  We have three warriors using them atm, they don't seem to have any issues whatever holding aggro.<br />
<br />
That said, I would point out that there's more to holding aggro than weapons and procs.  Our toughest warrior uses a BoW, and even though that's not the best aggro weapon now, the casters are all convinced he keeps bacon in his pockets.  I asked him about this, and he said that he only uses /discs now on the really nasty boss mobs, relying on his 20+ % shielding, 2400 AC and 13K HP to keep him alive.  Meantime, he uses his aggro disc, and chains Ancient Chaos Cry.  He recently got one of our wizards to do her best to pull aggro off him during the last half of a Msha fight in Qvic.  Critter never turned once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthious</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I missed a darkblade by not being able to farm time, we've only gotten 1 fleshbiter to drop in i think 6 uqua clears, so I bucked up and am using JoS main / demerix off with both A3'd, and it works very well when I need to tank, as i'm 3 / 4 tanks down on our order. EoA effect does help if you can get ahold of it thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am assuming that you guys have gotten enough EoE that it would be easy for you to pick one up. If this is the case, then I would recommend taking the next one, then getting a mainhand weapon from GoD. Once you have an EoE, you can pair it with JoS, FB, or Demerix to end up with a pretty kick ass combo.<br />
<br />
Since you already have a CB, I think it would be a waste to loot a VDD. While a VDD is pretty good agro, it just isn't going to compare to a high end DW combo. It's pretty hard to overcome 10+ ppm with DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angebleu</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion 2h A3  agro is not in the same league as Dual vield double a3 agro. Reason why so many stick to the 2h setup is that they are relying on Pre ldon agro assumtions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a VDD atm, I like it and it really does it's job, but I still think once I get the pieces of loot i need atm (DKP guild gotta manage money :)) I'll start looking at 1hs options again...just feel a bit greedy if i get a 1 hander having just recently got a VDD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mbad</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a VDD+ang3+all 2hand AAs. I have to stop attacking to NOT get agro from DB+offhand(JoS/EoE whatever) on raids, so for agro id go with the 2hander. And if the MT dies/FDs whatever im almost always the next on agrolist which makes it pretty much worth the while just for MT swaps on raids...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i agree that on long fights such as potime nameds the Vanazr easy gets the job done. I have a Stone etched warszord i take out of my bags when guild hits potime. It super easy position me whereever i want to be on the agrolist, second or third or whatever. <br />
<br />
However when we hit GOD and especially uqua where we have to lock agro on the traps i put the sews in my bags and equip Boc A3 mainhand and EoE A3 offhand. It totally owns locking agro compared to the sews A3.<br />
<br />
Oh btw the BOC  // EoE combination also totally locked agro down on the CBQ when we attempted that. I never lost agro, was only our second attemppt so we wiped though but hammered her pretty easy down to 30 % ones agro was locked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Tell the ones using the DB+JOS/EoE offhand to turn attack on.  That should help you not get aggro when using the VDD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimhead</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im currently using a VDD aug'd with A3 and I also have aten gloves. Agro is fine unless im going head to head with our DB/JoS warrior. Its actually a perfect weapon to use for me in PoT because im almost always second tank and I can go balls out on my agro but its not gonna pass our DB/JoS warriors agro so im always second one to get agro after he dies. Alot of the time i wont even have to use AoE taunt to get agro when he dies im just always second one on the agro list. I would get the VDD untill you get a chance at fleshbiter/DB or just A3 your CB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why the hell would you have him take a VDD when he already has a better weapon in the CB?<br />
<br />
You make zero sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">plane of time is a realy bad example for how good or bad agro on a certain weapon is imo. Yet it seem to have concencus for alot of the 2handers to post that as an argument. Plane of time is a totally uncomplicated zone regarding agro. All the mobs are single fights where you are allways capable of making a full agro  preparation pre engage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boy-</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say since you already have the gay hammer, steal a boc from guildbank, A3 it, then try MA an ikkinz clearing without anyone in the raid using stuns.  <br />
<br />
Then ask your shamans and chanters which they like better.  I'd put down bets they'll say the 1h combo.  Mean-time-to-proc is really all that matters when you're doing mobs that need to be debuffed fast.  And surely an eoe would be better than the gayhammer aggrowise.<br />
<br />
The problem is whenever someone asks this question, everyone with vanazirs pipes in and says vanazirs are fine, everyone with sews pipes in that sews are fine, etc.  Ask your shamans and chanters, they know which weapons make it so they don't die, and which they have to hold back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have a VDD augmented with Anger 3 and just picked up a EOE this past weekend.  I was just curious as to what i should match it up with.  DBotW is what I would love to have but with its rarity and a few warriors ahead of me wanting it, it is pretty much out of the question for now.  My guild has beaten Uqua and we are gearing up in Qvic and about to head into Inktuta.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aguktawarrior</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fleshbiter? Seems right in your ballpark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
jos+eoe for agro. CB for dps is what i would do.</div></div><hr />
