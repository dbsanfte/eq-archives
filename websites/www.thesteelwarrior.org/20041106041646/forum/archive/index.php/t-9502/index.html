<br />
                 Basically just wanted to look for some ideas on some upgrades that can be gotten by grouping mobs and such. I am in an elemental guild heading into time but due to living in australia I only get to raid weekends so my upgrades are few and far between. Although I spend alot of time getting drops from groupable mobs to allow myself to be a viable option for tanking in raids and such.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas of what I could upgrade and where it drops. Only upgrade I can think of at the moment is the maze runners mask from PG which I am working on getting.<br />

Edit: These can also include bazaar items if there the top of what grouping can give.</div></div><hr />
