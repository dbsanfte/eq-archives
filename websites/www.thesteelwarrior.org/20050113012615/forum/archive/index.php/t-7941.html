nother thought, with those 2 aa's listed (which I have) it procs for 1244 crit blast assuming no resists.  Which leads me to beleive something like this should do more damage offhand than say an sod for arguments sake, which would only proc 576 crit blasts.<br />
<br />
Not saying either is great for offhand but, wondering if someone has taken this for a spin.</div></div><hr />

He's a fun little mob that can be rooted and mezzed (blue con).  He does hit like a truck compared to most of the trash in riwwi, but he's pretty easy to tank with just a cleric and a warrior.<br />
<br />
I camped him for quite a while and you'll see a million maces of dark glory (the 27/25 knight's blessing proccer) which sell at about 25kish, before you get one.<br />
<br />
BUUUT i wanted one b/c I think an Ethereal Destoyer and one of these in the offhand would be a HOOT to have going off and crit blasting!<br />
<br />
In terms of aggro.  If you get a blast on the first swing or two, you're golden.  BUT with WA5 and this slow slingin brick on a 10 foot rope, if it dont' go off right away.....  <br />
<br />
And it seems that even w. WA5 that this has a low proc ratio mod on it.  I haven't crunched any numbers and maybe it's because you spend alot more time actively watching for the proc, but it doesn't go off that often to really make your eyes bleed.<br />
<br />
It's definitely more of a toy than an actual tanking weapon.</div></div><hr />

But have been reading them for awhile now..  I was wondering when someone was going to ask about this weapon.. I won this on a Roll while playing my chanter.. was in Rwinni in the colliseum.. Dropped of a named mob and this is his rare drop.. At the time my warr was level 59 Cat.. I have this to him and used in primary mostly.. got my skills maxed with it. and with 255 dex this thing would proc a ton.. at least 3 time in a battle in say PON or POD.. sometimes 5 times.. had a SotBS on the off hand.. I know it should go the other way.. I just wanted to see how often it procs in primary.. and it does quite abit.. and very rare resist on the mobs i have been on. ieven POV mobs get drilled by this.. Aggro seemed a bit of a Prob in the higher plane.. but probably do to my level at the time..  Anyway i love this thing.. will probably give to my young cleric to try out sometime soloing before she gets her good hammers..Hey nice to play around with this thing.. <br />

It may be a little slow but even if the proc doesnt go off right away, with the right combo it can be an effective weapon.<br />
<br />
Of course there is nothing better than the wow what are you using to proc 625 questions then linking it either lol.<br />
<br />
The warrior i stole aggro from was using a boc and some other weapon i never saw before and was level 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
enraging blow=700 pure hate<br />
<br />
cudgel proc=625 DD aggro which isnt even = 625 pure hate<br />
<br />
chos proc = 400-450 hate which again is much less than the boc<br />
<br />
assuming mainhand does proc 2x offhand rate there is no way you shojuld have been peling aggro off him if he had a clue what he was doing<br />
<br />
whatever his offhand wasw it doesnt sound like it was an aggro weap if you were stealing aggro off him</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curdlex</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I have alot of time at work ans since only a few EQ websites are not blocked.  This discussion kinda died out, usualy there are heated debates about whether an item is a good aggro weapon or not.  Its is my understanding that potential damage affects aggro more then actual damage.  If thats the case wouldn't this make a good weapon for nonboss tanking?  With PPM a constant and if Potential damage affects aggro, then wouldn't this be just  a step below BoC but far above teh DrogA weapons?  I don't have, but would anybody like to swear by it or against it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curdlex, I suppose you are thinking &quot;622 damage! That's almost as much hate as the BoC which procs for 700!&quot;  But it's not.  For nukes, the hate produced is less than the damage produced.  The fine tolks over at Graffe estimated hate:damage ratio at 2:3.  So that makes Dedgerex's proc similar in aggro to Anger 2 and somewhat worse than Taunting Blow or Force Strike... and with a really terrible weapon ratio backing it up.  To put it in perspective, a Short Sword of the Ykesha probably nearly matches Dedgerex for aggro.  A Copper Hammer of Striking is certainly going to outaggro Dedgerex due to its huge advantage in ratio.</div></div><hr />

First was we started doing guild groups in Riwwi and found out how common they are, got like 6 of them over 3 or 4 trips there. Second was to use for Valdanov doing the Loyalist Shield quest.

I am a 59 warrior (got the Flintforge when I was 56 from a friend). My dex, sta, agi and str are all maxxed at 255 until I get 60. I use the Flintforge in my offhand and depending on the mob, either an Ornate Stone Battle Hammer (proc's Mirror 3 for the caster mobs) or Sword of the Bloodsworn (has 75 DD effect and 50 DD aug for the melee mobs). All I have been hearing is people talking bad about this weapon. For someone my level and not EP flagged this weapon rocks! I have never lost aggro from anyone. That includes level 65 warrior's trying to take it from me. This thing proc's at least once per fight, sometimes the thing goes off 3 or 4 times in a row. I have had it go off 7 times on one mob before and I was just killing IZ trash at Veksar. And just to let everyone know, I have 4, yes 4 AA's (run3 and regen1 so far). So, anyone that says the proc rate on this sucks, you have no idea what you're talking about. For a lower level toon that doesn't have access to the EP's yet, this weapon is pretty decent.<br />

P.S. Had to tell my first story of when the Ornate Stone Battle Hammer showed it's true worth. I was in OS a couple days ago and was jumped at the GOZ camp by a froglok enchanter. Started beating on the chanter mob and M3 goes off. Next thing I know I have a frog chanter for a pet. Didn't know what to do for a couple minutes. Then proceeded to take out 3 mobs and get the chanter to 30% before the self inflicted mez broke. Talk about frikken hilarious... I'd hate to be the chanter that had to tell that story to his friends!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate to break it to ya rookie, but 99.9% of all weapons proc the same, including this.<br />
<br />
And the fact of the matter is, that it's not an aggro weapon.  It's got a shit ratio (I was using a 12/24 Crystalline Short sword in Kunark for christs sake), and a non aggro producing  DD proc (albeit a large one, which somewhat makes up for shit ratio).  Your Flintforged procs once a minute average in your offhand, for a whopping 600 damage a minute (well, assuming it's not a resist).<br />
<br />
Bring that weapon to my group, I'll show you what aggro is.</div></div><hr />

You know what, rookie? If you noticed my previous post, you'd see that I already stated the fact that if you complain about the proc rate, you don't know what you're talking about. I suppose I should have clarified it for people like Haass who cannot read between the lines. I knew that most proc rates are virtually the same and I'm sure that other people knew this, also. I assumed, that's the only place I was wrong. I guess it takes people like the above poster to try and point out people's faults to make them feel better about themselves. Anyway, my point about the Flintforge was that it is a very good weapon in the offhand. Regardless of dam/del ratio, for a 59 warrior. If you don't like it, say you don't. Don't flame others for their opinion. It just shows how self righteous you THINK you are.<br />

Did you read his post? No where does he state that the proc rate is better or worse than other weapons. This guy is using it pre-level 60, meaning he's probably restricted to bazaar weapons. This weapon is getting rather cheap on my server and is attractive alternative for someone in the mid 50'ies.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I fail to see the need to mock this guy, by calling him a rookie. Perhaps you're looking to boost your fake uberness at the expense of others?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the Epic 2hander auged with A2 for regular groups, I group with another friend that has a 65 War and was using one of these thingies, the only time he got agro was if a)Procced as soon as the mob got to camp and I didnt Incited yet, or b) He taunted. If the warrior knows what hes doing, there is not chance of this weapon stealing agro over a CHoS and much less over a BoC.<br />
<br />
Still tho, I would use it for a DPS setup just cause of the proc, if the mobs dont resist it a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, &quot;people like me&quot; figured out the proc rates on weapons.  In fact, you'll find that I contributed a very large sample set to the post where we did.<br />
<br />
Second of all, it's plenty fine to bitch about the proc rate on this weapon.  1 proc per minute in the offhand, on a 12/27 weapon IS CRAP.  If it had an increased proc rate, the weapon actually might be passable, as it stands, it's a pile of shit.<br />
<br />
It's a good weapon for a 59 warrior?  Sure, maybe a 59 warrior who doesn't feel like tanking, it's probably a great weapon.  For people who like to get hit, I can list about 30 weapons under the price tag of this weapon that will serve your purposes much better.<br />
<br />
DD procs don't generate massive amounts of aggro.  Math in this thread has hinted that this weapon is worse for aggro than the red epic, and you can actually do a search for &quot;Red Epic&quot; and you'll find about 1500 posts from people saying how shitty that weapon is, and how it doesn't cut it by today's standards.<br />
<br />
I would hardly call a weapon, which is sub par to a weapon that is sub par to today's standards, a quality weapon.  In fact, I'd call it a Bard, or beastlord weapon. <br />

It ain't pretty. As soon as the first rogue assists or the<br />
first heal or debuff lands, the whole guild chases the mob around<br />
<br />
It's for this exact reason that I'm very picky about the tanks I group with when I do pickup groups with my rogue.  I get rather sick of being told by someone who just got their PoJ trial flag telling me how to evade in an LDoN.  It only refreshes so fast and sometimes fails as much as taunt does.<br />
<br />
I built my warrior with rogue and wizard dps in mind.  BoC in main, SoD in offhand.  I'm there to tank, not be DPS.  Now obviously not just anyone's going to be able to afford that, but the CHoS and SotB work fairly well.  On my server you can pick up the CHoS for 8k, and the SotB for 3k.  The mace goes for 50k+  Go out and get yourself some ornate gloves or something much more useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see the cudgel overly great for offhand, but it can be fun in mainhand if you're duoing.<br />

LOL, that's when I pull out the yak augged tank toys and click on the stun poison and go into tank mode.  I probably have more AC/HP anyway.<br />
Seriously though, I keep seeing more and more warriors getting both these weapons, and that velium gemmed longsword and I just cringe.</div></div><hr />

We've basically determined that the primary purpose of this weapon is for damage and not aggro.  <br />
<br />
Hate generated is decent enough that if augmented with an anger3 it can probably keep up aggro, but by itself it's obviously not enough based upon the discussion here.  Seems better to leave the weapon in the bag, and augment with some heavy damage proc and just bust it out when you're the secondary tank that way.  <br />
<br />
I have seen a tank in BoT with the cudgel aug'd with a hate3, he had no problem at all keeping aggro, had a CHoS as mainhand with anger 3 also.   With the AA that gives  crits on your procs plus WA5, he was dishing out some serious damage.   Apparently the augs produced enough hate to make up for the lack of hate that the proc generates from the cudgel.    He probably wouldn't use this combo in a more serious situation like LDoN hard or on a raid as MT, but for zones like BoT it served the purpose fine. <br />
<br />
So the weapon is situational, will earn a slot in my weapons bag for a while to come (along with my fabled exe axe, whip of ensnaring, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrliss</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, &quot;people like me&quot; figured out the proc rates on weapons. In fact, you'll find that I contributed a very large sample set to the post where we did. <br />
<br />
It seems to me that Haass has not been given his proper respect. Thank you so very much for contributing so very much to figuring out proc rates, dps rates and the means to stop world hunger! You are a GOD and should be treated that way. If someone has an opinion contrary to yours they should be drawn and quartered for expressing it.  &lt;&lt;Sarcasm Off&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Second of all, it's plenty fine to bitch about the proc rate on this weapon. 1 proc per minute in the offhand, on a 12/27 weapon IS CRAP. If it had an increased proc rate, the weapon actually might be passable, as it stands, it's a pile of shit. <br />
<br />
As long as I have weilded this weapon in my offhand I have NEVER EVER had the Flintforge proc 1 time per minute. If anything, the damn thing goes off three times as fast as you think it does. Just because you have given so much of your precious time (probably most of it spent at work) to figure all these rates, doesn't mean you actually got it right or get the privelage to dictate what is good and what is bad. If someone feels that the weapon they are using is good for them, either tell them that it is or isn't with some suggestions of something better. Telling someone that a weapon sucks ass and then not giving a suggestion for a better weapon is the sissy way out.<br />
<br />
It's a good weapon for a 59 warrior? Sure, maybe a 59 warrior who doesn't feel like tanking, it's probably a great weapon. <br />
<br />
Another ignorant comment! I tank very well with the weapons I weild. I very rarely lose agro to anyone. That would include many tanks well above my level. <br />
<br />
DD procs don't generate massive amounts of aggro. <br />
<br />
Funny you should mention this... If I am secondary tank in a group (very rarely) and we are killing a mob, once the proc goes off I mysteriously ALWAYS take agro and keep it. Hmmm, wonder why that is? Maybe the high and mighty Haass doesn't know everything about everything? Probably the case. Just accept the fact that some people like different weapons and are partial to those weapons. I particullarly like the Flintforge. It works more than adequately for me at the level I am at currently. I have no agro or DPS problems. Therefore, I will keep my weapons until I NEED to make a change.<br />

<br />
  We've gone over this one before... You can grab virtually any weapon, including a proc-less weapon like a SBoD, and anger 3 augment it to hold ok aggro. Your aggro won't be great, but it'll probably be good enough. That doesn't make it an aggro weapon, it just makes it a waste of an anger 3. <br />
<br />
  Arrliss, yes. We have done *EXTENSIVE* proc rate testing on this board, and you are wrong. On average, this weapon will proc 1 time per minute offhand, just like nearly EVERY OTHER WEAPON. Parse it. You're pretending like you can just eyeball the rate, and I can assure you that you can't. 8 hour parses don't lie.<br />
<br />
  Use whatever you want. We don't really care if you're a shitty tank or not.

Hehe, one of the druids in my guild told me the mob with that weapon was up and offered to help me kill it just the other night.  I told him thanks but I wouldn't loot that piece of junk if it was rotting at my feet.  12/27?  Good lord.  It's amazing what people can rationalize when they want to believe :).  If you have ingenuity you can use it long enough to get a screenshot of yourself crit blasting for 1200 but there are too many superior weapons that are easier to get to consider equipping this on a daily basis.  Offhanding a BoC with it is completely ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

This is a reflection of the other tanks' aggro, not a reflection of the properties of this weapon. :)  If Dedgerex can grab aggro on a proc, then a Short Sword of the Ykesha from Lower Guk would have drawn aggro on a proc, too.<br />
I have no agro or DPS problems.<br />
I am just curious, though, how much DPS do you produce with your Dedgerex offhand and Ornate Stone Battlehammer mainhand?<br />
<br />
With a Droga combo, I would expect a level 59 warrior to hit 60 DPS enchanter-buffed, and a little more with a WMBS.</div></div><hr />

It appears that I have upset the Steel Warrior's very own Good Ol' Boys club! If you were half the reader as the great Tank you claim to be. I am only trying to say that I enjoy using this weapon. It works well for me. Do I need to keep repeating myself for the slow people reading this (Fitemore and Haass)? I did make a mistake in my last post, though. You may have figured your parse for a particular toon weilding that weapon. As far as I know, you don't use my account. And I am saying the Dedgerex's Flintforged Cudgel procs more than once per minute on my toon! I suppose you and Haass are the only ones that know the art of parsing? Once again, we have a case of people opening their yaps without thinking... Besides, my whole point was that some people like certain weapons. They work differently for different toons because of different stats and augs on the weapons and toons. You may think you are qualified to judge how people play their toons. As far as I am concerned, your opinion means very little to me. <br />
<br />
But don't come here and tell people who have spent more time testing stuff in EQ than you've spent playing it and tell us we're wrong based entirely on YOUR OPINION. You're wrong. We're not. <br />
<br />
Wanna cookie? First, I have been playing EQ before there was a KUNARK! Second, who says you are the only people that test stuff on EQ? You do realize there are more than a handful of people that play this game, right? And I never said you were wrong in those words. See the above comment about different people weilding the same weapon? Parses are different when a different person is using the same weapon due to personal stat changes and buffs that person may have on at the time. Your parse could have been dead on. FOR THE TOON YOU USED TO PARSE WITH! Look past you and see there are other people who play this game just as effectively as you! <br />
<br />
OMG! Don't kill me for saying that. You are the best and no one will ever surpass you. &lt;&lt;Sarcasm Off&gt;&gt; <br />

  Are you... kidding me? You're trying to tell me that for some bizarre reason your character procs 3 times as often as any other character? 3 times more than a character with max offensive AAs and max stats? Well, damn, you should sell on Ebay. I bet you could get thousands of dollars for a character with that attribute.

No you aren't. You're defensive about being wrong, so you're being smart-mouthed and offensive to seasoned steel warrior veterans.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am saying the Dedgerex's Flintforged Cudgel procs more than once per minute on my toon! &quot;<br />
<br />
No it doesn't. You may be implying that since you have weapon affinity it procs more than that, but if you were &quot;half the reader you wish others to be&quot; you'd know that they're talking about 1ppm base, before WA or Combat Effects. Can you keep up with the conversation yet?<br />
<br />
&quot;Parses are different when a different person is using the same weapon due to personal stat changes and buffs that person may have on at the time&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me explain something to you once, so you can crawl in a hole and go away. Your offhand procrate isn't affected by stats, so no buffs, stat changes, or general desire for the proc to go off more is going to make a difference. All the things that make a difference were parsed on this board, with seperate characters, evaluated, and broken down. Before you start to reply saying you have more dex than they had, i'm going to tell you that dex is a stat too and only matters for primary hand, which btw is why primary hand fires off more. <br />
<br />
If you happen to find an area of all that where I'm wrong, which btw, unlike you, I'm fallable, then lets go back to the point you keep missing, &quot;they're talking about 1ppm base&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I've never seen any evidence of that. As far as I've seen, secondary proc rate is affected by exactly the same things that affect your mainhand proc rate. Your primary hand procs more because you have more base primary attacks, at least that's what my reasoning tells me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know dex effects your offhand procrate the same as it does your mainhand.  The 1 ppm number is assuming 305 Dex and no weapon affinity with a standard proc-rate weapon.  It's not just the fact that you swing less with your offhand, offhand procrate is about half of your mainhand procrate but dual wield works considerably more than 50% of the time I believe (can't remember what the % is for sure).</div></div><hr />

As I have stated before, I have no problems with my current weapons at this point. I know this as fact. However, there seems to be a couple of people that know how my toon performs better than I do. This comes as quite a shock to me as I am the only person with access to run this toon. It is my personal opinion (something I am entitled to) that the Flintforge is a decent weapon and performs the task I use it for with the efficiency I require at this level of gameplay. It is not suited for every player! I never said that it will outdamage UberAxe_01 or is better than another weapon. I only stated that I am happy with it. To all those people that disagree, fine! You are also entitled to your opinions. Just don't flame someone that does use it! For all those who wish to continue to bash the fact that I use it, you're just looking for someone to do that to to make yourself feel big and important.

This will probably answer your question as to why the responses came as they did.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, there seems to be a couple of people that know how my toon performs better than I do. <br />
<br />
At some point or another, most of us have messed around with a wide variety of weapons testing their proc rates and so on.  There used to be a huge debate about primal proccing more often they anything else.  Later it was proven it's proc rate is the same as just about every other weapon EQ with a few Luclin and PoP exceptions.<br />
<br />
The 2ppm main, 1ppm offhand is a simple average over a lengthy amount of time.  You'll hit spikes where you get a lot within a short period of time.  And then you'll hit spots where it doesn't proc at all for a few fights.<br />
<br />
<br />
To all those people that disagree, fine! You are also entitled to your opinions. Just don't flame someone that does use it! <br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Use it.  By all means.  All anyone has been stating is that it's [A] Not an aggro weapon, and [B] Not a DPS weapon.  Back in Kunark, it'd have been uber.  But by today's standards it's merely a toy.  Since you have to be 55+ to even equip it, there are just so many other better weapons out there.<br />
<br />
And since you mentioned you're also using an Ornate Stone Hammer, the money you could get for both could definitely go a long way to upgrading your other slots with some pretty nice stuff.<br />
<br />
All that aside, play the game how you want to.  Just keep in mind, when you come to the warrior board and make grand boasts the way you did, expect a little bit of flak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, everyone on the warrior board is a tard except you.  We've seen this before, it's some kind of psychological disorder I think.  May want to seek professional advice regarding your condition.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna find me an Ice Comet Aug..ya know, good 1120DD.  I'm gonna put that thing on a 2/40 orc pawn pick and offhand that sumbitch.  Sure, i might lose 25-35 DPS from my offhand damage, but I'm gonna gain the l33tness that comes with a 2240 crit blast once every 10 procs, and that more than makes up for whatever aggro, DPS, and respect I'd lose by making such a decision.<br />
<br />
Understand yet?  The above statement is called &quot;Fucking ridiculous,&quot; and only a tad more so than justifying the use of a 12/27 (Like I said, I was using 12/24 ALMOST 4 GODDAMNED YEARS AGO), simply because of a non aggro producing DD proc.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna make a prediction.  I'm gonna make a wager that a warrior wasn't your first character.  I'm betting that you played a caster, and I'm also betting that you think the splitblade of destruction and velium gemmed weapons are top of the line.<br />

Arliss loves his Cudgel. He loves it enough to defend it to his dying breath. He feels it is working well for him at his current level.<br />
<br />
<br />
MANY others feel that Arliss could:<br />
<br />
A) Increase his aggro with a CHoS/SoTB combo<br />
<br />
B) Increase his DPS with changing his weapons<br />
<br />
C) Should sell his beloved cudgel AND ornate stone hammer and upgrade armor<br />
<br />
D) Should find a tank that can really generate some aggro and try to take it from him with current weapons equipped<br />
<br />
E) Should do his own 8 hour parse to find out HIS proc rate<br />
<br />
That clarified (like butta), I must say I am in the &quot;many others&quot; category. I think Arliss could benefit from trying A-E.<br />

First of all, I've sugar coated responses for people for a long time, it didn't accomplish shit.  Some people still don't care about facts and think their own experiences (in thier skewed perspectives nonetheless) are fact, and will defend that fact to the death.  If this is going to be the case (Which it is more times than not around here), then I'm not even gonna fucking bother.  I'm gonna be the dick I want to be and the dick I can be because I've done my homework.<br />

Second of all, if he sticks around and stays a productive member of the community, then I'll think even more highly of him.  There are very few people I want to see leave here, and uninformed people are not them.  Am I gonna lose any fucking sleep at nite if they do?  Certainly not.<br />
<br />
Third, I couldn't care less what you, or anyone else thinks of me.  I won't be losing any sleep over that either.  Peddle your rants somewhere else, I've heard it all before, and I'm not going anywhere.</div></div><hr />

Sell your mace to a poor soul and buy yourself some gear upgrades :D<br />

By the bys, yes, some people have a playing style and you sure can use whatever weapon you want (Hey, Im using a 2h Epic,  I like it, but Im not gonna say its awesome agro cause I know there are plenty combos out there with better agro, personal choice :D I like 2hs and its the best agro proc I can get on my casual time), just get it when you are proven wrong, dont go berserker  :p <br />
There we go, noone insulted, isnt the world a nice place? Vodka or Ouzo? Beer?</div></div><hr />

Just like the 16/20 DD750 Etheral Destroyer is for warriors (i use one).<br />
<br />
ED+A3 is &quot;decentish&quot; agro mainhanded.<br />
Nothing spectacular, but will produce enough agro to hold attention and do some decent DPS.<br />
Thats with WA5  and CE25 and 305 Dex.<br />
<br />
12/27 DD600 Offhander with no WA no CE and no extra proc wont do much.<br />
It will probably be &quot;enough&quot; but as you progress.<br />
<br />
In the best case DD600 will produce as much agro as a DD/Stun. (300-400ish).<br />
Which leaves us with the ratio. 12/27 for an offhander is a really poor choise.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that ATM this weapon is &quot;Enough&quot; for you.<br />
However when you advance, you will sooner or later be penalised by its ratio.<br />
And while the &quot;1000+ procs&quot; will be fun, they will no longer be sufficient.<br />
<br />
Some people managed to put that with diplomaty, some other... are like Hass :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : A lvl59 holding agro over a lvl65 is absolutely trivially pathetically idiotic.<br />
This is what we saw in Valor (Outer Caves) with my ex GF :<br />
<br />
War 65 + Blade of War (48/32 EB) + 800AA + C Effects 25 + Anger 3 + Extra Clicky Proc + Raex BP<br />
vs<br />
Pal 55 + Spear of Fire (44/35 no Proc)<br />
<br />
And the paladin was pulling agro off me, very very very often.<br />
Its all about the lvl difference, i did 3 times the DPS and had more than 6 EB/Anger per minute.<br />
<br />
So your &quot;I held Agro off a war 59&quot; is totally unvalid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, if you just admit. &quot;hey, I am willing to sacrifice agro for for damage, looks and/or impressive procs.&quot; Just say so. It will save you alot of time.<br />
<br />
The cudgel is much worse agro compared to a copper hammer of striking and not really that much difference in dps depending on your aa choices.<br />
<br />
But you know what? Thats the way it is always going to be for us warriors, the best choice for agro weapon is always going to be sacrificing something to get the agro we need.<br />
<br />
The people here have done a shitload of testing (not me) and have shown that weapons like the spilt blade of destruction, velium gemmed longsword and dedgiebob's fippyforged butplug are not worth it for a warrior. In some situations they may be a small dps increase but that would come from a large agro loss. You don't have to listen, you can go on useing whatever you like, but don't lie/guess to try to make your choice sound better.<br />
<br />
yes, adding anger3 is enough to make almost any weapon decent, but trust me, the more agro you get, the faster the mobs can get slowed, the less wizards have to use agro decreasing spells and the less you will have to recover from wipes. All that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alittle more dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, it is much easier.  It's much easier because there are some days where I just flat our refuse doing other people's work for them.  People shouldn't be coming here asking the same question that's sitting on the top of Page 2.  That's what the search function is for, that's what the library is for, and it's not my goddamned responsibility to hand people information on a silver platter.  If you wanna come in here and make ridiculous claims, then I reserve the right to use whatever medium I see necessary to prove them wrong, until told to do otherwise by people with a different color name than you.<br />
<br />
In your case, and Zynth's case, I went back and dug up my work on this board because it makes you both look like gigantic jackasses.  That pleases me.  You can hate me all you want, but you can't question for a second that I don't know what I'm talking about, and I didn't help figure it out in the first place.<br />
<br />
If you don't like me, that's your perogative, but I wouldn't waste your breath trying to change me.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm so you are saying that level has an effect as well?  Is it the level or the difference in HPs?  Also was the Paladin chain stunning?  (Still learining all the in and outs of aggro, patience is appreciated)</div></div><hr />

This is definitely true.  When my cleric bot was 59 or 60 I would bring him on raids and with the mt swinging, melees engaging, clerics healing etc, some mob would take the time to walk to the back of the raid and beat down my stupid little cleric bot who was doing nothing but standing there minding his own business at least 2 or 3 times a night.  Saw the same thing doing Earth rings Saturday night.  Had level 61ish warrior and SK in my group and they sometimes died without even turning on attack.  Mobs definitely have a strong tendency to attack the lowest level person on the aggro list first.</div></div><hr />

i never claimed i was gods gift to the message board. you're the one that cant seem to make a post with out bring down some one else and calling others a jackass. maybe it seems i am a jackass to you, but i'm simply extending the same gratitude you've shown the rest of the community. <br />
<br />
i will however grant you the final word on this topic as i do not plan on responding to further hostile posts over something as rediculas as judging my self worth on a messageboard.</div></div><hr />
