<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if you guys could help me with some longterm help...  My warrior is currently at lvl 30, but I'm leveling him fast, and I have bought a full compliment of gear for when he gets old enough...  I threw it all into a magelo and what is linked below is what I came up with  (missing my ranged slot because I forget the name...  It's that bow that fell off the skellies during the anniversary event).  I set his age at 46 because that's the level that I am able to equip all my gear at.   While he is currently comming up at 3179 hps and 1080 ac at level 46, he still isn't close to all the level restrictions so he has some room to grow into his gear.<br />
<br />
At lvl 65 with the skills re-adjusted to the post-50 cap he's comming up with:<br />
HP:  4614<br />
AC:  1220<br />
<br />
Str:  233<br />
Sta:  243<br />
Agi:  135<br />
Dex:  128<br />
<br />
I know he currently looks like the most stereo typical warrior on the face of the planet, but what can I say  :p.  Anyway, I was wondering where I should go next from here?  I am planning on doing LDoN's quite a bit to start working toward some anger augs, but I am wondering what gear upgrades I should be looking ahead for...  <br />
<br />
Here's my current situation...  I have a family guild that is starting to get interested in raiding.  We have raided SSra a couple of times (I don't know if we took out the emperor).  We can take Vindi pretty easily, and clear fear and hate on occasion for epic stuff...  Other than that we haven't really tried very hard targets... Mainly because we have no tanks.  Hence where I come in.  Since I had some spare PP to equip a war and was bored with my main, I was kinda picked to roll us an MT.  ATM we have a lvl 60 warr, but his gear is less than mine atm, and he isn't on much.  So as far as farming gear, I bassically have a good strong force behind me, but can only fight things that I myself am tanking...  So that gives ya some perspective on the size of targets I can take down for upgrades...  As far as PP goes, I'm pretty much out.  I can farm a little more if there are cheap upgrades I missed, but I don't really have the ability to start collecting for a BoC or anything...  Maybe when I'm high enough to Duo in BoT with my warrior, but certanly not yet.<br />
<br />
All that crud being said, What do you think are the next most important upgrades for me (and where can I get them at)?  I can easily throw a few groups together if need be, but again, I'm probably the tank (we do, however, have plenty of DPS and a good number of clerics).  What weaps should I be aiming for, and about what level do I need them by?  In general, what pieces might be easy to acquire for me that would be a decent upgrade to some of the stuff I got?<br />
<br />
Sorry for being so long winded, but I'd rather be thurough than vague =).  THanks for the help  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few things that jump out as things you can get with small(2-3 group) raids would be crystaline acid bracers and Vindi BP. I'd also try to get a BoC and Bloodfrezied when your guild gets to that point. A 41% haste item would be nice. Alot of things depend on how your guild does loot and where you stand in that system what items you'd want to try to grab first.<br />
<br />
What you have, for the most part, can hold you over until VT. Just go for big HP/AC upgrades at this point and better agro weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the quick reply!<br />
<br />
What better agro weapons would you suggest?  I know a BoC and a bloodfrenzied would be nice eventually, but what is an immediate upgrade in the meantime that I might be able to work towards?<br />
<br />
Any 41% haste items in particular that might be in my reach?<br />
<br />
As far as loot rules, we'll pretty much be setting up these raids to get me gear, so the roll is not a problem...  The guild is pretty well equiped as a whole... mostly bazaar bought, but high end bazaar folks.  The only thing we are really hurting on thats keeping us from starting our way into PoP assention is a good tank.  We recently got some SK's in the guild who are in their late 50's and they're leveling fast, but in the end they don't make the best raid tanks, so we're trying to get me leveled and geared quickly.  So essentially if we can take it down, I can get the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Any other specifics that might be good to start looking for?  Any spots of mine that are particularly weak, or that need upgrading soon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it all depends on how much pp you're packing.  here's a list of very pricey high-end items that many folks drool after even at 65.<br />
<br />
warlord steel gauntlets<br />
bloody boots of dark rites<br />
steel ring of earthen resilience x2<br />
crystallized acid bracers x2<br />
BoC<br />
Black plated collar<br />
Amygdalan mask<br />
Helm of RZ<br />
Ornate Bp<br />
Ornate Legs<br />
<br />
In all actuality your gear is just fine atm for tanking all the way into VT.  concentrate on leveling to 65 and getting basic tanking aa's.  all the gear in the world still wont make you an efficient tank if you dont have the basic defensive aa's.  also, once you get to 65 grind out your first aa's in EF ldon and save up for an anger3 augment for a weapon on par with GBoS or BoC.  GBoS is a very easy upgrade to make out of BoT towers, and can be killed with 2-3 well oiled groups of moderately geared players (check my magelo for the GBoS).<br />
<br />
as for haste, there are a ton of them out there .. pick whichever fansies you best.  belt of the destroyer from NToV is damn nice and will hold you over for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think your best bet is to get to 65 ASAP.<br />
<br />
If your goal is to tank PoP progression mobs, you will defentely need to be 65.<br />
<br />
After that, try a few hard LDoN, if you can squeek by without the defensive AA's, you will get great exp .. great droped loot .. and great pointed loot.<br />
<br />
Alot of my gear is from Hard LDoN, few raid loot thrown in.<br />
<br />
As for 41 haste .. few warriors in my guild have opted to stay with 36 haste, there thought is that at 36, they hit the haste cap with chanter haste.  I however have the 41 haste from PoI dragon.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 65, off the top of my head could do as a raid:<br />
- BoT tower mobs ** Ornate BP and some nice weapons **not hard after a few tries to get down strat) <br />
- PoI dragon (hate hammer and 41 haste)<br />
- Ring of Slime event in CT (100hp bracer)<br />
- Shade in PoN (drops Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates, 65hp shoulders)<br />
- Mujaki event in PoN (drops Cloak of Daggers, 80hp back) ** 24 max able to do, so nice target**<br />
- Paffa event in CoD (drops 85hp cloak)<br />
- Can do non raid targets (so targets &quot;ubers&quot; can kill1 groups) named in Ferbi with a few groups.<br />
In Groups<br />
- GoD 3rd and 4th sewers (first hit very hard ** unless tweeked with last patch **, second has no loot)<br />
- Kill Bari tarsh, FT2 ring drops(to get casters to help) and nice mellee earring &quot;Rhyolite Tear of Thralldom&quot; drops (on my magelo).<br />
- Hard LDoN as previous mentioned<br />
- Normal LDoN if hards are to hard, or if you want to pharm points fast.<br />
<br />
That is off the top of my head .. But as stated before, you are GTG to lvl 65, so lvl up ... AND HAVE FUN ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WOW, thanks a ton guys...  very good suggestions.  I'm litterally writting them down =).
