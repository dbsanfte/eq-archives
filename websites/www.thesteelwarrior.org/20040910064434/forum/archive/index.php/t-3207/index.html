<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What if warriors got an innate hate modifier? The modifier could take everythign we do that generates hate and multiple it's hate value by 1.5 or something. It makes sense if you think about it. The typical storyboard warrior goes into a fight yelling and cursing at his opponent. This wouldn't be a lock-all game-breaking ability. Overnuking or slowing within the first 5 seconds would still net the caster agro (as long as the modifier is tuned right). It wouldn't give us the snap agro paladins have, but it would make us more desirable in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wonder what that would do with raids with multiple non-MT warriors attacking a target and generating more hate than the defensive MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not use agro weapons? Being as warriors now can control their agro over other warriors on raids, than it would be no problem. All warriors are subject to the same agro modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With a MT in defensive mode, he's doing significantly less damage, thus, taking your &quot;everything we do&quot; wording, a group of warriors would very likely out-aggro a defensive warrior, with or without procing weapons.<br />
<br />
Or, did you mean that warriors should have a modifier only when using proc weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how about an on/off toggle MT mode with a 1.5x mod...<br />
<br />
wait that would be usefull, forget that idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That could work.</div></div><hr />

Sorry this is long. I agree with your rational but not the details.<br />
<br />
The Warlord stands at the head of the army making rude gestures and hurling vile insults at his chief opponent. Soon they rush across the battlefield at each other.<br />
<br />
Sounds like pressing the Taunt button to create ranged aggro to me.<br />
<br />
As their blades cross our hero says, &quot;Ah then, have ye come for a lesson in swordplay? The tuition is quite high. There! A drop of your arm's blood. You fight like a farmer. Another lesson?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds like pressing the Taunt button to build aggro.<br />
<br />
Modifying the Taunt button to have a much higher chance of success of placing you at the top of the aggro list +1 if you aren't at the top of the list and to add a fixed amount of hate if you are would accomplish a lot. IMO it should not just operate at melee distance, but at just over the mobs aggro radius.<br />
<br />
Recoiling from the pain of a magical attack, the clansman attempts to disengage and dispatch his new tormentor.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Your daughter will make a fine pig girl!&quot; The clansman's face flushes purple. Ignoring all danger he furiously re-doubles his attack.<br />
<br />
Sounds like snap aggro to me. A lot like AE Taunt, but single target and working at just over the mobs aggro radius. A moderate refresh would work. A new discipline? Deadly Insult?<br />
<br />
I think Warrior taunt can be more powerful than talking smack to a mob that usually doesn't hear you while still not going beyond what a Warrior should be able to do and into caster-type aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ugh. The modifier wouldn't effect a defensive MT's agro over other warriors agro any more than it does now. If you take the MT's agro, multiply it by 1.5, and you take the non-MT's agro and multiply it by 1.5, the non-MT's should still be below him on the hate list just as if they were controlling their agro without a modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think this is a very good Idea.  As far as during raid/big encoutners, the hate modifier could double(to offset doing half damage) When defensive.  This could solve teh problem for us if the refresh time on the taunt button was also halved......specifically for when it fails and we need to mash it again to keep the casters up.<br />
<br />
The combination of these two things could make warriors wanted again...not just needed for big fights.</div></div><hr />
