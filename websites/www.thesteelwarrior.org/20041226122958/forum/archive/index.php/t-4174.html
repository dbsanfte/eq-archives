<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Extracting this from the thread incase people don't want to drudge right through it. As stated in the quote, this is my totally unofficial take on what we're seeking from this protest. If the organisers wish to modify or add to this then please do so, and anyone else with a point they think has been missed please chime in.<br />
<br />
I've kinda got sucked into this and am by no means a leader in this endeavour however I also have a big mouth so here's my recommendations :p. <br />
<br />
This is less of a demand for specific items so much as a protest against the crappy way in which we the customers have been treated. We should not be 'blackmailing' people and therefore we cannot issue demands but only requests. <br />
<br />
think Gandhi :p <br />
<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
<br />
Things we're specifically seeking.<br />
<br />
A clear, detailed statement of how SoE has been pursuing the melee balance and specific warrior issues up until this point. <br />
<br />
A statement as to what paths SoE are currently pursuing to return things to balance and a solid time frame in which we can expect these issues to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Regular updates would be desireable if there are setbacks, and information for we the customers to grumble and scream about on the boards (since in amongst the chaff they might find a few gems).<br />
<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As to the event organisation, i'd suggest people set up channels when they log on to their server this week titled... <br />
<br />
standdownservername <br />
<br />
...with the servername being the first word of the server i.e The Rathe would have standdownrathe, Kane bayle would have Standdownkane etc etc. <br />
<br />
Alternatively and if the channels are compromised look for names of people from your server in this thread *quoters edit - http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4109  * or on your server board and contact them about setting up an alternate channel. <br />
<br />
Keep that channel up this week so that you get an idea how many people will be attending, when they will be online &amp; wether you wish to recruit others - etc etc. <br />
<br />
If you want to join the serverwide channel go ahead although I would assume it's only required on the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
As far as the physical reality of the protest i would suggest making yourselves 'inconvenient' enough to be noticed without ruining other peoples gaming experience.<br />
<br />
As an example, If you're blocking the zone let people pass after asking them to /shout All hail to the Coffeemakers! or some similar silly line which advertises the protests' presence and politely asking them, if they have a spare moment, to send a feedback asking SoE to get melee sorted ASAP. <br />
<br />
If you're going to /AFK try to arrange with the others in your channel so that the zone isn't accidentally blocked.<br />
<br />
/Feedbacking in a block at particular times of the day (as hopefully organised in the serverwide channel) is a better idea than /petitioning, it inconveniences the volunteer guides (your fellow players) and those with a legitimate need for customer service - We all know exactly how hard it is to get that even on a good day ;) <br />
<br />
If you want to shout stuff to the zone or perform other forms of wackiness go for it, but I suggest deciding as a server group what's appropriate :D. <br />
<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, part of the point of this protest is to raise awareness with people who don't frequent the boards or concern themselves with balance issues exactly how upset we are with the way SoE has treated us as a block of paying customers. <br />
<br />
Alienating fellow players is counterproductive to our goals.<br />
<br />
*Edit* Because i suddenly forgot how to use the bold command :p <br />
<br />

**Edit** Because this time I forgot to use the bold command :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone mentioned /bugging as another medium to make a fuss in....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those people who want to know what the issues and solutions warriors are hoping to achieve, here you go. Although, if you were really curious, you can read every thread on outhouse and war room, and a couple in other places too. I'm sure you'll find them mentioned several thousand times. But in any case, here you go, reposted from the main thread:<br />
<br />
<br />
Agro: <br />
- Agro. Fix it, warrior agro is redundant. The most popular ideas regarding fixing agro were:<br />
1) Furor's Taunt/DoT idea: starts at level 20, scales in power. Level 65: 350hate/tick, 150 damage/tick. Duration: 2 minutes. Reuse: 24 seconds. Can be used at range, but he mentioned the range to which it works is limited. Multiple taunt/dots can stack on one mob (raid encounter utility). <br />
2) Innate EB proc. 700 hate instantly, usable at range, re-use time of about 20-30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Having both ideas implemented also suggested.<br />
<br />
HP edge:<br />
- The HP gap between knights and warriors has become WAY too narrow, especially since Plane of Time Knightmization, paladin buffs, and LDoN augs. Most popular fixes:<br />
1) Innate 5-10% Natural Durability for warriors.<br />
2) Stamina post-255 should work as it did prior to 255, giving warriors 7hp/tick as it should be (since 51-60 was 6hp/tick). <br />
<br />
Implementation of both also suggested <br />
<br />
Damage Mitigation:<br />
- See above in terms of HP gap. See the log parse for Rallos Zek if you are unconvinced. Most popular suggestions:<br />
1) Innate 10% mitigation boost for warriors. That means 10% off DI AND DB. Suggestion to limit this fix to just DI also made<br />
2) Remove /disc defensive altogether, 20-25% Innate mitigation boost (off both DI and DB).<br />
<br />
General Fixes (this area affects ALL pure melees, not just warriors):<br />
- While casters/hybrids received massive benefits between levels 61-65, pure melees received nothing at all. Aside from that, pure melees have been suffering at the hands of game designers since SoL. Suggestions:<br />
1) Skill caps increase: 5-10 points/level all around (offensive, weapon skills, defensive skills) for pure melees only. <br />
2) Stat caps increase (since casters can get up to 355 wiz/int, smilar increases proposed to melee-based stats; Str/Dex/Agi/Sta)<br />
3) Unlinking the timers between discs. Especially between offensive and defensive based disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/bugging goes straight to the developers. So yes a lot of bug reports on that day would be great. /feedback goes into a monthly report that the gm's for a server produce so that is not a great way to get a point across.<br />
<br />
/petition will only serve to annoy the guides and if warriors were to do it enmass they could be given verbal warnings for abusing the petition system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like 1 feedback and /Bug's the way to go then...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*bump* has now been linked to the source post in Call to Arms thread so can be considered 'official'. Please refer to that first post for further information on the Standdown.<br />
<br />
**2nd Edit** At this time only those things listed above this post are considered 'official' also note that where this thread and the Call to Arms defining post differ the Call to Arms takes precedence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am sure they are more than aware of how unbalanced eq is.  In fact i would be willing to bet they dont give a fuck unless it makes them money.  Look at full gear server transfers, a solid gimick to make money while fucking the population.  After 4 years of doing nothing its pretty solid to say your best way to petition would be to /sit /camp click on your warrior click on delete click on yes and make a new character.  Or just cancel eq because chances are bitching is just wasting your breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">id say a fix to agro sums it up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not a general discussion post Aspit, look around, there's plenty of other threads in which you can state your opinion or else you can even start your own thread(!) No further opinion or rebuttal of opinion posts unless they relate specifically to the organisation of the Stand down please.<br />
<br />
*Edit* And you Gerick :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Further info, Blocking the stone and the zone in point is causing difficulties with the guides etc. and standing as a mob looks a little disorganised. I'd like to recommend people set themselves up in ranks so that a clear corridor is provided to the PoT stone through which anyone using it needs to walk, the impact would probably be favourable without causing a disruption the guides feel a need to punish - <br />
<br />
This idea was first put forward with a neat little graphic by Timrum here..http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=58797#post58797<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyrfalcon</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, everyone remember to eat and drink your cheap stuff, and not your expensive stat food and drink, unless you have money to afford it. If the space around the PoT stone becomes too crowded. I might suggest that we line up around the wall of the courtyard as well.</div></div><hr />

I cancelled all my accounts yesterday (even gave my 65 cleric away for a friend to bot), but I'll reactivate the warrior, if only just for this.</div></div><hr />
