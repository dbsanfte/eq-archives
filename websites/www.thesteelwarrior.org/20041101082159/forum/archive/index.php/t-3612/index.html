<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>battlefrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 52 druid main, and have managed to save up 20k to have a play as a warrior.<br />
You can guess my race by the name.<br />
I'm not looking to start a debate here with regards to twinking, as there's a plethora of opinions out there.<br />
Reason I'm posting is that I don't have the first idea regarding warriors and they're equipment. I have 20k to spend and want to know what's the best thing to spend it on?<br />
<br />
I'm currently in the Venril Sathir server.<br />
<br />
Your's hopefully (and expecting the flames)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My advice to you is go to the bazaar and use the /bazaar command and sort items by warrior-&gt;your race-&gt;hitpoints add pp limits like for instance minimum 300pp maximum 3000pp so you don't get too many results, you can alter these limits as you like. Now choose the pieces that have good hitpoints and AC, and stamina too if possible. Save a portion of your money for a couple of weapons that have low delay and are affordable. I'm sorry I can't give you a more detailed advice as I have no recent experience buying newbie stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Monglok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Outfiited myself for around a total of 20K if I remember right, been pieced together by selling spider silks (yeah, 20K is A LOT of spider silks, I know) but that should give you an idea of what I did, doesn't meant thats the way you should go.<br />
I'm from Sullon Zek, not sure what pricing looks like on you server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">invest and get more pp then invest again keep investing then win the bazaar and buy top notch stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>battlefrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for advice all.<br />
I do have experience of how to use and play the 'bazaar' game.<br />
<br />
I know that prices fulctuate greatly depending on the demand, availability of items etc.<br />
<br />
The advice i'm after, is what to look out for. I know there's a lot of experienced players use this board and would like (if they are prepared to ) to tap into their knowledge and experience. What would you have bought at level 10 with 20k to spare?<br />
<br />
As far as weapons go I think I'm sorted. I'm forgetting 1hb and 2hb. I've gone for a lammy blade another (can't remeber the name for the life of me, but its a 9/19 and costs about 1k).<br />
<br />
Hope you can help, and make me a better meat-shield! :)<br />
