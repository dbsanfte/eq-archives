<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone could suggest some wearable items with sight.<br />
Must be non nodrop and hopfully cheap unless there is some way a 51 warrior can get the item solo or small group.<br />
I am still using a greater lightstone which I hate because it takes up a slot.<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

is a decent item if dragons like you, the only hard part for you would be the guy in DN which is left of the stairs leading down. SO it may be beyond you at this time as far as dropable vision items can't think of one off the top of my head (memory is bad due ti having to keep all them stun spells in my head)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Glowing stone band is pretty cheap, I think it has infravision effect for all your see in the dark needs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still have a glowing stone band in the bank.  Dont use it much anymore since I always group with a shaman, but it's easy to get.  Got mine around lvl 30-35. Drops from a goblin in Sol A.  Can't remember which one, but he spawns in the room adjacent to Lynada the Exiled.  Cobalt helm has ultravision I believe, and is good AC-wise, stats kinda suck though.  Still, you could put it on when you need the vision, and swap it for something better when you don't. (It's probably gonna cost a little more than the infravsion ring though)   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Glowing stone  band, or if you can afford it, Cobalt Helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Perhaps, when you've gained some levels, you could get a couple of groups together and kill Lord Bob in VL.  (the mob with the insanely hard to spell name)  One of his drops is a ring of frozen flame.  It has ac, sta and hp, and infravision.  It'd be a decent ring to wear with vision enhancement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cobalt helm is 25 AC and gives infravision. Definately better than nothing until I wasn't paying attention and gave it to Lt. Miluven (sp?) while turning in giant warrior helms in Skyshrine and he ate it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had the band but it kinda sucked.<br />
Light was not as good as stone and I have better rings.<br />
Helm might be good.<br />
I will have to check prices.<br />

Thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, the band doesnt give off any light at all, just makes it so you dont really need light anymore.  I always preferred having infravision to a lightstone, because you could see more distant objects with it.  But you will have to sacrifice the stats on your other ring when you use the glowing stone band.  Just bump up your gamma a bit and vision wont matter unless you're underground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When you log on, ask a Mage for a light.  If they hand you a Bud Light, be more specific.</div></div><hr />

Merkell, I just want to clarify something for you: Infra/Ultravision and light sources (e.g.: lightstones) do different things.<br />
<br />
Infravision makes it so a night-blind race (human, barbarian, erudite) can see in the dark; murkily, but they can see, especially at a distance. Infravision sometimes tints everything a brownish-red in the absence of light. This is what you experienced with the glowing band, and it is what you will get with the Cobalt Helm as well. Don't buy a cobalt helm if you don't like the way you see with the glowing band.<br />
<br />
Ultravision is better, but it tends to make everything you see bluish, and it is not a light source. Still, a great improvement over infra and literally like night and day over night blindness. There is a kind of ultravision known as truevision; this is simply ultravision with added perks, like seeing invisible.<br />
<br />
Light sources, like greater lightstones, actually illuminate the area around your character with &quot;natural light.&quot; They do not illumniate much of anything over distance, so night blind races remain night blind when they try to see past 50 feet or so.<br />
<br />
The only way to get the &quot;full effect&quot; is to have both an infra/ultra item for distance, and a light source for close-up natural light conditions. I'm not sure which items that warriors can use also act as light sources, but I know several shields that do (shiny brass shield, charred guardian shield, others). I believe Allakhazam's sometimes lists if an item is a light source.</div></div><hr />
