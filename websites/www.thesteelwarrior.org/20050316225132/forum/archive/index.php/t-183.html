<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need 3 specifik groups.<br />
<br />
Group 1.<br />
best warrior, best cleric, best shaman, best chanter, best druid and one other.<br />
This group will engage the named in each round and tank it untill all other spawns are killed.<br />
<br />
Group 2.<br />
Good knight, good ranger, cleric, a haster and the rest does not matter.<br />
This group will be guarding the Thurgadin entrance, so all needs to be non-kos. The knights can use spells to draw agro from runners and the ranger will snare to slow the runners down.<br />
<br />
Group 3.<br />
Healer, buffer and so on, which should be located at the KOS camp (normally the big stone to the right when coming from thurgadin and passing the guard towers).<br />
People should run to this group and send tells for rebuffs and so on.<br />
People has to get someone in their own group to drag them to the camp for rezz, if they die.<br />
<br />
You also need 2-3 players as lookout over the spawnpoints.<br />
These lookouts should not move if pops occur in other spots than the ones they have designated.<br />
<br />
If you have alot of players and they got plenty of DPS, then place a group at the east camp too, so you can encounter the giants there faster, just make sure they got a healer and slower there too. :)<br />
<br />
Finally you need a non-kos player at the thurgadin entrance that spam the line that makes the dwarf gather around him. This player can be a level 1 without any problems as long as he is non-kos. :)<br />
<br />
The rest of your force will be moving around from pop to pop.<br />
make sure that only ONE player call movements and charge on the named in each round!! If the named goes down before the others, then you will lose rebuff time and you will be needing more dps then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One last note!!!!<br />
<br />
If people get agro then they do NOT try to zone into Thurgadin to wipe agro!!!<br />
It will move a giant very close to Thurgadin and maybe end it all!!</div></div><hr />

Basically.. at least on drinal.... the 10th war event is busted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the more the merrier i say. The last successful ring war i participated in had about 60 people average level 58 though it can be done with less. <br />
<br />
There are a couple of different strategies but the one that worked for us was to have 1-2 groups defending the entrance to thurg. This was also the battle/rez buffing group.<br />
<br />
The rest of the raid force was split into 3. One out in front of thurg, the other to the east and west.<br />
<br />
Treat each group like a mini raid force and make sure that they have a competent leader as it is too hard for one person to co-ordinate all three when you have multiple waves. <br />
<br />
Snares and kiters are worth their weight in gold as they can keep mobs occupied whilst others are finished off. Also, have each front force designate someone to watch for runners - who will head straight to thurg. These have to be engaged asap.<br />
<br />
Also, assign a bard for corpse pulling duties to bring corpses back to the rez/buff group - just makes things faster.<br />
<br />
When waves pop, kill all the crappy giants first and save the nameds to the last (the nameds are the captains and generals i think).<br />
<br />
Also, befor estarting, make sure you have a simple strat for how to deal with narandi. With sufficient numbers you can just zerg him, but if you don't, people need to know what they have to do. otherwise you can kill all the waves and wipe on him and that will suck. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild &amp; friends keep doing this with less numbers, though that's not how we plan it...  last time we did it, we had like 21 people for the 3rd wave.  However, you definitely feel more comfortable with 40'ish.<br />
<br />
Our strat was always have every grab a giant, everyone moves with the raid and responds to pops.  So, a wave spawns in the east, we run from our 'camp' near the rocks on the river east and engage.  The MT + his cleric grab control of the named if there is one, everyone else grabs another giant...even if only to hold it aggro until it's slowed.  We have bards/rangers/druids on runners (bards are AMAZING for this).  So long as you control runners and have all the giants stopped near where they spawn, you can do it with less numbers since everyone can focus in the same area.  Saving the boss for last, since there are some that believe the wave spawn timers are somehow tied to them. <br />
<br />
If you get a stacked spawn (another wave spawns in the middle of one you're working on)...our strategy has been for everyone to move to the new spawn after they finish their current giant...leaving the leftover giants of the last spawn to whoever is holding them.<br />
<br />
So far, Thurg hasn't fallen...though we had some real close encounters on one nasty early doublespawn.  Oi...<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the hardest parts from the ones I have seen is trying to keep the groups together in all the chaos. Its real easy for the healers to get seperated from their melees as the waves get kind of spread out with folks chasing down straggling giants.<br />
<br />
Last one I did I didnt think we had enough but things all went pretty well through the whole fight. Then when Narandi popped, half the folks rushed down to him before the rest knew what was going on and from then on it became chaos. Bout half the raid got wiped, many of us numerous times. But Eventually I ended up Kiting narandi around after running back from dying, looting half my gear and getting him mad at me. As I ran him around in big circles, getting summoned back the clerics ran around clicking corpses. Once I finally died someone else took over till we had enough ressed and an MT buffed and ready, I was amazed we managed to pull that one off at the end. I think the Narandi fight itself went on for like 30 minutes :)</div></div><hr />
