I just finished equipping my wife. We got lucky on some drops in the first week of OoW, so everything she is wearing we paid like 250k for total. I figured since she is tanking we should focus on her equipment. I know at 56 she is only getting a certain fraction on some of the pieces so it should be a bit better later on.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are about to start doing LDoN's so I think basically we will be focusing on the Augments for her. With what she has should I go for.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) 10sta augment, 357 AP<br />
2) 10ac augment, 510AP<br />
3) 40hp augment, 1150 AP.<br />
<br />
She has like 17 slot type 7's open so it will be a long time filling. I know the AC and HP ones go in different slots so I was just wondering in general based on her equip.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.<br />

PS Plan on getting fiercely hooked claw, warclasp ring, steel ring of earthen resill, and duskwalkers sash, blue flame necklacke eventually... other than that any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stamina augments = Worthless<br />
HP augs = Overpriced<br />
<br />
And that leaves the only reasonable choice.</div></div><hr />

STA is easily maxed in any normal exp group.  You can either:<br />
<br />
A) Have a shaman cast STA on you and it should more than max it if it already isn't<br />
B) Have a Beastlord cast STA<br />
C) Get some Kizrak's Greaves and click them for some STA<br />
<br />
Next, if you use the commonly accepted formula for the tradeoff between AC/HP you get 1AC = 6HP.  So get a lot more bang for your buck if you get the AC augments, simply because 10AC is about equal to 60HP, or slightly less plus you're paying less than half of what the HP one costs.<br />
<br />
If you really want some HP augs just get some Kyanite from OoW zones and have a JCM3 crafter shine them up for you.   They turn into 45HP augs and they can be put in three different slots, leaving the rest for AC.</div></div><hr />

So then the question is, 5ac for 150 ap, or 10ac for 510.... hrm. Depends on what else she's saving for I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would get the 10ac augs for all slots it fits, and just skip the 40hp augs. There are alot of other hp augs out there since OoW was released.<br />
<br />
There's a nice 20hp aug that drops off the undead named in Natimbi. However, it's a fairly rare drop and I wouldn't know if it's worth spending time on. Still, the aug is not lore, and fits in alot of slots.<br />

(I can solo it now, and usually do when lfg, but not sure if you'd want to spend time there)</div></div><hr />
