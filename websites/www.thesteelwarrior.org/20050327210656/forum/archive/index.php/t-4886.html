<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My little guild is looking at trying north ToV for the first time.  Yeah yeah, save the comments on it being ancient content newb stuff, blah blah.  :)  I don't think anyone in my guild has ever once done it before.  So we're going to be completely lost as far as tactics for that area go.  <br />
<br />
I have an excellent ToV map off eqmaps.com.  We'll take a bard for high resists.  I'm assuming right now that we'll want to keep a mage as non-kos to SS so that we can CotH past the many entrance mobs and go straight to north ToV.  That means at least one mage can't participate in the kills.  Is there any other way to do this?  <br />
<br />
I'm also concerned about CRs.  I suspect once we're a ways back in the KoS part of ToV, we'll be looking at coffins if we wipe.  I'm also wondering what is done if a puller dies in aggro range of multiple mobs since dragging a corpse means aggro.  Do you end up having to summon your pullers' corpses sometimes too?  <br />
<br />
Any general advice on starting north ToV tactics or links to strat guides about it would be much appreciated, too.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Rogues can drag corpses without issue.<br />
<br />
Flurry drakes put out a lot of DPS... don't get caught by surprise with them or you'll wipe :)  They are the ones with capital letters in the name.<br />
<br />
NToV is a lot of fun (at first.. it gets old like everything else after you do it enough) and a source of a lot of upgrades because there are so many named in close proximity to each other.  <br />
<br />
You'll also get to experience a lot of new things as far as mob abilities... ae mana drains, knockbacks, huge stuns, etc...  It is a blast learning the tactics to defeat the big lizards.  In my opinion, NToV is the first real &quot;raid guild&quot; zone where you learn the things you need to do to be able to raid throughout EQ.  Good luck, and have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about keeping a mage non-kos?  Should we plan on doing that?  We have a volunteer for it, but it's his main character and the only account he plays as far as I know, so I hate to ask him to sit out of the fighting.  That's pretty boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zigglewort</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having a non-KOS mage will save you a lot of grief.  Yes, it is boring, but if the person is willing to sit there and only buff between combats, the benefit to your raid is immense.  You might want to all chip in and buy him a new paperback every raid or two :) <br />
<br />
I found NToV to be a lot of fun, enjoy your time there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">coh mage can add plenty of dmg for the named, just needs to make sure he quits out before the mob dies. pullers should also stay with the mage for coh when fd fails or they just took too much dmg on the pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its best to keep your non-KoS mage around, and non KOS like others have said.  I don't know about how viable /q'ing out is before each mob dies.  I guess it depends on how fast they reset.  I like the paper back thing though =)<br />
<br />
For the rest of NToV, just get your raid force with decent resists, level 60+ and a half way decent tank (6500 raid buffed hp, some kind of avoidance AA, 65 a major +, etc) and most of it should be pretty easy.<br />
<br />
For your basic raider, I'd say min level 55, resists over 100 for FR/CR/MR.  At 65, most of my guild stopped wearing resist gear on NToV raids.  The AEs are kind of a joke then.  I think 4-5 groups should be able to rock through there.<br />
<br />
And there is a ton of info out there on how to pull and hide from the mobs AEs as well.<br />
<br />
Flurry drakes rock!  Such an adrenaline rush the first time you fight one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a good guide written and accidently lost it. :-/<br />
<br />
Get a map of NToV, I'm running off memory, but it should be fairly good.<br />
<br />
Ok, your NoN KoS Mage can run into NToV, up to the corner right before Aaryonar. The hatchlings are Non KoS, the bigger wyvern guards are, Ikitar and Eashen are. Might use an SoS rogue to scout out and help the mage get there.<br />
<br />
CoH your non-kos, get a decent force there, then get your KoS in and kill the hatchlings. At this point, for a new guild, I'd recommend pulling Eashen and Ikitar. You got a good corner if you can kill em faster then hatchling respawn right there, and should build confidence.<br />
<br />
TIME THE HATCHLING REPSAWN. I think it's 27 miniutes, but have someone knowing when it will happen again.<br />
<br />
Then do an about face, put the clerics on the stiars leading to Eashen/Iki, kill the hatchlings, kill roy's guards, kill the hatchlings, kill Roy. (Roy is Aaryonar). Positioning is important, you need Roy to never AE your casters.<br />
<br />
Oh, minor point- At one point, maybe still, Roy's AE was a bit buggy. The client would think it went through walls, the server would not. That meant casters could get hit by it (on the client) and lose all their mana. Get your casters cheap insta clicks (Kromzek survery scopes, telescopes, etc) if they don't have. Clicking one of those forces the client to update with the server, and will get your mana back, but ONLY if the &quot;buggy&quot; AE hit them, not the real one.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense? Here it is simple. Casters get insta click. If you get hit by AE and lose all your mana, click it. You might get mana back.<br />
<br />
Ok, again on Roy, I dunno how Pacification, etc, will change this, but when we did it, it was very hard to get Roy w/o his guards, or get his guards w/o Roy. There are two Wyverns near the bottom of his steps, with an hour repop, easy to get w/o Roy. There are two more up near Roy, with a 3 day? repop. Try to get them single. If you get Roy as an add, I highly recommend putting a tank on Roy, and concentrate on the named Wyvern(s). Once you kill the two of them, you can recover from the wipe and get Roy single, and that's a lot easier, IMO. Your Mileage May Vary.<br />
<br />
Kill Roy, drop down the back steps, and end up in a safe &quot;pit&quot;. This is an excellent spot to camp if it's now too late for your raid. You are just about to start the easy part of NToV.<br />
<br />
Either now or the next day, start by clearing to the right. You are looking for Lord Feshlak, he's perma rooted. Again, watch for Flurry Drakes, a Green Flurry drake is, IMO, the most likely thing to wipe your raid ATM, including the named fights.<br />
<br />
Once you clear to Feshlak, you should be able to use Incite to build godly amounts of aggro before you engage. Casters can hide from his AE on a ledge to the right.<br />
<br />
Next you clear to and pull Dargarn. We usually put him where the casters were on Feshlak, and put the casters where Feshlak was.<br />
<br />
Continue clearing right, for another rooted named, Lord Kriezlak, or Special K. He has ice leading up to him, watch the slip and slide. Casters, IIRC, just stay up the ramp a bit to advoid AE.<br />
<br />
Continue to the right, you should be moving around the circle and heading North, then West at this point. Get to a 4way. To your left (South) is Vulak Trigger. Stay out. Ahead (west) of your is Lady M (Rooted) and Lord Koi (Not). To the right (North) is the Old PoM zone. Dunno if still there, don't play with any little wierd looking things. Pull Koi's guards, and Koi. Pin Koi near a 4 way corner, with casters around the bend- I usually put my casters in the North Tunnel, and Koi in the West.<br />
<br />
Move up to Lady M, she is in a little cubby. Really obvious place to put the casters, and important, she silences.<br />
<br />
Back to 4 way to move North, turn right, keep going straight. Your target now is Jorlegg. Pull him to a corner, finish him.<br />
<br />
This ends the Easy Section of NToV, really. For a new raid, this has been a long day, you can camp in Lady N's room up ahead, if you move into a little cubby on the right, out of sight of Lady N. You'll see what I mean, it's right where Jorl spawns. There are other safe spots, some might be better, this is just what I used to use.<br />
<br />
Next day, or same day if you are really motivated and moving along at a good pace, I'd recommend going for the Triplets. These are Cekenar, Zlexinak, and... uhm.... Sevalak? Check the AE's, these are not an easy pull, etc. Hopefully your Morale is high from the previous section of the raid. You should get at least one of the Triplets, even first time, but I forgot which is the easy one. :-)<br />
<br />
Can also try Lady N. Rooted, does a long spinstun. Annoying Fight. Remember, this is the hard part of NToV, don't be discouraged if you don't win first time. You already are more powerfull as a guild, can always come back next week and do the rest again. For Lady N, the safe spot I mentioned earlier is a GREAT place to camp a pally or necro or something for CR.<br />
<br />
The other one I left out is Lord Vyemm. IMO, Lord Vyemm and Lady N are the two toughest fights in the normal NToV clear. Vyemm does a wierd knockback that will have your careening off walls. DON'T let him face the lava, or that's were half your raid will be.<br />
<br />
What else? Melee Range to cast spells. Watch out for Flurry (AKA, Rape) Drakes. Don't get frustated on Roy and give up, the Feshlak to Jorll segment is easy. It's almost like they said &quot;Well, we can't put 7 dragons worth of loot on Roy, but we can put 7 easy dragons after Roy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't get discouraged when you wipe. How you handle wipes will detirmine if you are NToV material or not. When you wipe, the first question that comes to your mind should not be &quot;Who went wrong?&quot; but &quot;What went wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
AE got the casters? Find a new place to put them or the mob. AE Ate the melee? Find some way to better their resists, or heal the AE damage. MA died? Find him some more HP, or AC, or tighten up the cheal chain. Clerics Ran OOM? Find em some Mana Preservation, or more clerics, or more FT gear, or Up your DPS so the fight doesn't last as long. Got adds during pull? Find a way to control them, off tanking, kiting, killing the add, eating the wipe, recovering and trying again with the add dead, whatever.<br />
<br />
If you can do that, and can, as a guild, not mind eating the deaths to learn that sort of stuff, there is nothing in EQ that can stop you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great information, thanks!  :)  CyrzB, your rundown of north tov makes it sound easier then I'm sure it is for first timers, but it's really good info.  I plan to lead the raid but I'll direct officers and any others interested from my guild to come here and read thru this thread.  Couple of questions...<br />
<br />
Are the flurry drakes slowable?  Are the named slowable?  And what spawn time are roamers, including flurries I assume, on?  Hatchlings are mentioned with a guess at the spawn time, but I assume those are just mobs up before Roy.  What about further in?  I could see if we killed roamers too slowly and they have 30 min spawn time or something, there might be problems getting to named with enough time to take them out before more roamers show up.<br />
<br />
edit: just checked loot for Ini, Eashen, and Roy and I'm a little puzzled.  By all accounts Roy is by far the toughest fight, but it looks to me like Eashen's loot is better.  And Ini and Eashen don't appear to be much different, but E's loot is way better than Ini's.  Weird.  The only difficulty with Eashen appears to be solo pulling him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lots of the drops in ntov arent entierly balanced in relation to the difficulty of the mob that drops them, but that's ok ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zigglewort</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aaryonar is also the guardian of the gate to the rest of NToV, once you take him down, the rest of NToV is available to you.  So by killing him, the real loot you get is an open passageway.  Depending on when you do NToV, you will want to make this a two day outting.  Just getting down the CoH chain, taking down Aaryonar and then one or two of the near dragon can easily take one night the first time or two you do this.  Then plan on coming back the next night and work on the remaining dragons as Aaryonar will not be back up so the CoH and clearing to whichever is the next available named dragon will go much quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't want to ask a mage to stay out of the fighting, hire a mage to do the summons.<br />
<br />
When in NToV, and moving to Aary's hallway, STAY AWAY FROM ALL WALLS.  The rooms are full of wyvrens and will aggro through the walls.  LAME but true.<br />
<br />
Pull Eashen's guards first, then finally Eashen.  Eashen has a few drops that will remind your tanks why you are there :-D *cough*twistedsteelbastardsword*cough*<br />
<br />
Aary is one tough sumbitch.  If you can take him down, you have the tonnage to take down most of the rest of NToV. We pull him from his cubby, all the way down the hall, to the point where he is close enough to the ramp to allow the clerics to CH the tanks, but not so far that he can AE the clerics, who are standing on the ramp.  If he AEs the clerics once, you wipe.  Pin him to the wall, and keep him there.<br />
<br />
Most of your problems won't be beating this mob or that, it will be effective pulling.  It's easy to pull Eashen, for example, if you don't mind getting his guards at the same time :-/  Be nice to your monks, they're going to have a hard day.<br />
<br />
And that's why permarooted mobs are meat.  You pull all their guards and dispatch them.  Then your shammy and chanter walk up and debuff them into goo, then you keeeel them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">-Aaryonar, or &quot;Roy&quot;, runs much  more slowly than his guards.  He's a pretty easily split for a monk.  Roy is a long fight because of his massive ATK drain, which also btw overwrites Avatar.  You do *NOT* want your casters, especially clerics, to be hit by this.  They get hit and you're wiped.<br />
<br />
Btw, you have to kill Roy.  If you train him to the side and bypass him, he will assist the other dragons.  You must kill him, but his loot is nice.<br />
<br />
-Flurry drakes are slowable, but ho-lee shiat their unslowed dps is absolutely amazing.  They flurry every round for 700's.<br />
<br />
-Knight tank anything green.  Green drakes proc slows, which is almost impossible for a warrior to hold agro.<br />
<br />
-Every dragon is slowable except for Kriezenn, Dagarn, Ikiatar, and Eeshan, I think.  Vyemm is only disease slowable.<br />
<br />
-Have FUN!  And I mean that.  NToV is one of the most enjoyable raid zones in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In response to your questions.... All non-named a slowable. Someone else posted in another reply the list that is non-slowable, the only change I can recall off the top of my head, I don't THINK Lady N was Slowable, and I could be wrong. Check Shaman Crucible on that.... Actually, lemme check RQ. (I used to know all these cold, but I haven't been in NToV for over a year, so double checking.)<br />
<br />
The link I'm using is http://www.interealms.com/shaman/guides/slowing.html<br />
And I've never found major fault with this<br />
<br />
Unslowable- Ikitar, Eashen, and Kreizen... I must have been wrong about Lady N, maybe I was thinking Kreizen at the time. Notice according to the web page, Yendilor is also unslowable, however, he is NOT NToV, he is actually WToV. I consider this a minor fault. :-)<br />
<br />
DR Slowable  (Plague of Insects, Cloud of Grummus) - Vyemm. Note that according to this page, Vyemm CAN be MR slowed, but it's VERY, VERY, VERY hard. To me, that means DR slow him, then if your shaman/chanters don't mind dieing, go ahead and try to MR slow him, but really, don't count on it.<br />
<br />
Also, remember, my guide is based on what I did. You may find it better, for example, to go left after Roy and skip Lord Vyemm, hit Lord Koi first, then Lady M. (If you got a map, you'd see what I mean, that part is a circle.)<br />
<br />
Also, when I first started doing NToV, it was a 3 day event. That was back before 65 was the cap, heck it was right about the time AA's were introduced, so you may be able to make it 2 days or less, even as a new guild. But I seriously recommend you do Roy, then the ones I marked as easy, then finish with Vyemm, Lady N, and the Triplets.<br />
<br />
On a humorous note... Doing this zone will mean you get the joking nature of the quote I sometimes see... &quot;All any real warrior needs for buffs is Rez Effects and Slime Mist&quot;. :-)<br />
<br />
Check me out on cazic.Cyrz if you have any other questions and I'm online. Chances are my responses will be slow, I'm often LDoNing or Raiding when I'm online, and always in at least 3 tells, but I will try to help.</div></div><hr />

I was supposed to lead our first crack at ntov last night, but on seeing who actually came for the raid, I had to call it.  We didn't have the numbers or the right classes. sigh... we could have easily done HoT or something, but I don't really want to give people more SS armor that they'll want to raise/keep their CoV faction to turn in... :p  We'll reschedule in a few days and hopefully get people to turn out for it.

Rez box your clerics.  It will make for the most speedy recovery as long as they don't get killed by a roamer.  <br />
<br />
This got nerfed a while back (about the time PoP came out I think).  It still works but you have a LOT less time to accept a rez.  I think timer is five minutes now but not sure.  That usually isn't enough time for everyone to die and the area to clear enough for cleric to get back in.  <br />
<br />
NToV is fun.  Hard at first but when you finally win it feels great.  Would love to do it again.  Lot of good memories there.  Enjoy! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to keep your CoH mage around for long, let him fight. He only has to be non-KoS so if his faction drops too low, make sure to hit Kael for a couple of hours before the next time you go in. This will save his sanity, otherwise, you may end up looking for a new CoH mage after the forst couple of runs.<br />
<br />
Also, it is beneficial to keep at least 1 puller non-KoS. You can pull Eashen and Ikky to the zone in pretty easily if your puller is not KoS. This makes it trivial to send your mage in to CoH right to the Aary fight spot.</div></div><hr />

4?<br />
<br />
I've never seen a need for more than one except on Sontalak, and even then he usually dispells you faster than you can click.<br />
<br />
Just keep the instant click in top slot and get a junk buff or two and usually you will never need more than a junk buff recast on you.</div></div><hr />

One insta-clicky is all you need, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">first time raiding ntov will be one of your most exciting raids.<br />
<br />
yeah jorlleag is the only ntov dispeller so not really a huge deal.<br />
<br />
my guild always just fought into ntov and used all the hub kael armor drops to fill in for the people who didnt get what they needed in HoT, plus it gave us lots of room to get eashen and ikitiar single (although ikitiar loot is generally awful)<br />
<br />
my guild always did eashen, ikitiar, aary, fesh, dagarn and kreizen on the first day. the second day with vyemm, koi'doken, miranella, triplets, jor, and finally nev.<br />
<br />
nev and vyemm like others have said are the hardest, aary is also pretty difficult. feshlak and miranella are especially easy, i would put miranella on par difficulty wise of gozzrem or telkorenar.<br />
<br />
also about flurry drakes.....slow them asap or they hurt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few minor things to add: If it's blue, white, or a chromodrac, make sure enchanters and bards are actively manadraining it. While depriving the druid and cleric mobs of their mana will increase the DPS of the drake or wurm in question, gating mobs suck. Period. Facing down two Rape Drakes and a dozen assorted lesser drakes and wurms, while fun, will teach you a new meaning for pain, uniquely unduplicated in my experience. <br />
<br />
Another hazard I note unmentioned is the blue drake proc. All blue drakes in WToV and NToV proc a dot called 'Thunder Blast'. To a pure melee, it's just another some hundred point a tick dot, but to your casters, it's a hellish manadrain. Keep these off your healers and slowers at all costs. Further, always be ready to change who's doing the actual tanking, though assist can remain one person. Slime Mist on a warrior or Thunder Blast on a knight cripples aggro generation abilities, and even with RC3, curing them is hit and miss.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Rape Drakes, they hurt. Alot. Worse, they always seem to come in packs. Take all your 60+ warriors. Put them in a rotation. Warrior 1 to the first Rape Drake. Warrior 2 to the second. Warrior 3 to the third, and so on, until you close the loop. Why the rigamarole? You want defensive on every last one of these. As a 7800 HP SK, I die once for every two Rape Drakes I tank successfully. As a tank, these are one of the game's major peaks. The tank will die on this one. Aggro loss is a -huge- prossibility. An AE Taunter or a suicide knight is a smart thing to have pre-arranged, you really don't want these loose on your casters.<br />
<br />
Depending on how your guild breaks, you may also have to deal with rampage wyverns, which are only really fun in mass pulls. <br />
<br />
Good luck. While NToV's much easier now, it's still a pretty potent testing ground for your abilities as a raid force. It's the challenge that makes it fun.</div></div><hr />

His agro range is huge and he is all of the sudden bringing a friend with him.  If you are coming from Vyemm side I don't think that you really need to worry.  Fighting Lord Koi in the hallway leading up to Lady M just sucks.<br />
<br />
Eashan, Iki, Lord Fesh, DtD, and Lord Kreiz are all complete push overs.  Lord Koi is a long but easy fight and Lady M is simple as long as you keep your healers out of the silence. <br />
<br />
FYI slows for Lady M must be in melee range.  So one of your shaman are going to get silenced.  Be prepared.<br />
<br />
Make sure on rooted mobs that you dispell and debuff.  Makes life a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Oh and flurry drakes just plain suck.  8k hps and they still own me before a cheal can land sometimes preslowed.  Once they are slowed, any decent tank can be single cleric healed.</div></div><hr />
