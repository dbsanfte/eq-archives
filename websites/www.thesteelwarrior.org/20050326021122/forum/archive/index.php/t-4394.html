<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zethallon</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently a member of a small guild which has a casual gaming schedule.  In other words, we usually don't raid all the time.  Although I'm not an officer there, I'm trying to look for events in which to schedule for other guild members who are interested in raiding more.<br />
<br />
As it stands, I can usually muster up about 2-3 groups of players (ranging from 58-65) who have a combination of cultural, planer and LDoN bought gear.  The players do have access to all of the expansions.  Most of the players have had raiding experience either through the guild in the past or have raided with other guilds on our server.<br />
<br />
I have attempted to run events (such as the Hedge quest in PoN) but with the number of players that we have, I'm looking for ideas in which to give them more opportunity to see other zones and hopefully encourage other members into joining us more on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions on events that would be good for the group listed above, I would appreciate it.  Also, we have attempted to try a LDoN raid event, but due to having the bare minimum of players, it was a hard event for us even with a normal setting.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Nobody does growth anymore, might even spend the day clering the zone and doing tunare.<br />
<br />
Start farming Klan and zlan, start alot a hype about ST and people will perk up with interest, the more people you key, the more interest you should get. If you get some more support (new members interested) step up to yelinak, and LTK. (is aaronyar a first brood dragon?) and key up. When u get enough interest push the time sync even more. Give it a few weeks, you might have a nice reinorced guild to step into ST with.<br />
<br />
ST has some kind of strange allure to people, prolly cuz most of us grew up hearing stories about this big bag dragon that flew around velious DTing people, and just to be in the legendary zone is cool. Loot isnt bad there anyway.<br />
<br />

Edit: i spelled loot as lute for some damn reason</div></div><hr />

Vindi gives a lot of different classes practice on what to do (clerics, monks, nukers, etc.) and mujaki is just super fun, as you can do it so many different ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terail</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with the ST keyings they will help your guild get better in killing dragons and with how to deal with debuffing mobs.. Kael Names  such as Vindi (nice loot and ST key) and maybe Statue (nice loot) other then that try Kunark content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feargal_Axebringer</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also keep your eyes out for Evolved Burrower in Acrylia Caverns. Some of the best risk v. reward loot out there for a small guild. Just bring along your Enduring Breath items and patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my guild is similar though sometimes we can push 4-5 groups.  <br />
<br />
Any reason Tormax wasn't listed with the Kael mobs, Futumsh?  Also, who are Baraguj and Banord Paffa?  The list looks pretty good to me.  We've done Vindi, Velk, Mujaki, and xanamech in the past off that list, though we usually wiped to Xanamech.  We use to farm HoT armor and would like to look at north ToV now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gleb</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Callon, with 4 or 5 groups you should absolutely no problem with ntov, unless your gear...well, sucks. <br />
<br />
My guild (mostly 65s) can take 2 -3 groups there (our max really) and lay waste to the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">our gear isn't so hot.  It's mostly SS quest armor, cultural, PoP jewelry and stuff we could pick up in the bazaar at a decent price.  <br />
<br />
My 65 warrior with 133 AA (defensive and hit point AAs maxed) probably has the most exp in the guild with a few other people a little over or under the L65/100 AA mark and many others far below that.  I think my 5300 unbuffed hit points is the most in the guild, which I know isn't impressive.  So will it be a cakewalk?  No, probably not.  <br />
<br />
I was looking over our recent raid participation and part of the problem is we are really short on some important classes.  We have 2 necros, neither of whom raids enough to count on at all.  We have 1 rogue who's been on a raid in the last 2 months and he's only L57.  Then we have I think four or five L65 warriors that have been raiding at least some, so we usually have 2 or 3 there plus a 65 paladin and sometimes a 65 SK.  So the classes aren't too balanced.  Some we have plenty and some we're just SoL.  I suppose that happens in smaller guilds.  <br />
<br />
anyway, good target tips here... I posted them to my guild's board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of these already mentioned, mostly just agreeing with them.<br />
<br />
Rhag1+2, Rumblecrush, Doomshade, VaDynn and IV in Akheva, don't overlook Fear if you have the time (Some of the loot is still good, esp off Draco and Cazic). BoT named are excellent.  Tormax/Statue also very good, might consider AoW in the very near future, or whenever statue becomes easy.<br />
<br />
WToV named very good. Telk/Etc.<br />
<br />
Might find a similiar sized guild and form a partnership to take out some bigger stuff you can't quite handle.</div></div><hr />
