<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm lvl 54 with average gear, about 2600 hp unbuffed, just under 1000 ac, and use a frostbringer and jagged blade of mourning when tanking.  I had an invite to PoN today for the MT position, and got chewed up by the mobs there and had some trouble holding aggro.  What level/ac/weapons are the *minimum* requirement to being a successful tank in those planes?  I'm probably going back to PoJ zone out groups until then.  Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there isnt a minimum requirement per se, but as you rightfully note, if your not carrying enough hps /ac your just gonna be a mana sieve and make the whole exercise almost pointless.<br />
<br />
2600 unbuffed does sound a bit low to me. I think youd probably want to be at least about 3200 - 3500 and about 1100 ac to be able to tank okayish.<br />
<br />
To be honest though, Id stick with PoJ for a few more levels. Its not like the exp there is bad at all. <br />
<br />
Fact is that most mobs in PoI/PoD/PoN are around the 54-58 level range and so at your current level your going to be tanking whites yellows and reds a lot of the time and that means shitty mitigation, especially with your current hps and ac. It also means problems with taunting. Once you start to hit the higher 50s things will go much easier.<br />
<br />
If you want more advice on upgrades, set up a magelo profile so we can see what your currently wearing and advise you accordingly. <br />
<br />
Weapons wise im not sure what the aggro like for the jagged blade of mourning but you got a frosty which is okay. If your looking to upgrade your weps, tell us how much pp your thinking of spending. however, a good tip for another nice aggro proccing wep for not a lot of money is to get a silken whip of ensnaring - put the snare whip in offhand and the frosty in main and you got 2 nice little aggro proccers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had this gear (except I had Sebilite Berzerker Cloak/Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide @ 54) since I was 54, and I've never had problems tanking. Although, I did have aggro problems using 44/44 Stonebladed Axe of Dismay. It got better when I got a Windblade, and now I have pratically zero problems with my Greatstaff of Thunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was 53 when PoP came out, and it was hell.  Was not at all ready for the change.  I kept working on gear, and working on levels, and it got much better.  Like Gulug said, start with PoJ.  Once you are having no problem there, maybe move to PoD flies.  They are easier than most of the rest of PoD/PoN/PoI.  From there, oozes and rats in PoD, random yard trash in PoN, and ZO PoI.  It won't take long before all this stuff seems easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would geniunely suggest you grab a shaman and go level up somewhat in Velks or Sebilis, even Karnor - or PoJ as previously mentioned. It'll be much faster. To tank in PoN/PoD you're going to need a well balanced group with at last cleric and shaman buffs and even then you're going to be chewing thru the clerics mana when mobs are not slowed.<br />
<br />
Either that or hook up with another tank around 56+ with over 5k hps buffed for groups in PoN/PoD and just be some damage.</div></div><hr />

With Cleric/Shaman buffs (which are getting more important every day) I hit 5k easy, with good cleric/shaman/hybrid buffs, I can get close to 5.5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2600 unbuffed is a little light for PoN/PoD/PoI. I would say you would have a much better time once you are hitting over 5k buffed. Part of that will come with better buffs, part of that will be better gear. Without looking at your magelo its hard to say, but depending on how much you have to spend you could end up with a couple hundred HP just from some smart upgrades. Breaking 3k unbuffed HP in the 50s is not hard if you plan your gear right. Post a magelo and how much you have to spend  and maybe we can give you some ideas on some upgrades you can camp or buy depending on your plat situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that 54 is a little early to tank in PoN.  If you can get a higher level tank into your group, a 54 warrior would make a decent secondary melee.  <br />
<br />
56-58 is kind of the sweet spot for tanking in PoN.  By 59, you're going to want to move on to PoD, the exp is better in the courtyards there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
not at all true...well part of it anyways.<br />
<br />
at 54 with 2600 unbuffed you get to 4k without too too much trouble, 3.8 usually.  thats fine for most trash camps.<br />
<br />
under 1000 ac is the problem.  you should be over 1k by 54 and pushing 1100.<br />
<br />
as for aggro try my FAV aggro wep for cheap, the barnacle covered axe.  I use a wavey and a bca and is either of them procs before slow lands the mob is mine for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
This is of course in a group with a slower.  with no slower you will die fast fast fast.  get a boon if your slower is a chanty and the hos takes care of dex from the shammy.<br />
<br />
At 54 I had about 2600 unbuffed, 4k with normal buffs, 1100 ac with normal buffs, and with the wavecrasher/barnacle axe combo I have NEVER lost a slower or had a cleric complain of being constantly oom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyson Dycson</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2600HP is about right for lvl 54 without being twinked.  With mid 50's cleric and shaman buffs, 4k is not uncommon and you should be 4200 maybe even 4300.  Hell, I am only 56 and do fairly well just sitting shy of 3k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
54 was a bad level for PoP tho because ZO in PoJ is horrid exp and not worth the time spent there, atleast for me it wasn't being Iksar.  Grab yourself an aego or virtue and you will be fine for HP and AC.  Your weapons look good but maybe you could replace your jagged blade of mourning with either a BCA or new smithed yak's.  Never used BCA but have heard good things about it.  Yak's are a bit hard to find tho, atleast on Luclin.  They run fairly cheap if you can fine one. I use a yak and frosty setup and only lose agro to knights who wanna tank and over excited slowers who cast on inc.  But other than that, everything is smooth.<br />
<br />
Yes you will get eaten by unslowed mobs but if you feel like you going down really fast, pop your evasive disc and you will be fine.  Takes some getting used to for the switch of justice mobs who max hit 150 up to the bigger mobs who are hitting 250 in PoI and PoN.  I did CY groups in PoD once at lvl 53, scared the hell out of me and I went back to justice where mobs wouldn't rape me.  You have the HP it looks like, agro is rough as always, just gotta stick with it and talk to your group and put them in their place.  Once you get 55, the world will change for you, things will be easier, just gotta get over the 54 slump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szerath</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye at 54 MT'ing mobs in POI/PON/POD was rough. I had the same hp and about the same AC. Although I noticed a big difference once I hit 56. My hp now are 2800 unbuffed and AC at 1071.  I now can wander through POI with fair confidence and MT the hedge in PON fairly well. I use a Frosty / BCA combo when tanking and once both of those proc the casters are relatively safe.  <br />
<br />
As for POD...personally..I can't stand that plane. The pulls are slower..lots of wandering adds, and with all the little hills makes for a rough time tagging mobs after the FD puller FD's.</div></div><hr />

Yard trash mobs = my bitches. I use 2hander though and usually have 1150 or 60 ac. At 54 though i was tanking them ok (aggro is another issue) and my gear was much worse back then...probably had about 2800 hp unbuffed and 1050 ac.<br />
*edit* I just want to note the importance of a few levels. Getting 57 has dramatically improved my taunt ability. At 54 it failed, quite often, now it probably works at least 80% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
totally wrong on hp. 3200-3500 is great for a tier 1 tank but 2800+ is good enough. 1050ac+ is good. and LEVELS have a ton to do with everything. hp gain ac gain can taunt more mobs. and at 55 defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFL so true :) now at 56 i rape them.  great xp...LCY is good, rcy is good, ccy is ok if you can stand getting trained from the other two cy's every half hour or so :P<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
once you hit 55 defensive = teh pwn.  I know people say its our one useful and class defining skill...also so true.  I love it and the 15 min timer is short enough that you can basically tank an add or two until crowd control gets off its ass.  This saves groups all the time.  or a LoM healer who doesnt tell you until you got two inc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously you should only have enough hps and ac to last the first 10 secs or so until slow lands.  Once the mob is slowed, it should be no prob.  The higher you're lvl, the less they hit for.  Perhaps make a magelo character so we can see ure gear and make suggestions?  There are a lot of cheap upgrades.<br />

Been a while since I was at those levels and not like im a super twink or anything, i think when i was around 53-54 i also was only carrying about 2600-2800 hps and struggling to get to 1100 ac. however, those were the days pre-pop when my regular exp group used to be velks/KC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schubydog</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem at that level and about as shitty of equip.  Look into cultural armor, you can usually get it much cheaper than dropped stuff with similar stats.  Once I got full suit of cultural, I increased my hp by at least 75%.  I would get something a little faster than the blade of mourning to help with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm I tank in PoI and PoN all the time and i probably have less hp then he does most of the time I do ok. Yes I'm not uber and yes aggro sucks sometimes but dont ever get into the habit of saying Im not good enough or you never will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started tanking PoI entrance at 53 with worse gear. Do your best to group with friends who will trust you and understand when aggro bounces, because no matter how good a warrior is, sometimes there is aggro ping-pong.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS have a slower ( ench, shaman, suicidal bard/beastlord ) in PoP unless you got some sick number of ac and hp. They make the difference. In PoI, if you time your spawns, you can single pull the left side of entrance all the way to &quot;Weathered Camp&quot;. You will need some practice on the order though, because some mobs spawn in a clump of 3, but their assist aggro is short-range as long as you pull with a bow. <br />
<br />
 So, get friends, have a slower, practice pulls, and expect a death every once-in-a while. PoP xp makes death not hurt so bad. When you can get a 90+ rez and then kill 3 mobs to have the same xp as pre-death, you will know why we all love PoP xp.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Although my gear is pretty fair on my magelo now, at 54 I was in Barbed ringmail w/ mostly crusty armor and wielding a lammy/Centi. Get your levels and gear will come along for the ride, just don't be discouraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Vamcoy.. sure 50k gear will help you but dont be so elitists.<br />
<br />
THis is my first 50+ character and I've been tanking in PoN and even Underbulks that were yellow to me in the LCY in POD.<br />
<br />
The real problem is group dynamics.. if your gear like mine is just about 'ok' or worse.. you just can't do with  a bad group.. if you r gear is uba you can probly survive bad groups.<br />
<br />
I was recycling a PoN group all night yesterday, by that I mean I was getting people in to replace eveyr time soneone left. Well, I can tell you sometime just when the shaman changed, for another one of the same level, things could be night and day ! It's that crazy. Some shammys do stuff that will take lots of aggro and make your work so much ahrder.. others I dont know why but you are cruising.<br />
<br />
That said, so far , this is my opinion :<br />
<br />
POI is relatively easy to MT at 55 with at least 2 other melees. POI near the exit can be night and day, again, depending on group dynamics. Melee heavy groups ahve worked the best for me.<br />
<br />
PON is definitely harder than POI, and mostly because of adds and trains imho. The level requirement is higher.. I agree that 55 is just about the lower limit.. I have had a much easier time when a 58 Pally was tanking for us. I was doing fine as MT when we had another warrior to split tank adds and a good shaman.<br />
<br />
POD underbulks hit hard, but I'd say in a good grp tanking them was easier than in PON, just more predictable : hit hard, hit slow, rarely adds. I could tank in PoD LCY at 54.. but with higher level melees for DPS and a 60ish cleric.<br />
<br />
PoD oozes were much easier to handle with adds, with a secondary tank to split tank until root holds, like in PoN.<br />
<br />
I still love POI , the exp at 55 is pretty good if you have everyone in the 51-55 range, with 3 other melees shammy and cleric. it's relatively easy exp unles it is sunday or it is trained ^_^<br />
<br />
BTW if you haven't tried, you dont even need a bow to pull in POI, the left side is easier, but generally you just walk a little close and they single to you.<br />
<br />
As for PoJ that's the place I was after I dinged level 51 in KC. The exp through 51 and I assume to 53 is pretty decent in a good group that chain pulls from the cells. Tanking at 51 there is really cake as long as you have a slower.</div></div><hr />

The trains from quad kiting wizards made it a dicey thing most of the time though. :)<br />

Who cared how much int/mana I had?  As long as I can KEI and enough mana regeneration and my pet out, along with a more complete spellbook, I was as good as anyone else.  But warriors?  Hmm, now there's something.  You have to farm armor pieces, buy good enough weapons to hold agro, and establish yourself as a decent tank.  Now, at least on my server, this work pays off.  Good tanks are a rarity and people will remember your name, asking you to tank for them later on.  ;)</div></div><hr />

i am lvl 53 iksar warrior...i have 2400hp unbuffed and use a sc and spiked velium mallet. i have no problem tanking in any place or holding aggro as long as we have a slower and a cleric/ch druid shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was tanking in PoD (goos, rats, and spiders) at 54 with about 2800 hp unbuffed and 1150 ac.  It was ok, but a bit tough at times.  I've gained a lvl now, bumped the ac to 1200 and hp to 3k, and things seem a little easier - I'm actually somewhat confident tanking there now;) .<br />
<br />
I usually play with a druid, mage and enchie (all 54 to 56) and the  way we do it is the mage pulls with maloi (or whatever the magic debuf is), when he gets close the enchie slows, the druid snares, and the mage pet roots.  Once the slow lands I step in and get agro.  The big advantage is I'm not getting hit until  the mob is slowed and we spread part of the damage to the mage pet - which has great hp regen.  Using this strategy the druid is able to cover heals and add some dps.  If the pet misses on root I step in immediately.  Sometimes the druid or enchie has to run a few feet, but never for more than a few seconds - and this rarely happens.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, almost forgot....I alternate between windblade (no agro probs here), and cheap 1 handers for skillups (blood point, venomous axe, sarnak warhammer, club of ice ocean.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
