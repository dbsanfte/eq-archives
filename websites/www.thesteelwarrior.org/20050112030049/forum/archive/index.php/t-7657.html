please note i do not have a BoC...i was just messing around w/ magelo and i cant change it back cause there website doesnt load properly on the computer im useing. I use Sword of the Bloodsworn in primary.<br />
<br />
Would it be worth ditching the decent stats on my offhand weapon for either the sotbs or the willsapper. Im sure i will get one eventually since they are so easy to get when the rat is up....I just want to know if I should use it for aggro or just have it around when no slower is there. I have seen some tanks wield them full time and they seem to hold aggro very well. I hold aggro pretty well with the setup i have now and am not complaining at all....but ya can never have to much aggo =)<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />
<br />
(ps. i did search but didnt find what i was looking for)</div></div><hr />

But u have a BoC! JK. I'd stick with Bloodsworn for the better stats, both are probably close in aggro, and WS is better as a utility.</div></div><hr />

also, it is a piercing weapon, which means it will lower ur ATK on mainhand. <br />
<br />
anyhow it is a good aggro weapon for mid-level warriors. good utility value too.<br />
so if u trying to grab it, remember, fight vikini at where it spawns... i learnt this in the hard way  :)</div></div><hr />
