<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kataa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to replace my shoulders, does anyone have any suggestions? My guild is not a raid guild. So it  needs to be fairly easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caerberus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates from Vhaksiz the Shade in PoN (Small raid required) or Grand Pauldron of Study from the Plane of Mischief (single groupable but you'll need to bring someone who knows their way around in PoM...drops off a fraudulent chest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Octawan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grand Pauldrons are easy, just bring a 65 shaman with you...you can invis into the castle, to the first big room, and can camp the chest only killing 2 spawns if you want...I duo'd mine with my 65 shaman<br />
<br />
Also did the Shade with 1 group, had a 10khp+ pally tanking, necro, cleric, shaman, wizard, and SK...all 65, Pally and Wizard time geared.  So not your average group =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I single grouped Vhakiz for my Secrets of the Planes quest.  Not an average group.  I was at around 8.5k hps, but we had two Time geared clerics, a twink SK (level 54 or something), a ranger and a Enchanter.  The chanter charmed one of the horsies to act as Rampage tank and added dps.  Wasn't too bad.<br />
<br />
I'm wearing a Preserved Flesh Mantle (click magelo for stats) that I got on one of my first LDoN hard runs.  It's a little low on AC, but not too shabby overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Strength of the elements can be done with 1 group all the way through and are 100hp shoulders.  May want to check out the quest.</div></div><hr />
