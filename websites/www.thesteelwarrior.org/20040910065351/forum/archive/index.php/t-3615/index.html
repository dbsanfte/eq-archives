It's basically like this, to those who get it<br />
<br />

Coray:Warriors::Moorgard:Monks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of it was fairly good.  Until he started talking about making dual wield over powered again and making warriors want mana/wis/int....<br />
<br />
If anything they should adjust the stats of 2h weapons to be similar to the stats you would gain by 1h weapons.  I do agree that some 1h weapons need to be rebalanced, ie: with better ratios to keep up with similar 2h weapons.<br />
<br />
He also did not touch on one of the biggest bonuses of 1h weapons.  This is veratility... one of the biggest gains for 1h in the past was that you could have one that procs avatar, one for snare, one for slow, etc and get more procs than you could before.  But now that the 'EB GIMMICK' is taking over EQ for Warriors... this whole idea is being displaced.  It seems like it should be enforced with the new procs in LDoN... but they haven't added any useful procs... other than DD and Aggro... there's no procs that debuff, stun (up to 65), slow, fear, heal, etc...   So with Warriors forced to use MAX aggro weapons and procs, most all of them just use EB x4 on 1h and EB x2 on 2h.  Which removes one of the biggest gains that 1h weapons once had.<br />
<br />
Also any idea that causes warriors to want mana, wis, int is just not going to fly with me.  Aren't there already like 5 MMORPGs that use mana or stamina pools for warrior abilities?  You want them to go and copy another game, AGAIN?  They've already got Warriors wanting/needing CHA, at least they recently added that to some of the better warrior items, but this is certainly only true for Time, and needs to be fixed globally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO, Coray simply again shows his lack of a grasp on the issues concerning the warrior class.  His dismissal of the agro and itemization issues show he is truly out of touch.<br />
<br />
About the only idea of his that I agreed with was with the revamp of 1HS weapons.  I LOVE the idea of swinging 2 swords like a madman, and being able to compete with, and beat, the big bad 2HS'ers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya, I wonder what that guy is thinking, it's like, he doesn't know how the mid level warrior feels.  It isn't like he played a warrior back in the day years before enraging blow weapons were even conceptualized!<br />
<br />
And it isn't like after working his way to 65, he made ANOTHER warrior on the SAME server who he also raised to a high level!<br />
<br />
Not everyone will agree with me and whatever I have to say, that's fine with me.  I'd be far more worried if people did, but don't for a second try to say I am out of touch or can't relate to the average warrior.  I didn't just drop out of the sky and into the elemental planes, I've been in the trenches as a warrior for years, and a lot of people who frequent this board can't say the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Coray, talk to some warriors on your server in the high 50's and up, who aren't in elemental planes, or raiding guilds for that matter.  Ask them for their thoughts on what it's like to be overlooked for a group because of the trivial, non-issues of agro and itemization.  <br />
<br />
You are out of touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another equipment related complaint recently is that because so many things are used by so many classes, the pure melees as the only people without a useful mana pool get less use out of each item comparitively. For example, if an item is plate classes only and has 50 hitpoints and mana, a warrior only gains the 50 hitpoints while every other plate class also gains 50 mana. This also applies to wisdom and intelligence which aren't useful for pure melee types. This is sort of nit-picking in my opinion since while it's true, it's not really a factor in the balance of the classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're Wrong Coray.<br />
Taking for exemple an item with a Virtual Object.<br />
<br />
Virtual object<br />
LORE NODROP<br />
50ac, 15str, 15sta, 15dex, 15agi, 15int, 15wis, 100hp, 100mana<br />
WAR PAL SHD CLE BRD<br />
<br />
the warrior will use ac, str, sta, dex, agi, hp. lets say the warrior have a &quot;classe modifier&quot; of 25% (skills, etc...)<br />
The Knight will use ac, str, sta, dex, agi, hp. with a modifier of 20%. AND he will also use int/wis, mana.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but 100mana and 15wis for a paladin are not a &quot;light bonus&quot;. IT allow a well played character to save the day more than once, With almost the same tanking ability than a warrior.<br />
<br />
That's why there was classes armors. Crafted. Soldier. Cobalt. Thurgadin. Skyshrine. Kael. Ornate. Those are armors balanced (ok some part of the kunark ones are lame, I agree) to reflect the disparity between tank classes. <br />
But today there is no more AC gap or hp advantage for warriors,  especially with LDON armor, where 760pts armor is better than all plate ornate except warrior one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They should just up your parry % when you duel wield, and add a dmg bonus to your offhand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But today there is no more AC gap or hp advantage for warriors<br />
<br />
I cut the quote down a lot because I wanted to focus only on this line.<br />
<br />
My overall point with what I was saying about equipment is again, that the differences between warriors and paladins should be something that doesn't require equipment.  That if I don't have fancy warrior specific item x, I'm not an inferior warrior to those who do have it.  Enraging blow weapons are an example of this, while more common now and/or easier to make in ldon, at one point in time there was a big gap between those who had and didn't have.<br />
<br />
At the exact same AC level, say 1400, a warrior should INNATELY tank noticeably better than a paladin.  Making changes to the very core of our class equates to warriors of every level being improved.  It doesn't matter if you're level 35, or 45 or 65, if you're an average player, or in full time gear.  You will tank better than a hybrid, every day of the week.<br />
<br />
Again, balancing the class based on equipment, augmentations, aa skills, and disciplines is a bad idea.  The best way to balance a class is to change the core aspects of that class, and in our case that is our defensive capabilities.</div></div><hr />
