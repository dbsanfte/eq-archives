Last friday night we hit Sol B with Naggy in mind. worked our way up to the big bad boy and set up camp outside the dragon's maw (that big doorway with teeth and scary eyes)<br />
<br />
We wiped twice that night, but had a camped epicd cleric for CR.<br />
<br />
The reason for the second wipe was getting Naggy's bodyguard out of the way. (Magi Roykl). We couldn't get em single pulled, so the first wipe was aimed at getting this guy dead. Then we rezzed, rebuffed, and stormed Nagafen's Lair and killed the beast with only 2 deaths. Did I mention we only had 14 people there? ;)<br />
<br />
WTG us!</div></div><hr />

I remember the days of camping to save buffs for naggy/vox raids. Your first dragon kill is always the best one.<br />
<br />
Grats to you and your guild!</div></div><hr />

14 people is impressive, considering you can't be higher than 52.<br />
<br />
My first dragon kill was Lady Vox, we had 84 people there.  Bitch didn't last a minute.<br />
<br />
Damn, those were the days.</div></div><hr />

Don't know how big of a DS it was, but hey, she got rid of it :)</div></div><hr />
