I think Afterlife's is in perl/CGI, and is very very old.  NoV's is newer and uses JSP I beleive.  So there's a lot of options.  Depends on what you are fluent in, what your ISP provides you with, and what sorts of things you are planning on doing (load, performance, etc).<br />
<br />
There's something sort of in the works on sourceforge, you can find some more info at http://www.akanon.org</div></div><hr />

Some guilds base looting rights on points you get from raiding and being part of that guild.  It works best when you have a lot of active people who use their points properly (IE 65 wizard not spending his DKP on a 41% haste item).  It can be tricky, but a good system for heavy raiding guilds, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well this is my highest char after all (yeah, since December 2000 no less!)<br />
<br />
I know, I know<br />
<br />
Since this is already kinda related, my guild is finally getting in gear a bit and getting some higher levels and will be starting the raid circuit soon. Could someone (or everyone) who has been around the circle suggest a good progression of raids that an up and coming guild should try and test their mettle on? Most in guild who would be involved are between 30 and 53 (obviously the 30's are too low, but by the time we get around to it, they should mostly be 40+'s). No one has their epic yet, but we have one druid who is one kill away (getting help from an allied guild)<br />
<br />
Well, now that my long spiel is over...<br />

<br />
After that I'd say it sorta goes in phases.<br />
<br />
Phase 1:<br />
<br />
NToV/AoW/ST/AR/Deep<br />
<br />
Phase 2:<br />
<br />
Ssra/PoP tier 1-3<br />
<br />
Phase 3:<br />
<br />
VT/Seru/PoP tier 2-3<br />
<br />
Phase 4:<br />
<br />
Elementals/Sol Ro tower<br />
<br />
We just made it to VT and we aren't gonna do Seru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tithus</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno what it's really like with the gear available at those levels now, but I would say that epic fights would be a good place to start.  Kunark dragons and nameds could also be good.  Once you get to Velious,  you will probably want to look at taking out Velk.  He's a good fight for getting used to CH chains.  Of course, getting velious armor should always be a priority.<br />
<br />
Definitely work on levels, but don't let the gear fall behind either.  If you are looking to really have fun, don't pass up any of those &quot;low end&quot; encounters.  There is some great gear to be had that can certainly help you out for quite awhile (CoF, for example).</div></div><hr />
