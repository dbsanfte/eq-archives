<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First post, I like this site, not alot of BS.  <br />
<br />
Having recently returned to the game, I find I am 3 years behind in gear.  I left sometime after SoV came out and been back a month.<br />
<br />
Two questions, I have been doing LDoN to get use to the game again and have even pulled for several missions.  My AC is around 1173 and hps around 2495 (guestiamte)  I am level 57 Barbarian and need  to know if LDoN North Ro gear is the way to get upgraded.  The new expanions now have me totally lost.  What areas drop like Hate did for Indoclite.  Would prefer to earn my gear.<br />
<br />
Weapons are again all new to me, so what do I look for? Where do I go?  <br />
<br />
I am still wearing an Indoclite BP, Champion greaves, vambraces, gauntlets and helm.  Cobalt bracer and boots. Bracer of Benevolence, imbued granite spaulders, spider fur cloak, silvery belt of contention, Coldain 8th ring, mithril torgue.  <br />
<br />
Waepons are two Lamentations, club of the ice ocean, chelaki whip, felhammer and sarnak battle hammer.<br />
 <br />
Also is continuing my epic worth it?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The epic is crap. If you want a nice badge of honor, go for it. If you want better aggro weapons go to Temple of Droga and kill the goblin king and earthseer gramolk and get a copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn.  Also, go to the bazaar and grab a Greatstaff of Thunder.  You probably won't find a better droppable 2h aggro weapon, especially  for the 50pp the GSoT probably costs in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
Everfrost and North Ro LDoN both have good plate armor sets.  For the most part, the North Ro stuff is better, but in some cases it's a real close call or the EF stuff is a bit better.  North Ro is just over 1400 points per armor piece,  EF is 760 per.  Ornate armor molds (roughly equivalent to LDoN armor sets) drop in Bastion of Thunder (need to be 62 or flagged to go), Plane of Tactics (need to be flagged to go), and some higher zones depending on which pieces you're talking about.  Get a mix of ornate, EF, and Nro armors (There's also some stuff that drops on hard LDoN adventures that you can buy in the bazaar if you have lots of cash).  AC/HP aug the armors, get anger augments for your weapons, and you'll be as good as you're likely to get without joining a raiding guild and hitting up HoT, VT, and elemental+ content.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Since ldon points dont come as fast at your level, you might also want to hit up veksar for some droppable upgrades.  Nice haste belt, and decent BP and greaves drop there.  Also some nice DPS weapons off some of the more rare mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Beornegar's edit is what I was going to suggest.<br />
<br />
The Kylong armor that drops from various mobs in Veksar is achievable for you right now and has the added bonus of coming from a zone you've probably never seen before (since you've been out of the game). <br />
<br />
I just love Veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you get to level 58 and can find some kind level 65 people to let you tag along in LDoN as a backup tank, then you can get some pretty decent points and experience and perhaps some augs will drop that no one needs.  Would be hard for you but well worth it if you can swing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Talan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">KK, thats what I needed to hear.  Thanks, I would'nt have thought much about the Kunark or Velious zones but after reading the replies here, I have found those zones you mention have been upgraded.  <br />
