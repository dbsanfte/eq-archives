<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wymp</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that my Kizrak's Helmet of Battle shows to be grey in the Dye panel, but it has no graphic when equipped.  I haven't found a warrior with one yet that I could ask about it, so I figured I'd come here and see if that is normal.  Also, the effect is listed as Faerune everywhere that I have looked, but mine has Plainsight as an effect, instead.<br />
<br />
If someone has one, please post and let me know yours is the same or if mine is screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faerune is the effet on all of the elemental helms (Raex's for warriors). Plainsight is the effect on all of the ornate helms. It probably has that color associated with it because they just simply made all of the pieces like that. It's not something to worry about. And no, the helmet is never visable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wish it had a graphic, though.  I'm gonna miss my gnome goggles.  =\</div></div><hr />
