<br />
Seems most of them that have CA3, LR5 use Evasive almost exclusively over Defensive.<br />
<br />
Has anyone parsed damage taken on high DI mobs with evasive and defensive with all of your avoidance AAs done?<br />
<br />
Curious to see if you can now avoid more than you can mitigate with defensive.<br />

Most luclin are evasives.  This of course depends on your ac..how often the mob hits for minimum dmg..and the spread between the mobs max and min hits.  Only upper tier fights i use evasive on are fennin and 4th demon in fennin ring.  Everything else is defensive.  Agnarr is borderline evasive but hes a pussy so it doesnt matter much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaspar</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read this (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13) thread. Very informative. Essential info for warriors.<br />
<br />
To give you a very quick overview, mob damage prior to calculating for AC mitigation (that is, mob's ATK compared to your AC) is explained by the formula DB + x * DI.<br />
<br />
DB means Damage Bonus and DI means Damage Interval. All mobs have these two numbers set for them. The 'x' variable is a number between 1 and 20 -- exactly what it ends up is determined by the mob's ATK and your AC.<br />
<br />
An example is Cazic Thule whose DB is 200 and DI is 20. That means his minimum hit is 220 and his maximum hit is 600. See how that happened? 20 times 20 is 400, plus the DB of 200.<br />
<br />
Now, defensive is a DIRECT manipulation of the DI, not the DB. It basically divides the DI by two. Point being, if the DI is relatively low, mitigation (which is what defensive does) will be minimized.<br />
<br />
So the basic theory is that you want to use evasive (which is avoidance versus mitigation) on those mobs with a smaller DI, since you'll be avoiding the entire thing, DB AND DI, as opposed to only mitigating an already small DI.<br />
<br />
As a general guideline, anything with a DI less than 25 or so is probably better off being tanked evasively.  Though there will always be exceptions, of course.<br />
<br />
**Edit: Oops, reread your post and realized you mentioned DI, so obviously you already understand all this :) I'm not going to delete it though because I'm pleased with my explanation, so there! :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're correct that I understand how the DB/DI factors work, pre-PoP.<br />
<br />
I was curious as to whether, with PoP avoidance AAs, you would avoid more damage with evasive (on a high DI Mob) than you would mitigate with Defensive.<br />
<br />
It sounds like the answer is no.  Was curious if anyone has actually tried both disciplines and parsed it to see what the difference was.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it's not the PoP avoidance AAs that swing warriors towards Evasive lately.... it's their already huge mitigation.<br />
<br />
Tanks with CS 3 and ID 5, sporting VT or Elemental armor (let's say 1700-1800 AC), already mitigate the damage of most mobs down very well without using any disc at all. You really need to parse a fight or two against a particular boss to see how you're doing for sure, but if you're already mitigating more than half a mob's hits to minimum damage, you'll probably get more benefit by just using Evasive.<br />
<br />
My personal guideline is this - Evasive cuts down about 30 percent damage, period (this may be swayed a bit higher on mobs with nasty contact procs, since Evasive helps avoid them and Defensive doesn't reduce their damage). I parse one or two fights against a mob using Evasive, and see how my natural mitigation does. I look at the difference between the Average damage I took from a hit, and the mob's minimum damage. Using Defensive instead would reduce the average hit by half of that difference... if that amount is greater than 30 percent of a mob's max hit, I'm better off using Defensive.<br />
<br />
I give Evasive a lot of love, but I tank primarily Luclin targets at this point, so it's appropriate. I've heard that Elemental tanks mitigate pretty damn well with their 1800+ AC, and it can also be beneficial to use Evasive there, even with the huge DI mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They way I saw it, all those avoidance aas would make defensive the better choice.<br />
<br />
Thing is, now many of the high end mobs, hit HARD but miss a lot.<br />
With all the avoidance aas, you get hit 1/4 of the time, im not less.<br />
<br />
Using defensive on mobs that already miss you ALOT, doesnt make much a difference.<br />
Whereas Defensive on mobs that can hit for 3k WHEN they hit. Now that saves your life a lot.<br />
<br />
I've also watched my guild's MT's life on most encounters, he's a evasive fan :p..<br />
When he uses evasive, he may not get hurt too much... but there are times where his health simply shoots down. From full to berzerk in one round.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive usually keeps you alive,<br />
whereas Evasive brings in a Luck factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bunnie brings up a very good point that I didn't mention in my post... spike damage. Even if Evasive gives a better total damage reduction result throughout a fight, it still might be better to use Defensive to eliminate the possibility of you getting one-rounded against a really tough mob. At least it saves your clerics from a heart attack :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felor Justice</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bah, my clerics don't have heart attacks.<br />
<br />
They just call me a ranger and move on to the next tank in the rotation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What good is defensive when say 45% of all of a mobs hits are for minimum and the other 55% are evenly spread between DI=1 and DI=20?<br />
<br />
As Player's AC and mitigation increase, the value of defensive drops, while the value of evasive remains a constant.  If things continue on as they are currently going, defensive will become a rarely used disc, with evasive being more helpful in almost all situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are mobs that have such a wide range of hits that makes Defensive still safer.  Evasive might still mitigate more damage but Defensive can keep you alive better against really bad rounds.<br />
<br />
Another simple work around player mitigation is to give mob innate attack buffs or AC debuffs.  Sedition anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it can but it's an unnecessary and overall inefficient safeguard. Also I'm sure guys like Hanadan are smart enough to pop defensive in the light of higher mob ATK or big AC debuffs.</div></div><hr />
