I'm a casual player and I know it. I also consider myself pretty well-equipped for a casual player. What I want to know is what exactly it means to be a casual warrior, so, if you are one, help me out here:<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gotta ask the question, just to be clear.<br />
<br />
Are you asking for CASUAL people, or NON RAIDERS?<br />
<br />
Casual people play a couple hours a week.  Non raiders don't do huge raids much.  Juat making sure that everyone knows what you're asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would guess that he wants casual people.  Non-raiders can reach really impressive stats if they put in a lot of time like hardcore raiders do, and the most rabid of them are probably already at or close to level 70 today, even without pofire-table access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I took &quot;casual&quot; to mean &quot;not a member of a raiding guild&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, that's what I'm wondering.  I'm wondering whether he wants a thread of 6khp warriors, or guys with their level 56 main characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KirasTrueheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, it comes down to what you mean by &quot;casual&quot;...  In my book, people who typically play 4 - 5 hours a day are not casual.  They might not be in a big raiding guild, but they are sure playing a lot of EQ...</div></div><hr />

Obviously I'm at the upper end of what you would term casual but it isnt impossible to break into the hardcore raider world as a casual just takes a bit of effort. Now I'm looking forward to seeing the &quot;Uber&quot; zones :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good question, Haas. <br />
<br />
My wife and I play EQ ~4 hours a night most days of the week. When we aren't online, we often spend some time reading about the game and our classes on various boards. So, in terms of the time we invest in the game, there's nothing casual at all about our EQ experience. I assume that's the point of Baadan's &quot;hours played&quot; question.<br />
<br />
Yet, despite the significant time investment, we still consider ourselves &quot;casual&quot; players. So, the defining quality of &quot;casual-ness' isn't the amount of time you put into the game.<br />
<br />
In my and my wife's case, what makes us 'casual' players is the fact that we're not under anybody else's orders. Nobody tells us where to be at a certain time on a certain day, or how many and which AA's we must have by a certain deadline. Nobody is laying out a progression for us to follow. If we aren't enjoying some zone or encounter, we just walk away from it. That's the way we want to play, and the price for that freedom is the gear and zones we have access to.<br />
<br />
Now, choosing to be a casual player doesn't mean you aren't devoted to improving your character. I grind AA's and pursue gear just as rabidly as my friends who belong to raiding guilds. The difference is that I understand that I'm pursuing a different set of rewards. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the dissertation -- started thinking and writing and couldn't stop!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the dissertation -- started thinking and writing and couldn't stop!Great post, that describes exactly what I mean by a casual Warrior.<br />
<br />
The reason I asked about the Pick-Up Raid Organization is that allows casual players to advance deeper into PoP content without joining a raiding guild and still being able to raid at their convenience. Sure, there aren't raids happening all the time that I'm on, but if I am on, and a raid is happening, and I feel like going, then I'll go; but if there isn't one, no biggy, I'll spend awhile looking for/forming a group to do a hard LDoN or Sol Ro or GoD or something, or, &lt;gasp&gt; perhaps idly sit around talking with friends or discussing something in a serverwide channel.<br />
<br />
The divider, I think, between a casual player and a non-raider is Sol Ro Tower access. With this, one can no longer be considered a non-raider because of the amount of kills needed to get here. To become a casual raider and not a casual player one gets EP access. Any progression further than this and you are not casually playing EQ.<br />
<br />
The real test of whether or not you fit into this thread is really whether or not  you follow a mandated schedule or play at your own whims and advance because a raid was happening and you felt like going, not because your guild says that RZtW is going down at 6:00pm EST and you are to be online from 5:30 to 8:00 that night.<br />
<br />
Judging by what people have posted so far, here's how I would classify them. Hopefully this will help others who respond:<br />
<br />
Baadan - casual<br />
Lathen - non-raider<br />
Varalla - casual raider, and just a hair less than the epitome of what a casual raider can hope to be, WTG Varalla<br />
Kermey - casual raider<br />
<br />
Here's the hierachy of player types that I'm going by:<br />
Non-raider (no Sol Ro access, far less than 6k hp 100AAs)<br />
Casual (between Sol Ro and EP, around 6k hp 100AAs, might have Vxed)<br />
Casual Raider (EP access, 6.5k+ hp 150+AAs but still mostly doing &quot;casual&quot; difficulty mobs, might have Tipt)<br />
Raider (EP access, 7k+ hp, 200+ AAs, mostly raiding in EPs, KT flagged)<br />
Hardcore Raider (Time access and beyond)<br />
<br />
P.S. Can't edit my first post :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nissa XXX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good post.  It shows that you can be casual/non raiding and have decent gear/knowledge!<br />
<br />
I for one am not in a raiding guild and havent been since Velious, and I like it.  My friends/guild can kill many nameds to upgrade us and keep us in the fun.  And thats what we want...fun.<br />
<br />
I can and have done an 8 AA day w/o Elemental access.....but I would rather spend 2 hours of fun than 10 or grinding :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmm... I don't quite fit your definitions.  My guild is casual in the sense that when we raid, it's usually only 1 or 2 targets.  None of our raiding is mandatory.  We are not elem flagged, though we did recently start getting some people sol ro tower flagged.  <br />
<br />
So I'm casual in a sense that no one is requiring me to be anywhere.  I raid at my convenience.  I level at my convenience.  I'm not very casual in terms of time except for the fact that I take some long breaks from time to time and while I have L66 and 332 AAs, I've also had this character for over 4 years.  <br />
<br />
But anyway, no elem access but I'm Kod'Taz flagged and with tribute and leadership have around 7kish unbuffed hit points, maybe a little over.  It adds up to 9600 and something fully raid buffed.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty well maxed out on pre GoD gear until I can get elem gear.  I have a few GoD drops though the best ones in the best GoD zones I have access too have so far evaded me (shoulders from ferubi, earring from vxed, mask from kod'taz, earring and ring from ikkinz1).  The good single group drops are just rare as hell and others always roll on them too or I can't get the absolute perfect group to be able to get them.  So gearing is a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm in a small family type guild, only about 18 or so people in it.  We do raid, but only 1-2 times a week and completely optional.  Non-sol ro, non-EP, but KT flagged, 7500 hp / 1750 ac unbuffed, just over 10k hp / 1900 ac fully buffed (pre-oow), 350ish aa's.   There is not an established open raid setup on our server, but I don't have the tolerance for large groups to deal with them often anyway, so I'd be unlikely to advance by that route in any case.<br />

My situation is unique I suppose.  I consider myself casual, but not necessarily by will.  I play in off-time periods so I can't raid as much as I'd like.  But at the same time my guild is not a hardcore raiding guild.  We are a family guild, RL&gt;EQ and everything, but we have a set raiding schedule because everyone enjoys it and enjoys doing things we are told we can't possibly do.  I play a lot (ask my girl  :p ) but, like I said, I play during off peak times so groupage and progression is a little more difficult.</div></div><hr />

Best moments tanking: back a bit probably flawless victories on 2 of the West TOV dragons (the lore keeper and one of the others) and a Syran (sp, the wench in torment) where I was ST/MT.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ah, well, since my first warrior is retired forever I'll fill this out based on the warrior I play now. He's basically the second half of my EQ career, after the baby, new job, etc caused me to first take a break from EQ. I stopped playing for a while because I thought if I couldn't play seriously, there was no point. But after a while I thought, well, maybe I'd see if I could just have some fun. So when I did return to playing, I came back as an extremely casual player, since it was that or nothing. I decided that I'd start over again, retiring my first warrior, and making a new untwinked one from scratch.<br />
<br />
My guild is very small (30-ish human beings, some of whom are semi-retired from EQ), casual in the extreme, pretty old school. Several of these players are English, so the American and English branches see each other mostly on the weekends. Several guildmates are rl friends or relatives (of each other, not me). Some are husband-wife teams. I'd say on an average night there might be 3-5 of us on at the same time. I think there are about four toons in the guild at lvl 65 now; the rest of the mains are below that. The guild I am in pre-dates EQ; my previous warrior was not in this guild, though, so I'm a relatively new member of the guild. I've never seen an argument or insult in guildchat in the year and a half I've been in the guild.<br />

# of AAs? 6 generals, two more banked (hung out at 52 a bit to kill Vox and Naggy)<br />
<br />
Does your server have an established Pick-Up Raid Organization? Yes<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; to all guild flagging questions (some of us have picked up flags, but always through being invited as individuals by friends in other guilds; I don't think any of these flags came through the established pick-up raid route, but I'm not sure.)<br />
<br />
Most notable tanking accomplishment(s)? Not much really on this warrior. Vox and Naggy a few times, for both guild and pick-up raids.<br />
<br />
Time played play per day, on average? I play for 1-1.5 hours every other evening during weeknights, on average. On weekends, if I'm not traveling on business or on a family vacation, I'll play 3-4 hours Sunday, and perhaps I'll do an &quot;LDoN night.&quot; I have alts, too, so my weekday time is split with them; I generally reserve my weekend blocks for the warrior. My policy is to spend 25% of my online time helping new players, although this has been getting more difficult the last few months on my server, as there are fewer actual new players around. I generally do not twink or pl new players; I have some mules at various levels and use them to group with the new players once I've determined they really are new. I answer their questions, show them some places to hunt, hunt with them.<br />
<br />
Total /played time, and date character was created? Don't know the total time played (meh, forgot to look). I rolled this warrior on Dec. 31, 2002.<br />
<br />
You'll note from the AC of this warrior that he's not yet in cultural armor. However, he'll be attempting some combines next week. (This is the last warrior I'm going to play that gms multiple tradeskills, I swear it.) Except for one ring he bought in the bazaar, all of the armor he's wearing now he either looted or quested or made himself or got from LDoN merchants or traded one of his guildmates for (multiple gm tradeskill folks in the guild).</div></div><hr />

My former guild ran through most of PoP in a short amount of time and has done Rathe, Fennin, Coirnav, and Xegony with a raid force of about 50.  Our personal best for Rathe was 51 so far.  <br />
I have also had the pleasure of doing Junk Beast with 4 people, no cleric.  We have also done queen, king and prince in Chardok with 3 people.  Shaman, necro and warrior.  When we did queen she was actually an add and we did her entire room and queen at one time no split.  We plan on having some more fun in the near future on other named mobs that we once wiped on.  <br />

   Always considered myself a casual player, in my second Family style guild now. We do raid on occasion but not on a regular basis. I love raiding but would never want to have to do it every day. I first started raiding back at Lvl 52 doing open Vox and Naggy raids. Used to be part of a 5 group alliance of small guilds and was normally the main tank doing things like Hate, Fear, Chardok , Sky and more epic fights than I want to remember.</div></div><hr />

I raid 5-6 nights a week, but was told that I am in a casual raiding guild, /shrug. My guild does VT almost every night with some progression mobs in there somewhere. Need RZtW and Solro for EP. Yes server does have a open raid alliance. <br />
Most notable mobs tanked: everything from Velious, Seru, EMP, every mob in VT, AD, RD, MM, Bert and Saryrn.<br />
Being military I deploy 6 months a year. This puts a big roadblock on my EQ experience. Knowing this I know I will never be any of the top guilds on my server, they have no time for people that have other commitments like myself. My brother got me all the Elemental gods after I left this year, so when I get back all I need is RZtW and SolRo for Time.
