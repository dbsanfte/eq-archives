<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmurbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">or, How To Twink Without Twinking<br />
<br />
What I Set Out To Do <br />
My goal was simple: to get a warrior, on a server I knew no one on, in full Crustacean armor without hunting anywhere but his native newbie zone, and without asking anyone for help of any kind (no begging, no buffs, nothing).<br />
<br />
How I Did It<br />
First off, I picked Crustacean because I knew it was decent both in AC and in stats, and that it was relatively cheap.  I changed this assessment later after the realities of Bazaar life started to sink in, which I will explain below.<br />
<br />
I also knew that a decent source of money for newbies was spiderling silk.<br />
<br />
With this information, I logged in to Zebuxoruk and started up a Warrior.  I chose an Ogre because my 2-year-old son is infatuated with Shrek at the moment.  Thus was born Timmurbuk.  I did the newbie stuff, put four training points into 1HS and one into Kick, and off I went.<br />
<br />
I had never played an Ogre before, and the only reason I had ever entered the Feerrott before was to pass through it, so I had no idea where to hunt for spiderlings.  It took me some time but I finally found a good spot: south of the Druid circle, between it and the path.<br />
<br />
There are spiderlings all over the place.  There are also some jungle spiders, who also drop spiderling silk.  The down side is that there are marsh bears who like to make short work of silk-farming newbies; thank goodness for keeping your items when you die before level 10.<br />
<br />
Once I found this sweet spot, it would take me about 10-20 minutes (depending on whether a bear got me) to loot a stack of silks.  Once I got a good number, like 40 or 60, I'd head up to the Bazaar and see how the silk market was doing.<br />
<br />
My goal in selling silk was simple too: to have the cheapest silk in the Bazaar.  I used this strategy:<br />
- Check out the prices of other traders<br />
- If anyone was selling for less than 3p, buy them out<br />
- Once 3p was the lowest price anywhere, /auction and /ooc that I had the cheapest silk<br />
- Wait for tells.<br />
<br />
I only had to buy silk once, from someone who was selling two of them for 1p each.<br />
<br />
When someone would send me a tell, I'd tell them that I was selling them for 3p each, but that I'd give a free one if they bought a whole stack.  Sometimes people wouldn't want a whole stack, but they usually did.  The cheapest I ever sold silk was to a very good haggler for an awful lot of silk - 96 silks (my largest single batch) for 275p.<br />
<br />
On my first trip up, I sold enough to buy a Crusty bracer and gloves.<br />
<br />
On my second trip, I bought the other bracer and a helm.<br />
<br />
It was about then that I noticed how expensive Crusty boots were for some reason, and realized that the price/performance ratio might be better for another type of boot.  That's when I found this site, and that wonderful chart comparing the different sets of full armor.  I didn't know that Ry'Gorr armor was so good, for instance, or that Crafted could be had so cheaply in some cases.  So here's what I ended up with:<br />
<br />
Crusty Helm: 75p<br />
Crusty Gloves: 50p<br />
Crusty Bracers x2: 120p<br />
<br />
Netherbian Chitin: 15p<br />
<br />
Crafted Vambraces: 35p<br />
Crafted Greaves: 50p<br />
<br />
Coterie General Boots: 14p<br />
<br />
Orc Fang Earring x2: 30p<br />
Jagged Band: 30p<br />
<br />
Mask, neck, shoulders, back, waist: I forget offhand exactly what I have here but I'll update this part later.<br />
<br />
My point is that I got stuff that will easily last me to my mid 20's for about 700p, which was about 240 spiderling silks, or about 4 hours of farming spiderlings.<br />
<br />
And I did all this before dinging 7th level.<br />
<br />
Help I Got<br />
It's amazing how much help you get if you DON'T ask for it.  One of the advantages of hunting near the Druid circle is that Druids pop in every so often and sometimes they cast the usual good Druid spells on you  - sow, SLN, regen, thorns, etc.<br />
<br />
I also received about 50p in gifts from random people.<br />
<br />
I didn't turn any of this down, but I didn't ask for any of it, either, because that was one of my goals.<br />
<br />
I figure that if I did ask for it, it would have taken me significantly MORE time to accomplish what I did by killing spiderlings.<br />
<br />
Fun<br />
This was a BLAST.  Sometimes the complexities of high-end life (I have a sixty-something character on another server) can get to you after a while.  It was nice to just play raw, simple EverQuest again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Koralak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here here! A great story, personally...yes I am sure I will get flak for this...but I think the high end game is for the birds :) Yes, I do have a high level character ( in what would be considered an uber guild and we are in the Elemental Planes) and to be honest...it is dull as hell. Maybe it is just nostalgia but I miss the old days, I prefer small group adventures rather than large raids, so I pulled out a lower level character and joined a small family guild. I have to say I enjoy this much more :) I am very much looking forward to the new expansion and hope it delivers all that it promises.</div></div><hr />
