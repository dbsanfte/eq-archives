45 warrior - My Gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=604349)<br />
^^Also, if anyone has suggestions about new equip, please tell!^^<br />
<br />
i am currently doing Sol B bats, and once he dings 46 i plan on bringing him into enforcer in PoJ with mage friend to leach exp(mage and cleric already farm there)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a 65 cleric to keep him healed and what not<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? Seb has too many hp, velk's i think has even more. And DL exp is WAY too slow(how the hell did i get through there the first time grouped?!)</div></div><hr />

Suggestions: get your mage friend to put on his highest DS, Get him a Shaman DS Potion, and pull a bunch of something (solb mobs, howling stones etc etc, places with a lot of wandering mobs) and just let the DS's kill em while you hack at each one once. or just tough through one level of exp until he gets to PoJ enforcers, and then he'll fly right through. <br />

DS pull huge train mobs to war, fight until all dead, rince and repeat.  I dont seem to remember having any problems w/ heal aggro was non-existant when was pling there.  Near castle entrance would probably be your best bet.</div></div><hr />

Got him within 2 blues of leveling yesterday in Bats.  Will try others though since in enforcers i will be grouped with the 61 mage</div></div><hr />
