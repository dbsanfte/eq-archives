<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i found a real good guid for the warr epic but a few questions still not answered. <br />
<br />

---------------------------------------------<br />
First Plane of Hate<br />
<br />
Hand of Maestro <br />
from my guide<br />
 &quot;I've not been up to the new PoH yet, but from what I've read the tiny hand sits in room before the room where the Maestro spawns.  No confirmation on if killing the small hand spawns the bigger hand anymore, but now you do not need to kill the new uber Maestro to get the epic drop.&quot; <br />
<br />
anyone can confirm this ?<br />
<br />
here a PoH map <br />
http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/hateplane2.jpg<br />

-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Second Plane of Fear<br />
<br />
Ball of Everliving Golem <br />
<br />
droped by <br />
Fright <br />
Terror <br />

Guards of Cazic <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">but now you do not need to kill the new uber Maestro to get the epic drop <br />
<br />
Correct, port to hate, pacify or kill the four mobs at the stairs or run by them really fast, run around to the &quot;catherdal&quot;.  Pull hand.  Kill hand.  Loot hand.<br />
<br />
Its easy.  Its boring.  /yawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ancient Blade from Queen  <br />
Any ideas and how many needed ? <br />
<br />
I would say 12 folks of 65 HoT lvl.  Less the higher tiered they are.<br />
<br />
Hardest part is not falling asleep getting down to King.  Those Sarnaks are like flies, we alwasy AOE our way down.<br />
<br />
The lower level you are the more you need.  12 x65 ers it will be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spiroc Windblade droped from Spiroc Lord on 5th island <br />
<br />
The only hard part about this is he DT's.<br />
<br />
Otherwise 6 people , heck two people could do Air minus the DT mobs.<br />
<br />
Keys are kept now, so take 4 friends one day and a necro.  Then when your ready to do Lord have the necro run up with the keys and summon corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ball of Everliving Golem  <br />
<br />
Two of the guards DT.  So need a couple people.  Otherwise two people could clear all of Fear.  <br />
<br />
The guards are on the map, look were it says &quot;soandsos&quot; Temple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BTW, in the time it took me to post and answer this you could have bought two weapons better than the epic.<br />
<br />
I understand that EQ is a &quot;fun&quot; game and is about doing &quot;quests&quot; but the warrior epic is overrated.  The proc is resisted &quot;alot&quot;, the speed ratio on the weapons is &quot;very&quot; out dated, and the hitpoints are lacjing in todays standards vs bazaar bought weapons.<br />
<br />
I dont want to discourage you too much, the game &quot;should&quot; be fun.  But take into account the time and agrevation that you are going to put your friends through to get weapons that are really &quot;crappy&quot; may not be in your best benefit.<br />
<br />
Read some posts about the warrior epic, decide if your &quot;time&quot; and your frineds &quot;time&quot; is worth the lack - lustered reward in this terribly long and drawn out &quot;quest&quot;.<br />
<br />
/shrugs and walks away eyeing her perma bagged epic blades with spite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First off that hate map is outdated, they did a complete revamp on Hate a while back, an updated map can be found here:<br />
<br />
http://www.guildseofon.com/images/Hate_b.JPG<br />
<br />
You can set up on the cathedral steps and pull the Hand outside, we did it with one group of mostly 65's the other day, just depends on how well equipped you are.<br />
<br />
The mobs in Fear and Sky that drop epic pieces will death touch so you usually need 2-3 groups for those.<br />
<br />
For Chardok get a mage on good faction to CotH a group or two in and have a chanter or cleric pacify the queen's room and single pull her to the hallway.<br />
<br />
Kind of weak info I know but it's a start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">whole quest is doable by 2 groups or less now. That is if those ppl are 60+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Always was :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ulic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Killed hand the other night with:<br />
<br />
65 War ( me )<br />
65 Cleric<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Wizard<br />
58 Ranger<br />
<br />
Your group could do it disgustingly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">quik question how can hate portion of the  proc on 2H be resisted? i thought hate is unresistable and if so isnt the resisted proc still a good agro maker? <br />
