<br />
1) Chests/Mines/Herbs are greyout taggable<br />
<br />
Grey out after you start to open/use them for 60 seconds.   This way even if a mob interrupts you, you have already tagged it.   The way most people get ninjaed is that they are fighting the mob next to it while someone comes up.<br />
<br />
2) Chests/Mines/Herbs are greyout-pvpable<br />
Same as above but instead of being &quot;safe&quot; for 60 seconds.   Attempting to open puts on a universal PVP<br />
<br />
3) Blizzard needs to declare this &quot;physical griefing&quot; under thier rules, you could currently argue it is physical griefing.   Declare it, and let people petition the ass doing it.   Im sure if this was mode of operation, once a certain numbers of tickets are on same player, you could suspend/ban.  <br />
<br />
4) People need to change the culture as players.   When someone ninjas one, declare thier name in open channel, everyone else support the declaration, rather than being part of the 25% or so who say &quot;Suck it up, it happens&quot;.    Tell thier guildmates.    Don't invite them on pickup raids.    Kick them out of your guild.<br />
In short, make reputation matter.   <br />
<br />
example from Zuljin, like Haladenn.  I see his name almost daily come up in EP channel.<br />
<br />
ultimately,  nothing is going to change until blizzard is forced to change it.   I recommend filing a physical griefing petition each and every time it happens just because it forces Blizzard to spend time on the issue, and maybe will clue them in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I 2nd, 3rd, and 4th that motion! Having been gold farmer ganked one too many times, I thought of that exact fix. I prefer that to the greyout PvP because if I'm beating on a mob next to that rich thorium vein then I'm already at a disadvantage and killing them after they take my arcane crystal doesn't make me feel much better. Okay, a little bit but still.<br />

<br />
Gold farmers don’t give a crap about that, most cannot read English anyway. Playing &quot;tag&quot; with those resources seems to be the way to go.<br />
<br />
BTW, I play on a Carebear server (PvE) and if I gank the other factions resource, I’d just feel horrible about that. HAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
Now we just need to start the petition to Blizzard! I'm with you!</div></div><hr />

In short, make reputation matter.  I desagree on this one (but just on this one) because it is creating harasment to the thief. Moreover there is no possibility to stop/correct it against fake griefers. Indeed, would you like to see a full guild getting on your back while mining just to hear them one after eachother shouting across the server that you are currently ninja jacking a vein from one of them. You could always try to defend yourself after in channels you wouldn't get your repupation back. Only Blizzard could prove you right and warns those f***ers to stop harasing other player, but it wouldn't change other players faction toward you since they wouldn't know Blizzard's responce except if Blizzard starts spaming every clients with the list of the warned players and the reason they are warned for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eq did this a lot with server boards, and what not and it worked fairly well.<br />
<br />
The rule of thumb here is, that it takes a LOT of effort and desire for someone to slander.  More than you think/expect.   <br />
<br />
Sorta similiar to why when your in front of a judge with a police officer on a ticket and you say &quot;I wasnt speeding&quot; and officer says &quot;I clocked you 10 over&quot; the court goes with the officer because whats the motivation to lie here?<br />
<br />
Basically, you'd really have to tick someone off to pick on you slandering, and they'd have to be trusted by thier guildmates implictly for them to pick up and do it as well ((I wouldnt spam based on guildies I didnt know well)) <br />
<br />
Then factor in, you are staking your own credibility.   If someone spammed a name, and got counter spammed odds are most people right both off.<br />
<br />
Basically, while I see where your coming from, it turned out to work better in EQ<br />
then you would think.</div></div><hr />

We arrived at the the vein at the same time according to my perspective but he had aggro on a scorpion running to the vein. He got the scorp and I got the 1 piece of Thorium. He sent me a &quot;?&quot; tell and I replied &quot;ya win some ya lose some&quot; and went on my way. I'm sure he thought I stole it from him but to me I won the race. I have no problems losing a vein this way and just move along when it happens. I do agree wholeheartedly about the pricks who come up when your already working a vein and start in trying to gank it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That’s fine and all, but with that scenario it’s still a race with the grey out &quot;tag&quot; option. In fact I'd say its even more of a fair race rather than having the vein go to the person that got there 2nd because they sat back and let the other person that has some balls take on the mobs around a resource. Not saying you did that but it happens far too often. Think about it, how long would you stand there looking at that resource and waiting for the other person to make a move when they are doing the same thing and waiting for you? Now if someone races to a resource tags it and dies because they took too much agro in the process, sorry about your luck and the grey out should be lifted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
these are kinda hard to judge honestly.<br />
<br />
the question is, was the scorpion close enough to the vein, that it would have agroed on anyone tapping it.<br />
<br />
If so, he beat you, and you stole that vein.<br />
If not, he picked a bad path to race you from and it was his own fault.<br />
<br />
Either way, a tapping system would so much fit the rest of the tapping system and be a good thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">his post indicates the warrior got agro on the way to the vein. and yeah, i think everyone should just report the hell out of ore thieves and the tapping system sounds great. when that shit happens to me, if the person is in my level range (still a young'un atm..) i dont care if they run or if i die fighting around the spot, thats what /who is for. i will find that piece of shit and kill them over and over etc.<br />
<br />
as far as handling this type of thing in EQ, we used the flameboard on tribunal. i dont know how other servers did it but there used to be a post called &quot;Pieces of Monkey Shit - Players to Avoid&quot; . some really fun shit used to be there but i cant find it anymore :p</div></div><hr />
