We have half our guild flagged for Kodtaz so far and thus i would like to ask some general information abt KD and above zones.<br />
<br />
1) Kod`taz : Apart from the 3 trials and collection quests, are there any instant target raid mobs around in this zone? I noticed a ring of summoner mobs in the zone as well, is this a raid event?<br />
<br />
2) Yxtta : Does being flagged for KD means we can enter Yxtta? Whats this zone about, trials ? or just straight forward raid mobs aka Primal stuff. <br />
<br />
3) Ikkinz : Are these the zones for trials 1 2 3 ? Is there raid event within Ikkinz?<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone who can share any information at all no matter how small . ~) cheerz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) The summoner event does require a raid, albeit not a huge one. Its part of the tasks required for access to the next progression zone (Qvic I believe) after you have completed the trials.<br />
<br />
2) Yes you can enter Yxxta. Yxxta does have some raid targets and exp areas.<br />
<br />
3) All the trials and raids (there are raids in Ikkinz you can access after completing the three trials and an npc given task to access them) take place in Ikkinz and the zone has the same layout for each trial and raid, just more of the zone is populated for the raids and bosses are in different spots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's the golem riddle ring in Yxxta which gets you access to a few boses through the stone wall. There's also a raid namer in a temple on the other side - forget the name but he drops PoT quality loots.<br />
<br />
There are also 4 instanced raids in Kod'Taz. First 3 become available when one person has done the extensive Kod'Taz quest involving all 3 single person expeditions as well as a load of nodrop collecting. The 4th raid instance becomes available once you've done the first 3. I believe these are now 54 person raids across all servers, though they're pretty easy<br />
<br />
After these 4 raids, noone knows. Assumed it's Uqua since that's the only place left to explore, but the jump in difficulty from Kod raids to Uqua raids is insane</div></div><hr />

Pixxt Suir Mindrider or something.<br />
<br />
There's also an event in the NW corner of Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />

That event is part of the flagging processes in order to get access to the Ikkinz raids.  However, it can be done just for loot, as it only takes mid-20's worth of people and the items that drop are Time P4-5 level quality, although you only get 1 at a time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quest for raid 4 is a small tradeskill combine thing that doesn't take long at all.  The quest to get the first 3 raids includes first winning the 3 group trials, then a shitload of collecting items and doing mini events, such as Pile of Bones, Summoner Ring, and the spawned event in the NW corner.</div></div><hr />

Even after the changes (ghosts finally despawning fairly quickly, max no of ghosts allowed, pets no longer hitting for 250 instead of 3k, and lowerd max hit of zone area mobs) I don't think this raid is possible.</div></div><hr />

You'll collect FOR THE MOST PART type 8 augs.  You'll get SOME type 8 gear, but not enough to aug, and you'll open a whole can of worms with issues of &quot;favoritism&quot; and all sorts of other bullshit by taking the logical step of giving people augs that have the gear to put them on.   Not to mention the fact that you're nowhere near close to ready to face the trials.<br />
<br />
Go kill Coir/Rathe, then go to Time, get onto your local server rotation and farm a little, farm Tipt/Vxed a little for some augs, do the Ferubi raid content... THEN come back and give Kod+ a whirl.<br />
<br />
Skipping progression is gay, particularly when you can't use half the crap you loot</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you like to fail over and over and get augs that you cant use go right ahead.  Kod = all slot 8 augs and you dont even have slot 8 gear or the hps to tank anything outside of mini named, however ill throw you a bone, should be able to beat pixxt priest summoner,,if you clear the first temple behind the human npc there is a pile of bones in the back..kill it the named and 4 guards spawn, all drop loot randomly, named always drops a tier 4 timequality item, we do him with 6 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ikkinz raid trials are pretty easy (least 1-3) if you could amanage to get someone flagged for them it would be worthwhile to do in days when your not pushing time (IE instead of farming elemnetals overa nd over for loot no one needs)</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh i think what i didnt mention is the fact that we are not focusing on kod`taz ! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
am just tryin to open up more zones to have fun in instead of pure ele farming <br />
:o <br />
<br />
and if gettin ppl into kod`taz means the chance  to get some time tier loots other than elemetnal zones..why not? :) <br />
<br />
we're a small number guild..average of 50+ ppl on normal day. not really ideal number for coirnav..rathe (possible), hence just like to see if kod`taz is doable..dont hate..  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrowsong</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">speaking of which...what is considered a good tank for kod`taz raids, ikkinz trials or yxtta raids?<br />
<br />
think our main tank has 11k - 2100AC atm. is that considered weak for those raid mobs stated? i know of another guild who have killed yxtta mobs etc...whose hp is similar and ac even lower ! just wondering</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">11k 2100AC is plenty, where you're going to have real issues is in the area of your casters' focus effects.   Again, it's POSSIBLE to pull it off, I don't know if the range on Pimal Splatterbug AE is tuned to pretty much require time level Extended Range foci, but it may be.   <br />
<br />
Time level clerics run OOM fairly regularly on trials even with time geared tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karekanoi96</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cleared first temple didnt see a pile of bones is that supposed to be a npc that spawns after clearing back room or always supposed to be up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrowsong</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we sorta..tried the event last night with 12 ppl or so....without a sk/mnk....warrior pulled =( .....cleared the front part of temple.....and moved in....final room had like 7mobs + Pile of Bones....killed 2...tried to pull another 2 and train ~ hu hu <br />
<br />
but anycase...am i right in saying, killing the pile of bones = spawning 4 guards + 1 named ?  and that these named shld pop inside the room with bones itself?  also do we need to clear ALL mobs in the temple? ( am assuming not ~ )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karekanoi96</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">spawned 4 gaurds and a named we killed 2 guards then everything despawned. Need sick dps to clear it fast if doing one group imo</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just beat the Kyv for the first time today, though I haven't finished all the trials.  3 successful Kyv kills have reasurred that it wasn't a fluke and that KT access isn't far off.  I have a slightly different interest in Kot`Taz.  I 2box a cleric fulltime, he's eligible for raid loot but on a very rare basis, and I work very hard on his gear outside raids.  To my knowledge KT access is another avenue for nonraid upgrades for my cleric and myself but I'm wondering how much in there is 1groupable for a midlevel EP guild singlegroup?<br />
<br />
EQ Loot Page (http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/) -&gt; Gates of Discord -&gt; Kod'Taz . . . how many of those mobs are 1groupable for a group of my guildies?(magelo of me and my cleric in sig, also planning on doing aug/gear farming before moving on and my cleric's &quot;Wishlist&quot; profile indicates an example of where I should be by the time we try Kod`Taz)  And finally is there stuff thats not listed there? I've seen links of some stuff supposedly dropping off trash that I don't see listed there but I'm not sure I trust the info.<br />
<br />
Any answers to the above would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your group beat 6 then you can kill any non-triggered names in Kod'Taz, most names excluding cragbeast rager and hynid howler spawn inside temples though, so you need a pulling class unlike trials 1-6.<br />
<br />
Darkwind's list is pretty good, but almost every named can drop any one of those augs and not just the ones they have listed per named. Would definitely be nice if Pixtt Venomblade dropped the 50/50/50 aug every time though :)<br />
<br />
A +35 endurance aug drops frequently also that they dont have listed and theres quite a few other names that arent listed that drop the same things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm i zoned in saw a ring of golems...what do we do with them?<br />
<br />
kill all to gain access? -o</div></div><hr />

It's a little tricky to figure out, so expect to spend some time there with a smaller group deciphering it before bringing a full raid.</div></div><hr />

did those 4 guards + 1named pop in the bones room? if so..instant ago ?  <br />
<br />
4 guards are instant aggro, named spawns on death of the 4th guards, all are mezz/snare/rootable.</div></div><hr />
