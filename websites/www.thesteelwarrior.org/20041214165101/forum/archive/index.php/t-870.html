<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's somepropositions about what devs can do about displines, while keeping in mind that discipline should not overpower us or trivialise (too much) the old content.<br />
<br />
1st proposition : Unhook discipline times.<br />
It could be a great idea, but very unbalancing against some encouters. for exemple any bossmob01, you engage him with Furious, you chain with Untouchable, then defensive... that is almost 20 seconds without any melee damage, solid initial aggro and defensive mitigation for 3 mins... unpraticable.<br />
So the idea is to unhook discipline by type :<br />
Long duration / short duration , or<br />
offensive / defensive <br />
<br />
2nd proposition : tune current disciplines :<br />
Some discipline are useless as they are, some others are just candy eye, and there is others we cannot use because the reuse time is waaay too long.<br />
- Resistant : every melee and hybrid got this one... However it is useless as it is, especially because resist were revamped. to justify the reuse time, this disc must give the equivalent of the level of the player in all resist (+65 to all at 65). so we may consider use it in certains situations.<br />
- Fearless : well no idea on this one.. I will never use it unless we can see &quot;so and so begins to cast fear&quot; :p.<br />
- Evasive : it's good as it is.<br />
- Defensive : good too.<br />
- Precise : well, this one is a sort of mini-aggressive.. I never seen the utility once I dinged 60. maybe reduce a lot the reuse time, and transform it in a 100% tactical mastery (well 100% with TM3)<br />
- agressive : this one need a reuse time very short too to be usefull... also retune the downside : getting hit for 1000 by a mob who normally hit for 800 is awful.<br />
- Charge, mightystrike : candyeyes... but a candy that can't let us use defensive for 30 mins is baaad, reduce reuse time<br />
- Furious, Untouchable : I think they are good as they are... but the reuse time is, again, too long.<br />
<br />
Also I think all the 3 minutes disc should be retuned to not have the downside anymore. it was needed for Kunark, it is no more.<br />
<br />
3rd proposition : Add new disciplines for 61-65 :<br />
Here's some idea :<br />
- disc level 61 : for 12 seconds you cannot be hit by any magic effect (heal included :p).<br />
- disc level 62 : for 3 minutes, all you ripostes will infict 4x damage, while all your parry and dodges have a chance to become ripostes.<br />
- disc level 63 : for 8 seconds, your weapon proc every swing.<br />
- disc level 64 : for 3 minutes, all magic damage will be reduced by 2/5.<br />
- disc level 65 : for 3 minutes, you will have the combined effect of both aggressive and defensive (long reuse time here :p)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Comment, flame, add, at will :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Put all the disciplines on separate timers with a general 1 minute reuse, thus they can't be chained.  That way, invulnerability can only be used once per hour but we aren't totally screwed either.<br />
<br />
You can pop off the eye candy just for fun and still have evasive/defensive usable a minute later.  Or if your cleric is asleep/sucks to high heaven you can punch riposte/invulnerability, buy yourself those precious seconds until they figure out where the heal hotkey is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err wait, it's fortitude, not untouchable..<br />
I may have used it only 1 time so... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synapticus</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea of being able to control a wepon proc.  it should be an skill-based ability, useable every 4-6 minutes, and allows a warrior to control at any moment a weapon's combat proc.  Quick skill-based ability to contribute to warrior aggro too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodheart</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fortitude is still useful for those latenight groups where the cleric begins to &quot;doze off&quot;.<br />
<br />
Although, the 50 min reuse time really is killer. Can handicap you pretty bad if you foresee an instance to use defensive/evasive =/. Good disc, just horrible reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dall18or</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deleate all warrior disciplines, they were a second hand patch to a wound in late kunark.......... the bandage needs to be removed and the wound needs to be sewn up, its been festering for to long. No disciplines period, fix the class itself.</div></div><hr />
