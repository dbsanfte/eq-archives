<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morticea</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently got a Crafted Wristband of Strife (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68766) during an Ikkinz Trial and I have been told that I need 'V3 Haste' to take advantage of the full 46% Haste.<br />
<br />
However no-one seems to be able to tell me which classes cast 'V3 Haste', and/or what spells I should be asking to be buffed with.<br />
<br />
Can anyone provide me with a list please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could be wrong, but I always thought V1 was item haste, V2 was spell haste, and V3 was bard haste.  In any case, I would be very surprised indeed to find that the bracer you got isn't just 46% haste straight up.  Telling you that you need some other kind of haste buff to take advantage of it sounds really hokey to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VeraagGoreblade</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">v0 is item haste, v1 is icon haste (spells, clickys, some songs), v2 is ervaj song line haste and v3 is vah shir/rizlona's line of bard songs. v0, v1, and v2 stack up to 100% and v3 is 'overhaste' and raises the haste cap by that percent and may also add that amount of haste. Been argued both ways and cant remember any definitive logs proving one way or the other.<br />
<br />
Since your bracer is 46% v0 haste, and say you have VQ which is 68% v1 haste, youd be at 114% haste which would be capped at 100%. If you had v3 haste, say Rizlonas, your haste cap would be raised to 130% and you would then get that extra 14%. Thats assuming Rizlonas doesnt also add 30% in which case the 14% from v0 and v1 haste is lost.<br />
<br />
So you may/may not need v3 haste to get the extra haste from your bracer depending on how you think v3 haste works.<br />
