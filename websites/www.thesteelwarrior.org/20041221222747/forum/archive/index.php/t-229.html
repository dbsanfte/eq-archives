After lurking for a couple years on the old boards,I come to you for some advice.I am a 61 war,fair to decent gear,but feel my HP's are way low.I have spoken to many warriors with HP's 5 or<br />
6k.I belong to a small guild,can usually only get 2 groups together at any one time,and I am the guilds only warrior.<br />
 I would like if you could look through my magelo profile and make any suggestions on what I can move up to,to be a batter main tank for my friends.I thank you all for your input and time.<br />

Crystal Spider eyes or Death mask of Eysian(sp) for Face<br />
Maybe some SS Armor MQ or even cultural armor.</div></div><hr />

Clattering Bone necklace for neck<br />
Maelstrom/Heiro cloak (Lodi sucks for warriors)<br />
If your on CoV faction, get some Draconic Pauldrons and a BoB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">or that too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gahid</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, you really do need some gear work :)<br />
<br />
First of all, get A Sandwich of Foul Smelling Herbs (5sta 50hp range slot) - it's no bow, but it's cheap and very nice for hp.<br />
<br />
Replace your IGS with Heavy Dragonwing Mantle or the such.<br />
<br />
Cloak of the Maelstorm &gt; Lodi Shield.<br />
<br />
As your sta is so low, I'd go with Crusty Greeves over Blood Runed. Don't laugh - the hp is well worth it, although the hit in AC is large.<br />
<br />
Beserker's Boots really suck, go with Dusty Soriz if I remember correctly (I've had Warlords for as long as I can remember)<br />
<br />
That Moktor Bracer is real ass. Get Silver Chitin Bracer and Bracelet of Fortitude - or even Bracer of Benevolence for a budget.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Gaunts are really bad. Go get some Hate ones, or if I remember any Velius quest ones (they all have nice hp+sta)<br />
<br />
Arms are tricky, as I can't find anything good. Sorry, but I've got no clue =( just do /baz and look for stuff with nice hp/sta/ac  for reasonable price, but those arms are really bad.<br />
<br />
For your neck, get a Tracking Wolf Collar. It owns.<br />
<br />
For your face get a Grobb Hide Mask. It's a Ykesha item, but it's common on Xegony and sells for 2k. It's great, having 35hp and 5 sta if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Your Helm is odd - I've never seen it, but I think it's pretty bad as I hardly ever fail taunt checks anyways. I can't recomend anything since I've been using Warlords forever, but I think it could be easily upgraded.<br />
<br />
For Earrings, get an Earring of the Solstice ASAP, then look for either a Pearly Sarnak Bauble or a Hammered Golden Hoop - in the mean time use something with +sta or Orc Fang.<br />
<br />
Your Magelo shows you as having no food, and if this is the case PLEASE get some. Grobb Liquidised Meat and Halas 10lb. Meat pies are great.<br />
<br />
I'd get rid of the Windblade and go for Snowchipper/Wavecrasher, but that's my twisted opinion (and I have never used/hate anyways Windblade).<br />
<br />
Another thing - stop wasting aa in Combat Fury and Combad Stability :p Get ND 3 and AE taunt asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinaden</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks to all for your input,I will do some trading out for some more HP items.I had a bad case of tunnel vision and going for as much AC as possible.<br />
As far as weapons,I love the windblade,but do have shortblade of lightning and a swiftblade of zek for 1hs.Also,i do stat foods,just did not bother too list it.<br />
Once again,thanks for your time and input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are very fortunate to have chosen Tribunal.  Please look into the cultural armor now.  It simply is some of the best easily obtained armor in the game.  Helanic Tundra bracer for example is 25AC, 5STA, 50HP, 5SV ALL iirc.  Fortunately this armor has been dropping in price as more people have the skill now to make it and blue diamond prices have dropped again.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Helanic Tundra to replace some of your bits is definitely an option.<br />
<br />
Other items to consider:<br />
<br />
Neck upgrade. Glimmering Mithril Torque is nice, but lacks hit points. Dragon Tooth Choker, or Clattering Bone Necklace are classics. I use the Qeynos Badge, because it was free, and I wanted a see invis item. But it too has 40 hit points on it. Always useful.<br />
<br />
On your back, a Pernicity Cloak or a Hierophant's Cloak would be good for hit points, but you'd lose the wonderful resists of the Lodi Shell. Still, HPs are what you're after.<br />
<br />
For the ear slot ... a Black Sapphire Electrum Earring, or a Wolf Fang Earing would be cheap alternatives to your Cougar Claw. More expensive ones are Mosquito Leg and Bloodmetal. OR you could camp the Mosquito Leg Earring, or quest the Solstice Earring.<br />
<br />
For your face slot, Crystal Spider Eyes, Death Mask of the Elysians, Horned Beetle Mask or you could quest the Draconic Mask of Enhancement or look for something really expensive like Amygdalan Chain Mask.<br />
<br />
Blood Runed Gauntlets would be a viable alternative to your Cobalt. Or Helanic Tundra. OR Myrmidon's.<br />
<br />
Your gear isn't too shabby. Just keep plugging along and you'll get some upgrades here and there. Don't fret too much.<br />
<br />
And BTW, LOVE the helmet! Sure, it's got no HPs but you know, that one's pretty rare and kinda cool. Wear it with pride!</div></div><hr />
