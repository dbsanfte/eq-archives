<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the one group DD Ikkinz trial tonight. Maybe I missed it in a patch message, but I had thought the &quot;Bouncing Aggro if Defensive is Used&quot; nerf was Vxed and Tipt only. Apparently not.<br />
<br />
While I saw no messages identifying me ( a bug? ), while Defensive was used aggro bounced all over the place. If a Cleric used DA, DD announced he wasn't going to waste his time......, etc.<br />
<br />
On the second attempt, without Defensive, it was very trivial.<br />
<br />
So, be warned - looks like the &quot;Bouncing Aggro if Defensive is Used&quot; nerf is in force in this trial as well, and with nothing (afaik) to alert the Warrior.<br />
----------------<br />
EDITED By me without being asked to remove comments about the developer's intellect and character that came up with &quot;Bouncing Aggro&quot;.<br />
<br />
Having the mobs in question ignore Defensive is one thing, but having aggro bounce is uncalled for pettiness. No stun immune mob DT's if you try to stun it - that's not how EQ in general works. The Bouncing Aggro sanction goes unnecessarily beyond rendering Defensive useless in these trials and makes it's use backfire on the user - for no good and fair purpose whatsoever.<br />

Grats on the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah thanks, the no message thing threw me and I hadn't encountered the change in action before. I thought this was just for mandatory individual flag trials. I don't keep track of where the Developers for no good reason change the rules to arbitrarily punish Warriors for being Warriors. And frankly, I don't expect fairly trivial content to DT my group just because I'm a Warrior that uses the ordinary tools of his class.<br />
<br />
I better leave it at that. No need for me to outhouse my own post by commenting on the obvious foolishness of the unknown individual that put into the game the bouncing aggro sanction which goes beyond merely making Defensive ineffectual.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yepper. By the time these changes went in, everyone I knew was through the one-group content and working on the guild raids. <br />
<br />
As far as I was concerned, the change was a monument to the pettiness of Knights (the loot sucks) and SoE's pandering to them (did Kether come up with the &quot;Bouncing Aggro&quot; *cough* fix?).<br />
<br />
Only helping a guildmate with the BiC quest brought me here after teh changes. And to think that at one time there was a thread here on successfully beating DD, giggle. Gimped content is teh win :D.<br />

<br />
It may have been 'gimped' and easy for you, but it was a seriously hard fought battle for my group.  We wiped plently of times before eventually pulling out the win.  Looking at your magelo I can see why it wasnt much of a challenge.</div></div><hr />

You stand toe to toe and hope you healers are good. (=</div></div><hr />

For DD?  Nadda damn thing.  =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least Evasive still works on Jhiru<br />
<br />
Has anyone else found this to be true?  I  thought stonewall, evasive, and defensive all caused the same aggro bounce result.  It would be odd for 1 of this disciplines to be left off one of the mobs.  That would require... effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fighting Jhiru I have used Stonewall on mutiple occations (6ish) since this nerf, all times with stonewall, and NP.  Never lost agro.<br />
<br />
DD is another story, stonewall kills the cleric fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and I dont understand why people are saying nerf, i've been doing DD atleast twice a week now for augs/bracers for guildies...Riposte disc+area taunt+defensive = aggro held.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm... Froggerx, do you get a message from DD about your defensive disc when you set it off?  Like Jhiru does when he's basically telling you he's going to go eat your groupies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used stonewall on DDand he ate my rogues then my shaman then my cleric...right after riposte disc + AE taunt. I wasn't aware of the aggro bounce thing and was completely boggled as to why I lost aggro wielding an A3 augd Bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
The second go was with a druid and cleric healer and we barely won...used fellstrike instead of stonewall that time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh because on single group stuff your dps actually could be important.  On a raid situation sure, mobility&gt;your dps but in a group situation you're still a fair fraction of the groups dps.</div></div><hr />
