First, how well do people think this would match up to BoW? (Yes I know its inferior to BoW, but was curious about opinions on the gap between the two)<br />

I currently have it augged with an anger 3, and also was wondering what people's opinions on this would be with regards to a raid situation/high dps group (i.e. necro, rogue, zealous wizard, etc)<br />
<br />
So far when I've used it in MPG I've been able to hold aggro consistently better than with my old BoC/GBoS, with WA5 figured in, as well as punishing blade 3. any thoughts on this would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Less stats (duh)<br />
<br />
Yak proc = ~450 aggro<br />
Eraging B.= 700 aggro<br />
<br />
Looking at the raw ratio it'll have a good bit less dps aggro as well.  It should be just fine for aggro though.  You can certainly make do with less aggro than a BoWar, though i really doubt it'll hold aggro better than BoC/GBoS + anger3 in each with WA5.<br />
<br />
Seeing as the perk to the BoWar is it's rather massive dps aggro (relative to that level of the game) i wouldn't place it quite in the same category as a BoWar by any means, especially considering the proc isn't as strong.  That said, i'm sure it will work just fine in groups and raids.  People have done more with less  :D , and it's nice to have a unique piece of weaponry.<br />
<br />
I'd use it for sure in xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try it and find out :)  I find that I typically use my obsidian greatblade in MPG and it does better with initial aggro than BOC/GBOS combo.  I don't usually use a 2 hander on a raid however since mine isnt as good as the bladebreaker.  However, I am tempted to one of these days just to see how it performs.<br />
<br />
Btw, how tough is the mob that drops the bladebreaker?  I haven't been able to find much info on this guy and have thought it would be a nice upgrade to my OG for a 2 hander.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I could tell Fried, he's not bad. Its simply having an enchanter or a rooter to control the add he/PH comes with. His room has 3 mobs in it (including him). In the center is the PH which is a huvul strategist. On his left (farther in) its an elite GoD mob (usually have seen kyvs and ukun, and ikaav occasionally) and on his right (about as far in as the elite GoD mob) is a dragorn (battlemaster from what I saw) More on the mob itself, he was no harder than his PH with defensive on. He was dead before defensive got to 40%, I would say he's easier than the elites are.<br />
<br />
We had the enchanter target the elite for the mez due to the stupid powerful chaos claws and the ranger to root the dragorn. When I pulled the PH (and the named as well) at level 68, the elite added but the dragorn did not, even though he was as far back as the elite was. Also, to get to him he's in the hexxagonal room in the complex near projection of body. Its quite a hike, but you can invis as far as the huvul that guards the path to enchainer kurou area. Then you have to pull the see invis dragorn wanderer so you can invis past the Possesed Brute. Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no experience with a BoW, but I have been quite pleased with my ability to hold aggro when using the mbb.  My dual wield combo isnt very good (fish sword + MoM) and so far the mbb holds aggro better than that combo.<br />
<br />
It's not the greatest for dps but it's got ok stats.  Holds aggro surprisingly well.  After I a3'd it, the necro I group with made the comment that he can use blood of thule and similar poison dots again w/o feigning, as compared to my dw combo, so it works for me :)</div></div><hr />
