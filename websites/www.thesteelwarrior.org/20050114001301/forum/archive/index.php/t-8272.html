<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is about to enter the Plane of Time, and lately we have been defeating the pantheons to finish off flags before we delve into a new adventure.  During the process, I've began to notice quite a disturbing trend.<br />
<br />
Where are the pant molds?!?<br />
<br />
On Sunday, we did a round robin of Fennin Ro, Xegony, and The Rathe Council all in one day.  Not a single pantheon kill dropped a leg mold.  In fact, in EVERY Xegony and Rathe Council kill, we have never received a leg mold.  We've only gotten leg molds on about half the kills on Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
Are we just unlucky?  Aren't leg molds supposed to drop pretty much every time with a pantheon kill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say you're entering Time, pant molds are Phase 3. More pants than you can imagine are headed your way like a freight train. You're gonna be buried under so many pant molds and patterns you wont see daylight.<br />
<br />
Guess what Im sayin is in a short time, everyone in your guild, your recruits and flagged twinks will have a pair :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xegony always put out on plate pants for my guild, Fennin rarely dropped pants and neither Nav or Rathe ever did - guess its pretty random.  Phase 3 in time is definately the place to get pants at discount prices.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iyacc@work</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coirnav - 1 kill 0 pants<br />
Xegony - 2 kills 1 pants<br />
Fennin - 20? kills, probably like 7 or 8 pants<br />
<br />
We're about 1 for 3 on average. <br />
<br />
Like all our other molds/patterns, we mostly get plate though.<br />
<br />
plate &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the gods are about 1/5 on legs, or so I hear.  We have killed Fennin twice and got chain legs both times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stemcell</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like fennin ro drops pants more often than any other Elemental God<br />
<br />
Coirnav 7 kills 1 pair<br />
Rathe 5 kills 1 pair<br />
Fennin Ro 37 kills 22 pairs<br />
Xegony 7 kills 3 pairs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decaillin</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have the numbers since our DKP site is down atm, but we had most of our legs drop from Fennin (mainly silk/chain/leather...plate was rare with him). Xegony was our best source of plate legs pre-time, and Coirn/Rathe never dropped any for us as far as I know. <br />
<br />
But like Tima says, youll have multiple pairs dropping in Phase 3 each week, so dont give up =p</div></div><hr />
