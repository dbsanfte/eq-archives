<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, here I am Monday and Tuesday playing in PoD.  I am only 53rd lvl so for me it just gets more and more difficult to hold agro the deeper we get.  Anyways, we get to the camp we call “Stairs” which are simply just the stairs on the way up to Grimme or whatever that fatty’s name is.  So here I am talking to my friends etc, taking the advantage that we’re using our SK to tank because he’s 60 and agro control.  We are always looking for a way to work together so I start practicing weapon skill etc… suddenly someone says, Dude, the mob looked at you for a second.  I’m like whaaa?  I equip Frosty/Barny axe taunt taunt taunt proc proc proc taunt taunt proc proc, to no avail mob won’t look at me.  I shrug it off and equip ToD to keep that 2hb up for my GsoT, miss, miss, 187, mob turns.  I am baffled at the power 2 handers have even when they have ridiculously large delays.  To keep a long story short, I have found that just about any 2 hander I have, but particularly the ToD kick complete ass for holding agro and taking it etc… Whats my point?  Just sharing my story hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've noticed that my Weighty Polearm (29/34) that i got for 40pp in the bazaar holds aggro much better than dual lammies or lammy/Venemous axe, even procing 3-5 times a fight.   The funny thing is my 2hs skill is only around 90 so I whiff alot.  Similar situation as yours, had a higher lvl SK tanking so was practicing my 2h skills and i took aggro every fight.  he was using shield/1h combo and typical snare/dot + hate on pull to snap aggro from the puller.  i never used taunt at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bought a GsoT last week to build my 2hb from skill level of 59. I started in HoH as MT in a guild grp with them not knowing what I was doing. I was easily able to keep aggro and to build my 2hb skill up. Nice thing I was in HoH for about 2hr and built my 2hb from 59 to 219. I almost never user GsoT though unless I am not MT'n. Sometimes though when I am MT I use it but only after I got considerable aggro from BoC and then only to reduce dmg taken by me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Frostreaver was KILLING my 2hs Epic for agro in PoV the other day. Guy wasnt taunting or anything.<br />
