<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We are heading in to do Carprin Cycle this weekend in CoD.  I'd greatly appreciate some links to guides or words of wisdom from you all.<br />
<br />
From reading up on Allak i understand that you agro Carprin and 3 mobs spawn around him.  You then need to kill all 3 and not Carprin.  Then Carprin despawns and respawns at zone in.  You kill him and then the next mob in the cycle spawns somewhere else.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in strats to get the 3 mobs to raid without the first instance of Carprin.<br />
I'd like to know how to avoid the 3500/5000hp lifetaps.  Chain Rune and super high bardly given MR?<br />
Are the rest of the mobs in the cycle perma rooted?   Allak seems to indicate that at least one is.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pull em with pacify or whatever else. the dude plus his guards would be suicdal he has pretty high dps. If you pull him and guards do not try to kill him instead kill the guards since each dead guard reduces his hp total by alot iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a lot of info on the Safehouse you should look at. I'll give you the highlights for each:<br />
<br />
0) Keep MR up and have a bard singing PoV in your group for all of these. Some don't need it, and you can optimize what the bard sings once you know what's really going on. Enough of them lifetap for 1500 or 5000 (yes, 5000) that you kinda want it.<br />
<br />
1) Carprin -- we usually do it at the zonein, monks have no problem splitting him off his guards. Be ready for his respawn of course, usually someone dies when he pops, but he's not too hard. I forget if he rampages or not, it doesn't matter tho.<br />
<br />
2) Avri somethingorother. This dude spawns 4 skeletons every time a player dies or feigns, or every time a pet dies. Agro control has to be 100% locked down. He's rooted, and he rampages. Often you'll find some skeletons around from folks failing, or from monks feigning around him. They depop after 20 or 30 minutes. He has low HP, so you can burn him down as long as you keep agro locked so that no one dies. Our first win on him was during a wipe, so that's possible, but he's far far easier if you just control agro and do it right.<br />
<br />
3) Bishop Whoever. Rooted, don't think he rampages, not too hard. Killing him spawns the next three.<br />
<br />
A brief note about this. Raex and Vindor (Raex especially) are tough mofos. You should probably clear the entire room there before you spawn them, otherwise get ready for a lot of monk/sk drags (if you have many bards, maybe they can make it all easier with FM). Splitting Raex from Vindor is a learning process. You do NOT want to try them both at once, at least not your first few times through.<br />
<br />
4) Vindor BlahBlah. Slowable, flurries, not too bad. Your best tank should not tank this one, since Raex is next.<br />
<br />
5) Raex KillsALot. Not slowable, hits for 1700, rampages, 5k lifetap. You want your best tank on him. It's possible to do him before Vindor, just depends on how your pullers split it. You definitely want to know when he's coming. This guy is no pushover, he has enough HP to make agro lock a necessity, and the rampage can wipe you fast.<br />
<br />
6) High Priest Ultor. The reason you're here, he's a pushover after Raex. Rooted, procs a 90% slow. You need someone (two someone's?) chain-casting Abolish Disease on you, because it's 36 counters.<br />
<br />
Just did this again last night for the 7th  time, so I'm pretty fresh on it. Eventually it gets real boring, although Raex is always a nice kick in the ass ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hear this event doesn't drop loot either. That kinda sucks for all the effort and risk involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Caprin Cycle drops loot, your Alts will rejoice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make mob HP = 0 before raid hp = 0.<br />
<br />
If you can't figgure it out, why are you there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Every single boss drops a piece of loot :p.  Most of it sucks I got the Bracer from there like 25AC 45HP and some other stats.  Loot just isn't great but every boss drops something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Splitting Raex from Vindor is a learning process. <br />
<br />
They split themselves.  Patience is a virtue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You might want to get a few Enc / Nec pet for carprin, usualy the 1st Carprin fight are somewhat bloody.<br />
I believe Carprin proc are lure, as well as Vindor, but it's easy to resist Raex proc with a bard in MT grp (he rampages also, so set rampage properly if you don't want your bard to die 1st). Vindor can be fully (or mostly) slowed, so it's not hard.<br />
<br />
The second name, the best thing to do your first try is to just wait that the skellies in his room depop (~20mn after carprin death), and pull the rest of the room, once skel depoped.<br />
<br />
As far as spliting Raex &amp; Vindor, yeah just sit and wait 10 mn, et voila, they are splited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luthair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Skeleton adds can pop after Avhi's death if other skeletons are still up.  (ie, couple die to enrage and next thing you know 16 skeletons running around can turn into 60 skeletons running around...)<br />
<br />
All in all the cycle is pretty easy, and the info in the safehouse thread is more than enough to beat it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For caprin the one thats up is fake, pull him and 3 guards spawn - split those on death of third he spawns right there as event one. Buff up MR for Caprin, Vindor, Raex they all proc hugfe lifetaps. Caprin doesnt rampage. Avhi just clear the room and set rampage before engage, face him towards back wall and have everyone at max range and use pets. If you havent learned how to use pets on mob spawning bosses you shouldnt be at Caprin ). Bishop is rooted and u can preslow without even malo hes a joke. Vindor will path away alone and u can single pull those , Vindor flurries and has that tap. Raex rampages and has the huge tap, HP ultor is rooted unslowable and flurries one shaman can easily cure MT he doesnt proc it much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just about all lifetaps in this game save at MR - 200.  Get 500 MR and more is better (some people say resist past 500 still count at 1/4th value, no idea how they'd test something like that).  Other than the various 3.5-5k taps they're pretty standard MT encounters, minus the Avri one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah skeleton can still pop if someone dies to Ahvi, the problem we had our first kill was that a puller or someone managed to die when we were pulling the skel and then you have 6 to 12 skel in Ahvi's room. <br />
The best was when a shaman sent AA pet in front of Ahvi's enrage...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bakkal2003</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We use Paladins to tank the Life Tappers in Carprin/Bertox cycle.  Sanctuary is good for this.  We tank switch once normally before we've blown them up.  Typically no deaths.  When we started we were using Pets to tank them, but that was before Pet healing/aggro was nerfed.  Paladins work well. Lock a Paladin or 2 on them and have everybody burn like hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Carprin lifetaps for 3500.  Vindor and Raex lifetap for 5000.  It's freaking mean as hell, but if you have max MR, they don't even land.  Best thing to do is get a bard in the group playing Psalm of Veeshan.  <br />
<br />
Also, these guys are EVASIVE folks.  They cannot proc their lifetaps on you if they miss you.  The fellow warriors in my guild keep going defensive and they just keep getting mowed down like no tomorrow, and this is with 8-9 clerics spamming quick heals.  No amount of cleric healing power is enough to keep up with dual 5k lifetaps going off in one round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for all your info everyone.  Another question about obtaining the flag.  You kill the six named.  A final named spawns (Tarkil Adan), you hail him and you get the flag.<br />
<br />
1. Do you have to be in the raid to get the flag?<br />
2. How many flags will Tarkil Adan give out before he despawns?<br />
3. How long do you have to hail Tarkil Adan before he despawns?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
<br />
Hittem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Obviously no pets on Avri.  True story:  The second time I have ever done that ring a brilliant wizard sent in his swarm of sword pets and, well, enrage...50 gazillion skellies, wipe.  Believe it or not you actually have to tell some people this, intelligence should never be taken for granted...<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1. Do you have to be in the raid to get the flag?<br />
<br />
Pretty sure yes<br />
<br />
2. How many flags will Tarkil Adan give out before he despawns?<br />
<br />
Think 36, most pps give 72, this is one of the few that doesnt.<br />
<br />
3. How long do you have to hail Tarkil Adan before he despawns?<br />
<br />
Last few times he seemed to stay up a long time, like 10+ minutes.  Seems like some pps despawn pretty quickly, while others will stay up for long periods of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">only had one person get it who wasnt in raid . he claimed he hailed and got it, ran in sos after everyone was already gone.<br />
<br />
this isnt even required flag but its pretty hard to get someone down to the lower lvl without it. even if they do get down, they added some code so you get kicked to zone in a minute.<br />
<br />
its really silly they dont allow a share flag down like they do to solros chamber. we have managed to get 2 ppl flagged who didnt have the key since they had a minute to hail the pp using a mob to summon them down, little harder now with LoS rules but doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have been told you can't get into CoDb with the 85% rule.  I was on a raid and got left in CoD as i could not click in with the rest of the raid to go kill Bert.<br />
<br />
Its a key, not a flag was what i was told - thus no 85% thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Since you can damn near resist 100% of the taps with 500MR, Evasive gives no advantage to the well prepared that defensive doesn't supercede.<br />
<br />
Group with a bard, get GoD and use defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hehe, after doing the Carpin cycle many times we tried it with no bard.  Definitely makes it more interestisng (painful).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You can get the Tarkil flag without being in the raid. I've done it twice on an alt cleric and necromancer. Both times, after the raid TL'd, I DA'd (necro equivalent) all the way there and hailed the mob just as DA wore off. Easier/safer if you can get a selo's outside beforehand.<br />
<br />
Doing Carprin without a bard would be... mmm... hard? ;)</div></div><hr />
