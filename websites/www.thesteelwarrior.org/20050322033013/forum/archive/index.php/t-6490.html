I found Talwin's Remains in barindu, though a named saw through invis. Was guessing he was like the smith? =\</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't make sense, either. Vxed is incredibly easy, just takes a bit of time to kill the required # of trash to finish. Tipt is tougher, but if someone can't beat Tipt, I'm not sure what they'd be expecting to do in Kod`Taz and beyond other than a corpse run, save for maybe slowly plucking off a couple useless trash mobs near the ZI.</div></div><hr />

There's a reason only two guilds on our server are raiding in Kod'taz now, and that's it in a nutshell.<br />

Equiping their twinks in elemental due to constant respawn most likely. =D</div></div><hr />

We tried it once, some things happened with the elf-looking NPCs and they all died, so we lost.  The information on what you're supposed to do is quite vague.  It's probably easier (and more rewarding) do just do the final 2 trials for access to Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />
