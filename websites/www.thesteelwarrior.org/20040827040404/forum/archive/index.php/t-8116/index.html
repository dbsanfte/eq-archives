<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been this way for a while, but I never really thought it effected much.  Monks can cast their lul on PC's.  When they do this the icon shows up in your discipline window and the player emotes something like &quot;Soandso looks around, very confused.&quot;  The monk laughs and does it again and again just joking.  Well this joke got me killed tonight.  Fighting in Qvic we had several mobs in camp, I AET'd and started taking a ton of dmg.  I hit Fortitude, got message &quot;You are already in a disc(something like that)&quot; looked up and I had the monk lul in my disc slot.  *Splat* I die, then start yelling at the monks. :P  Dunno if one of em did it on purpose just fuckin with me or by accident, but this needs to be fixed.  I did a /bug and /feedback so maybe they will see it.<br />
