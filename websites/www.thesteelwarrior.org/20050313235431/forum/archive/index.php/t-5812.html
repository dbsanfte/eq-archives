<br />
seems there is  a passworded one. Is this a channel that originated from here? invite only?</div></div><hr />

To be honest we did open it up some a few months ago but it rapidly regenerated into TSW2 which isn't the idea of it. If you looking to join best thing I can say is while a lot of us no longer join TSW on a regular basis we do have some people there and they tend to keep eye open for ele (well time flagged is generally min now) warriors who seem to talk a load of sense. Also posting here will get you noticed and a possible invite. Please tho don't start spamming people like myself for an invite - I have a big ignore list I can fill if people start doing that, and am sure the other mods do as well.<br />
<br />
Mainly tho its not super secret stuff like strategies bandied around - but we do try and keep the discussions aimed at the high end raid stuff - well apart from discussions on how the french suck, and on how Chatja sickens us etc.... :)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't see the need to clutter forums or chat just for name recognition, but my interest is sparked again for the Overlords channel.  I don't join TSW anymore because its just spam with few uses beyond item links, and I'm certainly not interested in grandstanding or eliteism.  I know my stuff, and I'm to a point where I need ligitimate discussion of the high end game, and don't try and feed me the crap about needing the Time flag.  EP and above flags are 90% politics, 10% ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overlord, originaly, was a channel for friends who were all on tsw, all part of high end guilds, and who were fed up of the inane babble and the spam that was starting to show up at the time. So we created the channel. Guildmates of members started to learn about it, friends of members too, so we invited them, and we now have a regular pop of 25 people during primetime, we get 1 or 2 new people a month.<br />
We did open it once, we got 20 tells, the channel turned to shit and spam so the channel remains closed now.</div></div><hr />

It helps if you can some idea of what to do but no amount of understanding of the game will make the mob actually hit you for less when it's your turn to tank.  Our job is to absorb damage, and being able to absorb damage is a function of your gear, not your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kurghann</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mhhh tanking is much more than having hp and ac and hate procs ... it s also positionning a mob , taking care of your aggro range ,  use the right weapons for the right situation ( aggro dps rampage tank ) , it s being able to pick a target fast , faster than anyone around , assisting the chanter who said  &quot; NOT MEZZABLE TARGET PLZ TANK IT &quot; aggro it fast save the chanter using shield to save his arse , save clerics with shield too , jump on adds aggro em and call em for chanters to mez etc etc etc .. etc etc etc so no being a good warrior isn t having ac hp aggro ... only ... if you don t know that already why are you posting on overlord thread and go post on i m a noob warrior # 2900992928  board . no offense here but being a warrior isn t all about gear ... even being a main tank isn t all about gear it s a lot about skills and experience too . warrior class isn t get 2500 AC and  a DBoW and Raex BP  press attack / incite / taunt and go afk sorry ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good idea on how to position a targer, how to maintain your agro, how to target a mob quick and easy, how to follow instructions, How to not get agro(JIC you are not MT) etc. Gear plays a big roll in the warrior class, i agree with that.. But it doesn't make the warrior a good warrior. it makes him a Well Equiped Warrior, who might know wtf he is doing, or might not..<br />
<br />
Now, how all this relates to getting into a semi-exclusive club of warriors, who don't want to deal with the shit that goes on in TSW(Rap,GINK,Vadd CHestplate link x1000,etc) I really don't know. As much as any warrior who isn't in the channel, iw ouldn' mind getting in so i could talk to warriors who know what they are doing, and Who don't spam my chat with stupid chit for 30minutes.. But, O'well, maybe, maybe one day i Might get an invite, until then. I have to deal with the normal TSW tards &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Can't you handle being faced with the irony of your own clueless shit? Get a gripe, the game is easy, talking with the ubers and sucking them off won't get you anywhere.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps if you read the posts, with a tiny weeny bit of Objectivity, you might not be making the replies I am reading here.  Btw &quot;get a gripe&quot; ?  The one thing I ask is if you are going to flame at least don't sound like an idiot in the process.  You're a disgrace to trolls, go back to trolling school and come back when you can cause some damage.<br />
<br />
Timeline:<br />
<br />
A) Channel hints at &quot;Elite&quot; nature, therefore unintentionally implying that if you are not in the channel, you suck.<br />
B) I say I'd love to chat with one of these &quot;elite&quot; to see just how elite they really are.  If they really are elite(or more elite then me), maybe I can learn something.  I'm not above learning.<br />
C) Someone says it's mainly for mature people.  No longer an elite channel.<br />
D) I am content.<br />
E) Troll who half reads posts (Thats you ogre), posts thoughtless replies that I am only dignifying with a reply because my server is down right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll add if I was insulting well equiped warriors I would be insulting myself.  I was only insulting well equiped warriors that have gotten lazy/spoiled and forgotten their tricks/tactics/dexterity but believe themselves to be elite because they have the most HP etc.<br />

Clearly this is the only piece of logic I have on the topic.<br />

&quot;It's also painfully clear to me, that you're insulted, when you're not included with the in crowd!&quot;<br />

Not insulted as I said in my previous post that you probably skipped over, I really don't want the extra spam.<br />

That's why, when you see those 11k-12k+ warriors, they usually have a pretty damned good sense of how to play their class, and why they get invited to the overlord channel.<br />
<br />
It's not a hard logical process to follow.<br />
<br />
Person_01 plays their class well and plays alot;<br />
Uber_Guild_01 needs a good person of that class;<br />
Person_01 joins Uber_Guild_01, and soon becomes &quot;Uber&quot;.<br />

-  The uberguild doesn't know this for sure.  It's much easier to see who is good at their class in God however.  There are some people who are good at some things and awful at others.</div></div><hr />

Is it so you can have an extra chat channel when you are bored or is it becouse you think you are &quot;uber&quot; enough so that you can teach all the others how to play a warrior?<br />
<br />
As i see it the channel is for the high end warriors in the game.<br />
Just becouse its calld overlord chat doesnt meen that all the 65warriors in the game should have access to it.<br />
What can a 65 warrior that are raiding BoT nameds bring to the high end warriors? What can I, an EP warrior bring to the high end warriors?<br />
Not a damn thing would be my best guess, and thats why neither you or me is in the channel.<br />
We cant bring any information about Time tanking and we cant help in GoD with the new things they do.<br />
Do i care? No.<br />
I find all the information i need by just reading The steelwarrior or try stuff out myself.<br />
<br />
I see 2 things you can do right now if you still arnt happy.<br />
<br />
1) Become a warrior in a high end guild. Bust your arse to get there. Casual players probebly doesnt have to bother. All tho, being in a high end guild probebly doesnt give you a free ticket in.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
2) Start your own channel for all the lvl 65(or lower if you wish) warriors in the game so that you get your extra channel for chat or information.<br />
<br />
Personally im just going to keep search the net for the information i need.<br />
<br />
PS. Im a Swede so english isnt my first language. Sorry for any typos there might be in the text.</div></div><hr />

  B) I say I'd love to chat with one of these &quot;elite&quot; to see just how elite they really are. If they really are elite(or more elite then me), maybe I can learn something. I'm not above learning.<br />

I really don't know how some people keep up with so many chat channels. Between group, guild, and raid I have enough spam.  <br />
<br />
Hehe, I hear that.  I knew the password to the overlord channel for many months but maybe logged into it once or twice for 5 minutes just to see who was in it.  Same reason I never join the normal steelwarrior channel.  I have 3 autojoin channels, plus 2-4 more on raids, not to mention group, raid, and guildchat.  Frankly I'm out of colors, and have plenty of spam on my screen without any cross-server channels no matter how leet they are.  I was slightly disappointed when they changed the password because now where am I going to get DBotW links?<br />
<br />
Also since my server switch I don't qualify as uber any more, and usually when I joined the channel it had Chatja in it, which is a major turn-off.</div></div><hr />

Hehe I know how that is.  I'll probably just stick to reading this board.  The area I lack knowledge in is mostly the stuff that is semi-code related.  Though there are some neat ideas I see thrown around here like the one guy that suggested throwing on the shield when defensive fades.</div></div><hr />
