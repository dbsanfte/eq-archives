[Fri Oct 01 03:32:32 2004] You say, 'Hail, Trelak'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:32 2004] Trelak says 'Greetings stranger. What can I, Trelak do for you? Surely you are the strangers that I have heard whispers about . . . the ones that have struck back against our enemies? Perhaps we can aid each other? I am an armor smith that has crafted many fine pieces for the more prestigious officers in the dragorn militia. Many of these pieces have unique magical qualities that I crafted into them. If you are [willing] to recover them, I can recapture most of this magic and create new pieces for you.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:42 2004] You say, 'willing'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:42 2004] Trelak says 'Good, very good. When The Darkening came upon us, I could see by the ferocity and viciousness of the invaders that they would not be easy to defeat. So I took as much as I could and hid out here preparing for the time when our warriors would have need of me. If you help me, I will craft superior pieces of plate armor fit for our mightiest fighters for you. I can provide a [helm], [sleeves], [bracers], a pair of [gloves], a [breastplate], some [leggings], and a pair of [boots].'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:49 2004] You say, 'helm'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:49 2004] Trelak says 'Before I can make you a plate helm worthy of Makyah himself, I will need you to bring me some food. I was so busy with taking all of my tools that I did not have time to stock myself with enough sustenance to see me through this ordeal. From time to time I have seen kvy archers eating from a small food sack. I think if you bring me two of these sacks I can continue my work for quite awhile. Your main task though will be to bring me a certain piece of metal I have long had my eye on. There was a certain dragorn elder by the named of Patorav, a wiser and kinder noble did not exist. Wherever he went, he always carried with him a fine [walking stick].'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:51 2004] You say, 'walking stick'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:51 2004] Trelak says 'This was no ordinary walking stick. The top held a jewel of some mystery for I would always see Patorav whispering to it, but I am more interested in the bottom tip, for it you see was sheathed in a strange metal. I witnessed Patorav striking the ground with the tip only to see it penetrate any surface it encountered. The hardest stone, the most durable metal, nothing could withstand his walking stick. Thus, I have always held an interest in it as the enchantments contained therein may prove to be beneficial to my craft. Though Patorav fell during the noble's march through the causeway, his stick may yet exist. Find it and bring it back with the food and I'll reward you.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:54 2004] You say, 'sleeves'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:54 2004] Trelak says 'Though I managed to bring nearly all of my tools before the Muramites overran our lands, I did forget to bring the enchanted tongs my mentor gave me. I secretly returned only to watch the Muramites destroy my shop and steal what was left. I saw the leader of this pack of dark thieves place my tongs in an embossed leather sack . . . Which was probably stolen as well. I want you to bring me this sack so I may retrieve my tongs and perhaps other possessions he stole from me. I also want you to repay those brutes for wrecking my shop and home. Bring me back two noc right hands so I know they will no longer steal from me or my people ever again.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:59 2004] You say, 'gloves'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:00 2004] Trelak says 'One of my people's most famous warriors was Makyah the Fierce, who had no equal when it came to the battle arts. Enemies would routinely pause momentarily when he strode upon the field. After the portal exploded though, no trace of Makyah was found. I am more interested in his axe though, which may yet hold salvation for my people. It is my hope that the enchantments and techniques used to create the axe might be used for other purposes. Find and return Makyah's axe to me so I may use it to help my people. To remove the enchantments properly though, I will also need two yearning crystals. With the proper ceremony, gems such as these can be used to transfer charms from one object to another. Come back when you have recovered these and I will give you a pair of gloves that I was crafting in honor of a dragorn elder.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:04 2004] You say, 'leggings'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:04 2004] Trelak says 'When I tried to go back to my shop to retrieve my tongs, I found it overrun with a mob of thieving Muramites. At that moment I, a mere smith, vowed revenge for destroying what it took me a lifetime to build. I did not know how or when I would accomplish this until I crossed paths with you. You will be my instrument, exacting the revenge I cannot achieve on my own. Find the leader of this particular group of Muramites and repay it ten fold. Return to me with the medal it smugly wore -- a medal it no doubt stole from some other hapless dragorn. You also must bring me three blackened discordling tails as proof that the rest of this group has been slain as well. Do this and I will give you a pair of plate leggings that I have been working on for some time now.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:34:16 2004] You say, 'breastplate'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:34:16 2004] Trelak says 'Many good friends and loved ones perished in the invasion. One of my good friends was a famous hunter, Jayruk. He and I went on many hunting expeditions together protecting our lands from some of the more wild and dangerous beasts. I was not skilled enough to take care of a bazu mind you, but at least I could remove the threat of a few murkgliders. Jayruk, however, had no equal. I could regale you for hours of tales of how he narrowly escaped death, but I shan't waste time. Simply know that I wish to pay my respects to my good friend and for this I require the hunting vest he so loved. I will also need three dragorn ceremonial candles too. Return to me with the vest and the three candles and I will give you a plate breastplate that I was crafting for myself. '<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:15 2004] You say, 'boots'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:15 2004] Trelak says 'As much of my customers were dragorn warriors, over time I came to befriend many of them. Though most of them perished during the fighting, some were captured by the Muramites and tormented in their Proving Grounds. This was once a serene place where our elders would meditate . . . A place of peace and tranquility that my people looked toward Dranik's spirit for guidance. Now it is a place inhabited by the foulest horrors where resistant dragorns are tortured. One such dragorn was a noble warrior named Ethask. Thrown into the labyrinth unarmed, he fought off a horde of discordlings and kyvs, breaking their bodies with his bare hands. Seriously wounded, he still managed to find an exit through sheer force of will. Just as he was about to exit that black pit, a soaring [Muramite] cowardly struck him down from behind. Mortally wounded with the axe still lodged between his shoulders, Ethask crawled through the exit only to perish on the other side.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:58 2004] You say, 'muramite'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:59 2004] Trelak says 'I know little of this particular Muramite save that he received a medal for his dastardly deeds. Find and slay this Muramite so the spirit of Ethask may find the peace it longs for. Return once you have done this with the Muramite Cruelty Medal as proof that this monster shall trouble my people no more. Also bring me two kyv hunter rings to celebrate Ethask's victories.'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If i had to guess, the core item for the items will prob be found in anguish.

<br />
There are a few NPCs in Dranik too. Maybe there are lesser quality quested armor, being the one already mentioned the best.<br />
<br />
I hope they did like Velious and have different difficulty quests, I really wouldnt mind doing them if they are attainable by my family guild or casual group of friends, even if its the lowest of all the quests.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that is the bard finished result.<br />
Really curious about these set armors now :p</div></div><hr />

According to alla's, Velitorkin drops Dragorn Elder Sceptre http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31691 .<br />
<br />
Maybe this is the 'walking stick'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That is for leather class BP<br />
These items are statring to roll in, avg stats put them somewhere between ornate and Ep pattern as per quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am still not warmly with Dranik Loyalists yet, so I cannot make progress on these quests.  I hardly hunt in any zone besides mpg, and not every mob in there gives the correct faction, so it is slow going.<br />
<br />
Anyone know the bracer text from the npc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have been aimiable for weeks, and I try to kill mobs for faction every day and turn in stuff for faction whenever i get the chance.  I had forgotten how much faction can suck.<br />
<br />
Anyway...WTB bracer text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This has got to be a higher-tiered armor quest.<br />
<br />
Chain, Leather, and Silk all require mostly the same parts and they appear to be way easier to obtain then the ones in the quests on this thread.  For intsance, none would require anything more than a group - and certainly not a level 85 raid mob.   Only plate has not yet found their quest guy for the tier 1 armors it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Chain has found their NPC for this (the higher level) quest. <br />
<br />
Would be great if someone would get the bracer text for this, and find our &quot;lesser&quot; quest NPC.<br />
<br />
The easier quests also require just Warmly faction, and the harder quests require Ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zaqs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Q: There is a guy named Tibor a short distance east of Korbuk in Dranik's scar, has anyone tried him yet?<br />

A: Yep - it's the guy for chain tier2 quest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zaqs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Humm, found a post on allakhazam stating that Vorkiev in Nobles causeway is the tier1 quest npc for plate, someone with high enough faction check it out please ? thanks :)<br />

Zone: Nobles Causeway <br />
NPC: Vorkiev <br />
Location: pos 1358, pos 1030 <br />
<br />
Faction: Draniks Loyalist, need warmly or better! <br />
<br />
He doesn't respond to me about the quests, but he IS the guy for Tier 1 Plate based armor, he wants the same RARE no drop items as the other Tier 1 armor quests....</div></div><hr />

[Wed Oct 20 16:59:43 2004] You say, 'Hail, Vorkiev'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:43 2004] Vorkiev says ''Hello, Kurim.   I am Vorkiev, a former smith of Dranik.  Word of your battles against the Muramites has passed from ear to ear across Kuua.  You bring hope to the dragorn who long to be free from the shadow of Mata Muram!  Perhaps we can be of [service] to one another?' '<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:46 2004] You say, 'service'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:46 2004] Vorkiev says ''A decade ago my forge created great suits of armor to protect Kuua's strongest warriors.   When the Muramites came, however, they sought to conscript me to make armor for their captains.  Rather than comply, I fled into the wilderness to live as an exile.  I have no regrets about my decision, but I do long for the old days, back when the land was green and the dragorn stood side by side against their enemies, instead of kowtowing to these forsaken Muramites.  There many tasks I need accomplished that I am unable to see through myself due to my exile.  If you can help me, I can reward you with finely crafted plate armor for your [hands], [wrists], [arms], [head], [chest], [legs], or [feet].  What say you?''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:12 2004] You say, 'hands'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:12 2004] Vorkiev says ''I appreciate your enthusiasm.  Be careful though, this will not be easy for I require a rare item that is entrusted only to the Muramite captains.  Harbinger's Spire was once a dragorn lookout tower which Mata Muram has since claimed and bent to his own purposes.  He uses the spire as a beacon to receive news on his domain.  Some of his captains possess infused crystal shards which can be used to send messages from Harbinger's Spire.  If you can capture one of these infused spire control shards along with the satchels of two discordling messengers, it may disrupt the Muramite chain of command long enough to afford me a chance to return home for a day.  I have not seen many of my kin since The Darkening fell upon Kuua and I long to know if any of them are still alive.  Recover these items for me and you shall be rewarded with my finest plate gauntlets.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:53 2004] You say, 'wrists'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:53 2004] Vorkiev says ''Did you know that dragorns were created by the death of a single dragon named Dranik, the great father?  The first dragorn to walk Kuua created many things in his honor.  Among these creations was a fearsome battle standard painted with a drop of blood from each of Dranik's firstborn sons.  The last dragorn armies to carry the banner fell to the Muramites.  No one can say where the Blood Standard of Dranik has gone, but the recovery of such an artifact would leave me in your debt.  Return with this banner along with two Ashlock branches, so I can remake the haft.  From there, I can reward you with a powerfully crafted wristguard.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:03 2004] It begins to rain.<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:32 2004] You say, 'arms'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:33 2004] Vorkiev says ''The armies of Mata Muram are but one aspect of Discord's deep shadow.  The Darkening ravaged not only the denizens of Kuua, but the landscape as well.  Many of our old landmarks no longer stand and the sky -- once blue and vast -- now seethes with ash and storms.  If you can find a map of Old Kuua, one drawn before the coming of Discord, I will be in your debt.  Return with this map along with two ukun quills so I can take notes on the map.  My exile is long and there is no end in sight.  I would like to reorient myself out here in the wilderness.  Do this for me and I can reward you with some of my finely crafted arm guards.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:11 2004] You say, 'head'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:12 2004] Vorkiev says ''When Discord first impinged upon our world, sentiments of treachery and paranoia crept into our lives.  Dragorn turned on dragorn and longstanding friendships ended in bitter squabbling.  One dragorn, Noble Yemall the Arcane, kept his wits enough to realize what was happening.  Yemall toiled tirelessly to counter the effects of Discord.  Although his efforts were ultimately in vain, it is said that he was able to author a treatise before the Muramites seized him.  This treatise, entitled The Duskfall Chronicles, contains his reflections on the nature of Discord and was likely seized by the Muramites.  Retrieve this treatise along with two bristling ukun hides to use as book covers so I can bind the book and protect it from the elements.  Hopefully the knowledge in this book will help me to survive in Kuua on my own, now that Discord is seeping further and further across our world.  Do this for me and my best plate helm shall be your reward.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:14 2004] You say, 'chest'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:15 2004] Vorkiev says ''The chest piece is the most-prized piece of my collection.  For this I will require a special favor from you.  Before the Muramites came, the High Council of Eight ruled over Dranik.  The eight nobles, lead by Jelvan the Eldest, each carried scepters that were said to be carved from the bones of the first dragorn sons.  It is said that these scepters will glow as long as their owner is alive.  I have not seen or heard from the council since the Muramites overran our city, but I have heard that these scepters were handed out by Mata Muram as trophies.  If you can recover one of these scepters along with three shorn murkglider tentacles to disguise it from the searching Muramites, I can keep it with me.  Its soft glow will remind me that there is still hope for Dranik.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:17 2004] You say, 'legs'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:17 2004] Vorkiev says ''Kuua was not the first world touched by Discord.  There have been many others.  I know this because I have heard the Muramites tell stories of past conquests.  One of the stories they tell is that the last ember of a Discord-ravaged city will burn for many years, long after the ruins of the city itself have been covered over by time.  Some say it's the city's spirit slowly dying.  Others claim it to be a side effect of the Discord's lingering magic.  Regardless, these embers are highly valued by the legions of Discord, for Mata Muram rewards them to his fiercest captains as war trophies.  If you can bring me one of these embers along with three Dranik incense burners to hold it in, I will reward you with my finest set of plate grieves.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:20 2004] You say, 'feet'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:20 2004] Vorkiev says ''When Discord first descended upon Kuua, many of my own kin turned traitor.  Most dragorn who marched against Dranik were already in exile and seeking vengeance for their punishment, but a handful were established dragorn who conspired against us from within.  These established dragorn did the most damage to our defense efforts as they worked against us without our knowledge.  There is talk of a traitors' stone which is etched with the names of all dragorn who conspired with the Muramites in those dire days.  The Muramite captains carried these stones and used them to determine which dragorn to slay outright and which to spare with a life of slavery.  If you can bring me one of these Kuuan traitors' stones, along with two kyv bowstrings so that I can hang this rock of traitors for all to see.  Although the dragorn have been occupied for the better part of a decade now, this may still cause stir up trouble for the Muramites.  Do this for me and I can grant you my plate boots as a reward.''</div></div><hr />

Hello, tier 2 bracer reward.....  that is officially quite nice compared to vadds bracer, worthwhile upgrade imo, doesn't blow away all other tank bracers though.. time will tell how common the anguish quest pieces are for completion, too early to see if this is on par or weak for its rarity... looks bout right in line for raex-&gt;vadd-&gt;gladiators progression though.... 1 trial away from anguish flagged =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Foofee_test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Do we know the Riftseeker heart came from Anguish?  Seems odd the tier one pieces are from named in WoS, RCoD and NC, or from trash mobs in those zones.  The &quot;get me 2-3 of xxxx&quot; drops for the tier 2 quest are out of MPG, it would seem like it would make more sense that these things drop from named in MPG or RS.  <br />
<br />
Just speculation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the NO DROP pieces for these are pretty doable from the named in WoS or RCoD.  I have the arms piece.  For now, at least, getting the trash drops seems a bit harder just because most folks probably sell them as vendor fodder. <br />

[Wed Oct 20 17:00:53 2004] Vorkiev says ''Did you know that dragorns were created by the death of a single dragon named Dranik, the great father? The first dragorn to walk Kuua created many things in his honor. Among these creations was a fearsome battle standard painted with a drop of blood from each of Dranik's firstborn sons. The last dragorn armies to carry the banner fell to the Muramites. No one can say where the Blood Standard of Dranik has gone, but the recovery of such an artifact would leave me in your debt. Return with this banner along with two Ashlock branches, so I can remake the haft. From there, I can reward you with a powerfully crafted wristguard.'' <br />

Anyone find anything to do with a banner? Need new bracers and have yet to find any sort of banner.</div></div><hr />

The Dranik Blood Standard can be found from Ungi in RCoD, Girplan Mastercrafter in WoS, Noc Bonecleaver in WoS.  Actually, below is what I have so far for all the parts.  I DO NOT KNOW where you get or Kyv Bowstrings and I also can never seem to see them in the bazaar.  If you know where they can be found, please post!<br />

Thanks!  I'm wondering if they are extremely rare, then, because I've camped in RCoD statue area, pulling BowHound PHer as well, for the last week or so straight probably totalling around 40 hours and not seen either item drop.</div></div><hr />
