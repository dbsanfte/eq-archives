First of all i wanna say i LOVE being tank (maybe because i have been my whole life in EQ playing a rogue and got kinda tired). My first char ever was an SK, which still exits and is lvl 50 atm. Deleted it about 6 months ago and petitioned to get it back again, made the eyepatch of plunder quest, got some new armor and weapons but now i see my 31 warrior (made about 4 months ago and abandoned it) and i feel how it calls me.<br />
<br />
Is a warrior fun while you love being a tank?. I find that most knight classes are having problems in GoD, also i just see warriors tanking nameds in Eplanes so, why make a knight if what i want is to TANK?. Just need some encouragement to continue my warrior (im doing anyway but some will be good :P)<br />
<br />
Ok weird post, but im playing a warr now and im part of the cominuty so i ask here :D. Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

If all you ever care to do is live and breath tanking, then you picked the right class. Granted that's nearly all that an SK or Pal can do aside from ghetto-summon/rez(respectively).... You'll have more HP(likely higher AC), better mitigation + discs, and whenever they implement the rest of your spel...er... abilities you should turn a fair bit more DPS as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a warrior is like a wierd sickness =)<br />
<br />
I've played a warrior for three years, and I always come back.  I've tried 3 different SKs and 2 paladins.  Its the attitude that makes the warrior.  The good warriors are stubborn, knowledgeable, and confident.  Warriors have a limited amount of tools at our disposal to do our jobs.  Knights have it much easier with their spells to not only keep agro, but to have some utility.  We trade off that utility for our higher hps (not always though), and our tanking disciplines.  We are SUPER gear dependent, so being a warrior isn't cheap.  While I really haven't experienced the &quot;group stealing&quot; of knight classes, some groups are really preferntial to knights as the tanks so they don't have to worry about their agro.<br />
<br />
So the question is, are you willing to go down a tough, mana-less road?  Do you want to tank the big nasties?  If you are, get behind your warrior 1,000%, learn as much as you can about your class, as well the the mobs/encouters you will be fighting.  And find some money =)<br />
<br />
Good luck in enjoying the game =)</div></div><hr />

Are you willing to tank trash in PoAir for hours at a time?  :(</div></div><hr />

Yeah...makes me glad I'm on EQ break ATM! =)  No stupid spiders that hit for 1400 and stun, or mobs that dispell constantly, or mobs that split like crazy and sometimes spawn a bigger, stupider version!  Weeee! =)<br />

I enjoy being a class that can not only be someone's shield but at higher levels can employ the proper strategy for each mob. I agree the time spent from 30-50s is a drag but it is also time well spent learning to keep aggro, positioning and general dynamics of pure melee in groups and raids. I learn more each day I fight and take great pleasure in tanking &amp; beating the snot out of a mob. If you're good at being a warrior, you will be praised and hailed a hero (if only for moments)......if you stink at it, well.... it's ugly.<br />

I have been playing my warr for a few hours and it's the class i need (also seeing my guild warrs on EPs and tanking nasty mobs and boring zones, i love all it).

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some say all a warrior does is /attack on and go afk till the mob is dead. such people have never played the class. certainly when fighting low enough conning mobs its easy but this is true for every class.  when the fight is intense though the amount of positioning adjustments to be made is often intense. in  dungeon fighting or ldon  you have to be aware of all mobs and who they are beating upon. i cant count the number of times i had to save my groups because someone agrod a couple mobs and if i didnt quickly pull agro off them for even a moment they would end up dead perhaps taking the group down with them.<br />
<br />
and in this comes some of the thrill of being a warrior. to me its a sort of a high seeing myself at 50percent health with a mob and almost instinctively stopping what im doing to plow headlong into three more unslowed mobs that the shaman just dug up out of who knows where knowing that if the shaman dies before those mobs are slowed they will wipe the group. its not to say other classes dont get their own kinds of thrills like the bard who kites 30 mobs  or the wizard who ae snares the 3 mobs that the shaman picked up and kites them around knowing if HE gets tagged by them he is one dead wizard. but plowing headlong into trouble makes a warrior feel tough. call it a macho thing. ive plowed into 5 mobs that who knows who picked up by running into the wrong room and hit furious (and done 10k+ damage with it) and wowed the group how i could do that at 50 percent health and even survive it pulling agro on all 5 plus the one i already had until the group could get them under control or succor out. what a rush :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first character (and still my main) is a warrior. I also have a shaman and an SK and a beastlord.<br />
have no opinion yet about the beastlord (he's too little yet).<br />
The SK is a troll and I enjoy getting on him and going around killing stuff and, when possible, eating it. He's untwinked, and I've noticed that it's easier for him to hold aggro with cheap gear. Harm touch is fun too. he has a number of ways to help a group, even if he's not MT. His ability to generate lots of hate pretty fast makes him an excellent offtank. And something I don't see mentioned much but that I believe is true: an SK and a warrior who work well together make an unbelievably good tanking team. The SK doesn't mitigate damage as well, though, and every fight I notice it. He's relaxing to play, but it gets down to this: when I go somewhere where there's a good possibility that things will get nasty, I wanna be on the warrior.<br />
I'm very impressed with the shaman. Pretty durable for a caster, and can do a bunch of different things to erode the mob and increase the power of a group. You have to pay attention and think strategically with a shaman. It's very weird to be doing nothing but medding part of the time though. I have to remind myself to sit down, and sitting down just seems wrong.<br />
And then there's the warrior: expensive to gear up, hard to hold agro, minimal pulling abilities, hard to travel, very little extra utility. Yet once the fight starts, there's nothing that compares to tanking, and no tank as tough as a warrior. You manage aggro, position mob, watch push, keep an internal running estimate of everyone's mana, notice mez order, and always always think about what comes next. Eventually I've found that even my lack of snap aggro is oddly attractive: it just means that I have to pay attention to what I'm doing and everyone else is doing and where the mobs are--aggro is something you manage by thinking three deep into the mob order. When the chips are down, I don't want to be staring at a screen with a bunch of stupid spell gems blocking my view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree. Even though me and my brother are low lvl (33 and 30) we were doing a nice team having me as tank and him offtanking the adds.<br />
<br />
I like the SKs, i played one just to lvl 50 but i find myself playing the warrior being a lot more eficient when things get nasty (too many adds, low hp, etc) I just love, it, thanks for replying guys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to me there are 2 real &quot;classes&quot; in EQ that have (or should have) the more knowledge (is that english ??) of the events, the zones, the rules of the game : the pullers and the warrior.<br />
<br />
the puller must know the basis of agro, agro range, geometry, zones, the mobs. know his skills, their reliability.<br />
so does the warrior when tanking. he must know WHERE to tank, HOW to tank, WHAT to use. our lack of spellbook make us use all we have (basically that means using our guts and brains) to be victorious.<br />
<br />
there is absolutely no trick. just give us a sword a set of plate and some buffs and we are ready to go (btw, grab the best sword, the best set of plate and the best buffs :p).<br />
<br />
be aware, be confident, be beated.<br />
<br />
oh ! and of course: there is nothing that can compare with engaging alone for a few seconds a big baddy (well... nothing but pulling the big baddy, i guess Wubao knows what i mean as he plays a puller and a tank :p)<br />

<br />
last night i had some fun while pexing in BoT. i had just looted a fabled exe axe and a primastic 2HS and wanted to pull them out. i had no opportunities before.<br />
the group started, i was main tank... and puller. killed gaukr with no sweat.<br />
so i just bagged my agro weapons and pulled out the prismatic and the exe axe ! <br />
<br />
i was expecting for some agro issues (group was : cleric, paladin, shaman, wizard, beastlord and me).<br />
but... i rarely lost agro. i was kinda surprised and pleased :D</div></div><hr />

The Warrior I play today is the first character i created 4ish years ago.  Even thru all the gear frustrations, etc I wouldnt trade playing my Warrior for anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
And something I don't see mentioned much but that I believe is true: an SK and a warrior who work well together make an unbelievably good tanking team. .<br />

<br />
This can be said about any &quot;tank team&quot;.  I play along side a Paladin and we do VERY well.  We both are amazed at all the &quot;mutual exclusive&quot; type bull shit that goes on between Warriors,Pally,SKs on the various boards.  If you don't see how effective a group can be with a mix of Warrior/Pally/SK then you are too stupid to look beyond your selfishness and desire to have the biggest penis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the question is, are you willing to go down a tough, mana-less road? <br />

That's one thing I love about both my rogue and my warrior.  Rez me, buff me, and I'm ready to rock and roll.</div></div><hr />
