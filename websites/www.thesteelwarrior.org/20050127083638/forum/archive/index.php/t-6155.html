<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been getting like 40percent AA per pull on 6 toons in PoN latly with a combined pbaoe/earthshaker stratagy. <br />
<br />
For those of you unfamilar with earthshaker go to this thread:<br />
<br />
www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3957&amp;highlight=earthshaker <br />
<br />
<br />
Now as you can see from their stratagy they have to use fortitude or some other discipline. Although Rampage refreashs in like 10 mintues or something, Fortitude is like one hour or so (not sure on either time). <br />
<br />
My DeathShaker Stratagy requires a lot more people but allows the warrior to not use any discipline and allows us to pull just as fast as the mobs pop. The trees, spiders and birds in PoN pop fairly quickly like 10-15 minutes.<br />
<br />
I have 3 wizards, a chanter with color cloud, and a cleric and a warrior with EarthShaker.<br />
<br />
I bring in a good bard puller (lowdown is able to pull from the Nightstakers all the way to the hobs and only leave like 5 or 6 mobs up), and another chanter, thats 8 toons total. <br />
<br />
Ok the chanter slows the warrior (tash, forlorn deeds and then Night Dark Terror to get Dex up), so he is ready to rampage, by way of duel. Then the chanter zones and returns.<br />
<br />
The puller brings in the big train, and the chanters are a bit away from the wizards/cleric/warrior, opposite the train. The mobs hit and get stuned by the color cloud spell (8 seconds up to mobs level 65, thus PoN trash does not resist much), and the other chanter using a color stun, both chanters then spam their stuns, this will ususally lock down most of the mobs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the wizards are using winds of guile and jyllys spells to pbaoe the mobs, and the cleric is casting a group heal ... all this is spamed.<br />
<br />
Finally a few seconds after the mobs are stuned (so the trailing mobs catch up and bunch with the stuned mobs in the front of the train) the warrior hits rampage. If he is slowed and has some good AA (espiciall weapon aff) he will proc a lot and almost kill the mobs outright, but if not no problem they are low HP and stun locked and the wizards finish the job. <br />
<br />
Result is as you see from the photos. 40percent AA for everyone in the 6 person party. <br />
<br />
And the beauty is that as soon as the mobs repop its time to pull again! Warrior not using disc means no wait at all, cept for rampage which is like 10 minutes.... <br />
<br />
So basically with luck can do a pull every 15-20 mintues (the bard takes awhile to round up all the mobs)....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it is a bit much to ask for to have all 23 of your characters flagged as tag-alongs with a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaoraEci</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soo.....basically you have your 3 wizards , chanter and a cleric doing an AE group with your warrior.....I don't see how your warrior is somehow important in this mix?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in this group 4 of my 6 guys get .4AA per pull, and as I say we can pull as fast as the mobs pop, say one pull every 15minuts max. So 3 pulls an hour easy.<br />
<br />
My total take is 4 toons X .4AA or 1.6AA per pull total for all my guys or 1.6AA X 3 pulls per hour or about 5AA total for me per hour. Thats not to shabby.<br />
<br />
Right i am not flagged for elementals but with GoD its no longer needed. I can single group the first nine trials, if I am good enough, there is no requirement for a guild or more then 6 toons anymore. Loot by the 9th trial is easy Phase 4 of Time or Better. I havn't even done one trial but I am just saying there is the possibility of me to advance a lot now without needed a guild at all, whereas before it was impossible to get flagged without a guild. <br />
<br />
Also this, with 2 chanters, 1 warrior, 3 wizards, 1 bard and 1 cleric is super safe in PoN. Sure better stratigies exist in higher zones but its not even 1 in 20 we whould wipe doing this, with 2 chanters (the mobs are almost stun locked). Whereas pulling in PoFire or whereever, even with 8 toons, has some serious risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well all the toons contribute the warrior, slowed and with some AA like WA will take the mobs from 100percent HP to 25ish HP. The warrior does most of the damage by far, and the wizards mop up. Also he gets the agro off the cleric (who gets the agro off the puller lol)... I sure would not try this many mobs without the warrior cause even with stun lock there will be a few resists and if those resists mobs kill the chanters its all over.... With warrior you want to pull the most mobs possible, without the warrior you would max at about 20-30 mobs... Its just back up safety. With warrior and 2 chanters we gonna win 19 times in 20, without the warrior, and pulling this many mobs it might be 12 times in 20 or less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just waltz right into Vxed and Tipt and kick their ass, all while boxing the group!<br />
<br />
or better yet...<br />
<br />
Why not knock around those 2k+ hitters in Ikkinz trials for the fuck of it. I might get phat lewts!<br />
<br />
Uh huh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not saying I can do it, or that i have done it (I am still at the first room of the first trial), but I am just saying its possibe, whereas prior killing any boss mob with 6 toons to flag for the next level in PoP was basically impossible. <br />
<br />
Ok maybe two clerics will be needed or whatever, its easy to find one or two other people to do a 6 toons trial as compared to 72 to do a raid.... <br />
<br />
What was previously impossible is now only limited by my ability. Wheter or not my ability is up to the task, only time will tell.<br />
<br />
At any rate my first step is to get like 200 maybe 250 plus AA on all my toons, then its back to GoD and the trials..... For sure my warrior who has like 70ish AA now is going to be way stronger with 250ish AA... way stronger...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the context of what Hulanta was talking about ... Hulanta has a very good point. Elemental planes still have quite the edge in XP compared to what you're doing now and what could or even might possibly be doing in the future.<br />
<br />
You sort of shifted the point from XP to Gear/Loot when you decided to poo-poo the elemental planes in this thread. Which sort of misses the point from the very thread you started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whereas pulling in PoFire or whereever, even with 8 toons, has some serious risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm. That depends on what you're pulling, but the risk in Fire isn't much that I've encountered.<br />
<br />
In any event ... you're correct in your assessment of Planes of Power. It is slowly becoming dated content. And you may have gear options outside of PoP.<br />
<br />
Then again, you could just 6-Box LDoNs and rack up points for PoP level gear as is. So you haven't been bound by the constraints of &quot;flag&quot; issues for a whole entire expansion.<br />
<br />
But, back to the original point you brought up and Hulanta underscored ... the elemental planes is still pretty damn good XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya the Exp modifier is 119 in pop which is why I go there for exp guess I should try and see what the GoD zones are... <br />
<br />
This is recent as to exp of mobs as of 3-5-04:<br />
having experienced all of this myself, i can definantly confirm the two cases i have often seen: <br />
<br />
First &quot;bridge&quot; in POFire mobs (the golems with a 40ish min respawn) are solidly more exp than the rest of the field of gib (yellow area) <br />
<br />
GoD sewers trial 1, mobs are significatly LESS exp per kill, HOWEVER the rate of pulls/low hit points of the mob means i earn the same exp overall here as in fire doing yellows (1 aa about every 45min) <br />
<br />
sounds like they are adjusting now to cap total exp. (as they said as justification for god aa cost, its too easy to exp at the high end)<br />
<br />
<br />
Normally I would link but considering the source it would just be anohter long discussion.... <br />
<br />
Anyway the concensus seems that individual mobs now have exp modifiers... <br />
<br />
Ya but LDoN gets boring after killing same old looking mobs for the 1000th time. I got like 3000 LDoN points on each guy and got burned out.... but if GoD was not around thats where I would be.<br />
<br />
Ya well have to hand it to SOE now there are plenty of options for most anyone, guilded, ungilded, casual or whatever... <br />
<br />
Really would be interesting to try and AE a easy LDoN slaughter... wonder if a bard could actually do a pull in the close quaters there. Humm 2 warriors, bard, cleric, chanter and humm wiz or chanter might have some potential... <br />
<br />
If the mobs can actually be pulled might be possible to do a LDoN hard with 3 warriors with the sword, bard, cleric and chanter with color cloud. Humm maybe need a slower with a long time slow, 3 warriors, bard and color cloud chanter. No cleric heh ouch.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
No way in hell could you pull the 80+ mobs in a hard adventure needed to kill them all using earthshakers.  If you were in a large open field, perhaps you could but in a dungeon the puller would be smeared out like a banana slug under a steamroller.  Even if a bard could DA pull and has selos still on, he couldn't bunch the mobs up enough with all the weird pathing and doors shutting on him etc...  You couldn't even do this on an easy adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty cool and pretty creative, but my only question is, how do you get away with pulling the entire zone on a PvP server without someone messing with you for any length of time?  Because it's PoN and all the other decently geared people are in elementals at the time?  Or do you play in the middle of the night?  Also, you get a 20% xp bonus on SZ right?  So it'd only be about 30% of an AA on any other server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have Rampage because it seems to be one of the most worthless POS skills they could come up with, but perhaps I simply do not understand the skill.  It's description says that you can hit all mobs in a radius with a refresh timer of 10 minutes.  So every 10min I can get everything around me.  How on earth is that beneficial when that's one hit on a mob that's going to regen it in 5 rounds?  Also, why would you *slow* the tank when using an Earthshaker?  Why would you slow the tank ever?  Did you misspeak or is this some kind of solo tactic I've never heard of?<br />
<br />
As for individual exp modifiers on mobs, we've known about this for a long time, if its just the change they made to the mobLVL vs yourLVL.  The sewer mobs are 63-65, iirc, and the PoF mobs are 64-67 are they not?  There is no such thing as an individual mob on the programming side, only an instance of a particular mob object.  It's level coupled with the ZEM give you exp.<br />
<br />
When you refer to 'toons' and 6 boxing, 8 boxing, whatever, are you saying that you are running macro-controlled characters, or simply disassociating the players from the characters?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sword in question &quot;earthshaker&quot; has a pbaoe (point blank area of effect spells hit ALL mobs in a 30 foot radius for 246 damage) proc for 246ish damage. It has like 70 delay. If you have 50 mobs around you when you rampage you swing 50 times. Each swing has a chanch to proc. If you proc all 50 times that 50 procs of a proc that does 246 damage to all mobs inside of 30 feet.  So that 50 X 246 damage to EACH MOB. Naturally you dont proc every swing but 40percent proc rate when slowed is possible (do a search under earthshaker on this forum for why slowing in this case increases the proc rate - I know its hard to conceptulize)...<br />

<br />
It appears that the current consens is that there is more to it then just zem and level and group bouns (and server bonus heh)... they are thinking now that differnt mobs of the same level give difference experience... this may be true or it may not be.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you refer to 'toons' and 6 boxing, 8 boxing, whatever, are you saying that you are running macro-controlled characters, or simply disassociating the players from the characters?  <br />
<br />
Ya a toon is a single individual in game character...  <br />
<br />
I don't use macros, I have one keyboard hooked to 6 computers and make very very extensive use of socials.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya I can't figure out any way someone could pull a LDoN hard 50 plus mobs, but then again I'm not a bard....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On SZ there are 3 teams. I am on team evil, we are the largest and best geared. PoN is &quot;evil terriroty&quot; as is Valor. Plane of Storms is Neteral Team. If I were to zone into Plane of Storms most likly Nootz (neuterals) would be there, just as if I zone into PoN I would expect evils to exp there. I have never exped in Plane of Storms as enemy would be on me 24/7. SZ has low population. Im all level 65's, only other 65's would even consider attacking me. I have a treaty with the main Good team Guild so my only worry is Nootz who are agressive and will raid evil zones form time to time. Still as I run 6 toons one or two nootz would probably not try an attack but its been done heh... So with all that there are like maybe 40 toons that I need to worry about behing attacked with, it happens but not all the tiem, and I do play anytime I want in a 24 hour period and I tend to avioud prime time....</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's the first person I've heard who isn't under the assumption that he'll wipe within 30 seconds of engaging the mobs.... then raising his expectations from there.<br />
<br />
At best he's being overly optimistic... at worst, very overconfident.<br />
<br />
And hey, I said that without being insulting too :)</div></div><hr />

We will see but I think it will be just more of the same. I'll get slaughteed for awhile, then win one in 6, then 1/2 then 90 percent then 100percent. But obvisouly they are no cake walk and the first step is to up my AA's..... No doubt I gonna get slaughter for a long while.<br />
<br />
I'v goten past the first room in the first trial already (wow well we take what we can get lol), even killed some mobs in the 2nd room (then got hung up on the stairs on the pull and figured evac was better then death.... <br />
<br />
Also everyone seems to forget that there is some kind of thing where mobs have high resistence to some attacks but are very weak against others in GoD, I dont know why no one has done those quests yet to find out but by the time I go back they should be done....<br />

The NPC for this quest is standing close to Morden Rasp in the boat city:<br />
<br />
[Wed Feb 11 01:23:17 2004] You say, 'Hail, Alexsa Whyte'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 01:23:18 2004] Alexsa Whyte says 'Greetings traveler, my name is Alexsa and I am currently looking into collecting samples of skin from the strange beings that make up the Legion of Mata Muram ranks. Our initial encounters with them revealed that each one is innately resistant to certain weapon types and weak against others. So, by order of Morden, we must gather skin samples from each race and analyze it. Thanks to our tinkering sister, Vaifan, I now have a device which can readily examine samples. However, with news of our scouts missing and our resources being spread so thin, retrieving these samples is impossible for us. Since you have taken the time to listen, I am wondering if you would be willing to help?'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 01:23:32 2004] You say, 'I am willing'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 01:23:38 2004] You say, 'I will help'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 01:23:44 2004] You say, 'I would be willing to help'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 01:23:48 2004] You say, 'yes i am'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 01:23:49 2004] Alexsa Whyte says 'Oh wonderful! You don't know how helpful this will be. Take this device. It is what we use to examine samples. When you defeat a Muramite, remove his tongue, place it inside of here, and combine it with some distilling salts. Distilling salts can be found along the shores of Natimbi. Once you have combined the ingredients, it will give you a final sample which I will need you to return to me when you get the chance. Each time you hand me a sample, I will be able to reveal to you the innate strengths and weaknesses for that race. If you are successful in recovering a sample from every different race that has come through the portal, then I will talk to Morden about giving you a reward</div></div><hr />
