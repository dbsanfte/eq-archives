<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to get the best combination of weapons for my various roles as MA/SA/DPS.  However, I'm on a limited budget and my needs are many.  I use a GSoT for my main aggro wep when I'm MA.  I was recently lucky enough to not only get invited to a BoT tower raid, but to win a Wind-worn Handblade.  Other than that I have a Tae Ew Longsword, Defender's Lightblade, and Battleworn Ch'Ror (see Magelo for stats).  My question is, what weps should I use for SA and DPS and what should I sell?  I was thinking it might be better for me to just sell the Wind-worn Handblade so I can get more gear upgrades.  However, it's a really nice weapon and the proc doesn't seem to take aggro from the MA.  Finally, in general, what weps do you suggest for when I am SA?  That is, when you don't need to be taking aggro from the MT, but need to get aggro as fast as possible for an add?  Please bear in mind, that most of the weapons I have are cheap and/or easily obtained.  Therefore mentioning uber weapons is not going to help me any, because there is no way I can afford them or camp them anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're right, the proc on the Wind-Worn Handblade is small. In a PoP zone, the mobs rarely notice it.<br />
<br />
If you want to continue the 2h route for when you're going straight DPS you could consider the dirt cheap War Marshal's Bladed Staff, or the significantly more pricey Windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what you have I'd go windworn handblade + defenders lightblade for DPS.  Selling the lot of them and getting a windblade or war marshalls staff (and probably some coin left over) would be another good choice.<br />
<br />
Other DPS options if you are on a budget would be stone bladed axe of dismay or a widebladed greatsword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Razzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would try for Middle and Upper South groups in Bastion of Thunder... the Greatstaff of Thunder that drops there is absolutely wonderful for aggro purposes. You can also find it for 4k in the Bazaar (I looked like 2 mins ago, we're on the same server. Hell, I was with ya when you won the WWHB from the SE Tower Mini-Named).<br />
<br />
However, if I can recommend one weapon to you, it would be a Copper Hammer of Striking. I recently just invested one, and dropped my Vyemm sword in favor of the Hammer and my red epic. The aggro is sheerly insane. Its the proc of the Vyemm sword with an added stun component, on a one handed weapon (although the CHoS proc can be resisted, unlike Vyemm).<br />
<br />
As a ST, I'd got for the Lightblade and the WWHB. You can always offhand a proc'ing weapon if you're not MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd recommend just getting a windblade for when your'e not MTing.  It will work fine if you have to tank unmezzable adds.  If you have aggro problems, then just switch in GSoT.  It's only one inventory slot to switch.  Have an aggro weapon and a no-aggro weapon.  I don't see a need for stuff in the middle.  2h &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes wind-worn handblade procs is very small. Marshall's staff is cheap and it looks cool, imho. GSoT would be another good choice. Haven't tryed copper hammer of striking yet, but that might be another good agro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For aggro I'd definitely go to Droga and get a Sword of the Bloodsword and/or the Copper Hammer of Striking.  Totally easy to get, and its actually decent xp too.  For dps I'm not sure, what types of mobs does your guild kill?  If you can do Shei, he/she/it (dunno what shei is), drops a very nice 15/20 spear as a common drop.  And if you could do Rhag1 and 2 (neither are that tough), I believe Rhag2 drops a 15/20 sword.  Anything like that rocks for DPS.  But again, I'm not sure if your in a raiding guild or not.  If anything, get those two weapons from Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kamtor I hope your sig was a joke...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">he asked about DPS folks, not aggro. He has a GSoT, and that's fine aggro choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
DPS, go with War Marshall staff. Windblade is bursty, but War Marshall is consistant.<br />
<br />
You'll get more dps with War Marshall over a long period of time, although it's not much. Get which ever is cheaper.<br />
<br />
I traded in my Windblade for a War Marhshal, and i've never regretted doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For dps i would say war marshalls over windblade definaly. There both very close in dps and war marshalls is much much cheaper. Plus war marshall's looks cooler IMHO.<br />
<br />
Yes my sig was a joke. I almost did click yes instead of no on blade of carnage though. That would have sucked.</div></div><hr />
