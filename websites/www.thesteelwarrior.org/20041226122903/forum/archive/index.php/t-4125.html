<br />
Anyway, I'm levelling up my WAR a bit, and wondering what all the factors are in the ATK rating.  I know STR, Offense skill, and the weapon skill for what's being wielded are the main factors.  What else can raise ATK, within reach for a casual, mostly broke main?  I'm curious about equipment, as well as buffs and AAs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />

Vengeance items will raise attack, but if you mean affordable most are not.  You can however purchase a bunch of them now with the release of LDoN.  Certain spells will increase attack, most notably ranger's Call of the Predator.  Spirit of Bih' Li will also raise attack by 10 I believe if you are looking for a low lvl spell.  Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm sure someone will :) )but i *think* some of the high level enchanter hastes contain an increase to attack.  From there you begin to look at other items with clicky effects.  Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring has the Grim Aura clicky effect.  I believe the Eyepatch of Plunder clicky also contains an attack buffer in it.  Check in the library, I'm sure there is a list or two of items with useful clickies, you might find some more there.  And I can't think of any AA's off the top of my head that actually increase the &quot;attack rating, &quot; though of course there are offensive ones that will increase overall DPS.</div></div><hr />

Call of the Predator Ranger level 60 is +40 Attack. Strength of Tunare Ranger 62 is +60 Attack. Spirit of Predator Ranger 64 is +70 Attack. Spirit of Bih'li, Shaman level 39 is +15 attack and upgraded SoW. Avatar and Primal Avatar, both Shaman 60 are +100 Attackand some melee stats Ferine Avatar Shaman 65 is +140 Attack Spiritual Vigor, Beastlord 62 has +40 attackand +225 HP and does not stack with Brells line . Ferocity, Beastlord 64 is +150 attack +40 Stamina and +65 to all saves. Boon of the Garou from Enchanters level 44 is +30 attack,  Night's Dark Terror, Enchanter 63 is +45 attack and scarecrow illusion. Not all of these stack with each other though I don't believe, and like the Paladin and Beastlord lines, some have stacking issues with other spells<br />
<br />
 edit: Beastlords also get Spiritual Brawn at level 49 +10 attack and +75 HP, and Spiritual Strength at level 60 +20 attack and +150 HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatanka7th</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help!  I have spent some time in the Hole, maxxing the WAR's melee skills, and that's helped a lot.  Looking at the ATK increase based on the skill rise, it looks like an ATK rating of 1200 or so should be possible fairly easily once he's high enough of a level to have the skills completely maxxed.  That's not too bad, much better than the low 900s I was starting from.  Added about 30 points of 1HB skill last night (199 now) =)<br />
<br />
I am also using a chanter for PLing, so Boon of Garou adds another 30 or 40.  And sometimes, I notice another increase of 20 or 30, temporarily.  It just occurs to me now that this might be caused by going berserk.  Does that sound right to you warlords?  Going berserk adds 20 or 30 ATK?<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the help!<br />

I forget how much, but 20-30 sounds right on. Coupled with crippling blows, staying berserked is pretty cool if your healer can do it.</div></div><hr />
