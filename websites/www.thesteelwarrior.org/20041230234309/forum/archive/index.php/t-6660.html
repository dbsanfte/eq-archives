This forum is for HIGH LEVEL warrior posting. It is heavily moderated to ensure it remains that way. PoP elemental, Plane of Time, and Time-Level Ldon discussion only please.<br />
<br />
Don't be surprise to have answers like this in this forum, for this kind of queries go to the regular forums of the steel warriors, not in the Overlord Sactuary.<br />
<br />
This forum was made specifically for high-end discussion, it is not elitist or anything, but people here usually don't want to be bothered by newbie questions...<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />
