Seeing as we have already done knights vs warriors, and are completing monks (and by extension all chain classes as well), I thought we ought to talk about magic. After all my warrior does have +mana items. By the way, why doesnt that show up in my uber UI or magelo? :(<br />

Monks bitched about or fd so much they got AA just to wipe aggro 100% of the time identical to warriors fd.  That my friend is called pnus envy~</div></div><hr />

Of course through typical warrior whining you only got those abilities from rangers claiming that it was unbalanced that THEY get the superior forms of those skills over a pure melee like the warrior.</div></div><hr />

You be nice or we will demand a melee version of TS next. I want to routinely hit for 1K+ base like my uber ranger!!! Of course we want the aggro to be like melee weps not like bows :)<br />
<br />
And a pet, damnit I want a pet. A big fuzzy blue shark, that has to be shrunk 6 times to raid with. He of course should perma levitate (no water in most zones you know) and he should be a quad 3K hitter (that is unhasted of course), be runnable through a PiP type interface, have an unresistable taunt, and uber HT (new 40K version)-like LASER BEAMS of course! That way I can just sit on my ass in raids and do monster damage while merely surfing TSW.<br />
<br />
And if I dont get all this I am gonna sit in the corner and cry, at least til OoW comes out and I can farm the new lvl 45 content :)<br />

DAMMIT! STAY AWAY FROM THE LAZERS! Thats a MONK ONLY SKILL! *EDIT* Oh yeah, and if warriors get our lazers, I will call upon all monks everywhere to gather in the bazaar and fd simultaneously.</div></div><hr />

Oh, that's already easy to simulate. Just take like 3 or 4 100 hit point items on your person. Remove them. Then put them back on. BOOM. You just mended yourself, you big badass you!<br />

TS comes with a price!<br />
<br />
A shitty price at that.</div></div><hr />

Hehe is this where we start the warrior vs ranger thread? I have both and am aware of the &quot;price&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I wonder if game where you could get all the skills via AA/level/equipment type progression could ever work? Depedning on your current skill set you would be called tank, healer, CC, or DPS but could possibly do it all. Course then the ubers would be even farther head of the casuals but that is a different story....<br />

Make it a Wardog or something.<br />
Put the tome in the PoK Library and have it sold for a few copper so the raider/non-raider thing doesnt pop up.</div></div><hr />
