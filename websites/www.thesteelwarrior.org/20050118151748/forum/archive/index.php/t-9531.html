<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple question, really. With a Cord Hilted Spike Driver in mainhand, which one of these should i look into for offhand agro? I'll be dropping an anger aug on it as soon as i get it. I like the ratio and dd on the sword but the mace is far easier to get for me atm, and i always loved a good stun proc. Would the ykesha+anger offhand be a good combo? what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if it were me, I'd buy the Sword of Midwinters Vengance and put it primary actually.  <br />
Here's my reasoning... Everyone says stuns are what around 400-450 points of hate right?  Well supposedly a debuff is right there beside a stun which once again is around 400-450 hate.  Now to the fact that 15/19 is obviously a better ratio than 13/19 and the proc draws roughly the same aggro.  More or less Sword of Midwinters Vengance is a Frosty on steroids and if you remember like I do then the Frostbringer was an aggro champion in its day.  <br />
Thats just my 2cp man, so take it as you will.  <br />
Hopefully I helped ya out some,<br />

<br />
Having owned both stun weapons, stun procs, and an OSoW (carbon-copy or SoMWV except for proc mod) I can say without reasonable doubt that stun aggro is a good bit stronger than debuff.  Debuff is nice, don't get me wrong, but stun is the stronger of the two imo.   <br />
<br />
SoMWV is better than CHSD imo though.  Ideally i would get both SoMWV and MoM and put the Sword in primary.</div></div><hr />

I thought i read that on a post a little while back.  If thats true it would make me wonder why anyone would really bother with a chsd.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Ap, I know there are no set numbers for either a stun or debuff proc.  I just remember a while back a few people saying thats both procs were roughly the same and also roughly around 400 points of aggro.  But none-the-less I still feel the SoMV would do better primary and CHSD secondary.</div></div><hr />

13/20 with lesser stats vs 13/19 with better stats.  From an aggro perspective the procs are roughly identical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i simply do not understand why people do not think CHSD is good agro. i had a CHoS with anger2 on it, and i sold the thing because quite frankly, the pure hate on the CHSD was better. <br />
<br />
With a proc for 450 and 400 hate mainhand, they proc at least a couple times a minute, and after initial slow agro, i usually dont have to taunt the rest of the fight heh. I dont care much about the 1 pt of damage, the pure, unresistable hate procs are worth the mainhand imo. Now, i did use a frosty back in the day, and it was excellent agro, but im not convinced in the least that the sword would be better agro than the 450 pure hate. I seem to remember bagging the frosty for a crap stun proc weapon and having better results.<br />
<br />
No, i'm having a great time with the spike driver mainhand, and i'd reccomend it to anyone who doesnt have a pure hate weapon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies. I've decided to go with the mace of memories for the stun proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gartogg08</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with MoM, back when the trollified yaks came out I ditched my frosty for one of them after a week or two of &quot;testing&quot; I just lost aggro less with the yak (always fought with the same people, all 4 of us agreed the yak was supperior aggro wise).<br />
<br />
On another note I have also experimented with a jagged antiquity (same proc as the bygone butcher's cleaver) and found the MoM to be superior aggro wise, I realize the MoM has a much better ratio, but procs are a significant portion of our aggro, and the yak out taunted the debuff/dd on the Jagged antiquity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i believe the origional yak is what i ditched my frosty for, Gartogg :)<br />
it procced enough the crap ratio didnt matter a lot.  I'm assuming you meant the SoMW has a better ratio? I Agree, since I'm only going to offhand the thing, the ratio is less of a concern, and i figured good old stun would be pleanty doubled with an anger2 augment (for the moment, still grinding out a3's)</div></div><hr />
