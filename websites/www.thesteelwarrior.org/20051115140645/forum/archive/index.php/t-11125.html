<br />
My philsophy has been go for the aggro proc, so I went with a Frostguard and threw an icy chill on it, thinking those two procs together would be good for aggro.  I'm thinking this weapon will be a great aggro weapon and allow me to hold aggro better, which is my primary job as a warrior.<br />
<br />
Others are saying go for stats on weapons, sta for hitpoints.  That seems to be the consensus, although many people feel the weapons like flurry and thrash blade are good due to the extra hits and rage generation which can be used for holding aggro.<br />
<br />
Am I just stuck in EQ mentality that procs are important for aggro?  Is proc aggro so insignificant in WoW that 100 hps from sta on a weapon is better than an aggro proc?  Is a Timeworn Mace really better than a Frostguard or an Annihilator?</div></div><hr />

Bah, whatever happened to the EQ mentality, &quot;you can never have enough aggro.&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-30-2005, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is that a rhetorical or actual question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-30-2005, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Number 1 -- Warcraft warriors build aggro fine, with any decent weapon.<br />
<br />
Number 2 -- When warcraft warriors lose aggro, taunt fucking works.<br />
<br />
Number 3 -- When warcraft warriors taunt, they have other abilities to catapult them even higher on the hate list, ensuring that pulling aggro is a more difficult proposition every time.<br />
<br />
Number 4 -- Most combat in WoW doesn't last the eons that EQ does, making all of these things happen in a matter of 30 seconds or less.  There's no time to be concerned with how many procs per minute your weapons get.<br />
<br />
Number 5 -- This isn't EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-30-2005, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Icy chill has excellent potential for actual hard hitting boss tanking.  1 good proc on it should really reduce the damage you take more than just about anything.  I don't think that it's really super important for aggro.<br />
<br />
What I look at for tanking is DPS first, then useful stats second.  Weapons with high damage, and armor are very ideal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why max damage for tanking?  Do you actually use overpower/cleave?  Or are you a MS tanker?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use frostguard + icy chill for bosses I know aren't immune to slow, or for mobs that primarily melee, but no saying the proc will go off much before they're dead.<br />
<br />
In the long run, procs dont really mean crap. I use a timeworn mace + crusader to min max defensively. Can switch in frostguard + icy chill for dual wielding or to slow hard meleeing mobs (albeit people like prince are immune, and a resisted proc generates 0 aggro). <br />
<br />
We aren't pigeonheld to crappy aggro weapons in this game. If I wanted I could hold aggro with a toothpick and a rubber band. So go for stats or dps, and who cares about weapon proc. Even in defensive, our dps contributes. Locking down 4-5 mobs aggro I still have a ton of rage to heroic strike, or whatever else I feel like doing these days.<br />
<br />
Also remember 90% of bosses and 10% of non-bosses use de-aggro abilities, so it all comes down to using our skills. Taunt, revenge, shieldbash, etc to get and keep aggro, relying on a proc in a 30 second fight will destroy you as unlike EQ you aren't getting and building aggro, you're getting aggro then getting it back, takes precision, not random chance.</div></div><hr />
