<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, last night we did our first LDoN raid, an elemental normal difficulty raid in MM. Fairly disappointed that we got absolutely no loot, but whatever, thats not the point here. Some of the things I noticed were very strange about the raid, and I'm not sure if my observations are valid, or just bad day, or I'm hallucinating:<br />
<br />
1) Trash has EXTREMELY high AC. With BoW, I was hitting the rawbones for like 90 average per hit, non-defensive. I had aboout 1800 atk, nothing special but not all that low. I've never had this kind of results using a BoW, not even close, I usually hit around 300s outside of LDoN, or in LDoN group adventures.<br />
<br />
2) Defensive doesn't work on named (we had Scion named). I mean, it wasn't working for me at all. With defensive on, mob was hitting for 1600 max, 1000 min. Without defensive, 1650 max, 1000 min. I didn't even notice any change in the amount of times I was getting hit for ~1000 with def on vs. without def.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed this in MM on elemental advens? No one else in my guild had these issues so I'm confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used evasive a lot on our MM raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The AC varies on the different mobs I believe.  Some people were commenting about shadows having higher AC during our mm raids, but I wouldn't say it's too high.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume you are talking about the Elite Scions on the Scion raid, and I think you need to look again.  I don't think the different ones are all the same (and what type spawn seems to vary), but they all hit for 2-2.5k max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2) Defensive doesn't work on named (we had Scion named). I mean, it wasn't working for me at all.

<br />
Hehe<br />
The Scion named hit for 1000 min so defensive won't change that.  And they hit for 2k max, so defensive the max hit would be 1600.  <br />
<br />
As for your dps, you say your average or common hit dropped from 300s to 90?  Ok, sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, I was talking about Elites, my bad. But, I was tanking without defensive for a good while and never saw a hit over 1650 without defensive. I thought it was odd myself. <br />
<br />
As for damages, I was suprized too when I saw that. But I'm positive that was what I saw. I checked several times, don't have a parser or I would have done so. But I am 100% sure that on certain mobs, shadows and I believe rawbones I was hitting for double digits, around 90, sometimes much lower, whereas usually I'm hitting high 200s-low 300s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Elite Scions just have poor ATK.  With only 1440 AC I never received a hit over 2200 in 5 minutes and only 3 hits above 2000, but the paladin who died assured me that its maximum hit was actually 2500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">but the paladin who died assured me that its maximum hit was actually 2500. <br />
<br />
heh heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So, uh, if they don't yield loot, can someone refresh my memory on the point of such raids?  I haven't been &quot;lucky&quot; enough to experience one yet....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the point you're asking ?<br />
-handpick the 36 best players from your guild, tough call<br />
-get your ass handed to you by yard trash mobs<br />
-get shafted when/if you finish the adventure-raid.<br />
<br />
Should give you an idea for now :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kaledan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Loot is somewhat better if you win the raid.<br />
<br />
soru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meyni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Once you complete the raid, the loot is usually in bashable chests that appear after the bosses are dead.    You won't see anything other than something like +7 or 9 (I forget) stat mods other than that, like what you would get in a hard adventure on trash.</div></div><hr />
