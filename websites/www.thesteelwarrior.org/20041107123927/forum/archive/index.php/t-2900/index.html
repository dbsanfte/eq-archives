<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been thinking about the fact that LDoN is on the horizon and the fact that SoE has systematically rebuffed all efforts on the part of the player community to open up communications regarding pure melee balance concerns and I've come to a conclusion.  It appears to me that SoE is hoping that people will be so taken with LDoN, which many people indicate is a good expansion, that it will distract or diminish the perception of disperity between the pure melee and everyone else.  Am I the only one to see that as a strong likelihood given their behavior?<br />
<br />
So, my question is this.  Even if LDoN turns out to be the best expansion yet.  Even if everyone has a really good time in LDoN.  And even if people see using a Warrior is as good a choice as using a Knight in LDoN.  Will this correct the already well established problems in PoP?<br />
<br />
I don't see that it will.   Where will people be spending their time when they want to grind out experience for a particular AAXP ability in the shortest amount of time?  Where will people be when they can't conveniently find a group of four or more willing to commit to a dungeon?  Where will people be when they're on standby for a potential raid someplace and don't want to get in too far over their head in the meantime?  The answer to me is PoP.  Unless they suddenly restructure the way experience is gained, again, it's unlikely people are going to leave PoP.  They may spend less of their time there, but they're still going to spend a fair amount of time there.<br />
<br />
And frankly, given the fact that they continue to give all the classes in the game except pure melee more innate abilities through the use of spells, I see the gap just continuing to grow.  Am I being nearsighted?  Am I missing the big picture?  Am I the only one seeing that regardless of how well LDoN goes Warriors are still going to continue to be hurting and the best we can hope for is that LDoN dulls the pain slightly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will this correct the already well established problems in PoP?Absolutely not. LoY content didn't replace PoP content. In fact, people will use LDoN content in exactly the same fashion they used LoY content: to explore something a little different before going back to the planar grind while waiting for the Gods to spawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went on vacation for 2 months and took a break from EQ.  Before my break I was getting VERY down on EQ and the Warrior class.  But since I came back, I mostly forgot about that stuff while I grinded away on all the lame ass flags and keys needed for PoP.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm about done with flags in PoP and I'm in Time, etc and looking to grind out some more AAs... it's really comming back to me how bad it is to play a warrior in EQ atm.<br />
<br />
I'm just starting to take a look at some other games atm... America's Army Online, Horizon's Beta, and maybe soon I'll go back to AO, DAoC, or try out SWG or Planetside....<br />
<br />
I was really expecting to see some warrior changes over the 2 months that I was gone.  Very disappointed that never happened...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be great if this were to happen. It wouldn't negate what has already been established, but it would go along ways toward making people happier with thier class choice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Remember it took a couple of expandsions and a good set of spells to change people's perceptions about using a Paladin as a tank.  I could tank kobalds  in Velious (the dirty secret was nearly anyone could) but the stereotype was that you shouldn't use a Paladin.<br />
<br />
The competent players and leaders keep an open mind about how to approach things.  No one should be worried about these players since they will always pick the &quot;best&quot; options reguardless of conventional wisdom.  Its the Joe Player in a common group that needs to be worried about.  How can you change their hearts and minds if there really is no problem?  I guess it is through patients and constant advocation.<br />
<br />
As for POP, I don't see it falling off the radar in the near future.  Just like previous expandsions, the high end content was still picked over while new content was explored.  Just like previous expandsions, the old content is frozen warts and all.  POP is nearly all high end content.  Unless something that is easier that can be found in LDoN that yields as good if not better rewards people will still be hitting POP.<br />
<br />
Which begs the a question.  Is there any LDoN content can dramatically change how any class performs?  If the POP content is frozen then the only improves have to come from the class itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So far I've heard that DPS in LDoN is king. Many events are time trials. I think this favors non-warrior tanks. People simply don't have time to wait for a warrior to build aggro, or risk mobs killing important DPS classes. <br />
<br />
With some quests being rewarded to you on a point system, there might be a situation where itemization MIGHT be less out of whack.<br />
<br />
Since there's no fear of rots etc, there's no reason why I shouldn't be rewarded with a warrior or rogue only item for instance. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think if the key problems that exist haven't been addressed, that disparity will become all the more glaringly obvious when everyone else is having a great time and 10 warriors are sitting at the wayfarer LFG.<br />
<br />

<br />
Edit: 10 warriors and a bunch of feign deathed monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It didn't take new spells or anything to make the majority of people suddenly wake up to using a paladin tank.  It took thing and one thing only...the fact that PoP mobs hit hard, making slowing early in the fight a necessity.  Well, that and the high exp you recieved.  It wasn't a direct upgrade, it was an indirect effect of the setup they decided to use instead of just giving mobs yet more hp and ac.  Now that people actually know that Knights can tank, they need to lessen that advantage a bit.<br />
However, it suddenly occured to me, although it may just be from lack of sleep, the solution to the agro situation may not be in a direct nerf...but as indirect an effect as the damage output situation was.  <br />
<br />
Think about it.  PoP has incredible experience, so therefor people are going to flock there to get an incredibly amount of exp in a short amount of time.  However, mobs hit hard, making slowing a priority.  Knights have the agro abilities to hold agro through slowings, Warriors can't do that as fast.  People realize this, and understand that Knights are their key to fast exp...they begin to realize that, yes, Knights can tank.<br />
<br />
What happens when the challenge changes from hard-hitting mobs to simply getting through an area in a certain amount of time?  Slows aren't a priority as much anymore, the agro lock suddenly isn't as needed.  However, knights have proven that they can tank and people will use them.  And now, with a timer on the missions, the one main benefit of the pure melee classes can hopefully begin to become apparent: mana-less abilities.  All they really need to do now is make it where people WANT to go here...through the rewards or exp or something.<br />
<br />
I wonder how things will work out with this setup....I really do.<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
/agree Glatius<br />
<br />
Are pure melee really so powerful that they need to give the other 11 classes new spells and new lines of spells just to make them equal to the uberness of the 3 mana-less classes?<br />
<br />
Just who is(are) the melee guy(s) anyways?  What'd they do, lock him(them) in a closet?  I know the rogue board had access to a guy who worked on the rogues who would listen to their issues and actually knew what he was talking about, but that was a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know?<br />
<br />
My prediction tho:  Pet classes will suddenly become more useful. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, a couple replies...<br />
<br />
On Fennin Ro, there's already almost 10 warriors sitting around LFG during prime time... last night was 11 lvl 65 players LFG, 6 warriors.  I've seen as many as 8 lvl 65 warriors sitting for over an hour LFG, before they log off.  It's only going to continue to get worse imo.<br />
<br />
I don't see how aggro lock is going to somehow 'loose importance'... or how not being able to get snap aggro by click a button 99% of the time isn't an massive advantage.  I've been in plenty of exp groups in PoP that have Pal/SK tanks and I've never had them 'need to med' so I don't see mana slowing them down.  They will use mana for their most useful/powerful spells (ie: taunt) and use their melee to do damage, not spells (cept some dots from sk).  Any amount of ping ponging aggro is a massive loss of melee DPS, specially if you have rogues.  A bit of ping pong in a fight can drop a rogue's DPS for the fight by a good 20-80 DPS, do that 1/3 of the fights in an 'instance' and you'll loose a solid 10 minutes...<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, it's basically the same old story though... if the warrior doesn't have 2x better equip/gear than every other melee in the group, he's going to stuggle to keep/hold aggro.  If you've got rogues, monks, pal, sk, etc w/ superior weapons to the warrior, you're going to end up with a hell of a lot of ping pong aggro (and the war will be pretty close to worthless).  Course there's always the one trick pony route... /disc def...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm right there with you Glatius, its why I'm not buying LDON. By all acounts that I have heard now, LDON is going to be paladin playland with the undead. Any of you who buy it, let me know what its like to be passed over yet again for a paladin because of the undead.<br />
<br />
I'll be off lfg (ha), causing lag at raids, or leveling my necro. But my 22.95 (27.95 after the 9th) is staying in my pocket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, let alone LDON, last time I even logged my warrior on is almost a month ago.<br />
<br />
I think they have gone way too far in overpowering other tanking classes. Itemisation is just too big of a problem now IMO. I am not for nerfs though because no class wants to be hella nerfed, I blame SOE for not being smart enough to think before putting a few things into the game.<br />
<br />
The crap thing is if I am honest with myself I do not know if I will even like it if they upgrade our aggro to close to that of classes that can tank (which now seems to even extend to freaking beastlords).  It would dummy down the game for me and I think I would probably get bored faster. And even then the other tank classes have 100% aggro lock, so their utility will probably still be more desired than excess tanking. <br />
<br />
Tanking in EQ is really fubar at the moment, and being screwed out of everything just so I am required for mobs that need defensive is just not worth it to me anymore. <br />
<br />
Its really going to be interesting how SOE get out of this one without balancing content in lacking classes favor (ala kunark as an example). Absor is crazy or just flat out lying if he thinks  balancing tactics with expansions has not been used before.<br />
<br />
Anyways I don't know what the answer is anymore, they have let this go too long to the point where other classes think its ridiculous that the main tanking class who give up everything else should be more desired for a tank role in anything other than when defensive is required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ldon, lots of undead, I don't think many warriors will stand a chance lfg there, unless of course defensive is required.<br />

What I would have said would be &quot;We will not buy LDoN until fundemental changes are made to Warriors in the game in general.  When this happens I'll buy the expandsion.&quot;<br />
<br />
A company has little modivation to do something if you say &quot;do this or screw off&quot;.  They have much more modivation if you &quot;I won't buy till you do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for undead (I'm not sure why its being discussed here), I've always wanted SOE to push for more complex, stronger undead.  Why?  Its justification for having a bunch of anti-undead powers.<br />
<br />
There is at least one theme that is nearly all undead.  There is at least one theme that has nearly no undead.  It should balance out.</div></div><hr />

The only thing we can hope for is that all the paladins go to the one purely undead dungeon, leaving us and the SKs to tank the others.</div></div><hr />

Too bad the dungeons are instanced, and there's no limit to the number of people that can go to a given dungeon.<br />
<br />
This means that because of the warriors vision of a fix being a continued fixation on a traditional group and refusal to consider anything that could help with tank stacking, since people would make rogues if they wanted DPS classes or something, and the massive oversupply of warriors because playing a support class isn't cool or something, the problem will never be solved.<br />

Or the more appropriate answer is, we don't think it's appropriate to change warrior's role in EQ just to artificially inflate Knights' sense of self-importance, and keep you where you want to be rather than where you were designed to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am tired of this incompetent attitude that groups should take more than one tanking class. Give me a fucking break, there are 15 god forsaken classes in this game and  TWO OF THE SIX SLOTS IN A GROUP BEING FILLED BY ONLY THREE CLASSES IS NOT GOOD FOR THE GAME, PERIOD. Do you comprehend that? Is that penetrating your thick skulls?<br />
<br />
You know why we re-enforce the tank, slower, healer, dps, dps, dps group model? Because, ideally, it gives ever class in the fucking game an even shot for a group slot. There are only three tank classes, they get one slot of a group to fight over, there are only three healer classes, they get one slot to fight over, there are four slowing classes ( Bards are rare enough to let this work~ ) And there are how many fucking dps classes? let me think: about half of the classes in the game! Therefore: half of the slots in a group will be for dps classes. OMFG! Its shocking!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors don't need to change their roll at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, if there are 3 tank classes, 3 healing classes and 4 slowing classes, that makes, um, 10*.  So there are 6 DPS classes by extension (15 - 9 = 6).  6** DPS classes for 3 slots in the group.<br />
<br />
Warriors win at math too.<br />
<br />
And Frodlin, where exactly were knights designed to be? If it's not competing with the tank slot for warriors - which we can finally do after 3 years, it's LFG, depending on how you mean design.  Don't even bother spouting that crap about utility, because looking at Varaho's ideal group I don't see a utility spot anywhere.<br />
<br />
* 9 actually since you count shaman as healers and slowers unless you are counting paladins as tanks and healers and shaman as just slowers<br />
<br />
** it's actually 7 DPS classes if you count BST as a DPS class as well as slowers.<br />
<br />
See a problem here yet? 2 classes have 2 roles to take in a group. None of them are tanks.  The tank slot has the most classes competing for it, and, wonder of wonders, the worst competition for the slot. Especially since the slot was just opened to something besides one class in PoP.<br />
<br />
And it pretty much confirms everything I see playing the game too.  Too goddamn many melees, not enough support classes.  I don't ever get blind tells for groups as my ever so uber shadowknight, but I get constantly bombarded if I log on my shaman or cleric (well, I did, I put them role).  And most groups I have when I do play my shaman are 5 melees (not DPS classes either) expecting my shaman to keep everything slowed, them fully healed and buffed, where's my haste and oh can we pull faster the exp sucks here.<br />
<br />
Let me try this again for the slow learners.  Warriors do not have group problems because the class sucks (which isn't to say it's perfect now).  Warriors have group problems because there is too much competition for the tank slot, from other warriors and knights, and a disproportionate number of plate melees even disregarding the fact that they are competing for the most difficult spot.  The aggro problems you want fixed will not fix your problems.  <br />
<br />
There will still be too few clerics and shaman and enchanters to go around (especially since 2 of the classes are proficient soloers - one of them so excessively so that taking a group hurts their exp rate). The druids, of coure, will still probably be soloing since that's a druid thing - less so lately. Try checking guild rosters, it'll be pretty obvious what I mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I can tell you where Knights were meant to be, but first let's re-lablel group slots -<br />
<br />
Cleric - intended to be the best healer in the game.<br />
Warrior - intended to be the best MT in the game.<br />
4 other slots<br />
<br />
Yep, 4 slots for any class that accepts an invite. Ideally groups should include in their 6 members a slower, crowd control, mana regen (not needed if casters get KEI or better ahead of time and have FT) patch healer, and DPS (but every class can produce some DPS).<br />
<br />
So where does this leave Paladins? Lessee, chain stunning provides some limited slowing of the mob (can even work like snare), you can do DPS, you can stun, offtank and root for crowd control, and you can patch heal. Why it looks to me like your class is an excellent choice to add to a group and you've got 4 chances to be selected out of 6 - schweeeet deal!!<br />
<br />
Now I'll admit that if we are in CoD I want a Paladin to MT. But if we are doing PoEarthA I suggest he either recognizes or goes and plays in easier zones where he can pretend to be a big dog.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm not claiming that you shouldn't be able to form a group without a Warrior and a Cleric, but it should be less effective and often is.<br />
<br />
Only the existance of high experiance zones where the mobs hit like sissies and groups that don't exercise aggro control have let Paladins become the prefered MT. <br />
<br />
If everyone is to have a chance to play, then there are going to be a lot of sub-optimal groups. Aggro at a distance, snap aggro on demand, and being able to hold aggro as well as Knights IS necessary for Warriors to do equally as well in such groups.<br />

<br />
No.  Let me be absolutely unequivocal on this.  No.<br />
<br />
If warriors won't be happy until they have a lock on one of the two slots in a group and the other 13 classes fight for 4 slots, the answer will be no.  Warriors will spend the rest of their lives unhappy, because that will never happen.  Ever.  If this is what you think is balanced, you are, simply put, morons.  If this is what you really think, I can't blame SoE for completely and totally ignoring what you want out of your class. You deserve no less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a red herring though.  Group composition is determined by minimum acceptable configuration to get reasonable amounts of exp, &quot;optimal composition&quot; and who's actually LFG.<br />
<br />
Like splaktar said, during his sample period, 15 LFG, 9 are warriors.  Guess what.  the 6 others LFG are not enough to support the 9 warriors.  9 warriors need 9 healers, 9 slowers and 27 DPS classes to form 9 optimal groups.  That's 45 people, and only 6 more LFG. If it was 9 SKs LFG instead of 9 warriors, it would still be the same underlying problem.<br />
<br />
Is the problem warrior desirability? Possibly, but seems to me like it's a problem with plate classes LFG not warriors LFG.<br />
<br />
If you fix the complete unstackability of tanks in groups, you fix the warrior LFG problem.  You just want groups, right? Tired of sitting LFG, willing to take any chance to get a group? That's a fixable problem.  Making warrior the only choice for tank again isn't fixable (that is, it won't happen).  Because even though you swear up and down you don't want to go back to Kunark, making warriors the only tank is Kunark again.</div></div><hr />

You see, it's not just the paladins and necromancers who will want to play with the ghosties... fighting undead has some real attractions for clerics too, since fighting undead means that any level 65 cleric has a 26/18 weapon, a 4 ratio nuke with a -100 resist check, a range of DoT's and the ability to invis, with no downsides.  I know for certain that many clerics will want to focus on the undead content.<br />
<br />
Since there's no competition for that content in instanced dungeons, I can foresee clerics sticking conditions like &quot;Mistmoore ONLY please&quot; on their LFG flags, which logically means they're looking to group with paladins.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you that warriors shouldn't ask for nor receive a &quot;lock&quot; on tanking in exp groups.  That was the BS in Kunark, and it's the BS that's going on today in PoP with Paladins/SK's.   Neither situation is ok.<br />
<br />
What is reasonable is that the following formula shoudl apply<br />
<br />
Knight Aggro + Melee Offfence + Melee Defense <br />
<br />
Is EQUAL to<br />
<br />
Warrior Aggro + Melee Offense + Melee Defense<br />
<br />
Special Skills (/shield, disciplines) are a wash with spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Currently, this is not the case and it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Kiztent, your statement that the problem isn't the inherent undesirability of warriors, but instead that it's the overabundance of plate classes in general;  well, you're sort of right.  There ARE a lot of plate classes looking for a limited number of group slots.  However...  in those plate classes, taken as a group, the warriors are the weak sister of the bunch.  That means that while sure, knights may also have problems finding a group because there aren't enough support classes to group everyone, it still also means that warriors won't be getting their 1/3 share *or however many it works out to, purely numbers wise*, of groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Frodlin,<br />
<br />
The problem is that the ability of Knights to get aggro from a distance, snap aggro on demand, and a fairly dependable aggro lock is not going to be removed. It's affects Warriors starting in the mid-50's (when the available equipment starts to close the meaningful AC and HP gap).<br />
<br />
A start (although it would nerf the heck out of CHoS, etc /weep) would be to make most blue mobs immune to stun and a few other spells and no aggro be produced (or make them summon). Since Paladins have a Taunt Button and can wield BoC, BoW, etc spells like Root would still be more than adequate balance for AE Taunt.<br />
<br />
An alternative to what amounts to nerfing Knights is to give Warriors barely adequate matching capability. Kick and Slam having a chance to Stun and a way of establishing ranged aggro - arrows/bow with a Hate proc, vendor sold Swollen Fungusbeast Gland, etc.<br />
<br />
Finally, I suppose a radical overhaul could give Warriors and Knights parity as experiance group MT's while insuring all would be useful in groups when not doing it (DPS boost?).<br />
<br />
If there's another path, I'd be delighted to hear about it.<br />

Who's to say they're not?<br />

The problem with PoP is that it's all about aggro.  No ifs, ands or buts.  Given that my normal grouping is me (61 SK) 2 boxing a slower (59 shaman) or a cleric (57), a 62 warrior and the first 3 people in guild LFG, I feel very comfortable discussing the differences in between knights and warriors.  Simply put, warrior defense (even without defensive) is a HUGE advantage for them.  <br />
<br />
Aggro is passable for a warrior (realizing I don't exp in PoP at all and my shaman can handle exp mobs in the zones I hunt until taunt does work). A GSoT proc will lock aggro well enough to slow without losing much sleep. Taunt does work. Not perfect, but it does work. Since I'm not a crack addled KEI junkie, it's actually my preferred aggro method in exp groups. <br />
<br />
Now, if you are in a zone where slow has to land before the mob is in camp because it will two round casters, therein, and only there, lies the problem.<br />
<br />
The aggro gap is nothing new, yet it didn't make a damn bit of difference until 3rd tier PoP. This tells me not that aggro is broken, but that the 3rd tier of PoP is. Again, you are trying to fix the wrong problem.  <br />
<br />
Try worrying about how tanks stack and breaking the absolute dependance of groups on early slows.<br />
<br />
Offense is well, simply put, who the hell cares.  I'm usually grouped with necros and wizards for DPS. You could jack warrior DPS 50 percent and it's not going to make a difference once the necros start slapping DoTs on in kill speed. Not to mention a 65 wizard with SCF3, SCFM2 and ID4.  Blam, 4k, thanks for coming. Anyway, you and others have said warriors are not a DPS class, so I'm going to call offense a red herring.<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way: If you could hold aggro reliably without doing a single point of damage (and couldn't do a single point of damage in exchange), would that make you more or less desirable for groups?<br />
<br />
Defense, there's no comparision.  Well, actually there is.  I have SCF2, ToL1 and SA1.  This means my lifetap procs will almost bridge the difference in number of complete heals needed per unit time with a warrior 4 levels lower than I am (and no AA).<br />
<br />
Slow is game breaking in PoP.  Try moving out of PoP zones for exp and you'll find there's still a noticable edge for warriors.<br />
<br />
Zito: hope that addresses your comments.  I group a lot with a warrior (several in fact since my thoughts on too damn many plate classes are based on watching LFG in guild), I don't see them as a broken or weak class. I'm willing to believe there are problems in 3rd tier PoP, but I've yet to see anything requet that even begins to address that problem without reverting to the warrior is the only tank mentality.<br />
<br />
Battleblade: You can call me whatever you like, I will never ever budge from my stance that a group is a warrior, cleric and whatever 4 classes are priviledged enough to group with them is moronic. As I said, if you consider that balanced, warriors deserve to be ignored. And nerfing stuns won't make a damn bit of difference to how I generate aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who said warriors want to be the only choice for the tank slot? Stop acting stupid.  Knights are already tanking Gods in  POP, nothing is going to change that unless they get directly nerfed big time.<br />

What defense? We have the exact same defense skill as knights. The only difference is more innate hp and other higher skills (dodge, parry. riposte). Its not HUGE by any means.<br />

Your aggro spell is 50 mana, kei or no kei I am sure you can get by.<br />

<br />
Quote:-&quot;Now, if you are in a zone where slow has to land before the mob is in camp because it will two round casters, therein, and only there, lies the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stop using extremities. I see this a lot from knights. Firstly again warriors do not want knights to not be able to tank at all anymore, if you had any sense that would just not be possible unless there was a huuuuge nerf which is just not going to happen. Secondly slow does not HAVE to land on inc, its just more mana intensive and defeats the purpose of a so called better tank. This is due to proc aggro unreliability.<br />
<br />
Quote:-&quot;The aggro gap is nothing new, yet it didn't make a damn bit of difference until 3rd tier PoP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lol, you obviously were not around during Luclin when warriors started to bring up this very concern, even before POP. Knights had big increases during that time through upgrades and aa, and warriors were starting to see it.  I still believe it was one of the main reasons SOE made POP mobs hit so hard, but like I said earlier they forgot about how important they just made aggro by doing it. Knights always did have the aggro advantage, but the difference in classes was a lot bigger then. People are not going to complain about one classes ability when they are really bad off in others (which most admit knights were pretty bad off in Kunark and Velious).<br />
<br />
Quote:&quot; This tells me not that aggro is broken, but that the 3rd tier of PoP is. Again, you are trying to fix the wrong problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good conclusion. You just freaking admitted it was all about aggro in POP, admitted knights have a huge advantage there, then cannot seem to understand why warriors see a problem and feel its not out of whack at all.<br />
<br />
Quote:-&quot;Offense is well, simply put, who the hell cares. I'm usually grouped with necros and wizards for DPS.

Blam, 4k, thanks for coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
The difference is casters and dps classes have to hold back with warriors, with knights they have far more room to  destroy things quicker, which again like the slow example defeats the purpose of a so called better tank.<br />
<br />
Quote:-&quot; Anyway, you and others have said warriors are not a DPS class, so I'm going to call offense a red herring.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well if you stop arguing black and white arguments and use your brain maybe you would understand. We rely on our dps a lot to get aggro, that does not mean we are chosen for DPS in groups, but it is still a  part of us getting aggro.<br />
<br />
Quote:-&quot;Let me put it this way: If you could hold aggro reliably without doing a single point of damage (and couldn't do a single point of damage in exchange), would that make you more or less desirable for groups?&quot;<br />
<br />
More desired, its another usable facet, especially if you can get aggro at range before doing any single point of mellee damage and before the mob has arrived in the camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are a specialist class, it has just been proven that knights who were crying that their versatility is useless were full of shit. Knights should be taken over a Warrior in a group if the group DESIRES more versatility (which they often do) along with lesser tankability in one slot.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for SOE and seemingly &quot;head under the ground knights&quot;, they cannot seem to comprehend that aggro is a part of tanking, not a part of verstility. And thanks to the huge gap increases in other areas of tankability and the huge importance of aggro in POP, well its about time I think that warriors get an improvement in aggro. And if knights who often like to call warriors stupid cannot comprehend how this will not destroy their class and make them unable to tank, well they can wear the dummy hat themselves.<br />

<br />
I clearly stated that IMO a optimal group starts with the best healer in the game and the best MT. It is entirely possible to make a group without these foundation classes, but it should be at a cost - at this time there is no cost when a Knight MT's for most experiance groups, only advantages. This is unbalanced.<br />
<br />
When an SK MT's he takes more damage. The Cleric might have to heal more and it's possible hard hitting mobs might get lucky and kill him if his FD fails when he gets in trouble. But with WAR SHD PAL/all armor, AA's, FT, KEI, etc. there is no meaningful disadvantage in choosing an SK to MT in any pre-planar zone.<br />
<br />
Just to skim the surface SK's can pull, hold an unshakable aggro lock not only on the mob being tanked but multiple mobs if need be, snare, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
The Warrior AC/HP advantage is meaningless for the most part and the SK spells gives him overwhelming advantages.<br />
<br />
This is unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately SK spells are part and parcel of what makes an SK a successful class. Nerfing them in any way is unthinkable. The only way of restoring balance so that all three tank classes perform as well (using experiance rate as the measure) is to improve key weaknesses in the Warrior class.<br />
<br />
Despite my post asserting Warriors should be the prefered MT, that position is as wrong as asserting Knights should be. Balance is necessary. SoE should at least let Warriors be equal as experiance group MT's and give them more DPS or something to make them acceptable in the non-MT positions as well.<br />
<br />
Things are not right at the moment and hybrids should not tank as well (melee, defence, and abilities) as Warriors AND have a book full of spells to assist them in balancing out non-existant difficiencies.<br />
<br />
And btw, calling people moron does not make your argument more pursusive nor diminish theirs. You are wrong and name-calling won't change it.<br />

Your question as to &quot;who's to say they're not&quot; is ridiculous, as YOU should even know that just about everybody says they're not equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I agree there is a problem Daemonwynd, I just don't think that we're looking in the right place for a fix.  Right now, snap aggro is overrated.  In a world where early slows weren't completely essential, the disparity might be less obvious and the warrior advantages could again come to the front - just like every expansion previous to PoP when early slows weren't essential and just like every PoP raid (bar 2 I believe) where the warrior is still the tank - aggro problem or no aggro problem.<br />
<br />
Snap aggro hasn't changed and it's nothing new. The only change is the relative weighting for it in certain exp groups.  Fix that and you come pretty close to fixing the desirability problem.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat that.  Snap aggro is not new. Did you see knights getting groups for snap aggro before PoP? I know I didn't.<br />
<br />
The dynamic has changed with KEI from mana conservation to rapid mana use.  Couple that with the need for fast slows, and the relative weight of the 3 skills changes. This changes the perception in EVERY group, regardless of the truth of the matter. Just like before PoP when snap aggro didn't make a lick of difference in group selecton. KEI, mana preservation focus, FT items, that's the problem.<br />
<br />
Reducing the knight's edge in snap aggro removes the one advantage they have over warriors. That's not a balancing fix. That's a go back to Kunark holy trinity fix. You all can yammer about utility until you are blue in the face, but that's a load of hogwash, and you ought to know it. There's no utility slot in an optimal exp group.<br />
<br />
I still think it would be best to look at tank stacking, but I guess that's a lost cause here.  1 group, 1 tank, 1 warrior seems to be the rallying cry here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I believe aggro at a distance, snap aggro, and aggro lock are significant independent of the mechanics of class balance in experiance groups -<br />
<br />
Weak aggro lock promotes risk during combat and the tension that arises from confirmation of that risk when the MT loses aggro.<br />
<br />
Snap aggro and aggro at a distance allow for an aggro recovery period that engenders feelings of relief and accomplishment when we regain control and disapointment when we fail.<br />
<br />
Combat is intended to provide the emotional peaks and valleys needed to make the game enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Knight aggro lock is too strong, unless another source of risk accompanies it (possible death of the MT), to engender a sense of tension during combat. Only the death of the mob (a foregone conclusion) provides a limited sense of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro recovery is chaotic with the innocent very often punished along with the guilty. It does not promote feelings of relief and accomplishment, but rather disaster temporarily averted.<br />
<br />
I give SoE credit for being senstive to some design issues we are aware of but don't give sufficient weight to when proposing changes.<br />
<br />
Warriors have been advocates of Tank Stacking forever. Most of us believe that in a 6 person group a Warrior MT and Knight Offtank is one of the most powerful combinations in the game. <br />
<br />
Or are you again suggesting Wariors bow to the supremacy of Knights as exp MT's and try to compete with Wizards, Monks, Rogues, and Rangers for DPS slots with 0 utility to offset inferior DPS? Cute.<br />

<br />
Sorry, not true.  At least not for me.  What I see if warriors, sensing finally the aggro gap, asking for things to remove it (not even, remove) while holding on to their advantages in DPS (over paladins anyway), mitigation, HP and disciplines.  So, what exactly does that leave for knights to do then? Taking away the knights one advantage, as overimportant as it is in PoP, and leaving the rest of the warrior advantages intact is, quite simply, not balance.  Unless you propose to totally revamp the knight classes to become DPS classes, which I have never seen suggested (well, once).<br />
<br />
Your suggestion that paladins can serve as effective slowers in a group because of stun is inane.  You'll pardon me if I look at that as a serious warrior suggestion for balance and disbelieve anything that emerges from your mouth after that.</div></div><hr />

Call it what you want Frodlin, but every suggestion I've seen from warriors is along the lines of &quot;we need aggro like knights.&quot;  That leaves the knights with what advantage again? Lower HP? Less AC? Less damage?<br />
<br />
Wait, I remember now, there's 4 free slots for the 13 classes left after every group get its warrior and cleric.  That's your vision of balance, it makes such perfect sense now.<br />
<br />
Certainly knights having no advantage over warriors is nothing like bringing back the exp penalty, but the fact it, knights won't get group invites without some advantage. And we're talking about that aspect of the dark days.<br />
<br />
So what exactly do you want the complete unwillingness of warriors to accept any competition for the tank slot to be called?

Actually.... let's see, paladins would still be similar tanks to warriors, only more versatile and more volatile (i.e. Stunning will still stop melee damage, and heals will still land).<br />

<br />
It seems to be your contention that Knights must have significant superiority to Warriors as far as group attractiveness is concerned in order to compete.  It's necessary they be the preferred tank class (as they currently are) under most circumstances and if they're not, then they'll be returned to being unwanted and LFG (like Warriors are now).<br />
<br />
Well I'll tell you Kiztent, I don't think that giving Warriors an improvement in aggro control is going to be as big a kick in the teeth to Knights as you fear.  I won't deny that it would impact the Knight's ability to get groups, to a degree, but mostly that is because right now they have an unreasonable lock on PoP tanking.  Making it more balanced would mean Knights get fewer groups because Warriors would be getting more.   This shouldn't mean that Knights are overlooked altogether.<br />

A typical Knight approach on this debate, one I abhor.  You point to all the Warrior advantages and make them an issue.  Yet ignore all your advantages.  Healing, buffing, root, and stuns.  We have a marginal, very marginal advantage in AC.   It's almost to the point of making no difference at all.  We do slightly more damage than a Paladin, but every other class in the game does more damage than we do.  So trying to claim that people are picking Warriors for DPS is a red herring.  They're not and they don't.  They pick Warriors for tanking, DPS is an extra.  Just like you rightly claim that they pick Palainds for tanking, and heals are an extra.  And obviously our greater HP isn't enough to offset your aggro generation, or we wouldn't be having this discussion.  Even if the aggro generation gap closed, the HP difference is still relatively small.  Usually one Paladin cast fast heal makes up that difference.  And how often do you really need to heal yourself in a group?  If you're not doing it frequently, then the HP difference doesn't have much impact.  And if you're doing it frequently, then your ability to heal yourself is allowing you to compete with the Warrior's HP advantage.<br />
<br />
Your major concern seems to be that closing the aggro gap will doom Paladins to being an outcast again and the butt of jokes.  I don't think this fear is completely rational and I certainly don't believe it's justified.  Paladins do have abilities that counter balance those areas where they are weak compared to a Warrior.  Allowing both to have reasonable aggro control won't change that.</div></div><hr />

That's not necessarily a bad thing, have you looked at BoT recently?<br />
<br />
I think the answer is to make any mob that hits for less than 800 light blue at level 60 - a real tank ought to be able to handle that easy :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Bazzal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Here is my take on knight v Warrior tanking in a XP group in PoP<br />
<br />
<br />
On cleric mana and healing<br />
<br />
With a warrior tanking you need to give him a few seconds to get agro against an unslowed mob where as with a knight you can slow right off and the cleric will have to do the about same amount of healing with ether tanking. Sure the warrior takes less damage per hit but the knight was hit a lot less times.<br />
<br />
On slowing and nuking<br />
<br />
With a warrior tanking you have to wait till the mobs well agroed before you can slow and wait even longer before a nuking class can nuke hard. But take a knight and you can slow before the mobs even had a swing at the knight and you can start nuking like a mad thing almost as soon as you see the mobs hp drop.<br />
<br />
So with a knight you can kill a mob much quicker than with a warrior tanking so the mob gets even let chance to swing at the tank further removing any and all difference in the damage taken compared with a warrior in indeed I would go as far and say a knight is taking much less damage per mob than the warrior.<br />
<br />
The conclusions <br />
<br />
It not just that knight can lock down agro and it not just that they can tank and rightly so as there a plate class. Nor is it solely a mater of poor warrior agro. You have to add all the caster upgrades over the last few expansions from better nuke better mana regain grater need for slow and the ever efficient complete heal and fast heals. <br />
<br />
And if the caster are able to keep up a DPS over a long period of time well in excess of even the most uber warriors agro control abilities but with in the most mediocre of knights witch one off the two is going to lose out when LFG.<br />
<br />
The definition of a tank with the advent of PoP has changed from absorbing the mobs damage till the tank and the rest of the party could kill it.<br />
<br />
To keeping the mob from killing the rest of the party while the mobs gets slowed then blows into little bits. <br />
<br />
And there in lies the problem warriors defensive and evasive and all the hit points and AC in the game will no change that fact there utterly useless if the mobs not hitting warrior.<br />
<br />
I dont know what the fix may be a skill that will not work on boss mobs to stop the much out cried dumbing down of the game to different agro modifiers but what ever the fix may be I feel it should scale up from a level 1 warrior to the raiding level 65 warrior.</div></div><hr />
