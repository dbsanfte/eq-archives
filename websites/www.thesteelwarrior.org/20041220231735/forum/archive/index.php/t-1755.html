<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already mentioned this idea, but not on the War Room board.<br />
<br />
I've seen lots of ideas about dealing aggro when wanted.<br />
But none so far seem to talk about a simple control over your proc.<br />
<br />
Taming your weapon, turning the weapon's skill into a skill, which refreshes every say.. 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
1 proc every 12 second... that wouldnt be very unbalancing would it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Could also make it, so that once the Weapon's proc is &quot;Tamed&quot;, you can wield another weapon with another proc...<br />
allowing a warrior to proc up to 3 different spells (armor procs excluded) - Primary, Offhand, Skill -<br />
This considering that you have earned such weapons that hold the proc.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
Tame Weapon:<br />
---<br />
- The warriors have learnt how to tame the wild spirits that inhabit many magical weapons.<br />
<br />
Reuse time : 24 hours (ingame)<br />
Duration : Unlimited<br />
<br />
Effect : Creates a hotkey named &quot;Command&quot;.<br />
<br />
--Command hotkey--<br />
<br />
Reuse : 12 seconds<br />
<br />
Effect: The effect of this hotkey is the Combat effect, which the Primary weapon posessed at the time where Tame Weapon was used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the duration is unlimited then why the 24 hour re-use on it? <br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be easier to just give warriors commandable procs every 12 seconds? This could be abused with the right proccing weapons I would imagine. I'm not sure which ones off the top of my head, but I'm sure someone would find a way to use it outside the design intent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another thing I found funny is that every other duel weilding classes epic has haste built into it (except bard perhaps?)<br />
<br />
kinda off topic sorry :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 24 hour reuse time, is there, so that you can't change your &quot;Command&quot; hotbutton any time you like.<br />
<br />
Once you make such a hotbutton, you're stuck with it for 24 hours, so choose it carefully.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, you could also have a weapon proc on command, that's the simpler alternative to this skill :p<br />
But you would have to be wielding such a weapon at the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
and ordering a weapon proc every 12 seconds CANT be unbalancing.<br />
Weapons can proc 3 or 4 times in the first 12 seconds...<br />
i dont see where one additional  proc is going to be exploited in any way.<br />
<br />
But now that i think of it, having the primary weapon proc on command, is better then the idea suggested above.<br />
It's less attractive though ;p... but simpler and more digestable by devs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm as far as I know, only the monkie epic has a clickie.<br />
<br />
Everything else is either equip or proc.<br />
<br />
Its only the heavy melee (Warrior, SK, Pally) who don't get haste effects on their epics. LOL any maybe bard... or maybe not. Their weird like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">noodle - click..<br />
duck - click...<br />
leafblower - click..<br />
snakee - click...<br />
shaman spear - click...<br />
monk gloves - click..<br />
mage - click..<br />
wizard - click...<br />
bard - click..<br />
<br />
ranger 41% haste<br />
rogue 41% haste<br />
beastlord 41% haste<br />
<br />
And as already stated, the heavy tanks have no haste on epics</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caeden</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the overall idea, but I came up with something slightly different.<br />
<br />
Lets say you get an extra slot in your inventory screen for your proc.  You can put any weapon in that slot, and that weapon's proc will be the proc that goes off when you press the macro.  Let's say that you need to keep the weapon in your proc slot in you're inventory at least (so you can't lend your BoC to your friend, let him use the EB proc without having the weapon)<br />
<br />
We'll say that you get the skill at 51, and the max skill for a warrior is 200.  The success rate is totally dependant upon the skill, and nothing else (no dex, or any of that crap), lets say with a max 200 skill, the success rate will be 2/3 the time, so every time you press the button, you have a X% chance of you're proc going off based on you're proc skill.<br />
<br />
We'll keep the refresh the same at 12 seconds, so you can click this proc once every 12 seconds, I decided to throw out the 24 hour thing, cuz this made more sense (to me anyways).<br />
<br />
Of course other classes are gonna bitch about wanting this too.....and I'm not trying to sound unreasonable, so let's say all other melee get a max skill of 100 or 150, keep their success rate at 1/3 or 1/2.<br />
<br />
I dunno, it's just a thought that came to me when I read this post.<br />
I personally like it, but I know there are those of you that think this is the stupidest thing you have ever read, so feel free to flame away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha sorry just can stop laughing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not the proc of the Bard weapon that is the 'fuck you' to Warriors, its the usefulness of it.  It is every musical instrument, no longer do they need to shuffle Lute's, Flute's, Banjo's and Tamborine's around.<br />
<br />
People continue to defend the uselessness of our Epic with the 'its from 3 expansions ago, what can you expect?' line.  I can expect it to be UTILITY USEFUL like damn near every other class Epic.  Given, the Knight's shared our 'fuck you' on that one.  *shrug*.  All they'd have to do for us is make the blue blade a clicky, and let it stack nicely.  Been /feedbacking that forever, join me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jear</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks not usable with Encs lvl 61+<br />
Rangers Not usable much well why.. since it is almost demanded that they have EQ am 3 and use bow all the time.<br />
Rogues Not the best of ratio daggers and with pop it isn't hard to get better about as hard as it is to get a better agro weapon for a warrior.<br />
Wizard. No daubt about it. One of the most usable epics in the game rais group solo can only be replaced if there is a beastlord.<br />
Druid Right click dot .. dot umm well always more damage nice, but it is a slow dot <br />
Shaman same as druid <br />
Cleric very good epic .... when you need to res ..<br />
SKs and Paladins crap epics except for the looks<br />
Bards yes very nice weapon due to the instrument part and well to be honest only fair they get such an epic.<br />
Enchanter .. Crap after pop. right click haste well umm what melee would use a lesser haste?<br />
Mage well Nice epic. Usable yes. but with the new pets its usabilety is geatly redused<br />
Necro. Great for grouping Soloing. Nothing like mana free dot and snare. good item<br />
Beastlord easy to find better weapons.<br />
<br />
To be honest you warriors aren't realy as fucked up with your epic as you pretend to be. Nearly every melee epic is out dated. Rangers use their epic mostly for atk. Rogues keep their epic unless they got a Ssra or BoT or better weapon. Bards are forsed to keep their epic due to intrument reasons. getting slaped in the face then it is the wizards, Mages and Necroes you should be mad about. They don't have to equip it. Only when they need the effect. Bards have to use epic all the time even if they find a better weapon due to the effect. Only if you get elemental armor and some pop weapons can you find some new instrument kind of thing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This would be one hell of a fix, sure I'll take a ToD proc stuck in there, who needs a slower?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't really see any downside of this idea.<br />
<br />
People may think its overpowering if warriors can suddenly replace slowers.<br />
Well its only a 50% slow, and it will have a 12 second recast if it's resisted, and you have to HAVE such a weapon which is no easy thing :p.<br />
<br />
With such a skill,<br />
Warriors can become powerfull if time is devoted into them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Controlling a warriors proc would fix many many things: <br />
<br />
- Fix the aggro nicely, without stepping on Knight's toes <br />
The proc can be used for snap aggro, or taking advance in aggro after a taunt.<br />
But only every 12 seconds, thus still giving wizards a limit they wouldnt have with knights.<br />
<br />
- Make Warriors a lot more appealing.<br />
Warriors with the correct equipment could become very appealing for groups. Replace unavailable slowers, snarers.<br />
As well as giving warriors a possibility of soloing decently.. though still being the worse class at such a thing :p<br />
<br />
- Give warriors a bit of needed Versatility<br />
Dont tell me you all love spending 4 hours in an exp group pressing just Kick and Taunt.<br />
It can get very mind numbing very fast.<br />
Having warriors choose between snaring, reslowing, getting more aggro etc... Can make things a bit more exciting for warriors.<br />
<br />
- Giving a Lifting to a few old world items<br />
Quite a few weapons already existing out there will have a sudden new meaning to their procs.<br />
Getting a few stacking dot weapons etc...<br />
<br />
- Allowing for more easy fixes in the futur<br />
Its a lot more easier to fix spells for SOE, then fixing skills etc...<br />
Reason we're seeing so many new spells while melees are still in the dark.<br />
With such an ability, adding in certain weapons will be nice fixes and upgrades to warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imo, such an ability would fix most of the problems that warriors are having atm...<br />
Maybe just the Disciplines would be left to be looked at.</div></div><hr />
