<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mynka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warriors need to be fixed.  I know this, you know this.<br />
<br />
I've read some ideas on this and other boards, and some of them are pretty good, some are just nuts...  But if Warriors are going to be fixed Sony needs to look beyond just fixing Warriors.  They are going to have to look at the Knight's as well, how will changes made to Warriors effect Knights, how will changes made to Knights effect Warriors.<br />
<br />
Below are my ideas...<br />
<br />
1) Taunt needs to work.  IMHO the whole taunt system needs to be redone.  Taunt needs to work to the point that when the tank presses the taunt button he/she can be reasonably sure that he/she is going to get aggro.  I do not think this should be 100%, but as the tank gains levels their success rate should climb (my opinion is by the mid 50's a tank should have ~80% chance of a successful taunt each time the button is pressed).  1b) Taunt needs to have more range, perhaps the range increases as the tank levels, but the tank needs to be able to at least have a freakin chance to draw mob aggro on incomming with taunt.  Granted all classes that can taunt would benefit from a Taunt revamp, but please keep reading...<br />
<br />
2) I'm going to be hated by every Paladin on Norrath for this but...  Aggro generated by Paladin stuns needs to be reduced.  Now, I've never been one to call for a Nerf, but I honestly do not think that Paladin's stunning to lock aggro is how the spells were intended to be used.  Paladin's would benefit from the Taunt revamp so they could continue to hold aggro reasonably well.  IMHO, Paladin's and Warrior's should be pretty much equal with each other (Warriors being slightly better) as far as aggro is concerned.<br />
<br />
3) This seems to be a pretty unpopular idea, but...  Warriors need their innate HP/AC bonus upped.  If the difference at the end game between Knights and Warriors is so minimal as to not make a difference, then this needs to be fixed.  Warrior's should have a fairly large lead over Knights in the HP/AC department. <br />
<br />
4) Shadow Knights...  Shadow Knights have a line of spells that they can use to draw aggro.  The opinion of most Shadow Knights that I've seen is these spells do not work and that Clinging Darkness generates more aggro than their aggro spells.  This is lame.  Shadow Knights from just about the onset of EQ have been aggro drawing machines.  Their aggro spells should work as intended.  Yes, I mean lower the aggro generated by Clinging Darkness and up the aggro generated by the spells that are supposed to draw aggro...  IMHO the ability for an SK to draw aggro should be far superior to a Paladin or a Warror (boy is that going to be an unpopular statement on this board...).  The balancing act here is, if you do have a Warrior and an SK in the group you would certainly want the Warrior tanking because their HP/AC are so much better than the SK's, the Warrior would be able to hold aggro fairly well cause Taunt has been revamped, and the SK's aggro spells could be saved for pulling aggro in the case of an emergency.<br />
<br />
These are my ideas, love them or hate them. :)<br />

<br />
 Mynka, it's almost perfect, except taunt shouldn't work at range very well if at all. Also, the amount it puts you over the top should scale with levels, but only if the taunter is NOT the one on top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
 Edit: Oh, and Paladins should get /shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Panazule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always felt a good method of deciding the success of a taunt should be the level of the mob your fighting.<br />
<br />
The higher the level of the mob the lower the chance of taunt working.  This would allow them to scale it so that raid encounters would not be trivialized by a virtually unfailing taunt button while at the same time allow warriors to consistently snapp aggro back in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Even if they worked this into an AA that gave a new taunt button, it'd be fine.  They could even make certain mobs immune to the AA taunt ability.<br />
<br />
The idea that casters should have this ability solely because they are casters is an attitude i never understood.  Why shouldn't a skill or ability be just as powerful as a spell?<br />
<br />
No reason a skill such as &quot;stunning blow&quot; which generated about as much hate as tash/malo/slow, a 30-60 second refreshable button that did little damage but drew aggro would not work either.</div></div><hr />

Before anyone else jumps on the nerf stun aggro bandwagon, think for a second or two of what Stun does BESIDES generate aggro.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Good. Now, explain why reducing the aggro on stun is a good thing...<br />
<br />
Yeah. The problem is not that Paladins are using Stun for more then it was designed for is not the issue, the issue is that on raid encounter situations, the chain stunning paladin will get the heals required to compensate for the insane damge he is taking for stunning a mob so much.<br />
<br />
If you reduce the hate on stuns, you're going to make things worse, because there are monsters out there that are effected by more then the hate generation of stun. OMG, stuns inturrupt spells and melee....  NToV would have been so much easier if we went in with 10 paladins on a chain stun rotation instead of 10 clerics...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mynka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ODB, I'm not sure I follow your logic.  How is reducing the hate generated by stuns going to make it any less effective for interrupting spell casting, or stunning the mob for the few seconds it would take for a heal to land?  I'm not saying make stun less useful, I'm saying make it generate less aggro, and raise the aggro generated by Taunt as an offset.  Doing this would pretty much keep Paladins where they are now, but increasing Taunt aggro would benefit Warriors as well.  <br />

<br />
 That's why I say hardcap the two teeny stuns at lower levels than 55. That way, Paladins who wish to stun to gain aggro will have to use more level-appropriate ways to gain it.<br />
<br />
 Any additional balancing you want to do based off of that (resist modifiers, success rate, aggro generation), I'm not sure would be needed. IF aggro generation needs to be nerfed in that line, it doesn't need to be much once you get rid of Cease and Desist in high level xp grinds/raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Partha's suggestion to hard cap the teeny stuns.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can totally agree with putting a lvl cap on  each of the stuns. a lvl 14 stun shouldn't effect a lvl 66 mob at all, shouldn't effect a lvl 30 mob at all.<br />
<br />
And I am not saying that by reducing the hate on stuns you make it less effective at what it was designed to do to mobs, what I am saying is that it will make the drawback of using the spell less effective.<br />
<br />
Stuns are spells that most classes that have use sparingly, because they don't want to get aggro and die. Paladins use it for the sole purpose of getting aggro in MT situations.<br />
<br />
If you take away or reduce the hate from stuns, you give everyone more reason to use their stuns more often. Some encounters in the game will become completely gimped because of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ODB--<br />
<br />
We have had DOZENS of threads, the consensus is that STUNN AGGRO from mobs immune is BAD. We want stuns that the mobs are immune to, to not cause aggro. No one has said remove all aggro from stuns, except for paladins, who twist the suggestion that way, and then say that it would be a bad idea, its rather obvious they have a hidden agenda and personal interest to keep the status quo.<br />
<br />
HARD CAP STUNS- two ways to do this. <br />
<br />
1.) IMMUNE SPELLS cause 1 Hate, no more, no less... this would afect all spells  that mobs are immune to.<br />
<br />
2.) Put in the same type of mechanic as there is when you try to cast KEI/Virtue/etc on a level 1 twink. You cannot cast this spell on target, because the target is too high of level.<br />
<br />
Either way, that fixxes  A LOT of the problems with stun aggro.</div></div><hr />

ODB.. you have just stated EXACTLY why warriors are FURIOUS about stuns.<br />
<br />
From your own words.. what you have said is that paladins use stuns as an exploitation of the game mechanics to lock aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I realize this, but if you're talking about retuning Paladin stuns, they only overlap Cleric stuns in 3 places. The other 6 or 7 they get are unique to Paladins. Further, the only ones with a casting time under 4.0 are Cease and Desist. Finally, as I stated above, I'm not sure once you hard cap the lower, exploited stuns, that you need to really retune the others at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hm. Do I read it right. Most of you want that a stun that does not affect a mob has no hate ?<br />
<br />
When Sony would make this happen I see a legion of stun weapon using warrior write petitions cause their weapons cant give them aggro any more.<br />
<br />
You have EB an then you have STUN. 99 % of all weapons with stun which are used by warrior do not have an effect on the mob. This included the new Ykesha procs out of LdoN.<br />
<br />
And for all who did not remember. Stun was in the beginning a spell without hate. Players noticed it and stun was THE THING to do to prevent damage without having aggro. So lots of Encounters and exp mobs were gimped and classes with stun were kings .. So some stuns were eliminated ( necro 44 DD .. ) and the others were made to aggrograbbers. <br />
<br />
So over all reducing aggro on stuns is hard stuff. Reducing aggro on stuns wich are immune to mobs would nerf more warrior than knights. After that.<br />
SoDs = useless<br />
BBotE = useless<br />
Weapons out of droga = useless<br />
Nearly all other weapons with stun = useless.<br />
Augmented weapons with yak effects = useless <br />
<br />
Price of a BoC = 1 Million pp<br />
<br />
Think of it .. thats not the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And if they retune stuns...<br />

Should not the 'AGGRO' weapons also be retuned?<br />
<br />
THINK PEOPLE..<br />

Its the thinking that, well my SOD wont work so we cant fix the stuns, just keeps us in this rut...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This was a quote from another thread that I think is appropriate:<br />
Second, of course Akilae and Akira are not the same thing. But outside of a couple of GLARING exceptions (Harmony being one) where it's more practical to use a lower level spell over a higher one. If Stuns follow the same logical progression, there's no harm to the Paladin class except it's not as easy as it used to be.<br />
<br />
The thing about higher level spells is that generally they have a greater effect. Nukes do more damage, buffs give more hp, heals heal more hp etc. With stuns, it really doesn't work that way except for that magical threshold when mobs go from level 55 to level 56 and suddenly become immune to normal stuns. The stun spells available to paladins were not designed so that there a better return on mana used for the higher level stuns. As wizards gain levels, their nukes not only get bigger, but they get more efficient. As clerics gain levels, their heals not only get bigger, but they get more efficient as well. There really isn't any reason that a cleric would load up minor healing at level 60 because they would get much less return for the time and mana spent casting the spell. They use the newest spell because it is clearly superior than the lower level version. Paladin stuns spells weren't designed nearly as well, for the most part. <br />
<br />
There are 3 main things a paladin will use stuns for: spell interruption, stopping melee/movement, and aggro. A good spell interruption stun is fast casting and refreshes quickly. The duration doesn't matter. A good melee/movement stopper lasts a long time. Fast cast times are nice, but not as critical as they are for spell interruption stuns. A good aggro stun is cheap and refreshes quickly...that's it.<br />
<br />
As an interruption stun, cease is better than &quot;stun&quot;. It has the same cast time, a shorter recast time, and lesser mana cost. Those are the primary concerns when using stuns to interrupt. Desist isn't nearly as good at this role as Cease is, the spell it is supposedly an upgrade to. <br />
<br />
I can see why SOE put in cease and desist when luclin came out, but I think they made a mistake. One of the main reasons for grouping a paladin, historically, was a paladin's ability to interrupt casting NPCs. Adding cease and desist were meant to expand on that role to lower level paladins, but I don't think it was really needed that early in levels. Up until the point mobs start nuking for significant amounts of health and/or complete healing themselves, interruption isn't nearly as important.<br />
<br />
The reason cease is so fast casting is because lower level spells are generally faster casting. To interrupt, the stun has to be faster than the spell it is to interrupt, and most heals and nukes from level 24 and below have generally a 2-3 second cast time, with 3 seconds being the high end. The low mana cost is due to the level of the spell. 15 mana is appropriate for a level 9 spell...assuming the spell itself is appropriate at level 9 for a hybrid. These same design issues hold true for desist as well. The problem is that this doesn't leave many ways for &quot;upgrades&quot; to these spells to be better in the role of spell interruption. What they really should have done is only add in 1 stun before &quot;Stun&quot; at most, and it should have been designed so that as soon as &quot;Stun&quot; was available it would be an upgrade in every way over the previous stun. <br />
<br />
Another reasons paladins will use cease is due to the level 55 cap on stuns. If you have 3 spell gem slots (mainly because there really isn't anything to put there that needs to be used often) a paladin will load up 3 stuns. We don't have nukes to load those spots up with. If you only have 2 stuns that will actually land on the mobs you are fighting because of their level, you will simply load the cheapest stun you can in that extra slot. Since you aren't getting any effect from that stun other than aggro, you want it be the lowest mana cost possible. SOE has addressed this to some extent by adding in Force of Akera recently. It is a fast casting, non damaging stun that will hit mobs up to level 61. This has replaced cease for me, even though it costs 6 times the mana. The caveat to that is if I am fighting mobs that are level 62 or higher. There is then no benefit for me to use Force of Akera over cease since neither one do anything but give aggro at that point, so I will switch out Force of Akera for Cease. If I am fighting mobs that are both above and below that level 61 threshold, I will keep Force of Akera loaded. The only time I actually want a stun to NOT have an effect is when I'm pulling. Stunning a mob with Force of Akilae adds 4 seconds to the pull time. That is 4 seconds during which a wanderer can walk into assist range of the mob I just aggroed. That is the only situation in which I prefer to use cease BECAUSE of the lack of effect. Generally I (and most paladins) want our stuns to actually DO something.<br />
<br />
<br />
A much better spell progression would be something like:<br />
<br />
Cease <br />
level 15 (up from 9)<br />
mana cost: 25 (from 15 - only 10 less mana than the level 30 stun)<br />
cast time: 1.8 (up from 1.5) <br />
refresh time: 18 (from 9 - makes it harder to chain for aggro)<br />
1/55  stun<br />
(increasing the mana cost alone would make this spell less attractive to use when other stuns are available at higher levels)<br />
<br />
Remove Desist completely...but since that isn't going to happen:<br />
Desist <br />
level 22 (up from 15)<br />
mana cost: 30 (up from 25)<br />
cast time: 1.75<br />
refresh time: 18 (up from 10)<br />
2/55 stun<br />
(I think it would be better to just remove it, but this would be a decent progression)<br />
<br />
Stun<br />
level 30<br />
mana cost 35<br />
cast time 1.5<br />
refresh time: 12<br />
4/55 stun<br />

<br />

Even if there wasn't a problem with warrior aggro, I think that changes similar to those above would be warranted. That being said, I don't think that these changes would be a fix for warriors, it would basically be a fix for the paladin stun spell line and would make it so that a paladin has much less reason to use the lowest level stuns. The lowest level stuns are just too cheap, too fast casting, and refresh too quickly for the mana cost. Changing the lower level spells so that they are less attractive would allow a more natural spell progression where newer stuns are real upgrades comparitively over the older stuns. Using a level 9 spell at level 65 is cheesy, but if it is the best choice, why would you not? It shouldn't BE the best choice. With the changes outlined above, paladins would have much more incentive to use higher level stuns, which would up the mana cost. At the very least, it would dramatically increase the mana cost and reduce effectiveness (by increasing recast time) when a paladin uses the lowest level stuns for pure aggro. <br />
<br />
In regards to warriors, I've mentioned what I think needs to be done many times: Taunt needs to work at a minimum of 75-80% of the time against even cons and below at the skill level equalling a warrior's taunt cap. A taunt success rate of 75% would give a 6% chance of having 2 failed taunts in a row, as opposed to the current 25% chance. A taunt success rate of 80% would give a 4% of 2 successive failures. An 85% success rate would give a 2% chance of 2 successive failures. I also think taunt should probably work just a touch better against raid level mobs too, maybe the following suggestion would help in that regard. Taunt should also add a bit more +hate when moving a tank to the top of the hate list; instead of top of the hatelist+x (whatever x is currently) the added aggro margin from a successful taunt should be tripled (x*3). The range on taunt could also use a small boost, maybe 25% increased range. It shouldn't be &quot;ranged aggro&quot; but the range on taunt is TOO small. I don't like the innate hate idea because it makes it harder for warriors who don't want aggro to do good DPS and it lessens the warriors ability to control whether he has aggro or not. We have warriors who get aggro when they don't want it already. It would simply make their lives harder to make that situation worse.<br />
<br />
I think changing taunt to work at a much higher rate (75-90%) against even cons and below and increasing the added margin of hate from a successful taunt would probably be enough to make warriors as viable a choice for xp groups as knights are. The biggest reason many groups don't want a warrior (as opposed to prefering a knight) is due to lack of reliable aggro.<br />
<br />
A bit off topic, but I was thinking of changes to do with /shield. Change the living shield AA to decrease the penalty for using shield and lower the reuse timer. At level 3 instead of the shieldee taking 50% damage and the shielder taking 75% of the damage, make it 50%/50% and scale with AA level, ie level 1 is 50%/70%, level 2 is 50%/60%, level 3 is 50%/50%. Does increasing the duration of /shield actually provide a benefit? I would think lowering the reuse timer by x amount per AA would be more usefull, especially if the taunt skill was improved because taunt SHOULD then be able to let you get aggro back within a reasonable time.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Statue of RZ is stunnable. 3-4 paladins/clerics could keep him locked down if there was no aggro concern. Many luclin mobs are stunable now too. IV, Shei, and Va'Dyn in AR are good examples.</div></div><hr />

I saw stuns more as a utility type spell similar to charm spells, not from the scalable side as per heals. Either way, we both were thinking the same way - there should be no reason to load a level 9 spell over a level 53 spell when you're fighting content 55+.<br />
<br />
 If ya want, merge in with mine and Boleslav's discussion on the other thread, as he's brought some good ideas to the table as well.<br />
<br />
 As far as Taunt goes, I agree with you there almost 100%, although I think 80% is a bit high; 75% seems more reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have a question for you Partha. Why do Paladin's need /shield?  Don't get me wrong, from a roleplaying perspective it makes sense, and I don't particularly care if pally's get it or don't, I just want to know why a pally would need it.  Basically /shield is a crutch to allow a warrior to absorb part of the punishment a caster is getting when said warrior can't  pull the mob off the caster.  A paladin could just stun the mob or cast a fast group heal and get the mob to hit him instead.  <br />
Oh, and half the time /shield doesnt work right unless the caster is standing in my back pocket anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think taunt for warriors should work as often as spells. Could you imagine the carnage if spells fizzled 20-25% of the time. I am just curious as to why a spell should land so frequent yet taunt not land with the same amount of accuracy. I can understand you wouldn't want healing spells to have a 20% failure rate but it would be real interesting if all harmful or damaging spells had this kind of a failure rate. I know it will never happen but it would sure make things a lot of fun because you would never be able to rely on anything with the exception of a heal. And why shouldn't a taunt failure also produce aggro just like most spell failures will?<br />

Exactly. Statue of RZ is stunnable. 3-4 paladins/clerics could keep him locked down if there was no aggro concern. Many luclin mobs are stunable now too. IV, Shei, and Va'Dyn in AR are good examples.  <br />
<br />
How are these examples?<br />
<br />
The opinion has been to remove aggro from STUNS that DO NOT affect mobs...<br />
<br />
ie...  SoRZ is stunnable, then I guess that means the STUNS AFFECT him, ergo, NO AGGRO CHANGE, Stuns still cause aggro on SORZ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Coding being half assed or not, a stun is in many cases, functionally equivalent to an enchanter nuke. Way back in the velious era, they aded some coding so that enchanter nukes did not need to be all or nothing: the stun could be deflected, but the damage could still take hold, as the damage was considered the prime reason to cast the spell, with the stun being an added bonus, not always a desired one. <br />
<br />
While a paladin (And potentially more importantly, a cleric) casts his stun with the primary intention to be either to stun or aggro, with any damage/knockback being a bonus, the same coding comes into play, as coding it specifically for just enchanters leads to the same thing that happens to bards: It gets broken every patch. Thusly, a cleric or paladin can play golf with mobs, reguardless of stunnability, root, or other factors.</div></div><hr />

Chill out. You sure are quick to judge based on a very limited understanding of the spells involved.<br />
<br />
The knockback stuns do 3 things: stun, do damage, and knockback. All 3 of those components are put there intentionally. Some mobs are immune to the stun portion of the spell, but that doesn't make them immune to the knockback or the damage. You saying &quot;you are USING them as an EXPLOIT&quot; is like telling a necro they are exploiting if they use their epic dot on a snare immune mob. The dot still does damage. It's also like telling bard that using their snare/slow song to slow a snare immune mob or to snare a slow immune mob is an exploit.<br />
<br />
I use spells that are designed to have a pushback to...push a mob! Holy shit what a concept!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why it's so hard to understand, I'm trying my best to explain it. ;)<br />
<br />
The aggro from a knockback spell comes almost completely from the stun. Remove the stun aggro component from the spell and you are left with basically just the aggro from a 108 point nuke. I could position boss mobs ALL DAY LONG without getting aggro, assuming ANYONE else was trying to get aggro. That would completely trivialize fights where positioning is one of the most important factors. Currently when I position Fennin, I have to wait a while before I start, and then I have to watch my aggro while I'm doing so. I can't heal, I can't cure, I can't even do my 3 DPS from archery.<br />
<br />
Normally we use another method to do the initial positioning of Fennin. If I could position 5-10 seconds after the tank engages, it would dramatically reduce the chances of the clerics getting hit by AE or AE rampage in the initial stages of the fight and it would basically make it so that we had 0 deaths every time we killed him.</div></div><hr />

Ok. Seen the word &quot;portion&quot;? Re-read above if ya need to. As you can see, SOE coded stuns as spells with different parts. The spell can be resisted as a whole (one resist check), and if it's not the stun part of it has been designed to have no effect if the mob is immune while the other parts do affect it.<br />
<br />
Some of the higher level stuns have 3 parts: stun, damage, pushback. SOE has recognized a while ago that calling such spells &quot;stuns&quot; while stun is in fact just one of many components will confuse simpletons. This is why they changed the message when a mob is stunned from &quot;target is stunned&quot; to &quot;target has been struck by a sudden force&quot; in a patch from around a year ago, in Luclin era. However, the spell line has always worked this way, with a mob either being affected by some or all portions of the spell.<br />

<br />
The classes and their balance are about tradeoffs. Up through kunark Paladins Rangers and SK's could pull a mob off your soon-to-be-dead chanter or cleric but would inevitably be mana-sponging if they tanked throughout. This was good. The tradeoff is much much much less now thanks to: turgur's, flowing thought, skill cap changes, AAs and lack of good warrior-only itemization.<br />
<br />
AE Taunt is a nice crutch but IMO if they want to fix things for non-ubers there need to be a couple more aggro management AA's than just reducing AE Taunt timers.

1) Taunt needs to work<br />
<br />
Taunt itself works often enough given what it does right now.  However it really needs a pure aggro generation component added as well.  Every time you press taunt you should be adding aggro to a mob.  60% of the time you can use it to steal a mob from someone even if you have not built enough aggro.  ONE successful taunt should put you at the top of the hate list and should add X hate.  A failed taunt should just add X hate.  The X hate generation part would work at range but not the move to top of list part.  At least thats how i see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) I'm going to be hated by every Paladin on Norrath for this but... Aggro generated by Paladin stuns needs to be reduced<br />
<br />
I agree to a degree.  Cease and Desist should probably have their aggro reduced, especially against non casters as the spells more or less do nothing to them.  Resisted spells of all types should probably have reduced aggro generation and any spell that can't effect a mob should have no aggro generation.  That all just seems to make logical sense from a realism standpoint and it is all solid from a balance standpoint as well.  Sure this will nerf some warrior aggro weapons but they could always work how those weapons work if its deemed a huge balance issue.<br />
<br />
3) This seems to be a pretty unpopular idea, but... Warriors need their innate HP/AC bonus upped<br />
<br />
I agree with this as well.  They should have the same type of HP/AC bonus as clerics do for their heals.  15% bonus that works on HP's from EVERY source, items, buffs, stamina.  That keeps the gap higher where it belongs.  You could give Knights and monks a 5% or so bonus as well so their HP/AC gap vs the melee hybrids are kept steadier as well.  Sony already messed up melee balance beyond recognition with the terrible itemization and choice in who got what AA's but at least this would help a little.<br />

 Thank you. You're finally starting to get it.<br />
<br />
 Paladin stuns aren't being used for except for KB in postioning and canceling CH's, right?<br />
<br />
 No, wait, they're being used as a source of free aggro!<br />
<br />
 So if you change them so the Stun portion doesn't make as much aggro if it lands, and even less if it's resisted, then you go a good step towards bringing aggro parity back to the tank classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realise that it is not only pallies that have stun rite?<br />
<br />
Clerics have three stuns affective against up to 65 mobs, wizzies have stuns, druids have stuns and probably other classes too!<br />
<br />
Reducing the aggro on stuns will make plate tanks all but worthless in exp groups, why use plate when a BL or ranger will do, just so long as they can hold aggro/do damage while the other stunning classes neatralise the mob with little fear of gaining aggro? That is the reason stuns have high aggro .... so they can't be exploited in such a way. Changing the aggro level on stuns will have more far reaching consequences beyond pally/war balance that it's probably a none starter as an option.<br />
<br />
I also suspect that it can't be coded (or not easily) so that the lower level stuns cause little or no aggro, they are detrimental spells and detrimental spells always cause aggo no matter if they effect the mobs or not, unlike the lull line which are classed as beneficial spells and are coded to have level restrictions.</div></div><hr />

And that was my point, I am not disagreeing with you in principal am just saying that it quite possible that it isn't as simple to change as it may sound.<br />
<br />
Secondly yes i do think resisted spells should cause aggro. Should any casters resisted (even if the mob is immune) mez, charm, nuke, snare or slow cause aggro? Hell yes, the game would be really dumbed down if this wasn't the case. Even resisted beneficial spells (eg pacification) can cause aggro, its part of the risk/fun. <br />
<br />
If an enchanter/shamen could cast slow on a mob with no risk of aggro until slow actually landed EQ would not require plate classes at all, except for raid class mobs, my enchanter can tank pop exp mobs ONCE they are slowed and my enchanter can hold aggro as well or better than my pally!</div></div><hr />

However, in the case of Cease and Desist, they should be fairly easy to code in no aggro from resists and lower aggro overall. Tuning single spells is easy for SOE, they've already said as much.</div></div><hr />

Reducing the aggro on stuns will make plate tanks all but worthless in exp groups...<br />

ROFLMAO --- Ok, so what exactly is the use of a warrior then?</div></div><hr />

Reducing the aggro on stuns will make plate tanks all but worthless in exp groups, why use plate when a BL or ranger will do, just so long as they can hold aggro/do damage while the other stunning classes neatralise the mob with little fear of gaining aggro<br />
<br />
And it was 100% without a doubt correct.  If you take aggro out of stuns warriors don't become the tank of choice, they lose out on being secondary tank as well.  You start to let a DPS melee tank using snare/slow whatever for aggro while a paladin, cleric or enchanter chain stuns since they won't aggro.  Nothing wrong with modifying just cease and desist though, they aren't real stuns they are spell interrupters.</div></div><hr />

Warriors arent a tank of choice, Take aggro out of stuns just makes SK's the #1 hate generater's, which is what they are designed to do. <br />
<br />
If the mob is immune to the spell take away the hate that goes with it, If they full resist a stun, then there should still be residual aggro along the lines of 1-10 points of hate <br />

As it stands sir, No ranger, or bard, or Bst, Or rogue will ever take MT job's on current content in Pop tier 3+. They would splat too easily. <br />
<br />
Taking the majority of aggro out of stuns wouldnt hurt warriors at all, GSoT is great but if there was no aggro from the stun I dont think that many warriors would complain.<br />
<br />
As for copper hammer etc, Those where gimpified when they came out, they dont help the warrior class, they just band -aid it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Bst already tank fine in Tier 3, rangers do too so I don't know what you are talking about, Bst make better tanks than knights in the majority of places, great aggro generation with almost double the DPS.  The reason taking aggro out of stuns would hurt a warrior is simply because it lets all stunning classes chain stun without worrying about aggro which is not good for the game, that just makes the actual tank side of a class less needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">The majority of both PoP and LDON (normal missions) does not require any significant level of mitigation or HPs.  The primary requirement of a tank for an xp group is aggro lock so the DPS classes can unload and the healer can concentrate on only using his most efficient heal on a single target.  Because of that the only solution is to bring warriors up to knight levels of aggro control.  <br />
<br />
If knight aggro gets nerfed then none of the tank classes will get groups because the beastlords and rangers will be doing the tanking.  Groups are looking for aggro control first and tanking ability second.  If a warrior can't hold aggro they'll get a knight.  If a knight can't hold aggro they'll get a beastlord or ranger.  Unless you're truely testing the limits of what you can kill with one group while XPing, the ONLY thing that matters for a tank is aggro control.  <br />
<br />
I've been in XP groups on several occasions where it was more efficient for a beastlord with 3500 hps less than me to tank because he's the ONLY one getting healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">and i see the whole LOGIC of  removing stun aggro escapes people...<br />
<br />
AGGRO FROM STUNS THE MOB IS IMMUNE TO....<br />
<br />
MEANING THEY DONT FRICKIN STUN THE MOB&lt; THEY DONT GET FRICKING AGGRO...<br />
<br />
SO HOW ARE THEY GONNA STUN LOCK THE MOB WITH NO AGGRO?<br />
<br />
READING, its a good habit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Arny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">READING, its a good habit... <br />

And so is reading comprehension......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">People need to get off of this stupid &quot;nerf stuns&quot; kick.  It won't help anything.  Best case scenario they'd find a way to do it without making all our stun weapons useless.  Now SKs would be the preferred tank and both Paladins and Warirors would be SOL.  Worst case scenario they'd fuck up our stun weapons too so now pretty much all weapons without an EB or Anger proc would be useless.  Neither sounds like much fun to me.<br />
<br />
If knight aggro gets nerfed it won't get us any more groups than we have now.  For xp groups people are used to tanks having aggro lock.  If we can't do it and knights can't do it, they'll get a ranger, or a beastlord, or a shaman to tank.</div></div><hr />
