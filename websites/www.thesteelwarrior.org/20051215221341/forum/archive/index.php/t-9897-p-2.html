<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mocking Blow (or something like that) just doesnt grab enough aggro and has the chance of missing and the recast timer on it just blows. <br />
<br />
Agreed. Mocking Blow (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=321) didn't cut it when I tried it grouping, but I also believe it doesn't actually generate agro (same with <br />
Challenging Shout (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=370)), it just forces the mob to attack you for six seconds or something silly if you actually hit (see links).<br />
<br />
I just recently started using a 125damage (28dps) 2hander, been doing so for about 5+ levels. Granted I haven't tried it in groups yet, I did a fury build for cleaving multiple mobs at once and have no problem holding agro even after my shaman two box steals it. If anything, mocking blow/AE taunt will fix anything you don't snag off big cleave/sweeping hits.<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice though is a higher damage slow 2h &gt; quicker low damage 2h (atleast in my situation). I couldn't hold agro for dick when I tried a 80 damage polearm even though it had a proc and 3 more dps (yes, both polearm/axe skills were maxed out when I was testing). I'm still pro-defensive for grouping, but seeing as how I don't group at all, 2h/fury works fine for me.<br />
<br />
Will be doing some testing in berserker stance, I'm curious if anyone has good experiences with it. I heard some people were going to town with whirlwind, but seeing as how I have maybe four actual berserker stance abilities it seems to be weak sauce for now. Any feedback on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">'zerker rage is awesome for building up some quick rage.  plus you can still sunder so if you're getting a lot of rage, you can drop a gaggle of mob's AC quickly.  Of course Intercept is the chit when its up.  Gonna be even better when they fix the whole need 15 rage to spend 10 thang. I'm not high enough level for whirlwind or pummel yet.  If you are not MT then it is an awesome stance for damage dealing.<br />
<br />
Of course you gotta have Tatical Mastery talents inorder to utilize 'zerker stance very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have tactical mastery (which you should), and you're able to start off with charge, do that and then there are two things you can do. If your group tries to start attacking immediately and not give you any time to get aggro, fire off mocking blow and then switch to defensive stance, demoralize, and start sundering. If they're smart and wait two or three seconds to start attacking, just switch to defensive after charging and demoralize followed by sunder. If you're having problems with aggro, you might want to fire off a sunder first. Taunt if you lose aggro followed by a sunder if possible. Once you have aggro, if you have revenge talents I would recommend using shield block followed by revenge as much as possible, throwing in your other abilities every once and a while. Switch back to battle to hamstring if needed.<br />
<br />
If you can't start with charge, pull with your gun/bow and try to get enough rage to sunder as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
This is a very general guideline to follow, as each situation is different. I can use this strategy to hold aggro the majority of the time I'm grouped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't even buy the last upgrade I got to it.  It's not worth the gold.  Also, defensive stance is clearly more aggro than battle for sure.  if I switch into battle mid fight, I'll lose aggro a lot of the times, switch back to defensive and immediately it will come back.  Dunno what's up with that, but I've seen it happen a few times now.<br />
<br />
By the way, anyone have ANY fucking idea what slam is for?  I mean AT ALL?<br />
<br />
Heroic strike costs the same rage.<br />
Heroic strike doesn't have a cast time.<br />
Heroic strike does more damage.<br />
Slam does...uhh...nothing?<br />
<br />
It doesn't stun, it doesn't interupt..right now it's HS with a cast time from what I can see.  Am I missing something, or is it total crap too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, I'm pretty sure you're right about slam, I didn't even bother training that shit.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=288) - Level 56<br />
<br />
Slam (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=343) - Level 54</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slam is an extra attack doing weapon damage + whatever, not a +damage to next attack.  In theory the advantage is that it does weapon damage (use slow weapons) and also you don't lose one hit of rage generation like Heroic Strike since it's an extra hit.<br />
<br />
That said I have never played far enough to get Slam, and I'd assume it requires channeling and I can't imagine tanking while trying to get a channeling attack off to be very fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, I'm pretty sure you're right about slam, I didn't even bother training that shit.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=288) - Level 56<br />
<br />
Slam (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=343) - Level 54<br />
<br />
Slam does weapon damage + the listed damage, versus just adding X damage to your next attack.  It should always do more damage than Heroic Strike if you ignore the fact that it's got a casting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you aint swining while you're casting slam.<br />
<br />
weap damage + X hits tend to be lower than HS hits if you debuff the crap out of the mob.  HS adds damage on top of what you hit the mob for, so str, mob AC, atk power, etc., gets factored then the HS amount gets added on top of that.  So the damage varies a lot with HS versus a more set amount of damage with the weap dmg + X formula.<br />
<br />
where slam could out damage HS is if you are up against a mob that mitigates your melee damage down to next to nothing.  I havent tested it to much, but I'm pretty sure any weap dmg + X move (slam, cleave, MS) will out do any melee damage + X move in under that circumstance.<br />
if I switch into battle mid fight, I'll lose aggro a lot of the times, switch back to defensive and immediately it will come back. Dunno what's up with that, but I've seen it happen a few times now.<br />
that would be defensive stances extra 10% threat add per hit (per move?)  I'm not sure if its exactly 10% but its something like that.  By it self it is almost enough for aggro lock.  Toss in some talent points that give you 3% more threat per hit in defensive stance and its pretty fookin hard to peel mobs off ya at that point ;)  Not impossible, just difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, well if it's an extra attack all together I could see using it with slower 2handers. Mortal Strike is an extra attack also correct? May be a nice way to make up for weapon delay, 1.5 sec isn't that bad of a cast time if you just drop it after your swing. <br />
<br />
Guess I'll play around with it, I should have mortal strike soon also. I'm going to wind up in defensive once I start grouping anyway, but until then might be a good fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mortal Strike is an instant attack, like hamstring or sunder, that does not interrupt your swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, that's what I meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless one of the two skill gets affected by armor and the other do not, the two skills both do constant damage improvement (Slam has a range, but average the damage done is a constant number).  It's a simple matter of comparing which number is higher for purposes of DPS.  <br />
<br />
Now I have no idea if Slam stops your swing timer or not, or how likely a warrior is to channel a 1.5s attack, and these factors can influence Slam vs HS one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried slam out, was hitting for around the same amount as my heroics usually do. On top of that every time it tried to channel it was interrupted atleast once from me getting beat on, so it took twice as long to get the actual swing off. Awesome.<br />
<br />
I honestly didn't try it for an extensive period of time, I pretty much tried it for ten minutes before I was to irritated to put up with that shit anymore. If something is going to take me that long to get off, it might as well auto-crit, stun, slow, make me a sandwich, do just about anything usefull, but three secs for some extra damage you would do just by swinging normally is retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I have no idea if Slam stops your swing timer or not, or how likely a warrior is to channel a 1.5s attack, and these factors can influence Slam vs HS one way or another. <br />
<br />
Yes, you have to stop swinging to cast slam.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it is fucking useless, near as I can see.  I do know one mob with absolutely ridiculously high armor that I could test the armor equation on, but I'd need a healer with me and slog thru a 1/4 of BFD to get to it, and I got better things to do with my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ran down south of 1k needles and picked on a pather 6 levels above me to see if there was a difference between the two on mobs where you hit for next to nothing on.  Nope.  Neither slam nor HS care about the mobs level or AC, they we're bothing hitting way way harder than my melee on the mob.  150+dmg with HS or Slam versus 12dmg average with regular melee.<br />
<br />
There is only one situation I can see slam being effective: being a dps tank with a real slow 2h.  So warriors on raids will benifit from using slam with weapons that have big delay on them, thats about it.</div></div><hr />
