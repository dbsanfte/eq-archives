What base hp should I be shooting for?  should i be more hp or ac oriented?  Any thoughts and advice will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing's first, get a pair of Valorium rings of Gallantry, or if you dont have the cash for those, 6/65 velium fire wedding rings.  a pair of 6ac 65hp rings might run you 700p or so.  <br />
<br />
Second, start doing LDoN's if able, going after the 760point malevolent armor of suffering from Everfrost.  Every piece has at least 55hp...  I'd start with the BP and work down from there hp wise.  Also, a Silver Chitin Bracer or even a Bracer of Defense would work to replace the Amethyst bracer, 5ac will not cut it as you try to break into the tier 2-3 planes. <br />
<br />
3rd, replace the neck with any of several droppable pieces, amulet of mummy wrappings or spiked mithril collar come to mind among others.<br />
<br />
HP is your key number, but AC is important too so try to improve both as you go.  Others might have more raid oriented suggestions, but for the basics start out with some basic HP increasing gear that also raises your AC.<br />
<br />
Your weapons are good, you wont need to worry much about replacing them until you hit 5khp at the least, unless opportunity arrises via raids or a great deal.<br />
<br />
There's also a few quests you might run that will benefit you compared to your current gear, such as the Bracer of Benevolence quest, and others.  I am a decent example of non raiding casual player gear, check my magelo.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt waste time with thurgadin pieces unless you are doin vindi/AoW anyway and happen to get pieces (like the BP).  I wouldnt dismiss so easily the Skyshrine armor however, if your guild still does ToV events.  The gloves have 90hp, and others have pretty good overall stats.  I dont suggest going out of your way for them, if you arent already in the neighborhood, but if you still do Velious content they're not a bad alternative.  LDoN is the easiest way to get relatively fast upgrades, if you cant expend hours and hours on raids for Ssra named/VT, or PoP progression.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

Thats very good because it allows you to wear Fierce Heraldic Armor.<br />
Look for Fierce Heraldic in your bazaar, its great HP/AC armor. You wont find much better bank for your buck :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, save up for some RZ cultural; get some valorium rings, bloodmetal ears, and update your magelo.<br />
<br />
after that'you'll be ready for PoP and newer stuff. sure it'll cost some $$$ but; well, get to farming and collecting drops to make some coins.<br />
<br />
BTW if you need to see what the RZ stuff is like check my magelo. i got some pieces in slots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can find an RZ smith, you might be able to get the cultural armor cheaper by supplying some or all of the subcomponents and contracting with the smith to try the combines.<br />
Note that this stuff is sometimes called BD (blue diamond) cultural, because it requires blue diamonds to make the infused rings that are a subcomponent of the armor. Several pieces require only one ring and hence might be logical places to start if you do supply a smith with components: bracers (one ring each), boots, collar and visor. <br />
The greaves, cloak and BP are three-ring items; the rest are two-ring.</div></div><hr />
