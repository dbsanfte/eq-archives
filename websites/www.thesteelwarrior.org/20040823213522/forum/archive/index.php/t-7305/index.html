<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drake247</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok well i currenlty have a 21 war and iv been playing 3 months (I have serious alt itus) And i really want do to do some raids because i can not wait to do some raiding. Now my guild right now dose some low lvl raids but they ussaly flop. Just every one running around killing things. Now i want to get some guildies and some friends and try to do a serious raid. Now if any one could give me some pointers on doing this and soem good targets at about lvl 20 and the people needed to take them down would be gretly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First low level raid I did was Tower of Frozen Shadows.  I think you want to be about 30ish minimum to try this though.  We had people levels 30-45 on our raid and it went well.  We got to fifth floor with no problem and then I think stopped due to time not due to mob difficulty.  <br />
<br />
At your level.. maybe Unrest?  Lots of named in there and the pathing will give you lots of practice in crowd control procedure.  Splitpaw might be good as well.  Basically take a dungeon that you can xp in but is a bit hard and send in 2-3 groups to kill through it.  <br />
<br />
Oh, there are events for low levels in Gunthak as well - you collect finger bones and use them to start a ring event.  Info Here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2332) I think that is for 30s as well but you could probably start doing the xp camps to collect the items soon if not quite yet.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Might also consider Dalnir or Sol A.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Castle Mistmoore.....that zone will blow your mind as to what kind of mayhem you can produce :D<br />
Problem with raids at your level is...well, the goal is basically fun...Items as your reason for raiding will come up rather short.<br />
at 30 or so; most definately start out in Tower of Frozen Shadow. YOu'll have a blast.</div></div><hr />

It will help if you know the zone thoroughly and use a tracker to make sure some name mobs are up. While the loot isn't great compared to what you can get in the bazaar, if you are all somewhat undergeared spoting the Cloaked Damphyre, Maid Isis, Mythi Davisi, Advisor, Avenging Caitiff, and Garton Viswin could net you some usable items. There are also a number of quest items, particularly for Paladins. (And Shaman, but the Black Dire bites.)<br />
<br />
There are two major great features. Repop is twenty minutes. So, if you clear all the named mobs or their placeholders there's a chance that other named will apppear on repop. Secondly, it's a classic dungeon crawl. There are mobs to avoid, see invis mobs, walk through walls, and places where the whole raid has to stop and fight with a good chance of being wiped if you don't have your act together.<br />
<br />
Nice and scary at level 20-26. One of the very best zones in the game.<br />
<br />
A shame Mayong went on vacation and has never returned. He would make the zone perfect in every way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>johnyjohnson76</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sol A and runneyeye are two of my favorite low lvl dungeons and they are almost always empty and full spawned, no one ever seems to remember runneyeye nowadays...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye on mistmoore, just watch out for the de camps in lfay, they can wreak total havoc if someone strays a little and gets agro lol. Bring a chanter, in fact, bring several. You WILL need them. Im fairly sure I could get wrecked by a mistmoore train if its large enough lol. My guild did low level raids as we worked our way up. We would normally just move in and take over the entire zone, (we had a large guild and an alliance with another one that always came with us) We would put level appropriate people at each seperate camp spot and just farm for a couple hours gaining exp and loot then at the end we all gathered together and rolled collectively on what dropped if any of it was good for us. Or even just as cash loot since most of it was fairly crappy. We did crushbone raids, mistmoore raids, unrest raids, tofs raids, we moved up to fear/hate raids, kael arena raids, umbral plain raids, dragon necropolis raids, it was great fun. You get to progress as a guild and as the zones get higher such as in tofs, you start really learning how to move as a single unit and listen to the raid leader so you dont cause a wipe. On that tofs raid we made it all the way to the wedding floor and started farming back and forth up there till we got tired lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another place we did a raid at low lvls (lvl 21 being the high end) was Kerra Isle. Not a lot of loot here but enough mobs of different level to get good practice at raiding. Enough mobs to learn about crowd control and this zone is normally dead empty also has a very good exp modifier. I have found alot of very high level people that did not even know this zone existed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol thats true. The only reason I know where it is is because I had to do that scavenger hunt for my druid. Bleh to zones in the middle of nowwhere on a continent known only for being a place people try to leave as soon as possible. Unless they are on a hole raid at least. Thats another nice low end type raid for when your guild starts hitting the high 40s, low 50s. Raid the hole as deep as you can, but bring plenty of porters, no way out without a port or gate spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dalnir is great zone for 20-30 but more 30 then 20<br />
Najena is just right for 20ish<br />
unrest is too small too raid imo. There is pretty much 1 hallway to the ghost and a lil bit of 2/3rd floor.<br />
MM would be very very very tough at lvl 20 if you have at least 5 lvl 30ish and one of them is a puller it may be doable. I spent a fiar share of time pling there and lvl 20-30 characters have insane prox agro ranges. I'd be suprised if raid of 10 or less could get into the castle, but then again quality of gear on lowbies now days is amazing.<br />
<br />
at this lvl thats about it thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's a triggerable raid at Shadeweaver's Thicket. Easy to do, look it up.<br />
<br />
Good for like 30's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Never done Sarnak fort in LoIO as a raid, only as a single group, but seems like it would be a good raid spot for level 20. <br />
<br />
Another lower level raid idea that you can keep doing as your guild progresses might be raiding for VT shards. Try to time your &quot; shard raids&quot; so that the camps are challenging for 2+ groups rather than waiting till all 60+ and being bored with it. Also, would give your raids a concrete goal. Could start in DS and SD at mid/late 30's maybe? Do TG mid forties. Then continue with harder ones as you all level. Anyway, just a thought. Might be kinda cool to do em that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had forgot about Najena. Thats a good one. Nice dung type experience with the goal of getting the keys to the different areas. I would recommend that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Najena is a good bet, and one of the crafted armor pieces drops there too.<br />
Never did Mistmoore, but that sounds reasonable as well. Likewise the Kerra Island thing.<br />
<br />
If your goal is to learn crowd control and raid force discipline, you could try fighting your way to the goblin archeologist in Permafrost. You would need excellent crowd control, and you would need to be able to stop runners and deal with casting mobs. Would be a challenge, but perhaps not great experience (highly aggressive green mobs). Archologist, who spawns right where EQ Atlas says he does, drops a useful weight-reduction pack. He's on a 26 minute spawn cycle, but drops the pack fairly often. It might be a bit hard for low-level evil characters to get past the guards in Everfrost without invis.</div></div><hr />
