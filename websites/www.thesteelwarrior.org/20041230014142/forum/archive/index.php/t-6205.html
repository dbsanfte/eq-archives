I have not been able to figure out how to corner consistently (i.e., my back is to the corner, and mob is pinned by other melee facing me, allowing everyone else to attack the MOB's rear).  Do you have any tips and tricks you could share with me?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get shrunk as much as you can and keep backing up into the corner the whole fight(can start backing up and hit enter to lock it in).  If not the mob can get between you and the corner, in which case it will turn to face the raid,  and it's hard to get it back most times.  Levitate can sometimes mess with your ability to corner tank, so I'd drop it as well unless totall necessary.</div></div><hr />

do you guys ever worry about what direction you look, keep walking backward, anything like that?</div></div><hr />

Another thing once you have it in the corner is not to move around. This can slide you slightly out of the corner forcing the mob back in it. I like to use a 3rd person view in this instance if I need to see more than a cod shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Groovin FV, you never mentioned if you were shrunk or not, nor do I know what race you are since you don't have a Magelo posted.  Yes, cornering IS that easy, provided you can hold agro and get to the corner before the mob does, and you keep the raid off till you call assist.<br />
<br />
Once in the corner, I hold the down arrow key to stay back against it.  I look up at the sky and make the intersection of the walls center on my screen forming a nice inverted v up there.   If you keep looking straight ahead in your normal perspective you'll usually get &quot;you can't see your target&quot; hence the reason for looking up.  (Unless Im tanking Blob Ha Ra's in VT in which case I look down)<br />
<br />
Oh, one other thing... sometimes you'll encounter a mob that can hit you while you're in the corner, but is out of range for your mellee. In those cases have a monk with dragon punch or a class with swam pets position themselves behind the mob and push it into you more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two words MAX MELEE! Haveave your group mates and raid partners use max melee. Also make sure you are shrunk and a race that fits in corners well. Max melee also offers an easy tank switch when corner tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">other thing to remember is that not all mobs can be cornered, meaning that they are not big enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using top down view when you're in the corner helps keep everything square, I also find that in gnome illusion you don't really need to keep walking backwards in most cases.</div></div><hr />

Haven't been able to do that in the past.  Of course there were a lot of other problems thanks to the dx9 collision stuff, but that one thing was an improvment hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The smallest non minor illusion player character model is a double shrunk skele (chanters can get smaller using minor illusion and a dropped dagger, etc.).  <br />
<br />
One other thing to watch when cornering- pets are your nemesis, especially non-controllable ones when the mob has a popcorn AE (i.e. VT).  If a non-controllable pet (wizzie swds, clr hammers, PoP class pet procs, swarm pets, etc.) gets into the corner, you simply won't be able to.  Tends to happen a lot with knockup/back procs, tho if you make it to the corner first and run back into the wall, you can usually prevent the knock up from affecting you...<br />

<br />
Maybe I should sell my AoN while the prices are still good :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal view, just look up. If you are looking up, you can tell right away if you have moved slightly and you don't run the risk of accidentally moving, which can happen in other views.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mike cothard</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the help I have recieved throught your posts over the last year or so.  Everytime I corner a mob with my butt in the corner I recieve the, you can't see your target message.  I am a dwarf who always looked forward.  From now on I will be shrunk and look straight up.  That will remove this problem correct?<br />
<br />
Again my thanks to all of you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking up won't change anything other than decrease the lag from having to look at your entire raid.  Being shrunk small enough is the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In VT i have found that Skelly illusion plus shrinks and you can corner most mobs. Have had problems with Gnome illusion and no illusion just in VT though. Also constantly walking backwards into the corner seems to help dunno why</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a halfling now, but sometimes that doesnt cut it so I have an AoN, which almost always works double shrunk.</div></div><hr />
