Most of my eq time has been spent in bazaar wheeling and dealing cause i wasnt a big eq player and had a hard time leveling without playing hours on end, but now with the combo of PoP and a lil more time on my hands i have begun leveling my war. Right now i got a Blade of Carnage in my primary and a Splitblade of Destruction in my offhand. Are there droppable weapons better then this combo? I also have an Anklesmasher that i just got about 5 min ago and havent used. I am also looking into getting an Ironbound Quarterstaff, but i cannot use it untill 55 anyway so I am not in a rush.<br />
<br />
Can I please get some opinions on what the best  1h combo or 2hander is for tuant? I really like the stats on my current weapons but ill toss either or both for more taunt. Money isnt to much of a restrictor so just pls tell me what ya all think is best.<br />

I hate you.  :D  But anyways, i don't believe you're going to find better droppable taunt than the BoC.  The anklesmasher would most likely create more agro than the split blade because of the snare proc, but you'd be giving up some nice stats and the nice ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoC/SoD is still the top droppable agro combo in the game as far as I know (BoC obviously proccing 700 pure hate, the SoD proccing 288 dd and a stun).<br />
<br />
I too am filled with hatred for someone who needs to ask this question yet has a BoC :(<br />
<br />
Would be interested in a full magelo to see if you are just a twink with little knowledge of the class' gear or if we need to call BS. Because if you are having any (and I mean *any*) aggro issues while using the above combo, then you would have to be the worst warrior *ever*. If you can't keep agro with those weaps, then you need to sell off and roll another class.</div></div><hr />

No one actually asks these questions, because anyone who is capable of getting a BoC or has 400kpp to spend on one knows what a BoC is and how it ranks.<br />
<br />
People just do this crap to say &quot;Hey, look at me, I made a twink.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crickkett</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually not just looking to say I am cool. I wondered cause I have read the board and I hear alot about hategiver and Bloodfrenzy proccing alot more then BoC. I have yet to find an answer on the boards that says how proc's work exactly that most everyone agrees on. I have taunt almost all the time, once in awhile i lose if someone starts chain nuking, or a shammy dots and canni's himself to low. The only thing I dont like about BoC is that it procs 5 times during one fight and 1 time during another. I dont know if this is true for all weapons with proc but i hear that bloodfrenzy doesn't do this as much. I also know that the taunt is +700 hate but am wondering how much damage, tuant keys, whatever 700 hate is. Thats why i wondered about getting a Ironbound Quarterstaff b/c it would be more DPS most likely, and I would take less riposite damage. The main reason i asked the question was not about switching out the BoC but switching out the SPoD for a different offhander. <br />

<br />
just let it go...  u've got uber equipment, who cares?<br />
<br />
probably isn't a droppable weapon that would be better aggro that what you've got right now, SoD maybe, but why bother, you shouldn't need to upgrade what u have until you can start some hefty raiding for the usual BF's and HG's.  <br />
<br />
Don't really worry too much about riposte dmg... chances are you won't be tanking anything that would kill you with riposte... <br />
<br />
But if u must... get a windblade or WMBS and call it quits, both will do you well for aggro and dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no one was questioning whether you have the items, they were questioning your intent in posting this thread.<br />
<br />
To answer your questions, yes hategiver and bloodfrenzy proc more than a blade of carnage, however its not relevant in the context of your first post as they are not tradeable.  The only things I can think of that you may be able to purchase at the bazaar / player auctions that would be compareable to your current selection would be to replace the splitblade with either a greatblade of storms or a Sceptre of destruction.  The later I wouldn't recommend as you may lose some DPS there.<br />
<br />
As for 2 handers a Windblade or a War Marshall's Bladed Staff may out damage your DW combo but wouldnt compare for agro.  As far as a procing 2 hander goes I have never had a GSoT so can't comment there although I can say BBB does generate more agro over time than BoC + DPS 1hs but doesnt have the same initial agro that you can get from an EB proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ditch the splitblade, it sucks ass.  It'd make a nice ranger weapon (if they could use it), but it's crap for a warrior.  Grab a SoD and you'll be set.  If you want 2handed, Greatstaff of Thunder is pretty much the best buyable 2hander.<br />
<br />
The reason you are getting some shit from people is that if you were at the point where you could earn the weapons yourself, you would know most of this.  People get angry when people who haven't made it to the point that they could actually get the items without cash go and sound, no offence, fairly noobish.<br />
<br />
As for Bloodfrenzy and Hategiver, both are leaps and bounds above BoC, but both are no drop.  So since you're not on FV, you won't be able to buy them.<br />
<br />
For how exactly procs work.  Procs can randomly go off whenever you swing.  The percent chance of it happening on a given swing gets less with more haste, and better when slowed.  So in a large parse, you should have the same number of procs per minute while slowed, buffless, or hasted.<br />
<br />
700 hate is just that, 700 hate.  Damage and spell hate other than pure hate spells are too complicated to be able to say how much damage or whatever 700 hate is.  Additional factors are distance, comparative level, weapon type (1h or 2h), class, etc.  There are too many variables.<br />
<br />
Taunt key.  Each time taunt is successful it puts you at the top of the hate list, plus a little bit.  If it fails, nothing happens.  You do not get a message distinquishing between the two, unless you are fighting a &quot;speaking&quot; mob, which will say &quot;I'll teach you to interfere with me Tauntersname&quot; when you succeed.  There is more to it, as there are modifiers (same as above, plus whether you are attacking, and some others).  So, as proven in a different thread, taunt may take you to the top of the hate list, but not always to the top of the modified hate list, so sometimes it takes multiple successful taunts (until the &quot;little bit&quot;s all add up to above the modifer) to finally get aggro.</div></div><hr />

Did that make you feel better? Or perhaps you should link me the SoD you're about to get with your uber amounts of plat....</div></div><hr />

Actually, SoD is pretty uber DPS for a 1hander (I have SoD, GBoS, and BoC). 288 on a proc that I find is quite hard to resist is nice. Likewise no DD on BoC's proc and I find that GBoS is resisted far more often.</div></div><hr />
