<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We were doing a Hard Adv, the mob got pushed IN the wall, and he kept hitting us, but we could not hit / nuke / send pets on it. When I got in meele range, it said I couldnt hit my target from here, even when I was on the mob's face.<br />
<br />
Guide had to come down and zap it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Had it happen to me today as well in LDoNs.<br />
<br />
A few mobs would get pushed into the wall, unable to hit/see them message a plenty.<br />
<br />
Had to basically wait for the mob to take its sweet time coming back out again :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I love it when SoE can't even calibrate their collisions and mob locations between client and server. It would take a large number of idiots to allow this to happen but they apparently pulled it off. oh, and it applies to corpses too, usually I end up drgaging mine around a while until both the server and client seem to agree on where its located so I can loot.<br />
Oh, and time is just lovely with these new changes.<br />
Good times, good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snarl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">had this happen on Glykus in tactics night before last... was really annoying.  So we evac'd and started all over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lanamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had the same thing happen in a NRo LDoN run...mob pushed to wall, mob got stuck, couldn't hit it but it could hit us. After we backed away from it, it finally worked itself off the wall.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this was a related issue, but while trying to get to Yxtta from the Kod'Taz zone-in, I kept getting stuck along the wall. Couldn't camp out because it thought I was abandoning the camp, /rewind didn't work, and couldn't use gate potion because I was kept in a sitting position. No druid/wizzy or mage available to port/CoH. This happen three times. All three times I had to go to the chat room (via /q) and get a GM to kick me out.<br />
<br />
Working as intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">did south middle (the spot with 4 named spawns) and man cornering and walling mobs in biot is just impossible now. they get pushed thru the wall and if you get summonmed then there is a good chance you will fall thru the world and repop at zone in (go go having mage in group). sometimes its almost as if the mob knows its safe there, because it gets to where you cant hit it, then you back the pets off and try top pull it out and it refuses to come out, you dont see casting messagesd, ont see his life jump like he is healing or get nuked or anything, he just stands tehre like he is going &quot;nyah nyah nyah you cant hit me you gimpass ogre&quot;<br />
had to change the way we pulled and which mobs we kept down in order to adjust mob posistion and keep hem out of the wall alltogether but it is workable at least<br />
i admit tho, that if this had been a hard mob and not the gimpy bot mini named and stuff, it could have been really ugly</div></div><hr />

I have a horror story for you.<br />
<br />
Other night i logged in to see if the game had gotten better in the 2 weeks i had taken off, faught a blizzard mob into the wall, it warped me to the zone just as a train from the sand tower arrived at the safe spot, so i had all the monsters from upper blizzard and upper sand on down on my arse, got splatted and then they went back( blizzard and sand) and killed my group(even tho i had told them quite a few times that they needed to run or they would also end up nude at the soul binder, they said they were fine but i saw them a few seconds later) when i got back to BoT I was blammed for the sand train(even tho i had no part in it) and the blizzard train, apparently after sand+blizzard ate my group they all went back to the sand group and wiped MSR, MS, US.....<br />
<br />
<br />
what a friggin mess, and the GM res didnt even restore my exp because i had been ressed by a cleric who had &quot;accidently&quot; used his 75% res on me, and i didnt notice till after i was warped over to my corpse....<br />
<br />
so i can resolutly say i will not be doing anything until the next patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The game as it is now is a fucken trainwreck. Is it any wonder people are leaving in droves.<br />

A big ,,|,, to Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">here's another thing to avoid. running up the sides of zones. you know where the hills get really steep at a zone edge. my alt chanter got stuck on a hill and had to be succored off it. strange since i didnt LOOK like i was in an unusual position. in some ways they are improving the collisions and in some ways they are making it worse. my groupmates seem to be having less problems warping but the mobs seem to be having more problem.<br />
<br />
being warped to the zone-in without wiping the agro list is a recipe for zone-wide disaster. leave it to sony to be so worried about exploits that they wouldnt wipe the agro list.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully fixed this week.  Interestingly enough this may and should fix most ranger, can't hit them in the wall with arrows problem, that has been around oh... forever ?<br />
Who knows if this will fix it, we can hope I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I was always blessed with grouping with a Ranger who had to repeatedly say, &quot;pull it out of the wall,&quot; like I had any control over it at all.  Usually it wasn't me that had it locked in the wall, it was the fricking pets, and if I moved away the mob turned on someone still in melee range.  So many people just don't freaking understand that Warriors don't &quot;own&quot; aggro control and don't understand how pets work.  Gah!  It was so frustrating not to be able to shout at him, YOU KNOW, IF I COULD GET IT OUT OF THE FRICKING WALL I WOULD NUMBNUTS!  Whew, really had to vent that one.<br />
<br />
EDIT: But then I've run into just as many Rogue numbnuts as well who didn't get the exact same concepts and had to bitch and whine about not getting their BSs in.</div></div><hr />

However when we killed him the second time, he got pushed into the wall and we couldn't get him out of it for a while. <br />
<br />
Hopefully it'll be fixed and my guild can get back to equipping our members with these.<br />

Yay, post 600.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Best of all though is when you are in a LDoN and you pull 3ish mobs.  One is a chealer, so you engage it first, naturally.  You push it into the wall, cant hit it anymore, and it cheals itself, then proceeds to heal both the other mobs whenever you get em low enough ^ _^</div></div><hr />

See, when you get a ranger that just fucking sits there with his bow and shoots at mobs instead of having some balls and getting in there and using those funny looking things called &quot;swords&quot; in their hands, it's time to &quot;mistakenly&quot; boot him. Jesus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Had some zone in warping going on in BoT myself this weekend.  Pets pushed it into the wall, I tried to get it out of the wall as usual, only this time it was too far in and took me under the world with it.  This warped me to zone instantly.  I'd get half way back to the group before I'd get summoned under the world, and warped instantly back to zone in cause of it again.  Over and over.  Till finally he warped out of purgitory and back into our group.<br />

The second you can't attack the mob anymore cause he's just gone into the wall, back away and sit down quick.  He'll summon you if he summons, back away and sit again immediately, and he'll come running out of the wall at you.  You need to do it quick though, before the mob gets pushed all the way through the wall and falls through the world.  Mobs that don't summon are way easy, since they'll just come out of the wall, or eventually warp back on your heads if it fell through the world.  I'd continue to sit till the mob warps though, to make sure that you're the one he warps onto.<br />
<br />
Sitting is a very powerful tool.  I've kept an add busy before simply by sitting with my wizzie alt.  Had a 2nd mob smack my wizard when it got in camp since he was sitting.  Someone snared it (ranger I think), and it immediately headed for them.  So I sat down the wizard again before it got to them, and the mob started lumbering back towards the wizard.  Stood up before he got to me, and it lumbered back towards the ranger, sat again before it got to him, stood before it got to my wizard, etc.  Kept the mob busy and not hitting anyone till the battle with his buddy was over.  I even timed it with my nukes.  Only a 3 second cast on the draughts, so I'd let the mob get real close to the wizard before standing and nuking his buddy during the time it was lumbering back towards the ranger.</div></div><hr />

Depends on the ranger.  We've got a ranger who has his archery AAs maxed.  He does &quot;waaaaaay&quot; more damage shooting his bow that he does with his swords.  The DPS reduction is very noticable while we're crawling through a room that's too small for him to shoot, where he's forced to drop to his swords.</div></div><hr />

When i'm running from PoK, i naturally take the book.<br />
<br />
I either sit and invis myself past the guards on the way to the camp (green, but annoying) or just run up the wall to avoid them.<br />
<br />
Of course i got stuck 3 times today doing that. Luckily rewind worked and i still got by without aggroing them. Proves invis is better.<br />
<br />
Also, reconfirmed that reverse pins are useless as push will put the named in the wall.  We pwned Leaf Windfall's arse anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">While hunting in Ssra Temple over the weekend we &quot;walled&quot; several mobs.  When they eventually summoned me I ended up in either 2 spots:<br />
<br />
1)  stuck in the wall.  once the pets killed the mob I could /rewind and get out, or<br />
2) in the basement, soloing the mob<br />
<br />
#1 was irritating, #2 was even more irritating  :eek:</div></div><hr />

No way that will happen nowadays, but I consider fighting out in the open a lot more fun and it gives the tank a chance to show a little skill.<br />
<br />
As far as mobs being stuck in walls goes, the tank can almost always get a mob out of the wall no matter what anyone else is doing.  Sit is your friend.  Of course if you get summoned inside the wall yourself it's another story.</div></div><hr />

All those archery AAs are worth shit if you can't hit the mob because it's in a wall. Melee usually will however. Some DPS &gt; No DPS</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everytime I've had a mob pushed into the wall cause of this new nifty little bug, melee could not hit the mob at all equally with the ranger being unable to hit with bow.  There has been no &quot;some DPS &gt; No DPS&quot; in any walled mobs in any cases I've seen yet.  The second that mob goes in the wall, nothing at all can touch them.  No spells, no melee, no arrows.  Tuant is the only thing that can reach them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">We did Xanamech on Tuesday and Thursday (yesterday) this week.<br />
<br />
Tuesday - it touched a wall at 2% health and bounced to the top and couldn't be hit by melee or spells.  After it killed the MA (me) and a couple casters it finally came loose and the rest finished it off.  It was particularly annoying because I was trying to get it to follow me into the open and it kept summoning me (then I'd immediately run to the middle), but it wouldn't follow me...it would just sit and wait a few seconds, then summon me again.<br />
<br />
Thursday - based on Tuesday's episode I decided to keep it away from the walls and just move it around in a circle near the middle.  Well...at about 20% it found a hole in the floor and fell partially in it.  It then summoned me through the world (20k hit...I died  ;) ), then popped back up and they finished it.<br />
<br />
Two wins for the guild, but one very frustrated MA (me!!)  I don't mind dying or losing a fight...it just ticks me off when it happens due to bugs that have been there for this long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume you're talking with the about 50AAs it takes for AM3/EQ and the 50k it takes to buy a Stonewood, but archery damage is in almost all cases metric fucktons better than melee DPS. You gotta get to late EP/time for melee to outclass archery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Played my bst alt today... my warder was getting caught on the steeper slopes in GD. I'd tag a frost giant, start getting beat on, and looking around wondering where my pet was.  Annoying as hell.<br />
<br />
Later, I decided to go soloing on some vamps in TM with my warrior. EVERY single damned mob was getting caught on the slopes there too.<br />
