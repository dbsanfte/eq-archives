It gives warrior a lil more agro then whoever it is on top of mob's agro list. Its instant. Its exatly same as taunt button except its AE and it works 100% of the time. If you do ANYTHING to piss off the mobs after the taunt they will be back to kicking your ass right away, instead of picking on warrior</div></div><hr />

On large mobs with funky hit boxes, more often than not it will fail. Also remember bloodlust &gt; AE taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does work 100% of the time.  If someone is frenzied on, the mob will immediately turn back to that person.  And often the 'center' of the mob is too high/far back/far away from you to allow it to work, but that is due to range and not the skill.  But for all mobs in range, it works.</div></div><hr />

True, when someone has bloodaggro, AE Taunt will have no effect, never had. <br />
<br />
But besides that, it sometimes happens that someone else has aggro but not yet bloodaggro, and when I then use AE Taunt the mob still keeps attacking him. The mob doesn't even turn around to me for a second, so apparently AE Taunt has a small margin were it can fail.<br />
<br />
And this also happened on mobs that don't have &quot;funky hitboxes&quot; like Snowz called them, e.g. Razorfiends.</div></div><hr />

Not true, aetaunt a mob attacking somebody with low hp agro and it's true it won't turn on you immidiately, but if they get healed it most definatly will. So infact the taunt is succesful, just mobs always go for low hp people first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlea</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right with that, let me thus rephrase it to &quot;AE Taunt will have no immediate effect&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just because the mob didn't turn to you doesn't mean it wasn't a successful taunt.  If you're AEtaunting off of a melee, and they land a hit immediately after you AE taunt the mob may go back to them without even having time to hit you once.  If they stop attacking though, you will get aggro back real quick.</div></div><hr />
