<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nimbex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have not been able to find a place that has info on where warriors should go in order to do there adv.s. What I mean is, what adv. locations have the best armor and equipment warriors can buy. I would hate to do most of my adv.s in MM and find out I cant use points there. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's a list of goodies :<br />
http://www.rpgexpert.com/330.html<br />
<br />
Many swear to the Takish Armor, and some others go for the more affordable Mir armor. Also, some augments are from Mistmoore, others from somewhere else .... it's all mixed up, so basically - Decide what is best for yourself. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can do any of them . Tak and Miragul will open Uber armor, Great armor, Anger,  14/19 and 15/20 weapons, and several damage augs.  Guk will open the 14 19 longsword.  I didn't care for the warrior drops in the other 2.<br />
<br />
Win 30 adventures in each of Tak and Mir IMO.<br />
<br />
Exception - look over the LDoN merchant lists and if you see smoething ou just GOTTA have, go for it.  Depends on your gear and wealth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah Mirguls and Taka= best places for warrior armor and augs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd do MM up to 510 also just for the cheapo 10ac aug. Not huge, but relatively nice and a good bang for the buck type ratio compared to the HP augs. Fits Face/Neck/Back/Shoulder/Waist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spent 1150 in Miraguls for Anger 3, spent 1150 in Rujark a couple times for +40 hp augments for existing armor (slot 7), and spent 510 in Mistmoore several times for +10 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Keep in mind Nimbex, You only HAVE to get points in a certain camp to unlock the vendor items. You can spend points from any camp at any merchant after that.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Earn 510 Adventure points in Butcherblock, unlock 10AC Aug.<br />
<br />
You can then buy the AC aug AND use the 1100 Everfrost points you have to buy 2 more if you want.<br />
<br />
So in the long run with the camps its really more a matter of which vendor do you want to open up first than where to aquire points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd have to be pretty desparate for AC, or phat with nice gear,  to spend 510 pts for 10ac.  I'd horde them and score Anger3, Tak/Mir armor, or a superb weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Migs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi Nimbex , sorry I didn't have much time to talk ingame tonight as I was getting ready to raid and had to arrange a few things.<br />
<br />
 The best info for LDon I can give is this link , here you can decide what's best for you at your current level http://216.100.228.172/skp/eq/ldon/list.cgi<br />
<br />
 Higher level Warrriors , it's a little harder to pick exactly what you'll need due to the fact that you don't want to spend 1492 points on a Tak(North Ro) armour piece , just to have it replaced on a raid by something better. Remember 1492 points is roughly 30 wins at 65 and even more at lower levels , the very last thing you need is to spend all that time on something just to have it replaced by something better on a raid or even in the bazaar.<br />
 <br />
 Myself personally , I went for the Takish Breastplate first , this was one item I know would take a lot for me personally to replace , in regard to my raiding situation , so I firgured it was a safe bet. With some good augs , it's probably going to be an item I keep forever - or at least a very long time , well worth the points. <br />
<br />
 Also the LDon weapons you can build are well worth the value. Since we've had such a hard time putting together groups for guk , I worked at Miraguls and picked up the 1150 point club there,  which opened the camp so I could use raw points to buy the 1150 point anger3 aug.  <br />
<br />
I'm about halfway to buying the 2dmg aug in Takish , which will make this little wooden club (that looks like it was looted at Derv3) a 17dmg 20 delay anger3 proccing club of ownage. For me personally , I really need the armour more , but I know replacing this weapon will be next to impossible (for me) and anything that's an upgrade to that will be very hard to attain. So I spent the major points on it because I know I'll have it a long time. I hope in the meantime I can either buy or earn on raids upgrades in other slots making the choice of my next Ldon item or aug that much more clearer. <br />
<br />
 In a nutshell , aim for items you think you'll use a long time , and that you'll have a hard time replacing in your current situation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, that is incorrect Jak,<br />
<br />
You need to have the correct amount of points in each specific camp to be able to buy an item. But after the item is &quot;unlocked&quot; you can get points from anywhere and come back and buy any item you unlocked.<br />
<br />
For example, the Anger 3 augment in Miraguls is 1150 points. That is 23 wins at level 65. You need to get 1150 points ALL from Miraguls. But once you get 1150 points there you never need to camp in Miraguls again. You can get another 1150 points from any camp and come back and buy a second Anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Theres also 5ac augs in miragul, same slots as the MM ones and only 150pts.</div></div><hr />
