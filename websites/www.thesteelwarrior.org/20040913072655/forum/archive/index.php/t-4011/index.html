Hmm ... maybe any percieved imbalance between Paladins and Warriors is modelled on the real world!<br />
<br />
Like most Atheists, Stubbingwicke was all tough talk, but deep inside he was weak since he did not have the Love of Christ to succor him and give him strength. His cynicism and disbelief proved no match for my Faith and I eventually had him on the defensive. As my fists found their mark as if by Divine guidence, he finally fell to the ground on all fours, too tired and beaten to give any more fight. I stayed my fists and stood over his pathetic, subdued form.<br />
<br />
This, however, means that RZ Warriors should be just as potent as any Paladin :D.</div></div><hr />
