<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all.  Whenever I hit numlock to autorun it does make my char run without holding keys.  However I can't use my arrow keys to turn him while he's running as I always use to do.  I've seen 1 other person with this problem but I have no clue as to what to do to fix it.  I don't use a custom UI and I have all my settings the exact same as I've had for a good couple of years.  The only other thing to mention is that when I do try to use my arrow keys (hitting up or down arrow) to try and stop (doesn't work) it starts trying to scroll through my chat messages.  This happens if I have hit enter to start typing a sentance before I hit numlock or not.  ANYONE have a clue what the hell is going on?</div></div><hr />

The Game locks your keyboard into Chat mode and the only thing that happens when you try and go up or down is you get repeats of the messages and tells you have sent and received.<br />
<br />
I usually start banging Ctrl, Alt, Shift, F12, etc etc until it goes away.<br />
<br />
Would love the answer to this one. I am sure it is something stupid.</div></div><hr />

I re-mapped auto run to the &quot;/&quot; key next to the &quot;Num Lock&quot; key and keeping &quot;Num Lock&quot; on, it's fine except for training yourself to use the &quot;/&quot; key.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, you might want to make sure you disable the &quot;Sticky Keys&quot; functions in XP as well.</div></div><hr />

I had this problem and so did another friend of mine.  We both have Radeon 9800 ATI cards and we just downloaded new drivers from http://omegacorner.com and it took care of that problem.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
