Not just for warriors but one for everyone who plays to protest the devs persistant and near lack of fixing the broken skills and AAs for so many classes.<br />
The devs keep pumping out expansion after expansion while at the same time claiming any fixes are &quot;under discussion&quot; and after 6 months to a year the same things are still &quot;under discussion&quot; with nothing done usually except another expandion.<br />
Do not get me wrong I love this game but I just feel that the devs need to finally get off there butts and finally stop discussing and get fixing.</div></div><hr />

That's the start of a &quot;stand down&quot;.  Anything else is just talk.  Your characters won't get deleted, just re activate them in 6 months to a year when the devs address the issues.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they don't count active online accounts, they count active accounts.  They don't know there are issues if the account count stays the same month after month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing that will imo change the dev's and SOE in generals mind set is the fact they are going to lose a lot of accounts to WoW.  They might think they are going to EQ2 or just quitting in general but I know a lot of people are going to be quitting to WoW.  They really don't care what you do with your time in game your still paying them so I really don't see how you will be affecting them in anyway.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I was beat to the point.  Cancelling your account is the only way to affect SOE at all because their money flow gets cut down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No this was a post in hopes or getting help in setting up an ingame stand down.<br />
I mean if say 10k or more people logged into tunare for example and went and stood in the nexus as a protest for an hour maybe the devs would get the hint and get off their butts.<br />
As for canceling or suspending my account yes thats another option which I am considering but I would rather try a stand down first.</div></div><hr />

yeah nothing to do with the game balance and everything with a frustrated person wanting to &quot;make a stand against the man&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SOE couldn't care less how many people they lose to WoW or EQ2. Thye've made their investment money many times over. Letting EQ collapse will just mean that they no longer have to support old buggy and outdated code. They also know that many of those people will move to EQ2 when that time comes.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that EQ is doomed. I'm just saying that their's no reason why SOE would care about actively maintaining such old code and trying to be innovative at the same time. SOE has never been concerned with fixing old issues, when there are other things that they could be tasking their devs to do that would effect many more players. They will just keep pumping out content expansions for the old players until community attrition takes over. By then, EQ2 should have matured and those players can move to that game if they wish. For SOE it has always put devs on issues and content that affects the largest ammount of customers, either real or percieved. Some stupid bugged door in freeport or old world quest that hardly anyone ever uses anymore isn't even on their radar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly right, and the way it should be.  On the list of priorities for EQ, fixing old, minor stuf is pretty low, at least to me.</div></div><hr />

Sony would certainly see how many people are interested in this action if that was done.You ever cancel an account in EQ before? If you have i think you'd know that it doesn't matter a bit if you get 1, 100, or 1,000,000 to cancel their accounts at X time. Reason being is SOE isn't going to refund your unused subscription fees. So if you have a 1 year plan or 6 month plan. They won't notice you're gone until you're up for renewal and don't renew.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am sure you all remember the opening system and how we got smoke up our asses........So while they blew smoke up our butts, they implemented it for EQ2 instead??  &quot;There are &quot;moves&quot; you can make, and there are also &quot;Heroic Opportunites&quot; A dial comes up with an icon that flashes.&quot;<br />
<br />
So yay, blow that crap up our butts and then can it...but re-implement it for their new game.  :(<br />
<br />
Drep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drep, the opening system was scrapped because feedback was so negative about it.  At the time, they had release the first part of melee rebalancing, and with further testing foundthat most people simply did not like it.  With the introduction of incite, 5 % mitigation advantage, and various other melee helps, things at this point where looking fairly good.  There was no point, no need, for the opening system, and with the reaction SoE was getting from people on test, it was let go, and rightly.<br />
<br />
If they continued to work on it, and made something that is useable in EQ2, great.  This has zero bearing on EQ1 tho.  They made a descision for EQ1, and most likely it was the right descision.<br />
<br />
Seriously, all you people who so hate SoE, who are so sure they have some sort of conspiricy to take your money, who are so convinced they are the antichrist...stop paying them, go to WoW ...end of problem.  If the things they are doing are so terrible...stop supporting them, and go away...please.</div></div><hr />

Zotha is a smart man.  This isnt to say that things don't need fixing, but by-in-large this game is waay to subject to the whim of the masses.  A fix here is an imbalance there which leads to yet another fix and imbalance elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Devs should listen to the eq community at large, but lately they've been catering to far too many complaints which only represent very small sectors of the eq populace.</div></div><hr />

after reading this post i thought to myself i bet this is 10k+tank(seriously)...its a true but unpopular statement that could only be made with someone who had just a tad of experience .....then i clicked on you magelo....i wasnt suprised</div></div><hr />

If you're going to try and say he's wrong point out the flaws, not some measuring stick that only applys to who's going to mt and not =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groovdog</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meat's point (my interpretation) is that only people who have true experience across the depth of the game realize that one class' upgrade is often a nerf to another (i.e. balancing is tough as hell).<br />
<br />
People whine too much and I think that is the one advantage people will have in WoW, the tendency to play only one class (or maybe 2 if you box) creates tunnelvision and a sense of entitlement (for that class of course). I have the feeling an account on WoW will have multiple high level characters (cause its easier to level and slightly less raid centric).<br />

(1 year in DAOC where balancing was constant and didnt help) and 6+ accounts here (6 diff classes).</div></div><hr />
