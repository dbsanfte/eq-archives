2)  snare<br />
3) can't see if named for rings are actually up or not<br />
4) boss mobs drop top person on aggro list <br />
5) so easy for other guilds to grief you on arbitor spawns<br />
<br />
I am sure alot of other things piss me off, but these are the only ones i can think of atm.  I guess they think it makes a fun zone when aggro means nothing and our class is totally useless on mobs.<br />
<br />
You can cut and paste most of these on why i hate air also.  Air isn't even a viable exp zone because every blue near the zone spawns 3 or so greens when you kill them.  These greens have over 20,000hp and hit for 400 max/boggle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed for the most part.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the root and snare, it's annoying in the case of the tree snare that it lasts so long and you can only hope radiant cure removes it.<br />
<br />
It's everything else raid related with the zones.  First, I dunno about other servers but the zone does NOT reset, like no event has reset on its own oh for like two months now.  You get it after a patch or crash and then that's it, the zone is shot til the next one.<br />
<br />
Of course, to find that out like we have, you have to clear events to get placeholder mobs, way to waste an hour or more of my time.<br />
<br />
Air, same deal really.  Friday night we went up, we cleared bird island trying to spawn avatar of mist, turns out that wasn't up.  Ok well an untargettable sigismond is up, that atleast is some indication that spider island is up.<br />
<br />
We go up, do all of spider island and what happens?  Yes, a placeholder mob spawns UNDERNEATH the still untargettable sigismond.<br />
<br />
An easy solution to that issue is simple, just have ALL bosses appear untargettable form, to indicate that an event is ready OR, have the islands and events in earth not respawn until the event is ready.  While that would put out a few people in earth, I doubt most people go and exp off of mudwalkers, or rockguys or whatever.<br />
<br />
Aggro issues in both zones are bad enough for an entire different thread.  Quite honestly the stuff I've seen in air in particular makes no sense.  I've had Avatars turn to me when I hadn't even been attacking and there are 20 other melee attacking them throughout, and absolutely lock on to me.  Of course the flip side is I've tried to tank avatars, and had them just flip out and ignore me completely no matter what is done.</div></div><hr />
