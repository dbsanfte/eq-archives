I filled in what gear I could from memory, but missed a few slots.  As you can see most of it is bazaar stuff that I either bought or farmed for.  I am not looking for uber upgrades but rather stuff that I could take the SK to get w/ some easy of farming.  Playing a war is alot different strat from playing my SK and I got to give you guys props for doing what you do.<br />

My normal play time doesnt leave many people on to group him to get the faction needed for them.  Hell my normal play time doesnt leave many people on for me to group w/ hehe.  the helm he has now is ok.  THe main reason I got it is it has +17 mr.  Also I can get him a ikky bp if anyone has any suggestion on good solo spots.  I pretty much soloed him up form 39 - 52 in SolB.</div></div><hr />
