<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StaboCA</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the past 6 months I’ve been averaging 1-2 levels a week while playing EQ. I know, nothing to write home about, but decent for a casual player. Anyway, once I hit level 50 things slowed way down. Though I’m playing just as often I’ve found getting exp is much tougher. I’ve gotten 3 levels in about 8-10 weeks.<br />
<br />
Since most of my guild is in their 60’s grouping with them (while fun) doesn’t yield much experience (it’s more of a family guild anyway).  As a result more than half of my playing time is spent in “pick-up” groups.  <br />
<br />
Fortunately getting groups isn’t too much of a problem. I’ve met a lot of people getting to the 50’s so people often pull me into their groups and when that doesn’t happen, I’ll just use the LFG tool to assemble my own group.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that where we’ve been hunting - PoJ, PoN, etc. - we’re not getting much exp.  I know there have got to be better places.  DSP was great exp for the 30’s, DL for the 40’s, so what are the “grind it out” experience spots for the 50’s – specifically the 50-55 range &amp; 55-60 range. (I separate the two because they may be different.)  Loot, while nice, isn’t a priority.<br />
<br />
Any and all suggestions appreciated,<br />

Chardok is ok, but you dont get a good ZEM and you wont get highlevel exp bonus for most mobs there if you do 10 levels in 1 spot. Funny tho that someone that dinged 60 in kunark already says that :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best place to get pick up groups is where other people are getting pick up groups.  Up to 55, that is PoI, PoD, PoJ and PoN, because you will spend the rest of your life in PoP from now on.  After 55 it's PoV, until 62 when you will get trained repeatly in BoT.<br />
<br />
And if you think grouping with a bunch of 60s is sucky experience, all I can say is: welcome to levelling post 50.  4 times as long for post 50 levels sounds about right.<br />
<br />
Now, if you have some people who are willing to try something, there's places I find PERFERABLE for experience to 1st tier PoP - dunno something about people kiting through graveyards that really put the do not visit sign on a zone for me.<br />
<br />
Sebelis, Chardok, Veksar.  Charasis is supposed to be good too, but I'm on Venril Stahir faction so I couldn't say.<br />
<br />
Of these, seb requires a key and zone out is not zone in which is a pain, chardok has a different zone out than in, and Veksar is the &quot;easiest&quot; of the three.  Charasis requires a key and has lots of locked doors. Of course, all of them are pretty remote, so don't expect to get (or see depending on your server population) many people there.</div></div><hr />

I am 57 and have been with a group containing lvl 61-65 other than me and the exp is very nice. If you can get one og the camps here you can get some good weapons too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far my experiences in the Planes has been mixed. I've played in both PoJ and PoN for hours in full groups (all around my level) and often not seen that experience bar move. Yes, killin can be fun, but if you're not getting exp (or loot) what's the point?    If dark blues (ravens, treants, etc) are going to be so much tougher in the planes at least make them worth some experience. The way it is looking, it will take 10-20 hrs spent grouping per level at this rate. (No, we’re not chain pulling, but this is ridiculous.)<br />
/vent off<br />
<br />
I have found PoD and PoI a little bit better experience, but not by much.  I recently got my Seb key, but being a non-porting class it's a bit of a pain to get to.  I plan to try that zone a bit more.  I'll also give Chardok &amp; Droga a shot.<br />
<br />
Trondir mentioned something that I’m unfamiliar with - what is ZEM and the &quot;highlevel experience bonus&quot;??<br />
<br />
Also, I’m curious how long it’s taking other people to level post 50 ?<br />

I leveled from 48 to 56 in POJ, POI, PON, and POD. But the exp just drags at 56. And I was told not to try POV till 59 or 60. I went there last night with some alliance members and picked up about 30% exp in 3 hours. what is everyones advice here. Should I just zone in and hope I can get a group in POV or should I wait till 59?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll quickly find that some areas of tier 1 zones give much poorer exp than others.  The best I've found are: CY, castle in PoD; hedge, goblins, werewolves in PoN; basement in PoJ; back area in PoI.  If you can organize the group, Veksar is an excellent zone as well.  50-60 is a GRIND, its long, its boring.  Don't expect more than 20% exp in more than one play session, and many times even that won't be reached.</div></div><hr />

Next time you log on, get down on your knees and praise your God for PoP and the removal of hell levels.  I'd tell you how long it used to take but you wouldn't believe me.<br />

<br />
The high level bonus is there is some bonus for killing stuff that is close to your level.  It used to be that due to mob power increasing faster than your power per level, the best way to level was to kill something as low level as possible, but still blue, and kill faster (hellooooo Velks).  The bonus for closer cons was added to offset this.<br />
<br />
ZEM is the zone experience modifier.  There is a bonus for each kill in a zone for certain zones.  These zones tend to be indoors. PoP used to have out of this world ZEMs, now they're just insane.<br />
<br />
As for levelling post 50... Beats me.  I always try to enjoy my play time so my level isn't relevant to me.  I'm not focused on the destination, I'm enjoying the journey.  I believe the upper 50s were about a blue an hour, but I refuse to set foot in PoP so you could do better if you wanted to.  shrug.</div></div><hr />

I'll spend a week at a lvl because I can't get groups that last more than 3 pulls before someone has to go to a raid or go to bed.  Then one night you'll get a good group and the exp will flow like a river.<br />
<br />
At 53 I would go do yard trash in PoN or the zone in for PoI, not uber exp but anything is better than PoJ exits(3 hours chain pulling, 26% exp tonight at lvl 52)<br />
<br />
Then at 55 try for the castle camps in PoD or gobbies/hedge in PoN.  Or if your guildies are feeling nice maybe they'll bring you along for some dps in PoS or PoV.  The desert camps in Storms brought back memories of Paludal when my monk was there at 55-57.  And PoV really was Paludal all over again from 58-62.  Inner, Outer, LC, RC, and Lever camps all gave excellent exp.<br />
<br />
Just keep plugging away, you'll get that awesome group where the exp never slows down and you'll wish you could stay for the next 3 days.<br />

<br />
I almost always have my group that follows me around but have ran outta places to go. Group is as follows me 56 warr 56 cleric 56 ranger 55 shammy 56 chanter and a 54 sk.<br />
<br />
PoN is slow killing and slow xp we were doing treants and ravens <br />
Gobbies kick our asses as do Slargs.<br />
<br />
PoD we get whiped almost everytime While i hold aggro i just don't seem to be able to take the beating yet.<br />
My comp lags too much in PoI so i stay clear of there wich sucks cuz i do like the zone alot.<br />
Nadox and Torgarin are ok cuz the xp moves and they are easy kills plus get a few drops but it is slow maybe 3 blues in 3-4 hrs.<br />
<br />
Droga was awsome exp but we always seem to get whiped by a wizzy after about an hr and have to do a total cr wich is a pain and a long downtime none of us can seem to take the nukes very well warrs resists buffed are all about 120 wich ain't great but not terrible MR and cold are about 150. with resist gear on<br />
<br />
Been told to try Veksar so was planning to hit that zone very soon<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on leveling now that I'm past 55 is that I don't really worry about it too much.  Instead I just like to take a group of guildies and travel to dungeons where maybe I haven't been before, and explore a new area.  Being as most of these zones are undercamped and because they do have ZEM most of the time the experience will take care of itself.  Zones like Veksar, Droga, deep into Velks, even Acrylia Caverns (lower Acrylia preferably), are all at least interesting to say the least.  They break the monotony of boring PoP leveling, and often you get too busy to even notice how the exp is moving.  <br />
<br />
Someone mentioned Seb already, just thought I'd give my take on it.  If you have the time and they're not camped, the juggs in Seb are pretty decent exp at 55-57.  Only problem is the long trip down there and getting a group to go with you.  I noticed however that the chance for spell drops usually convinced a couple of guildies to go along with me when I went.  I think at 57, last time I was there, I got about 30% exp in 2 1/2 hours or so.  Seb has a good ZEM and the juggs are all lvl 57 or 58 I do believe.  <br />
<br />
Plus, nothing beats killing frogs on the way down :)<br />

ya Veksar golems and shopkeepers is good. Fix your magelo btw (Set defensive to what it is :))<br />
once 1-2 levels in veksar are done, try hobgoblins again. they are the best exp at 58.<br />
<br />
Oh and to the guy that said PoV at 55... I dont know what he should kill there.. golems kick him, razors rape him.. and if he is so twinked out he CAN tank that stuff, kills will be so slow it  wont be worth it. not even to mention that the highlevel bonus for deep red mobs has been nerfed (ench 56 we had in PoV recently got 5% for 12 mobs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to chardok or Seb and be a man.  Alternatively you can go to PoP and be wearing the same gear you are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like someone else said, be happy that they fixed hell levels and PoP has such great exp. About a year ago, there was a thread on the wizard board a guy started when he decided to do all of level 59 in 1 sitting. People said he was crazy and it couldn't be done. A lot of people on his server showed up to help him out and he did most of 59 in AE groups or quad kiting (at the time the best exp you could get) and it took him 39 hours to complete level 59. Be glad it's not like this any more.<br />
<br />
The 50s are considerably slower than anything pre-50. Levels do take 3-4x as much to get through. Get used to that. The trick is to find the place where you can cash in on all of the various experience bonuses. Since you are a warrior, you need to make sure that your groups are always full. The more people in your group, the higher the bonus is and it scales up relative to the amount of people. Next you need to get in a zone with the highest ZEM (here is a list of most zones - http://www.graffe.com/library.php?id=20). Also, you should try to hunt mobs that are as close to your level as possible. There is a bonus you get for fighting mobs that are within 5 levels of you or higher. Finally, don't try to group with people who are much higher level than yourself. The amount of exp per mob is divided among the people in the group with the highest level people getting the largest share. You might be fighting reds in a high ZEM zone, but if you are 53 in a group of 65s, your portion of the experience is going to be a lot smaller that theirs.<br />
<br />
Your best bets are to exp in PoP. Dobbo pretty much nailed it, those zones should get you be best exp/hour if you can get a decent group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too am a believer in Droga. <br />
PoV inner camp ( considered one of the best exp camps in PoP) yields me an AA ding in about 90 minutes, at the King camp in Droga I get an AA ding in 1 hour 50 minutes. So Droga can be very comparable to any Planes camp.<br />
Loot is also exceptional, camped King room/ Seer camp the other day and in 6 hours got 6 Copper hammers of striking, 2 Sword of the Bloodsworns, a Necklace off another named and of course 3 AA's. Since Copper hammers sell for 10-12k each on my server that is a pretty damn good camp.<br />
:)<br />
One thing regarding Droga, the spawns are very fast so expect to be busy. You also require crowd control as it is easy to get multiples on pulls and adds as mobs can spawn close together.<br />
The best part is the ease of the mobs. Whether it is a named or a regular spawn they are the same difficulty so you can get into a very good rhythm.<br />
