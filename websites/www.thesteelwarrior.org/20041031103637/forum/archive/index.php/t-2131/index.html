<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well kids, what do you think?  2hb or 2hs?  Are they both pretty equal weaponwise or does one have more than the other?<br />
<br />
How about non-lore items?  What's out there in regards to 2 handers?  Anyhing worth having that isn't lore?  (can't hand it off to my newbie character if its lore...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No they aren't equal. There's about 5 2h slash weapons to 1 2h blunt weapons. Besides, only Warrior 2h blunt worth using when you're in the 50s-60s is GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some of the Ntov 2handers are worth useing in that lvl range imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/boggle...try a Greatstaff of the Four Winds before you go spouting off about there only being one 2hb weapon for warriors in the 50s-60s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both.  Read any of about 50 threads here to find out how loved GSoT(2hb) is, Greatstaff of the Four Winds is simply awesome, so 2hb is important.  2hs has so many good weapons I cannot even begin to name them all(WMBS and WB are 2 good droppable ones).  Try and get and keep all weapon skills up, you will be glad you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just wish they would fix the damn 2hb animation. It looks like I am trying to shove it up thier arse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also Aggression if it still even drops from that formerly broken-ass zone and the old, reliable ToD. I still whip out the ToD every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I stand corrected...GSo4W is worth using also...still only 2 though ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aggression no longer drops =\<br />
<br />
ToD is a useful 2hb.  Also, once you get farming primals, if you have both skills you can pick up whichever one drops first.  2hb is definately useful, especially since GSoT and GSo4W are much greater than most 2hs available at the min level to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In keeping with the 2HBness of this thread. I'm thinkin about getting a GSoT, problem is, my 2HB skill is in the 50s :p :eek: <br />
<br />
What's a good low delay, war usable, 2hb I can get rather cheap (under 1k or so) to train this skill up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ninja, you don't really have a clue do you?<br />
<br />
Allow me to state the single reason why you should keep up 2hb and 2hs -- The windblade.<br />
<br />
Lost yet?  Here, let me explain it for you.  Right now in the bazaar there is the Greatstaff of thunder at 20k, Amy Staff (37/36, 8sta 75hp) at 9k, Tae Ew Hammer (34/35, 100hp) at 8500, Rubicite Staff (47/50) at 4k, Great Maul of Hatred (30/33) at 3400, some 32/34 stick from Veksar at 2500, and a boatload of others, all of which will outdamage ANY 1h combo you can get your hands on in your 50's.<br />
<br />
Shall I state the 2hs list?  Windblade, WMBS, Widebladed Greatsword, Reaver, Argent Protector, Tae Ew 2hs, and the Black Acrylia Halbard, all ranging from 2-30k depending on your budget. <br />
<br />
5 2hs's and 1 2hb worth using in your 50's is the most retarded thing i've seen posted in awhile.  If you keep both up, the minute you hit 51, you can take whatever change you find in your couch, search the 2hb/2hs list in the bazaar and get the best weapon you can afford and it's gonna blow your lammy and centi longsword out of the water in both damage and aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You should keep both weapon skills up to snuff.  I personally have found that many warriors overlook 2hb because it is slow to train usually (lack of fast training weapons that are worth a crap) and it can lead to some great deals for us warriors who are on a budget.  For instance, there are 2 handers that drop from CT, one is 2hs, one 2hb.  Both are 33/36 but the 2hb is consistently cheaper on Tunare than the 2hs.  Both are nice weapons for warriors and net the same DPS.<br />
<br />
And I can think of 3 that I would use atm, one of which I do and that is the ToD.  When a slower dies on a raid or I am not the MT in an exp group, I use it to slow with.  The GSoT and GSoFW are two more awesome 2hb's.<br />
<br />
For tradeable weapons there are 4 that I know of that I would consider for a warrior looking for DPS and utility.<br />
<br />
2hb:<br />
ToD    Utility weapon 33/44 proc's 50% slow DPS is so-so<br />
GSoT  31/30 good DPS and good aggro from the stun proc<br />
<br />
2hs:<br />
WMBS  31/28 better DPS than GSoT but less aggro due to no proc<br />
WB       50/44 same as above<br />
<br />
Although there are more 2hs weapons available with ratios around 1:1 I think the 2hb atm is the way to go.  You can lose a little DPS but have better aggro and utility.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I think you are confusing Lore items and No Drop items, you can give Lore items to a twink but not No Drop items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm thinkin about getting a GSoT, problem is, my 2HB skill is in the 50s  <br />
<br />
When I got my GSoT, my 2hb was 0.  I had 20 training points left, used those, and by the end of the night, my shaman friend was liking my improved agro enough to tell me to just sell my one handers.  At that point 2hb was about 120.  took like 3 more days to get it maxed.  If you are going to get a GSoT soon, just use it(delay 30 will get you skillups fairly quickly) to skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a 2hb skill of 18 myself, but as wonderful as the GSoT apparently is it wont be prying my BBB from my hands anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Its not like weapon skill takes long to raise tho.  I had no piercing skill until level 40 when I got given a jarsath trident and it took me 2 days to raise it.  I didnt start working on 1hb till my early 50s and that only took a day or 2 to max aswell.  <br />
<br />
Two hand weapons are slower so it takes longer to get skill ups, but I didnt start on 2hs till level 60 cos until I got my epic my best 2hs had been a nathsar great sword, but it still only took me a week in XP groups to max 2hs.<br />
<br />
Im sure if I ever get a 2hb worth using I'll have my skill maxed within 2-3 days but seeing as the only weapons on my wishlist are slashers its not something Im gonna worry about for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i think i maxed my 2hb skill ni about one and ahalf days of exping.<br />
<br />
so really, just pick up whatever weapon takes ur fancy and dont worry if your skills are not maxed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">GSoT where not arround in the bazar for a long time on my server if you could find one it was 30k-40k.  Tonight there was 7 for sale all rangeing 5kish.<br />
<br />
Why the sudden increase and why did the price fall off a cliff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Two reasons.  One, they opened up BoT to the masses.  Two, they upped the drop rate quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for all the input, gave me a lot of great ideas.  The reason I wanted non-lore 2hb or 2hs is because of the bank slot thing.  Can't drop lore items into it, and I dont trust people to hand things to and then have them hand em back.<br />
<br />
Appreciate all the great info, quite a lot of info on different weapons.<br />
<br />
I'll max out both, but just wanted to see which was more used/DPS/Aggro..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You can put lore items into the shared bank, just not no drop items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For me not that high level i was thinking of this (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16301) to train my 2hb, seems rather okey and the mob is lvl 35, but maybe it is harder then i forsee to kill him(adds and such)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lourdin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Don't forget for 2hb:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I thought Delay &lt; 28 = bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Depending on the weapon &lt; 28 can be a drawback but the Ornate Greatblade is 35/23.  1h DB or not, it is a mean fooker, good DPS and aggro even over a long haul.  The extra 6 DPS from the DoT doesn't hurt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">my 2 coppers on the GSoT.<br />
<br />
I just tried it out today and I was very impressed.  It holds agro well because the proc seems to draw agro regaurdless of weather it is resisted or not.  I wouldn't throw away my windblade but it is right on par with it and much cheeper to buy.</div></div><hr />
