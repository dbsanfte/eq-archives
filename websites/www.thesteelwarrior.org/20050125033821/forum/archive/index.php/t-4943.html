<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bull</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
I'm in a VT guild that is lookin at elemental within the next few months. We have a very solid crew of warriors. 5 of 7 are either at 9k or close (with a couple being well over.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, we've been getting some war apps lately and we're concerned that we're going to have a dimished capacity at raids and such.<br />
<br />
Obviously we'd like war apps closed, but our guild doesnt see it this way. They're afraid we're going to bail on them at any moment and leave them hanging...(Even tho their current Warrior crew has the best overall attendence stats)<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
When does a guild have enough?<br />
<br />
How do you folks handle being a guild that is saturated with Wars?</div></div><hr />

My guild closed warrior apps when our number reached 12.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends how many are active on most raids. If you already have 5-7 full times and a few extras i'd say close it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah IMO 5-7 Warriors is plenty.  My guild has about 10 warriors but only about half of them tank usually if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on how well your Cleric crew is. If they are not running on all cylinders, they can make 10K Warriors look like a paper tank just as well as an 8k one. Ever have one of those days where every tank is used on one mob?...heh. <br />
<br />
Sure, for certain encounters you need tanks, or really anyone with high enough HP and can hold agro. But for the most part, if the healers are perfect you only need a handful of active Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 7 on roster and we generally see 6 online every day, most of them having ~ 80% + attendance, which is outstanding.  In elemental+ encounters, it's nice having a handful of warriors, especially on fights like Reparm, Rathe, Time trials. Before some heavy recruiting, we averaged 2-3 warriors online and it was tough at times on some encounters.  Even if you have a slight excess on encounters where extra warriors aren't needed, they can still add some extra dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5 well equiped warriors should be enough for any encounter. most encounters wont even need 2 unless there's a whole in the CH chain or some rampage healers arent paying attnetion, or some other weird off base, murphy's law type situation comes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well geared and experienced warriors become very important at the high end; they are also very rare. A guild should honestly work at keeping any skilled warriors happy and making them tank. <br />
<br />
I got thrown off the deep end when I joined my current guild; Initially I was one of 9 warriors. The experienced warriors made absolutely sure I knew how to MT or RT on most encounters, knowing 1 day it would be needed. Quite a few of them had to quit EQ due to RL issues so now I am one of 3-4 active raid warriors, which is not really enough. (there are plenty of fights were you need a RT and 2 or more MTs)<br />
<br />
Also we have found the leaving warriors very very hard to replace. A cleric can Cheal in cloth armor if need be, but a warrior needs gear AND experience. An experienced Time geared warrior is worth his weight in gold, more so than any other class I feel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semidil</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No such thing as to much of any class, they important thing is when you get to a cirtain number, to make sure the recruits understand who gets in the raid first and who my get left behind.  If you do that, you will see a lot drop out cause they are only applying to jump on your coat tails, but the few that stay will enable you to raid on days you might not have been able to because of a low turn out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have too many when any of your warriors can't get enough meaningful work...a warrior that doesn't raid tank anything not only isn't living up to their potential...they are getting rusty.<br />
<br />
All that being said its a subjective question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We mostly just keep raising the requirements for classes that we don't need very much.  We don't normally totally close any class.  Sometimes that means we'll get a couple extras that we didn't really need for some classes but I'd rather get a fully flagged warrior with good gear and 300 AAs when we don't need him than have him go to another guild because we're not taking apps and then have to take a 65 war with 0 AAs and missing some flags when we do need them...  <br />
<br />
We always seem to get hit with Murphy's Law when people leave the guild.  If we're running low on slowers we won't just have 1 shaman quit on us.  We'll lose all but 1 of our chanters and shamans, all of our beastlords, and all but 1 of our bards.  It always seems to hit us in waves.  <br />
<br />
We had a stretch like that for warriors too back when I first joined the guild.  We were up to I think 14 warriors at one point and within the space of about 2 weeks we were down to 5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gleb</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can honestly say that my guild wishes we had this problem.  We are a small guild with 1 active tank (me) and one 50%er.  We could really use some warriors as we are climbing up the ranks a bit.<br />
<br />
Doing a lot with the 20 or so we have playing but there is a wall that we are going to hit eventually.</div></div><hr />
