                I have taken over my husbands retired warrior and am trying to lvl him up as quickly as I can. When I got him he was pretty much stripped so as you can see I have replaced the equipment I could.<br />
<br />
Without breaking the bank I was wondering if there were any good items I could camp buy for him.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the responses in advance.</div></div><hr />

Well, some of the slots look pretty good to me. I'd use the underfoot cultural armor as a guide for what might be upgraded:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=70&amp;rsa=Smithing&amp;rc=DWF&amp;sb=item&amp;menustr=080040030000<br />
<br />
Check all of those pieces against your current slots, then go to bazaar and start getting an idea of what underfoot costs.<br />
<br />
You have a couple of weaker slots here and there (one of your bracers, for example, and your boots are well into the &quot;yikes&quot; category) but compare each slot to cultural and you'll get a general idea of the most bang for your buck upgrades. You can look up steelwrapped and barbed ringmail (Uh, check to make sure dwarves can wear it, I dunno for sure and am too lazy to look) for temporary fixes that are cheaper than cultural, but they would be temporary.<br />
<br />
If your husband (rather than you) quested the champion's piece, you might ask him how he did that. It's not the most efficient camp, but I like fighting in Kael, and with a group you can get to part of it where the quest drops do (infrequently) drop. You could also find out from your husband what this warrior's Skyshrine faction was like. If he's killed enough giants in Kael, and you can get to the Western wastes, you and a 62 ish druid could probably do the draconic paldrons quest very quickly and it would be a minor/temporary shoulder upgrade. (Wouldn't bring this up, but you asked about stuff you can camp.)<br />
<br />
But the first thing I'd do is look at your weapons, particularly the BoI. Might want to replace it with either of the droga weapons (sword of the bloodsworn or copper hammer of striking). I kinda like the debuff on BoI, but the others are better aggro. <br />
I note you have a very very nice smithing mod in your range slot. Can this warrior make his own cultural stuff? (oh, smithing skill of 153, heh, not quite yet.)<br />
If you can't afford a droga weapon right away, you might pick up a Great Staff of Thunder and play with it. It costs 200ish plat on most servers. <br />
<br />
At  the moment, I don't think your armor precludes you from leveling. Aggro generation in the mainhand might be the first thing that you'll notice giving you problems.<br />
<br />
Oh, hmm. I forgot to look for what you are using for haste. With the right group you could try to get the soulscream belt in Veksar or perhaps the Sirens Grotto haste, if you don't have 31% or better. If you don't have haste, that should be your first priority.<br />
<br />
I like this warrior. Your husband put a lot of time into him.<br />
the fact that his alcohol tolerance is 198 in and of itself deserves a /salute.</div></div><hr />
