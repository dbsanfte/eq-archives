<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furo</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello. Recently picked up a Shimmering Jade Axe (ref magelo). <br />
<br />
Just wanted to know if it's possible to use it as a tanking weapon. I don't have Punishing Blade yet but am working on it. My main question is whether or not to A3 this weapon. I realize that the DW set up I have is most likely more aggro due to pure procs available, WA5 and Ambidex. But, the AC on the Axe is nice to have during fights in KT etc. <br />
<br />
So, can this weapon with an A3 aug be used to tank in exp groups?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'll just slap the 150 dd aug on it from East Commonland adv camp.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally, what is the aggro produced from the Guard proc? Someone told me it's roughly equivalent to a heal for 150 points which is basically poor.<br />
<br />
Weapon is incredible DPS by the way, despite the poor DMG bonus. Just wish the min hit on it was higher though...i've seen it range from 21-320 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will it work in xp groups for aggro?  My guess is yes<br />
Will it work on raids for aggro?  My guess is yes<br />
Will it let you hold aggro while grouped/raiding with hardcore dps who dont like to hold back?  My guess is no<br />
<br />
Great dps on it i'd imagine, but Guard procs are low aggro IIRC.  You could get by with it wonderfully, but i dont think it would stand up to the challenge of a wizard/mage/druid/necro at your level of play going full dps in either raiding or xp grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the usual consideration... it'll be fine, but not great. It looks like a great experience group weapon due to the high DPS, the extra damage mitigation via proc, so you could do worse than that for experiencing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Apolyon<br />

It has been said time and time again Tanks are not DPS when MA. The more aggro/hate you can bring to the table the more DPS your group can dump = shorter mob lifespan. I would keep the axe for when non MA duties in a raid or group but for any groups you want the most aggro you can generate. Also depending where you are tanking and the group makeup I have bagged my 2handers and gone DW to get aggro faster and hold it better even with killer ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furo</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the reason for my original post is due alot to ripostes. Mobs in KT , Ikk tend to spike quite often and AC + Mitigation are your friend in those situations  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right there Furo but I was told to bag my 2handers and get out the DW setup from my clerics there in both zones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not just 2hander or 1hander that determines aggro quality,It's the particular weapons.You don't want to use the axe to hold aggro because it's not a good aggro weapon, that's it.You could make it an ok aggro weapon,but,why bother if you can apply the same modification to good hate weapons and make them better.Good aggro is a warriors first concern,riposte while something to be considered at times is a distant second.BOW,SEWS &amp; I've heard VDD ... all hold aggro pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could make it an ok aggro weapon,but,why bother if you can apply the same modification to good hate weapons and make them better. <br />

  Normally I don't really consider warrior DPS as significant, but in an experience group with a very good DPS weapon that can hold aggro just fine, warrior DPS definitely helps. If the group doesn't have to hold back while he swings this, then he's improving the group more than the added aggro would. If they have to hold back, then it's not good enough aggro and he should use something else. I think it'd be worth at least a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furo</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent the 1150 points yesterday and A3'd it for two reasons.<br />
<br />
1. I want to test it as an aggro weapon in group exp.<br />
<br />
2. I figure that down the road I can simply move the aug over to a one-handed aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was only able to exp for about an hour in KT with the aug yesterday but had varying results.  The damage mitigation and lack of ripostes was outstanding. However, there were some sporadic aggro problems mainly due to not landing that first critical Taunt when a shammy has a slow already on an incoming mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I decided to keep my inventory window open and simply rotated my one-handers in for early aggro purposes. This worked well because my one handers proc EB or A3 quite frequently. Then about 10-15 seconds into each fight I switched back to the Axe and had little problems with aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm going to do alot more testing but it seems to work this way as long as chain pulls are not too fast and I have the few seconds to get my one-handers up. <br />
<br />
In other groups like LDoN normal or hards I'll keep the one-handers because fast aggro is a must and I like to normally charge through ldons.<br />
<br />
But for KT - type groups I'd like to use the axe simply because it helps the healer out and adds quite a bit more group dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally, a groups dps is limited by aggro,so the more the better.If you can afford to max out a main aggro set and have an extra dps aggro weap for situational use kewl.Necros and stuff have to hold back a lil with me regardless of what I use at this point.RZ in time tomorrow hehe....knocks on wood. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well last night I had the joy of tanking aow I didn't think about bringing a 2hander. So I used my emp bane unauged 2hs to tank and I never lost agro nor did I die. This is while being in cheal chain as well lol so not sure how much the wep matters as how well you are at keeping up on incite and taunt I had no trouble at all didn't even see a split second target change using hott. <br />
<br />
Let the flaming begin=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The weapons matter hehe.If you think they don't good luck with your future raidtanking. :)</div></div><hr />

  Someone also tanked AoW while afk. Yippie, you can do what an AFK person can do. Good luck thinking that weapons don't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I don't mean completely don't matter. As you can see I have a boc and today have aug3 for it. What I ment was you can hold agro well enough with incite and taunt alone of course having some insane agro proc wep makes the DPS able to come in faster was just a statement knew someone was gonna misinterpret it notice the ending statement. a 22/44 held agro and raid attacked at 99% we are only solro flagged so don't quite have the insane dps fighting me over agro some other do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AOW is easy to manipulate.His proximity aggro on you was obviously of great effect and if you actually did this your're  lucky.On a lot of raids you're fighting red cons with poor chances of taunt being succesful and incite is pretty horrible aggro without procs overtime.So really I'm not sure what the point of your post was.Are you trying to say that all the aggro research and discussion on this board regarding weapons is not important,because, a skilled warrior such as yourself tanking in velious can get by with taunt/incite and no procs?Or are you just pulling our leg trying to get a rise out of people as a troll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my point was 2hand are descent weps to use sometime and the agro on them isnt as horrible as I myself thought. Not a troll been trying to post some info other threads that are helpful. Rereading my post didn't quite get my point I did not know about higher level mobs being able to resist taunt in a way guess my point was a grossgeneralization sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furo</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Higher level mobs get paid to resist taunt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, its not uncommon at all to see a streak of 8 or 9 failed taunts. multiply that times the 6 second reuse and that a loooooooooong time the mob could be cleaning your raids clocks. <br />

/hugs ae taunt</div></div><hr />
