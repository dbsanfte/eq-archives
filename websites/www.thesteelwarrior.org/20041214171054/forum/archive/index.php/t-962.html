<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious what hotkeys &amp; macros you use on raids, either as MA or SA or split tank..<br />
<br />
At the moment I have a 'Inc' one for if I grab something that just popped or to tell people when I switch target (it says Inc but people figure it out..)<br />
<br />
The main one is a Assist macro simply to assist puller (necro or monk), tells raid and channel about mob incoming and waiting for attack call.<br />
<br />
Then I have another one for attack call, which tells raid to attack, and my group what is the current target..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heres they ones i have - <br />
<br />
Assist call - i have one for melees and casters but tend to use only melees and even then only infrequently now as our guild melees are meant  to manage their own aggro.<br />
<br />
Target - just a MA targeting %t - i find this useful as a heads up to people to know whats incoming or when 2 mobs are inc so the SA knows what to offtank.<br />
<br />
SA OT - if im MA - i have a macro telling the SA which target to offtank. If im SA&lt; then ill change this to say SA offtanking %t so people know what mob im on.<br />
<br />
Back off - Basically a disengage and back the hell away from the mob and let me get aggro/position - for occassions when u have an add or MT goes down or pets are misbehaving and you need to reposition mob or get aggro.<br />
<br />
Defensive - to let em know when im hitting defensive.<br />
<br />
autoriposte - to let em know when im doing combo of AE taunt and autoriposte - for occassions when the sht hits the fan and i need to buy everyone time to cast evac.<br />
<br />
MA switch - for MA switches ill have one telling the clerics that im just about to hit AE taunt/defensive in x no of seconds and to start spamming the heals on me.<br />
<br />
proc - to let em know when wep procs. helps the shams /enchs to time debuffs and melees casters to know when they can unload a little bit more. tend to only use this in intial rounds of fight and if its a harder mob that shams are holding off slow for.<br />
<br />
/shield - if i have a primary class in my group then ill put em on hotkey shield.<br />
<br />
thats about all i can think of atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inc %T, Assist me on %T, Offtanking %T, Switch Sides, Back Off<br />
<br />
That does me for raid instructions<br />
<br />
Also have AE taunt, and defensive give messages to raid too.<br />
<br />
/shield I just set, no actual text output.<br />
<br />
If not MA I set /assist &lt;MAname&gt; or just F8 :P<br />
<br />
Sometimes if I'm not MA I do AE calls as well, ie<br />
<br />
+++AE Off, Casters have 12 seconds to next AE!!+++<br />
<br />
where 12 can change depending on mob (lucy and good mob knowledge is your friend here :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes I with for a /raid command..<br />
/raid back off<br />
/raid report health<br />
/raid attack<br />
/raid hold<br />
/raid who leader<br />
/raid get lost<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dealing</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I am not MA or SA I have /tar &lt;MA&gt; so that I assist correctly. If I I am SA then I have /rsay I AM ON %t Dont engage. Assist the MA. That is more for the few peeps that dont pay attention and try to assist me. I also have /rsay call your pets off. Because you have the few pet classes that think I need the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty much as above...<br />
<br />
/rs inc %T  - for when I need to tag pulls<br />
/rs assist me %T - when I am MT/MA<br />
/rs splittanking %T - when I am offtanking<br />
I usually don't worry about telling my raid my disco's are engaged: not really their problem (if I am discoing, I am  MT and they should know better than to try and gank aggro) but  I have one telling them when defensive/evasive is down (/rs disco down). <br />
I sometimes have one telling them to switch and assist Tank 2 (but usually if this happens, I'm dead and they know already :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't use macros for anything except for calling an AE.  They're annoying and don't help at all imo.  Who cares if you just AE taunted?  If things were that bad, clerics were probably already getting pounded and put DA up so they won't be able to heal you right away.  Ok, you're defensive ... congratulations.   There's already a message that anyone who matters is going to see, I don't need more spam in my window.  If you have to micromanage the raid that much, you're already screwed.  It's better to put in the effort to get their heads out of their asses so they can figure out what to do in the future without 4 bazillion macros flying across the screen.  And if you're the MA and people can't use /assist anyway, they need to learn and you shouldn't be switching targets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krunt</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for raids (usually MT,ST,RT or sometimes two or more)<br />
I use W,A,S,D as oposed to arrow keys for movment<br />
1.Taunt<br />
2.Kick and Disarm (it may add agro) linked to the E key for quick hits<br />
3.AE Taunt (right above that E key)<br />
4.Range<br />
5.INC MSG (/rs --%T-- is my target, you may assist now)Lets em have one last &quot;doh&quot; check before they cast engadge whatever they do.<br />
6.Disc (Defensive or Evasive depending on the mob, rarely anything else)<br />
7.Assit %T<br />
8.Linked to the refresh on the Kick skill so i know when to hit E again... I ditch it if i need something on raids, but usually i sub it out and never hit the button.<br />
9.Insta clicky or some other important something that is mob/raid specific<br />
10. Insta clicky (9th dain ring, hopefully 10th soon)<br />
<br />
Oh, i have all my other disc keys on the preceding page for a quick hit if I need to disc somehting that isnt' up.  On the following page I have some other messages and convinince keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sliceum</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MT or GROUP:<br />
1 = Attack, 2 = Kick <br />
3 = Range, 4 = Taunt<br />
5 = /assist, 6 = &quot;INC %T&quot;<br />
7 = /disc defensive, 8 = /disc evasive<br />
9 = /shield, 10 = varies<br />
<br />
RAID<br />
1 = Attack, 2 = Kick <br />
3 = Range, 4 = Taunt<br />
5 = /assist [MT Name], 6 = /rs &amp; /g &quot;OFFTANKING %T&quot;<br />
7 = /disc defensive, 8 = /disc evasive <br />
9 = /assist [ST Name], 10 = varies<br />
<br />
I also have a bank of &quot;Social Keys&quot; that hold other MSGs that are not commonly used, but are close if needed.  These will get switched into the MACRO #10 if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My assist hotkey for raids is like this<br />
<br />
/assist &lt;puller&gt;<br />
/pause 1<br />
/rs Assisting &lt;puller&gt; with [ %T ] -pls wait for attack call-<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
The shield hotkey, best when MT :<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 1<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
(to use when mob runs off to caster)<br />
<br />
I also tend to use the top view a lot recently. I have found it gives me the best framerate in some zones like Plane of Innovation, and gives a good view of positioning of melees around the mob. The perspective is quite cool as well on gnarled treants in PoN or giants in Kael ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assist me on %T, Incoming &lt;--- %T ---&gt; thats about it oh and my assist for when not MTing is<br />
<br />
/target &lt;MA name&gt;<br />
/assist &lt;MA name&gt; <br />
<br />
all in one push.</div></div><hr />
