I always wanted to make a tanker type character, but I didn't know what would be the best choice or what weapons to work with or anything. I've read some of the posts and I don't really know what to look for in a weapon if I want to be a warrior. I was wondering if some of you guys could give me some info on what would be the best racial combo for a 'n00b' war :) . Any of you guys ideas would be great, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5722 - Guard Captains Mallet<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=63794 - Steel-Laced Aged Snake Whip<br />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5629 - Nathsar Greatsword  __or___<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5657 - Ornate Runed Blade<br />
<br />
All pretty cheap and get your major weap skills covered.  Those 2 handers are great till damage cap is lifted, then probably want something with a better ratio. The one handers are good till you are high enough level to get something with a groovy proc. (Can't think of a good 2hb for starting out, I used the shovel from lake Rathe to train 2hb.)  If moneys no issue then you can do a lot better, but those are solid to twink with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Poison Wind Censer is a nice 2hb starting weapon (20/28)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=551<br />
The effect will not work until level 50 so dont worry about the AE.<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer your Question about the best racial combo: In the end there will be no big difference so play what you like most.<br />
Some advantages/disadvantages of some races/deities:<br />
<br />
advantages:<br />
Iksar: higher natural regen, AC bonus<br />
Troll: higher natural regen<br />
Oger: Stun immunity<br />
Halfling: hide, sneak, fastest leveling<br />
woodelf: hide, sneak, forage<br />
small races: need no shrink<br />
Rallos Zek deity: allows you to wear Fierce Heraldic armor<br />
<br />
disadvantages:<br />
large races: need shrinks often<br />
iksar: cannot wear some plate armor (for example Fierce Heraldic)<br />
iksar,troll,oger: exp penalty<br />
<br />
Stats like STR, STA etc will not mean much in the end. With Raidbuffs you will hit the caps anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vah Shir, innate safefall (and sneak I believe)<br />
<br />
No slam like other large races.  Eats more then any other race, and the tail gets in the way.  Can ONLY be agnostic which has it's good and bad points (Worker Sledge Mallet is easy to do with dark elf, ogre, or troll potions)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venox</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best Race(s): Erudites and High Elfs<br />
Why: They have highest CHA. Warrior's need CHA in the end game because of DI. DI makes a check vs. CHA, which means the higher your CHA, the more you will live, the more succesful the raid will be.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm OFF<br />
<br />
Seriously though. Iksar and Ogre are the best races to be a Warrior with. Iksar because they will always have 54 more AC than any other race, and Ogre's because they have frontal stun immunity; although that can be fixed (to some extent) through AAs.<br />
<br />
The weapons I would reccomend getting: Frostbringer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4851) and Barnacle Covered Axe (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19649). Although you need to be levels 40 and 35 for the procs to work, these should last you until you get your epics (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=768)  or until you get a Greatstaff of Thunder (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17984). Before I was level 35 I used a Centi Shortsword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7260) and a Sarnak Skullsplitter (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=331).<br />
<br />
Equipment is easy. Get HP/AC/Resists/STA Items. Don't worry about any stats, just HP/AC/Resists/STA -- in that order.<br />
<br />
There. That should last you until you get the hang of things.<br />
<br />
GOOD LUCK and HAVE FUN.</div></div><hr />
