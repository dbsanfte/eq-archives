<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rakaul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I did a search but couldn't find any answers so here it goes.<br />
<br />
Back in the day I remember weapons with 40+ delay had a larger bonus to dmg.  Is this still true?  And if so how much of a difference is it?<br />
<br />
Reason I am asking is I am looking for 2hs weapon and see the warmarshall's blade as a nice weapon but it is on the quick side(which I suppose gives me more opportunities to hit?) but then there are a few weapons out there with similar prices in the bazaar that are even delay/dmg but slower like 44/44 ones.  Does the dmg bonus of the slower weapon make them more even or has verant, or soe now I guess, changed this or was this misinformation a few years ago?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.  For some reason I have neglected using other resources...<br />
<br />
But according to this.<br />
<br />
WMBS with a 28 delay and 31 dmg has a bonus of 35 at level 65.<br />
Whatever axe I was looking at with a 44/44 has a bonus of 45 at level 65.<br />
<br />
So does this mean in effect that at level 65 they are a 63/31 and a 89/44?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion.  And I am not 65 yet.  Only 50 but figure I had better get this stuff straight now.</div></div><hr />

  No. The damage bonus is added after the damage calculations are done, not to the base damage. So every hit with a WMBS has 35 damage added to it, after the random part based off of your damage table and attack. At least, that's how I *think* it works!</div></div><hr />

I think you are right.  I just came back to the game after being gone for a few years so I am rusty but that certianly sounds like something i've heard before.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rakaul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So does anyone know how this plays into the dmg?  I am looking for an okay dps weapon for when I am not the MT and with the dmg bonuses added in I am wondering if a slower weapon with not as good of a ratio might be just as good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The idea behind damage bonuses was to balance out higher delay weapons to lower delay ones. Before the changes, you basically wanted the fastest weapon possible so that the damage bonus would be applied more often. In theory, the scaling up of the damage bonus on high delay two handed weapons allows them to do similar damage to a similar ratio faster weapon. I haven't looked at enough comparisons to know how it actually works, but I'd think you'd never want to go for a worse ratio slower weapon. I believe the advantage is in DPS still lies with the faster weapons, in general. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for 2 handed weapons is at 28 delay, where you have a damage bonus of 35 at level 65, while 27 has a damage bonus of only 14.</div></div><hr />

and a GSot4W http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24780<br />
the max hit on GSot4W is exactly 22 damage over the CB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Damage bonus applies to minimum and maximum hit, before innate mitigation comes into effect.<br />
<br />
Assume two weapons with the same exact damage, but different delays so that the DB is different.  A weapon with 50dly has a Dmg Bonus of 51.  A weapon with 40dly has a dmg bonus of 42.<br />
<br />
The average hit of the 50dly weapon will be 9 greater than the average hit of the 40dly weapon, as well as the minimum and maximum hits.<br />
<br />
It has been estimated that the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for a 2h delay is at 28.  Anything less and you take a significant hit to your dps.  Anything more and your dmg bonus isnt being applied as often.<br />
<br />
Rule of thumb: for DPS, pick the best ratio'ed weapon you can.  If there's two weapons with very similar ratio, go with the one with the weapon with the lowest delay over 28.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Short answer to your question: according to several parses (theres one over at the sk forum at least), the WMBS is the best droppable dps weapon out there. It comes out ahead over everything up to and including a windblade. A &gt;1 ratio and a delay of 28 is a pretty wicked combo. I used one up until I got a GSo4W and it's a great weapon, and looks cool too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">trying to answer the question about whether the 31/28 with 35db is &quot;like&quot; a 66/28 ...<br />
<br />
assume minimum damage of 1 and max of 2 x 31 so average damage is about 31 (the damage rating). in that situation you would be correct about the effect of the damage bonus.  now in many encounters the distributions is fairly linear between 1 and 2 x damage. there are however also some hits that go up to something like 4 x damage and there are crits as well. besides that the distribution is not necessarily linear within that range anyway because ATK vs mob AC will skew that distribution higher or lower. so it all depends.<br />
<br />
i would suppose when targetting deep red named mobs you might be able to say the damage bonus is even more important than that equation makes it (since average damage is skewed seriously downward) but for the large majority of blue con mobs the damage distribution will be skewed upward and the damage bonus will take less significance than that equation states.</div></div><hr />
