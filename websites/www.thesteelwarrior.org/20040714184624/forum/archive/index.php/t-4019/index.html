<br />
A few restriction i have considered for tanking class:<br />
-2hander for aggro is preferable for tanks to reduce riposte damage, what's 1000 HP advantage when you take twice as many riposte of 3k hit that increase you're chance of dying.<br />
<br />
Warrior : 9010HP 2097AC<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=848207<br />
<br />
Paladin : 8398HP 2076AC<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=848184<br />
<br />
It was said that if warrior are considered 100, then knights should be 80. Well that would mean that the paladin should have 7208HP and 1678AC.<br />
<br />
Instead the paladin have 93% of the warrior HP and 99% of it's AC. Considering raid buff and LDON augment, we further lower the difference.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1 HANDER COMPARISON<br />
For the sake of argumentation, i have also included a dual wield warrior and 1hander+shield paladin.<br />
<br />
Warrior : 9324HP 2127AC<br />
Paladin : 8549HP 2164AC<br />
<br />
In this case the warrior will have a much harder time getting a hammer of timeweaver in a dkp guild compared to the paladin a shield of strife.<br />
<br />
In this scenario the paladin is 92% of the warrior HP and 102% of his AC.<br />

total     : 2402HP                     total    : 120AC<br />
<br />
Paladin also have Aura of the crusader of which i'm not sure if there is stacking issue with the above spell, pls advise.<br />
<br />
+500 HP  from easily attainable LDoN augment<br />
<br />
Warrior 2hander : 11912HP  -  2217AC<br />
Paladin 2hander : 11300HP  -  2196AC<br />
<br />
Which bring the paladin at 95% HP of the warrior and 99% AC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Using a shield is a practical MTing setup for a Paladin, since they need not rely on their weapon's DPS or procs to hold aggro. So, for completeness:<br />
<br />
Warrior (2H): 9010HP 2097AC<br />
Paladin (1H/Shield): 8549HP 2164AC<br />
<br />
add raids buffs:<br />
Warrior (2H): 11412HP 2217AC<br />
Paladin (1H/Shield): 11178HP 2300AC<br />
<br />
LDoN augments increase the numbers equally and therefore make the % difference even smaller. Without taking augments into account we see a Warrior &quot;advantage&quot; of 234HP and (-)83AC. This is more like 97.5% than 93%. With LDoN augments the number will approach 98%.<br />
<br />
It would be an interesting exercise to do the same thing using VT and Kael items (Great Shadow Platemail, Velium Encrusted Gauntlets, etc.). My guess is that at several stages Paladins can practically match a simularly equipped Warrior in HP's and AC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, since tanking is the product of the ability to soak up/mitigate damage, that means a Knight should have 90% the HP and 90% the mitigation as warriors, which would put them at 80% the effectiveness of a warrior (well, 81% with these #s).  <br />
<br />
The HPs don't look horribly wrong to me.  It's of course closer than it should be but that's mostly attributed to freebie shield and Aura of the Crusader.  This part is relatively easy to fix should they decide to.  Just tweak some class numbers and you'll get back the 90% advantage.<br />
<br />
The AC part is really bothersome.  Knights should have 90% of our AC AFTER using a shield, not before, as they lose nothing in any tanking situation by using one.  If you look at the elemental pieces, it even agrees with what I am saying.  All pieces of Trydan/Grimor's consistently have 90% AC of Raex.  A warrior using the same all plate equipment as a Knight (not all/all, those I think should stay the way they are) should get 10% more AC off the same piece.  No need for any fancy calculation.  If an item is War/Pal/Shd or War/Pal/Shd/Clr/Bard then Warrior gets 110% the listed AC on the item.  It's tempting to slap a 10% HP bonus as well though I'd rather they just fix the freebie shield/Aura of Crusader issue instead.<br />
<br />
Actually, it'd be best if everyone besides Warriors get 90% the listed AC value on all/plate items.  But of course people will cry about a nerf so that's why we should just give warrior 10% AC and then make mob's attack 10% higher to keep people from crying nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Phant, I agree with your logic, however you assume AC = HP.  83 ac is a lot better than 234 hp.  One warrior here quoted 6 hp = 1 ac, and that is more or less the rule I follow in determining how much hp to give up for ac.  This, of course, favors knights even more.<br />
<br />
Right now the only reason warriors exist is /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
I got $10 that says they nerf a certain warrior AA skill before they do a god damn thing about this thread's topic.</div></div><hr />

Which would explain your 140% overall DPS. Lord knows, with the number of mobs in the game totally immune to your crazy magics, your melee is all you got. <br />

Of course, some rogue abilitys would be nice, how about the ability to backstab with my 2h weapons, my VDD is kinda pointed im sure I could shove it through a mob's back, maybe I should get the ability to do it from the front to just to give me a chaotic stab equilavent.<br />
<br />
Gazarion, which augments would those be?  Thanks to FT augments being lore and all loot being time gear he only has type 8 slots aviable, giving him access to an FT1 and FT2 which could be placed in (at the cost of 40 hp/mana that could be put in instead, or 20 ac or a mix depending on the slots used).  Or is there some magical FT10 augment from LDoN raids thats been found that I've missed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This where stuns come into play and give you an advantage in tanking ability.  If i can stun somthing so it does no damage to me I would consider that a significant improvement to midigation or chance of miss, which arn't that far off from war ability in the first place.  So you think that you should maintain your advantage in tanking ability as well I take it from your comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's actually not important how much HP each AC is worth when you look at the class abilities broadly.<br />
<br />
Suppose warriors has X HP and Paladin has 0.9X HP, and we interpret mitigate 10% better as warriors takes 10% less damage.  Then, when a Paladin takes 100 HP of damage, it'd take 111 HP do the same to the warrior.  Hence, the warrior X HP is really worth 1.11X HP if both classe are taking the same damage.<br />
<br />
So now we get Wariorr at 1.11X and Paladin at 0.9X, which is roughly the 80% ratio that as quoted.<br />
<br />
If you use the recent monk parse Brodda Thep quoted (monk 1800 AC and Paladin 2100 AC), using mob DB = 200, DI = 40, then the Paladin was taking 82% the damage as the Monk.  If an uber monk has 10K HP, then that means the Paladin had effectively 21% more than monk HP, which is 2100.  In reality it's better for warriors because the more HP you have, the more effective AC is (taking half damage at 10K is like having 10K more HP, as opposed to taking half damage at 1K is only good for 1K extra HPs).  <br />
<br />
This would seem to indicate 1 displayed AC = 7 HP.  Even if you factor in that it wasn't a long parse and that maybe 1800 AC for a monk isn't as good as 1800 AC for another tanking class, let's say that we're so off that we overestimate the effect of AC by 100%.  Then we use 1 displayed AC = 3.5 HP.  Incidentally that'd mean the 10 raw AC augment buyable in Mistmoore is worth around 50 HP even at this very pessimistic estimate.<br />
<br />
This is also why I'm far more bothered by Paladins having our AC if not better than approaching our HPs.  I don't care if their HPs are close.  Currently in this game max HP do not matter very much anyway assuming a reasonable chain behind the warrior.  But it should be much harder (20% at least if our HPs are nearly identical) for a mob to take a HP off me than a Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Suppose warriors has X HP and Paladin has 0.9X HP, and we interpret mitigate 10% better as warriors takes 10% less damage.

<br />
All the parces i've seen pal and sk were within 5 percent of warriors on mitigate.  where are you geting 10% from?  Secondly how are you comming up with pal get .9x HP you must mean .98x hp.  <br />
<br />
so war have 1.05xhp vs .98xhp for pal?<br />
<br />
Also their are MANY other things to take into consideration regarding max hp.   For example DI triggers at 14.99 percent so their is value in having the most hp you can possibly have regardless of ac, midigation or anything else.  Potential of being one rounded, AOE damage, proc damage all are not effected by midigation but warrior lost their any advantage they had in surviving these.   <br />
<br />
Your 1.11x HP looks good on paper but when it comes to playing eq we need a hp advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I didn't say that's what the numbers currently are.  I'm saying that's what the numbers ought to be.  80% of our tanking power translates to just about 90% of our mitigation ability and 90% of our HPs.   That was in response for the people who think Knights should be 80/80 which would put them at 60% of our tanking ability.<br />
<br />
At the high end level I really think HP and AC can be used interchangably anyway.  It's not like there are people with 5K HP and 5K AC.  Yes there is still spell damage to deal with but I don't think we have to be better at absorbing magic damage as well just because it's part of tanking, as long as spell damage isn't the primary source of damage the boss does.  From my knowledge, most ubers are still primarily melee-based.  It's true the spells can mess you up pretty badly but most of the damage is still physical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Considering that curently they are at 98% of our hp and 95% of our midigation ability right now I guess that would be an improvement.  80/80 would put them about even with warriors, no where near 60%.  <br />
<br />
When you factor in the ability to stun to midigate damage as well as heal with mana,aa skills,weapon procs and life taps the equasion changes significantly.  Its hard to leave those items out,  unmem hybred spells and say &quot;thats balanced&quot;.  If 80% is the target efficency we need to include more than simple melee midigation and total hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>cuedyen2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I didn't say that's what the numbers currently are.

<br />
Not that I agree or disagree with your statement - but I do disagree with your math.  90% + 90% = 180 into 200 = 90% of your tanking not 80% of your tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">90% = .9 =&gt; .9 hp * .9 mitigation = .81 tanking ability ~ 80% tanking ability. <br />
<br />
90% of the mitigation means each hp is worth approximately 90% less than a warrior's hp. Include 90% of the hp in that equation, and you end up with about 80% of a warriors tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pretty much, and in fact your HP gets higher the more useful AC becomes, assuming mitigation always provides a constant % of improvement.  In other words, no matter what your AC is, adding a fixed amount of AC always reduces the damage you take by a fixed %.  It really isn't a problem if Knights have our HP but say 80% mitigation for example.  Ignoring stuff like spell damage (which is significant but rarely the major source of tanking damage) 100% HP 80% mitigation is exactly the same as 80% HP and 100% mitigation.  For all practical purposes, if you propose Knights have 80% mitigation (meaning we take 80% of what they take) and 80% HP, then if the current uber Warrior is at 12000 HP, then a warrior's tankability is 1.25 (each of our HP is worth 1.25 of theirs) / 0.8 (ratio of our HPS) = 56% better, which means an uber Knight is the equivalent of a 7680 HP warrior with the same AC.  <br />
<br />
90/90 would put an uber Knight at 9720 HP with the same AC.  This seems about right... it might still be too high, but at least it's a lot more reasonable than 7680.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In other words, no matter what your AC is, adding a fixed amount of AC always reduces the damage you take by a fixed %.<br />
But of course it doesn't.  Min hits don't get any more minimal.  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Err what I mean is this.<br />
<br />
Say you have 2000 AC, and you take say 100 DPS on average.  After adding 100 AC, you now take 90 DPS.  Then, I'm assuming this means adding 100 AC always reduces the current damage you're taking (on average) by 10%.  So if I go from 2100 AC to 2200 AC, then I'll now take 90 X (0.9) = 81 DPS.  If I go from 2000 AC to 1900 AC then I should expect to take 11% more damage, or 111 DPS<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is a valid formula to compute AC but this makes calculating the value of AC significantly easier.  You can simply use some known parses and then convert AC to an equivalent HP based on that parse, and then use the formula obtained for the general case.</div></div><hr />

This is incorrect. Quarm is not the Vulak of PoP. Quarm was, BY DESIGN (as in in the actual DESIGN DOC OF THE ZONE/MOB), a mob that was to be tanked by rotating /disc Defensive warriors. <br />

I am well aware of Vulak and his abilities and at no time was /disc defensive or evasive something any warrior cared about when tanking Vulak (aside from the first two pre-nerf Vulaks who were unslowable and considerably more powerful) - Vulak NEVER one rounded a non def warrior. The fact that Knights have enough AC/Hps to be able to stay in and even be LUCKY ENOUGH to not get one rounded the entire fight shows a massive problem in the balance of power in this game.</div></div><hr />

 For anyone that wants to read it. And Thor, he's already tanked Tallon I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yeah, I was mostly pointing out that at least 3 others mobs have much higher dps where 1 missed/lagged ch can result in death.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure about how DI fit in this, in the sense that since it fire off at 15% and not at 0%, you often get saved even thought you weren't dead.  The thing is that any of these mobs can 1 round a non-def warrior (and even one if you are really unlucky with rispote/ae) but since it's trivial to get 305 charisma now and that DI work (my estimate) 95% of the time, how can they expect tanks to die?  <br />
<br />
I mean, warriors 1 tank these mobs all the time now, with a significant part of the fight without any disc.  At least in my guild the MT are using DarkBlade/Edge.  Any hybrids tank will be using a weapon that will give about half the riposte of the warrior combo, negating imo any advantage we might have in term of hp/avoidance.  Hybrids can also probably not even attack to reduce the riposte to 0 and keep casting spells.<br />
<br />
I mean, since the upgrade when I'm about to die from dot/ae or whatever and I have di on, I don't even bother begging for heal since DI for me has worked very close to 100% with 175 unbuff cha only.<br />
<br />
So what's the opinion on tanking, balance and Divine Intervention now?  Tell me that they tanked with a monk/knight without DI and then I'll be stunned.  With it to remove 95% chance of dying to a big spike, I don't even see how this can come has a surprise, even thought I agree it's a confirmation of problems, but we all know that already.<br />

Sure does its total bull. if i have 90 percent of your nutts and 90 percent of your bolts somehow phantrom comes to the conclusion that i have 80 percent your nutts&amp;bolts.  <br />
<br />
Yah, yah, and if you have 50% avoidance and 50% mitigation, then you have 100% tankage and take 0 damage, right?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
There's a difference between multiplicitive and additive relationships.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I'd say it's still all flawed because it ignores the cost of healing.  Heals do a set amount.  Once you can land the best heal on either tank type for max easily, the hp total becomes all but insignificant.  HP totals can't be used to fix things unless there's a heal that provides a reason for higher hp totals to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Did you mean multiplicative?<br />
<br />
I'll agree with that and I'll agree that its not as simple as taking the raw numbers and adding them up without including heals and stuns in the function.  Half ass rules of thumb for diverse classes arn't really needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We know Knights are supposed to be around 80% of our tanking abilty.  I'd like to see they get that right before trying to fix anythign else.</div></div><hr />

Is that before or after /disc defensive?<br />
<br />
I think that knights and warriors should be fairly interchangeable when it comes to tanking.  Unfortunately, it seems that knights can more and more completely replace a warrior, but a warrior can't do the same for a knight.  (Think LDoN raids here.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">80% should be before disc consider there are really no 'disc only' mobs anymore, at least outside of LDoN (haven't done LDoN, so don't know if there are things that are disced only there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">This is incorrect. Quarm is not the Vulak of PoP. Quarm was, BY DESIGN (as in in the actual DESIGN DOC OF THE ZONE/MOB), a mob that was to be tanked by rotating /disc Defensive warriors.  <br />
<br />
Doesnt this mean that a warriior shouldnt beable to one tank him either? heh...<br />
<br />
I'm confused about your comments about DI Thor, maybe I dont know how it works, which is very possible, but doesnt DI only Trigger if you have 0 - 15% HP?<br />
<br />
If your gunna be one rounded DI wont save you correct? DI only will save you if you get to  zero and 15% HP, and would not have received a heal before the mob hit you again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Yeah Madrone DI makes the CHR check once you get to or go below 15% hp. but if your at 16% and get killed your DI never had the chance to make the Chr check and you die.  most people think DI makes the check when you run out of HP, but thats not the case.</div></div><hr />

I'm probalby just misunderstaning what you mean, but I dont see how DI would prevent a big spike; because if the big spike kilsl you, you die Regardless of DI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I'm pretty sure DI can check in between hits.  For example let's say DI goes off at 3K HP with your current max HP.  Then if you're at 4K and something hits you 4K it'd kill you with no chance of DI.  However something can do say 2000 then 2000, and those hits can be in the same round.  The first hit will knock you to 2K and DI would go off and save you.  If it doesn't even work on an example like this I don't see how DI can save as many times as it does.  It is pretty rare to end up with 30% or whatever that number is of your total HP at the end of a mob's round.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">A knight with a few Shielding items will be reducing damage a miniscule amount.  With Bulwark of Vie and 7 Shielding is looking at Quarm maxxing around 3400-ish, still... For a 10k paladin, that's still over twice what is needed to bypass DI entirely and splat the poor sap on the spot.  A warrior in defensive with the same buffs and the same gear is looking at a max hit from Quarm closer to 2400, leaving a much larger margin for DI to fire, especially when a round of max hits is not capable of downing a 10k warrior under those circumstances.  Even taking an unlucky round of two ripostes, it shouldn't be possible, given the pure gimpitude of Quarm's riposte damage.<br />
<br />
Clerics who are awake with a rotation of defensive warriors trivializes Quarm's melee.  It's a non-issue.<br />
<br />
A knight tanking Bertox, Rallos, or Tallon is another matter.  For that, I think it's less a matter of class balance, and more a matter of &quot;maybe the guild is not distributing loot in the most equitable manner.&quot;  Thanks Time Itemization for screwing things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Sscaley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Itemization with all/all or plate/all has been seriously fucked up since Velious. It is nothing new to PoP or PoTime in particular.<br />
<br />
SoE should get the fingers out and put the old difference between mitigation tables back in game, hell even make it a bit wider and remove disc defensive/evasive from the equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">For guilds with up to 20 quarm kills I don't see any problem with the loot distribution.  I have many pieces of time loot including some of the top of notch items and I'm far from the #1 loot whore in the guild so to speak.  I'm sure we have at least 1 Knight in guild with more hp then me now (I'm at 10.5k with BoW).  Anyway, just saying it's possible.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure about how exactly DI work at this point still a bit.  It's obvious it work in between hits, if not it would be useless.  The point is : Tanks simply don't die anymore.  We have a bunch of 5-6 min fights, and even thought /def will help for 3 mins, the tank will most of the time live throught the remaining time with a few DI save here and there.<br />
<br />
We all know that the average dps of these mobs in not that bad in theory (2kdps max I think?).  If your ch rotation isn't retarded, you won't die unless you get a mega spike of 4-5 hits + riposte + a flurry on let's say rallos.  That's where the 95% fullproof DI save your ass, and you are safe till next spike.<br />
<br />
You don't do that with a tank of 1500 ac.  You do that with a tank that has 2200 full buff ac and over 10k hp.  Even thought there is the obvious small diminushing return of AC, we have yet to see the cap.<br />
<br />
I mean, it's been said alot.  The only way to make defensive &quot;required&quot; on boss mob is for these bosses to hit so hard that a non defensive tank has no chance to survive past a few rounds.  A few strategy tweak, some mudflation and some farming done, this is not the case anymore.  Then it lead to the next  kinda sucky conclusion, when defensive isn't required, you don't need warriors anymore.<br />
<br />
I haven't done many ldon raid, and I'll agree that when tanking multiple bosses at a time with limited healing capacity defensive is a nice mana savior.  But again, it was usefull mostly for the first minute where the mob wasn't slowed only.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm exagerating the importance of DI in smooth time clear, and maybe now we could clear it without using DI at all on the MT without that much trouble.  But the first few times? No way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">You could just make mobs hit say, 5k with a min of 1K.  That'd pretty much guaranteed instant death without disc.  But while this is a solution I don't know if it's really good for the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I think thats what they intended to do with quarm when you look at his DB and DI.  It also makes a good mob for people to play with numbers on see Rueeliar's post above.  <br />
<br />
I really do enjoy this game but damn it DI has to go, yes i know you might actually wipe once or twice.   Its all part of the game and if you take out the chance of anyone actually geting killed its pretty lame.  DI, in its current state, is more overpowered than CH ever was THEN they go add cha on time gear for tanks. /boggle  <br />
<br />
Vie for the DI or DB only would be ok I guess but as it works now its pretty powerful.  I don't like where they are heading on this with shielding and vie,  add upgrades to the vie spell and shielding items and I'll just email a cleric when I need them to heal me.  Its another required spell for each encounter and if it stays in game they will have to make the mob melee 10% harder next expansion and some poor chap gets to be the vie bitch.</div></div><hr />
