<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am at work, so i cannot get to official warrior forums, but there is a stickied thread on blizzard looking into the Fury and protection lines.  The biggest fear here is that they will nerf the Arms line while fixing the Fury and protection line.  I think its a legitimate gripe and will explain why.<br />
<br />
The cookie cutter warrior build is 31 Arms/20 Fury.  With good reason.  I did not truly understand until I switched to Fury recently and got to have enrage.  Well at 60, you can get MS and enrage.  The true strength of the MS build is not just MS + impale line, but also enrage.  Any severe changes to the fury line could detrimentally affect the warriors best build, seriously nerfing its damage.  When I was MS at level 53, I could pull of 880 dmg MS crits.  If I had enrage, that 880 would have been 1232.  If they made changes that kept you from being able to obtain enrage, probably the best ability in the Fury tree, it is severely detrimental to the arms warrior.  <br />
<br />
I will withhold judgement, but we will all be holding our collective breaths with more awesome changes on the way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they nerf anymore there will be a LOT of angry warriors. As for enrage + MS, why bring that up at a time like this? :p It's our only pvp strength vs melee. Four good swings. If that falls our class is truly fucked in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats my point.  They are talking abut repwroking the Fury and Protection trees.  If they make any changes to enrage though, that could seriously hurt us.  Its wait and see, but man it makes you cringe to think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully it dosen't turn into a &quot;Hey, lets bring arms/MS down to the level of fury &amp; protection&quot; type of rebalancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I'll worry about it when it actually happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what i have heard thier are no plans to nerf the warrior! Only to make them stronger, in pvp so my guess would be thier not going to nerf MS/Enrage build i have goten thier yet im lvl 52 and can't wait for enrage to bad i already re did my talents once since i had something like 10-10-10 or so and at around lvl 38 and i hadnt use 8 talents so i said screw this build i can't do anything worth while so as i talked to pvp warriors i noticed that the MS Enrage tree was really good so im going with that  i will def respec  at lvl 60 no doubt but it will be 5g down the drainb but at lvl 60 thats change...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, if they really wanted to fix much of the problems with instant strikes, there is an easy fix.  Base instant strike damage not off raw damage, but off of DPS at say 3.8 or 4.0 seconds.  That would mean any time you used a Mortal Strike, WW, or OVerpower with any weapon, not matter the speed, it would hit like a ton of bricks.  You could say then fast weapons would have the advantage, but I do not think so.  Each would have its advantages, with fast weapons more spell interrupts and misses hurt a lot less.  You also might get 2 attacks in where you may only have gotten 1 before too.  Slow weapons would still not be hurt as much by player movement in PvP and would always hit harder up front because first attack ignores weapon speed.  <br />
<br />
That would make swords viable for MS, and boost Fury because you are still using overpower, WW, and even Slam.  Weapon choices would open up and not everyone would be carrying around a reaper.  That would be a start, and then they could look into the talent problems for Fury and Protection.</div></div><hr />
