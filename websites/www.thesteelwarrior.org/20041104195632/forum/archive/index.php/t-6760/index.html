<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, first post here so bear with me =)<br />
A while back I tweaked out a Warrior with some pretty decent gear and sat him on the shelf once he reached 40. I recently dusted him off and he is now level 50 and still doing pretty good for himself....until he went into PoP...<br />
<br />
My current gear is the low level cultural (Dwarven Plate).  Its not too bad and I can totally absorb the damage on old world mobs with my meager 4K hp fully buffed.  Now my question to you guys is: Should I attempt to obtain Ornate (200k or so for the bp on my server, which I probalby couldnt afford before I get to 65)<br />
Get the next level cultural (the AC is great but the stats blow for pure melee), grind my way through Kael again (does being a dwarf give you innate good faction with coldain? =) - or grind it out in LDON (12 points per adv currently and even BB plate is an upgrade at this point).<br />
<br />
I know some of you will probably say this is good for my level, and it is - non PoP.<br />
It seems to work decently for me in LDoN currently - but at my point gains its gonna take forever for me to achieve the points needed for certain armours.<br />
<br />
So just a matter of everybody's opinion - High end cultural (rec level 45 stuff), Ornate (probably could never afford), Kael Quested, or LDoN Grind?<br />
<br />
Current stats at level 50 look like this:<br />
STR: 175 (around that)<br />
STA: 200<br />
AGI: 106<br />
DEX: 144<br />
AC: 905 (with Virtue i think)<br />
ATK: Around 900 with CHoS / SoBS <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your input<br />
<br />
*edit* I know have a magelo posted...so you can use that to judge my gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grind the LDoN if you have the time.  That stuff is pretty good.  Another option is the velious line of gear (SS recommended) and hit it with hp augs until you can get into BoT and start getting drops on Ornate.</div></div><hr />
