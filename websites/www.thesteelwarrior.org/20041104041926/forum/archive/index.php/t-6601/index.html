<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We've just broken into elementals and I'll be tanking alot.I've got WA 5 and use an a3 auged BF/BOC combo.Aggro is great,but, I usually buff to around 9300+ and I've heard this is marginal there for one-rounding.Taking into consideration that my guild is dkp and a BOW is likely to be a little bit more expensive than say a Raex leg mold ;should I stick with my setup or go with a BOW to mitigate high damage spikes.<br />
<br />
Up to this point riposte hasn't seemed to be a big issue.I've heard it's worse in the planes and I won't have much cushion for awhile.If the BOW makes it worthwhile to miss a cpl upgrades I'll go back and grind out an anger 3 aug for the BOW if it drops.I've been saving dkp thru VT and have a little edge on our plate folks that will be lost after a cpl bids.<br />
<br />
No offensive aa yet save WA 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In EP only 5 mobs are really dangerous because of Ripostes :<br />
<br />
Blazaax , Magmaton , Raperm , 3K Demon FR ring, Krizzik .<br />
<br />
Why ? because they hit around 3kish , which is a good chuck of HP.<br />
<br />
Krizzik &amp; Magmaton are gimps.<br />
Blazaax is ... funky (gimped with MGB's)<br />
Raperm ... well he's GOD (most badass mob in EP)<br />
3k FR Demon ... Low Low hp (dies really quickly)<br />
<br />
You dont need a BoW. It is a small plus, but its nowhere near the &quot;gotta have&quot;.<br />
As for &quot;Killer Ripostes&quot; they do exist, but while under Disc they arent that bad.<br />
And usually once your disc drops, on these mobs you're history.<br />
<br />
Many people Cleared EP &amp; Entered Time without seeing a single BoW.<br />
If you have BF/BoC + 2x A3 , i wouldnt bother with a BoW.<br />
<br />
Get VoThule, Get some procs going, get out the Phat Shield and pray.<br />
Its almost the same.<br />
Actually better since your agro will be insane because of WA5 procs.<br />
The guild will be able to burn down stuff FAST before you have to switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would agree, all though the BoW would be a plus. With your combo definently not a must. BF/BoC combo is great. <br />

As for the riposte, what is said above I agree with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was Bonequest with those weapons Not I  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BF / BoC with WA5 and 2 anger 3 will overaggro BoW any days of the week. BoW would be a decent DPS upgrade, but as far as tanking is concerned, BF / BoC is better. There is absolutely no doubt that with wa5 your aggro will be much better with this dual weild combo.<br />
<br />
Riposte are not a problem, and really if you feel uneasy with tanking 3k hitters with dual weild, get a storm rider carapace or anything better, and once def is down, switch it with your BoC, after 3 mn of fight you will be quite high in the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Regardless of how good of a tank you are, you generally die once disc drops on mobs like Reparm, Blazzax, etc.  Hebabyllys (Fennin script) is also a super heavy hitter, but his hps are so low that he's dead within a minute anyways.  Of course, this isn't always true.  I've seen a lot of warriors stay alive post-disc on these mobs.  Then again, by the time you are well equipped enough to do so, your guild by this time probably does enough dps to kill them before three minutes, hehe.  I remember watching a guild just before they entered Time drop Blazzax in less than two minutes.  It takes my guild, which is relatively newish (sorta, going back and doing Vex Thal a bit), about 3-5 minutes on Blazzax depending on ranger TS discs (We're relatively ranger heavy, which rocks for Fire :D).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would go for the BoW, which will reduce spike damage while you're still in the elementals but you also have to look ahead to Time where you'll face a few assbeaters (hello VZ).  You'll still have all of P4 to tank before you'll see darkblades off of Rallos in P5.<br />
<br />
The longer the MT stays up before he drops due to a fizzle in the CH rotation or just a bad round of attacks on the mob, the longer the rest of your guild stays alive before they start dropping one by one, which may give you enough dps at the end to kill the mob before it kills you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if the mob youre tanking with max hits + riposte wont 1round your defensive tank ... dont worry about it.<br />
<br />
i would imagine that everything past elementals requires a cheal chain set up such that a cheal lands roughly once (or twice depending on mob and tank) per melee round.<br />
<br />
BoW would be ideal, but it sure as hell isnt a must.  if your gear could use some improving ... get the most bang for you buck on dkp and upgrade weak slots first.<br />
<br />
more hps and ac &gt; random ripostes<br />
<br />
unless you're habitually very very high up on the tanking lists (MT/ST/?3T?) for your guild, its best to just save your dkp.  once you get to time you will just be bagging the BoW for DBoTW and EoE.  wouldnt it be nice to get the first DBoTW in your guild? ... talk about insane tankability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Simple:<br />
<br />
You put 1150 points into each weapon.  Why get BoW and need to put ANOTHER 1150 points into it?  How much do you love LDoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">He is in a dkp guild, this mean probably BoW ~ 1 or 2 elem molds, really, if you had to choose between BF BoC + 2 A3 + 2 part of Raex VS 1 unaugmented BoW ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">BF/BoC will not out aggro a BoW, no matter what your WA is assuming others have it.  Even with a Darkblade and EoE i'll still occasionally pingpong with a BoW warrior xp'ing. You'd need a substatially higher DPS combo to out aggro it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Were they taunting ? :)<br />
<br />
Still BF+BoC + 2x A3  &amp; Thule should add insane amound of agro.<br />
Specially with WA5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">in long fights BoW will get killed by BF/BoC.  in xp situations where youre pulling a new mob every min of less the BoW will probably win.  the upped proc rate and duel procs, with WA5, really lets this combo shine.<br />
<br />
DBoTW and EoE i would think would most definitely pull ahead .... being far superior to BoC/BF.  either it had to do with his dps aggro + procs being greater than your limited procs over a short time, or that he was taunting.<br />
<br />
then again i've never had a BoW/BF/DBoTW/EoE ... wo what do i know ...<br />
it just doesnt add up though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">BoW was cool before you could get 10ppm with augment + AA and when everyone was like : &quot;omg if I tank any mob in elemental planes dual weilding I'll get insta death touched on first round&quot;, but now BoW is the 'cheap' warrior weapon, easy to get, decent dps and ok aggro, but nothing exceptional at all.<br />
<br />
Though it's still handy to have a decent 2hander in bags, to use with riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I find the BoW neither &quot;easy to get&quot; or &quot;nothing exceptional at all&quot;.  <br />
<br />
It is a HUGE improvement over most dual wield combo until you get to Time.   I have to wonder if anyone advocating dual wield with Ssra/velious weapons even has a BoW.  If only 10% of the damage you take from a slowed mob is riposte damage and going 2hs cuts that in half, thats still 5% damage avoidance, or equal to LR5.  <br />
<br />
On long fights BoW builds huge agro...its not just procs creating agro.  One of my ST's uses an auged BF/Gbos and he doesnt pull agro off me.  I can easily shut off attack for extended periods on long fights while tanking with a BoW.<br />
<br />
Do I think BF/Boc is great agro? Sure, of course it is.  But don't knock the BoW if you don't have one.  I've yet to meet a warrior outside of Time who bagged the BoW in favor of duel wielding until they got a Dbotw or EoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">WA works for 2 handers too.  I think you all are underestimating DPS aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i have a BF and BoC but id drop them for a BoW, it just overall is a better weapon to me</div></div><hr />

That said, I love the BoW.  DPS and the AC on it are significant upgrades.  Definitely not a must have, but I don't regret picking up the BoW at all (my guild merits EB weapons for no DKP so it was a no-brainer for me :)).  I'm still very tough to steal aggro from.  <br />
<br />
And I love buying Anger III augments haha.  I wonder if the day will ever come again when warriors can upgrade their weapons without thinking &quot;now I need another 1150 LDoN points&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sigh ... tell me about it ... just got a BoC the other day via AoW.  you'd think i'd be excited, but that just mean 1150 more points to bank  :eek: <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Another thing to consider, and I rewrote this to try and write it more clearly.<br />
<br />
Like the others said, if you're using a dual EB/AngerIII combo and switch to a raw Blade of War, you're going to be experiencing a huge reduction in agro, or at least temporarily.  If we were to compare a Blade of War to a Bloodfrenzy/Carnage combo without any augs or weapon affinity just like it was when PoP was still fresh, chances are the BF/BoC combo would outagro the BoW until certain AAs were attained by the warrior.<br />
<br />
The question is, do you have your offensive AAs maxed yet?  The truth is, and I can speak from experience, the Blade of War doesn't really shine until you get your offensive AAs maxed.  It really delivers a huge amount of weapon agro with its 48/32 ratio, especially over time.  When you start boxing in Flurry, Raging Flurry, Ferocity, and Punishing Blade, then the BoW will really start to shine.<br />
<br />
My advice currently is this though.  Since you already have a dual EB/AngerIII set up, it looks as if you're probably not having agro issues at the moment, so getting a Blade of War would be like trading out your 450hp 5.0 Mustang for a 405hp Z06.  Yeah, one looks a hell of a lot better, but the fact is, both will drive you down the road at obliterating speeds and both will get you where you want to go.  In the meantime, I would save your DKP for Raex slots or other snazzy elemental pieces.  Once you've attained your offensive AAs and have another AngerIII aug in the bag, *then* I'd bid on the Blade of War.  Without these, I think you'd be seriously let down in your expectations.  The weapon is unbelievably amazing, but it's not &quot;The Magic Answer&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
with wa 5 and all weapons anger3'd ...<br />
<br />
bf and BoC combo= 3050+1800 main hand + 1050+900 offhand per min average totals out to 6800 hate per minute  <br />
<br />
BoW= 2100 + 1800 = 3900 hate per minute<br />
<br />
both are from procs alone, not counting dps ... but i can guarantee that all the dps in the world wont make up 3k hate per minute in procs.  sorry, it just doesnt add up. melee dps = aggro ... but 3k worth of hate is more than enough to offset 200dps sustained by a rog.<br />
<br />
BoW is nice ... dont get me wrong .. but once the procs start rolling in, it isnt going to beat a dual auged BF/BoC combo with weapon affinity 5.<br />
<br />
i imagine you will kill faster with the BoW, hold initial procless aggro better with the BoW, and kill faster with BoW .. but you wont hold solid aggro in the long as hardcore as with BF/BoC.<br />
<br />
the introduction of ldon augments and weapon affinity turned the tables on 2hander vs duel wield aggro.  with that many more procs added to whatever you have offhanded, it adds up a lot over time.  oh yes, and there is a new aa which increases offhand duel wield dps as well ... i'm sure that helps with aggro on duel wield these days eh?<br />
<br />
then again, i've never had a BoW so what the hell do i know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">bigchest, my reasoning in that BoW will produce stronger aggro at the kickoff of a fight was due to the fact that its dps output might offset any unlucky streaks of no procs as a slow/debuff/heal is incoming .. not to mention /furious on a mob at the start of a fight.<br />
<br />
back when i sported the cookie cutter GSoT and droga pair weapon setups, the GSoT always performed better through the initial slow if procs were slow in coming around.  in the long run, though, the duel wield combo always pulled ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">early procs are better for snap aggro, hence the weapons with more procs will grab aggro quicker which is why the BF/BoC will be more useful in the quick fights. with WA5 and an aug'd BF and BoC trust me i know its great snap aggro, much better snap aggro than a big hitting weapon<br />
<br />
dps aggro is more built up over time which is why the BoW is more useful in long fights as opposed to quick ones<br />
<br />
the DW combo is def better aggro but the BoW due to AC and less ripostes youlle take less damage while tanking with the BoW. im not one to say that duel wield is suicide in PoP but theres a decent chance of taking unlucky ripostes on while duel wielding that will be very much cut down while using the BoW<br />
<br />
edit- apolyon if i pulled out my gstaff of 4 winds (assuming it had no aug) next time i was xping to keep aggro from slows over my bloodfrenzy and BoC i can rest assured anyone in my group would call me a dumbass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">/nod ... i understand that  ;) <br />
<br />
lightning could strike, however, and the gods of eq give you no procs in the first 10-15 seconds.  all my comments referred to quick initial aggro in situations of 0 procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">dps aggro is more built up over time which is why the BoW is more useful in long fights as opposed to quick ones<br />
<br />
Disagree<br />
<br />
Just an exmple:<br />
Assuming no proc for the first 5 sec, (a very realistic assumption IMO even with dual EB+A3 with WA5),  <br />
<br />
- with BoW, shammy can slow without getting summoned<br />
- with a 16/20 and 15/20, shammy gets summoned<br />
<br />
Hard hitting 2hander has been known to be useful in short fight.</div></div><hr />

How can you guarantee this without having used one?  LOL.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think you underestimate the sustained aggro of weapons that have high bonus-to-delay ratio (i.e. BoW and such).<br />
<br />
It is true that DPS produces little aggro... for one handers, not for two handers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have a parse that disproves the formulae put together in this thread:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789 ?<br />
<br />
If not, assuming 100% haste boost, and not counting pb3 etc, you're looking at about 600 hate per minute from swings. Assuming an equal improvement to hate as you would get to dps from the AA's, maybe 900 hate for the BoW. Thats a far cry from offsetting the 2900 hate/min from procs alone, even assuming the 1 handers gained no hate from swings.<br />
<br />
Is anybody that has both bored enough to try and set up a conclusive test?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">if youre relying on dps aggro as opposed to proc aggro ... your rogues/monks/wizards/mages will all be deaded as you cant possibly out dps them.<br />
<br />
3k hate from procs per minute over the top of BoW's proc hate 6800 vs 3900 will do far more for you in terms of hate than the dps upgrade on the 2hs.<br />
<br />
like i said, the BoW is an amazing weapon.  i would personally trade the dual wield combo for it.  the dps/ac/lack-of-ripostes are god-like.  <br />
<br />
the fellar posting, though, is asking if he needs the BoW in EP's.  he has this other combo, though, which produces more aggro than his BoW.  The 2hs, though nice, is not worth the cost in dkp vs relative upgrade he could obtain via raex.  was just pointing out that his aggro is stronger now than with the 2hs setup.<br />
<br />
personally i would buy my elemental gear with dkp and then horde my points while the other warriors catchup from lost points on dkp, thus to solidify for myself the first DBoTW from time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Thanks for all the Replys.Keep them coming if it's of interest because I'm bound to be indecisive until (hopefully) a BOW drops.<br />
<br />
With regards to the above:<br />
 <br />
                                           A) Atm it looks like I'll normally MA.When I'm not I'll usually be in the first 3 of order.<br />
<br />
                                           B)The LDON pts can be a pain,but, they don't measure up against dkp.If I get a BOW I'll a3 aug it without regret.The work involved in aqquiring those points is trivial to me against the dkp cost.Augs on tanking weaps are a given to me now -the aggro is great.<br />
<br />
                                            C)I've run low on defensive aa(any suggestions from experienced wars?)and have been banking a little.I will probably soon begin offensive aa with an eye to my tanking setup.<br />
<br />
The toughest things I've tanked have been pop flag mobs like RZTW,Bert,MM,etc...Riposte with them doesnt seem to be an issue.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure of the cost of both BOW and elemental molds at this time.Probably looking at a cpl hundred hp and 100ac vs the BOW.I'm also assuming BOW's will rarely if ever drop and molds will drop quite often.As well due to competition and a light raiding schedule many of our warriors lack eb weapons all togeather.<br />
<br />
The BOW would prolly be great on fast raid mez breaks especially on red trash and good dps in xp groups....sigh.Hehe spending your dkp on your tank gear is fun and painful at the same time! :) <br />
<br />
Thanks for your consideration folks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Stay with your setup, they're close enough in aggro that the survivability gained by using that DKP on more hp/ac gear will probably be best in the long run. I've seen a BF/something combo pull aggro on raids over a BoW wielding MT, and I've seen the reverse. The best combo for your guild, assuming all the other warriors aren't packing BFs, would be to keep what you have and let the other warriors increase their aggro.<br />
<br />
 You're completely done with defensive AAs, btw. Time to work on something else. I do fear that you have 200 AAs and haven't started offensives yet... Stupid GoD.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, I got flogged with tells telling me to bid and I caved.Back to LDON soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">&quot;The best combo for your guild, assuming all the other warriors aren't packing BFs, would be to keep what you have and let the other warriors increase their aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ya probably should have listened to Fitemore there. Your current setup is great aggro. The BoW would have helped a tad more in the hands of someone else, who is probably still using Cord Hilted Spike Driver or something for aggro.<br />
<br />
Ah well, too late for that. Just realize Rallos can be pretty stingy on the Blades of War if he wants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">We haven't seen a BoW in 3 or 4 kills; but before that we got 2 in one. The next one is mine. Then I will be able to add my input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Atm at least it makes AA look fun again.Down to 300ish pts for a3 now.O btw is aggro usually messy in POE rings? I haven't had such a hard time in awhile.I'll add to the post after I experiment a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">today i was playing around with a time warrior i know who used to use an anger 3 BoW. we were basically testing wether a time warrior with anger3 BoW vs my BF with ykesha and BoC with anger3 would be better aggro. she had all the offensive AAs and i had none plus she has higher atk rating but the aggro was pretty much dead even between the both of us which would say to me that the BoW is only slightly less aggro in the hands of a tank on my tier. i know its not overly scientific or parsed out but take it as you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Yeah, I agree.I have no data to support it.However,with only pb done the auged BOW seems a little less aggro then my old BF/BOC auged combo.That is mostly a measure against my other guild tanks with their aggro weapons up.Some of the guys dual wielding eb weapons will catch aggro on bosses when they didn't used to.They mostly have single procing hate weapons.The bow does appear to grab aggro faster off of mez breaks when I dont have time for a successful taunt routine.<br />
<br />
That said I do feel a little more survivable.Call it paranoia,but,im pretty sure Hydrotha would have raped me on our first encounter dual wielding.I haven't parsed ripostes so again it's just an impression.On a lighter note ,the BOW is sooo good to plow rage with hehe :) <br />
<br />
Regarding value: a) BOW cost me 20dkp b) bracer mold 22.50 c) flowing moss mantle 23ish.<br />
So others may have to judge by differant standards.It seems a good deal to me.<br />
<br />
I'm happy with it in the end.It will make offensive aa more fun I think.Also being a little low in hp I think it has helped me tanking early in EP's.Every one seems to like it too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I also had BF BoC before my BoW. That was before ldon or GoD was out. Back then, BoW was far superior dps AND slightly better agro (imho). The difference was: With BF BoC you HAD to rely on procs to get solid agro and these procs were too rarely. High dps casters or very fast debuffers stole agro from you pretty frequently. With the BoW you got slightly better agro and the main advantage agro wise was: You had a pretty straight agro line. Regardless of procs, your ench knew he could tash after 3 secs and slow after 3 more secs. The procs were more like of a bonus than the main agro source.<br />
BUT today:<br />
-We have augs, increasing our proc rate by 100%<br />
-We have WA, further increasing procrates by 50%<br />
1h weapons profit 50% more of these changes, especially a bloodfrenzy.<br />
Sinister strikes also adds some dps to 1h.<br />
<br />
Today you usually have at least 1 proc within the first 5 secs and tons of procs over time.<br />
<br />
However the BoW still has many advantages:<br />
-Very high dps. Only highend EP / time weapons will deal out compareable or better damage. Adding your own riposte damage which become a real factor when duoing unslowed mobs or generally in expgroups.<br />
-Relyable agro over time, regardless of procs.<br />
-Fewer Ripostes. Yeah, imho: I dual wield EoE(yak) BF(A3) for agro EoE(yak) Stone etched mallet(none atm) for dps 95% of the time. I love the amazing agro of the first combo when fighting mobs that hit very fast for low ammounts of damage (&lt;2k) but there are still mobs where ripostes can be pain in da ass: Quarm (slowable, VERY high maximum hits, where one round + one riposte can kill you with realtive ease), Ikkinz single group bosses (2200 quad, one riposte becomes a real factor when your cleric uses a ~4k heal), etc...<br />
<br />
I think you don't have to regret your choice. I think i would have done the same (&lt;-- weapon freak.), if no other MT with roughly the same stats like you was wielding some sucky weapons. (passed our first BoW on one of our MTs who was using HG+ epic (/shiver) when all others had BF BoC)</div></div><hr />
