<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wondering if anyone has been 2 boxing any GoD content?  I have a 61 Shammy that is well equiped that I 2 box in POV with alot and the combo pretty much lets me chain pull there and the occational double pull is CC'ed by the Shammy.  Is there a zone that I can 2 box in GoD for possibly better XP and or drops?<br />
<br />
I know that OOW has alot of 2 box content, but I have owned GoD since it came out and have yet to visit the place due to Uber mobs I have heard so much about.<br />
<br />
I know all the old content, but really just want to know about the new stuff.  I did almost get owned in OOW first zone when I got a ton of Green adds, but I can usually handle 2-3 at a time in there.  Only 1 death so far 2 DB to 65's when I was unready.<br />
<br />
BTW I know my Shammy can solo in there, but keeping a tank alive is a different story.  (Tank is going to get hit Shammy is going to occationally get hit.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I 3 and 4 boxed sewers farming spells/augs for guildees. I two boxed a bit in riwwi and Qinimi for quest drops.  Exp really wasn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried to 5 box a tipt the other day. I got to the eternal cragbeast matriarch and wiped. Didnt get anything but single pulls all the way. All toons were 65+, but it was incredibly stressful (I don't use macro programs).<br />
<br />
I've three boxed ferubi and qinimi stuff, which is pretty easy to do. Riwwi I'm sure would also be pretty easy, as the dps isnt as high (or the level of the mobs).</div></div><hr />
