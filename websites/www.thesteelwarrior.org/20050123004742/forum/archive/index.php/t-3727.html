For reference, I include [URL=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42896]his Magelo profile[/URL.<br />
<br />
Shaemus currently uses the CHoS/SotB combo for dual-wielding aggro, GSoT for 2-handed aggro, and WMBS for 2-handed non-aggro work (for the rare times when he does indeed join a raid). Given my limits (single group of 63-65 peeps, including cleric, druid, shaman, monk, bard and warrior, none elemental), what can I hope to get to upgrade the CHoS/SotB combo? A BoC is out of my price range (for reference, my price range is about 30Kpp, tops), and I'm not seeing anything in that &lt;30Kpp price point that would be better than the CHoS/SotB.<br />
<br />
Is there something no-drop that we can aim for with that group?<br />
<br />
Am I missing some bazaar weapon(s) entirely?<br />
<br />
Should I upgrade some different armor slots with gear that gives vengeance or other aggro-generating proc?<br />
<br />
Can this upgraded armor be gotten by a single group, or purchased at the bazaar with 30Kpp or less?<br />
<br />
Before you say &quot;go to LDoN, get that gear!&quot; I will let you know that two of the peeps in my group (the druid and the shammie) are 2-boxed, and that, combined with our generally less-than-stellar gear, causes us to fail in LDoN way more than succeed; that's not the way to get to those 1492 point items anytime soon. :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, thoughts, comments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The anger3 aug from Everfrost is a big boost in your ability to keep agro and if your group feels that you need better taunting weapons, I would hope the 2 boxed druid will give up his spot to give to a dps class that you can pickup.   Pick up some upgrades from lesser named in dungeons and everyone is happy.<br />
<br />
Other then that I dont see any bigger taunting weapon you would be able to get with 30k or with a single group.....<br />

<br />
You know, the old, go to LDoN line you didn't want to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you say &quot;go to LDoN, get that gear!&quot; I will let you know that two of the peeps in my group (the druid and the shammie) are 2-boxed, and that, combined with our generally less-than-stellar gear, causes us to fail in LDoN way more than succeed; that's not the way to get to those 1492 point items anytime soon. &quot;<br />
<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
1- Don't multi-box in the dungeon if it's causing losses. Get some people to join you.<br />
<br />
2- Take easier mission types. Just slaughter.<br />
<br />
3- Don't rush.<br />
<br />
4- You won't get 1492 points failing missions all the time, correct. BUT you won't get 1492 points not doing ANY missions either. Don't worry about your record, if your goal is 1492 points.<br />
<br />
5- The missions aren't about gear. They're about playing the game. You have 90 minutes to finish an adventure. So what if it takes you 89 to complete it ... a W is a W.<br />
<br />
6- Partial completions get less points, but points are points.<br />
<br />
Ah well, just my 2 bits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This isn't an answer to what you asked (I'm not a warrior and don't know if there are any upgrades between CHoS and BoC), however, I thought I'd suggest that you not to give up on LDoN so quickly.<br />
<br />
My standard group (the group I run in 99% of the time) is 5 characters run by two people.  Me (SK and rogue) and a friend (monk, shaman, cleric).  We aren't in a guild and have mostly bazaar buyable gear (heck, my rogue is running around with 800ac because I spend all my money on ac/hp for the SK).<br />
<br />
We got destroyed when we first started LDoN.  We wiped twice on the first adventure before we even killed a single mob.   I think we failed the next five or so adventures after that before getting our first &quot;overtime win&quot;.  Shortly after that, we started winning occasionally and we're prolly winning 50% of the time now.<br />
<br />
It took us a little while to get the hang of the LDoN zones.  Once we started to get a good grasp on mob placement and pull strategies, things started going a lot smoother.  I suggest doing assassination missions or slaughter missions (slaughter are probably the easiest).<br />
<br />
You might not want to hear any of this but I still think it would be worth it to try LDoN a few more times.  For unguilded players with limited pp, LDoN seems like the best way to catch up with some of the raiding guild players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhhhh if that druid is anywhere near competently played, that's already 1 helluva DPS class right there.  Regularly grp with a 65 druid who's specialization is in nuking, and she'll often/regularly crit for 3k+, while doing hella damage without crits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are failing in ldon with that group, its not due to gear.  Im sorry, but its due to tactics.  If the bard cant pull, he needs to learn how to pull.  Either that, or the cleric needs to whip out pacification, and start working with you, the warrior, and you two need to learn to pull.<br />
<br />
The advantage of a person single boxing the druid / shaman would be that the shaman, on adds, could have stuff slowed while the druid root parks any adds.  But that aint going to happen with 2 boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to hijack my own thread, but I guess I need to clarify some points...I don't dislike LDoN, it's just that it's not been kind to us.<br />
<br />
All members of our group (except for the warrior...sigh) have several wins in LDoN with guild groups ands the like (no 2-boxing at all). Unfortunately, I can field any of three major (60+) characters: a druid, a rogue, or a warrior...guess which two the guild picks more often (hint: it's not the warrior, that's why he's generally stuck in single-groupville)<br />
<br />
Our record with the group listed at the beginning of this thread, or most components of it (sometimes, we trade the monk out, sometimes the druid, sometimes the cleric) has been like 2 completions and no wins in about 20 attempts. Everyone knows how to do their job, but two-boxing seems to integrate a level of delay in response that sometimes kills us. It is these deaths that cause us to slow our progression down, and we just run out of time, mostly.<br />
<br />
the druid is played by the warrior (that being me); the shaman is played by the cleric (that being my wife). The druid is level 64 and has all spells, but is a bit weak in the AA department (no spell crits as of yet). His DPS is good, however, and he can lay the smack down with little to no issues. I've left him behind in some adventures, replacing him with a 65 wizard (and not 2-boxing as a result), but our success rate has not changed; eventually someone dies and we slow down.<br />
<br />
The puller is not the bard, but the monk (it's the way it's been with this group since 1999...all RL friends, so kinda hard to change that scheme).<br />
<br />
I think the solution with regards to LDoN is what Noctix said: just keep plugging at it till we do get some wins (we've been failing, the trying another theme, then failing and trying another theme, and so on...not much time to become accustomed to any single theme).<br />
<br />
Thread unhijack...I guess I gotta save my pennies till I get 175Kpp (price of BoC lately on Nameless), or just keep at LDoN till this group gets a few successes. Given that it's going to take me about a year to amass 175Kpp, I have a better shot at LDoN. :\</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17368<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems you need like 20 people or so but one guy said its 2 groupable (probably talking about level 65 with 200AA's) still.... <br />
<br />
<br />
If you are doing LDoN with fewer then 6 people forget it... its not clear but I get the impression you sometimes go in with 5... I went zero for nine sixboxing my 4 wiz, chan, cleric combo at the end I never did die but just the medding time did not let me finish in the time limites......<br />
<br />
I am thinking about adding the plus 2 damage aug and the anger proc to my SBoD (14dam 19delay no proc) though... we will see... BoC on my server is 159K, its a stretch but not impossible for me...</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that group you really should not end up dying, much less losing.  If you end up dying, I would think its because you are pulling more then you can chew.  <br />
<br />
Try different pulling tactics with distance and pacification and monk FD.  One of the ways I pull if the monk wants to pull is to have the monk pull, FD a good distance from the group, while the cleric pacifies with AE pacification.  Then either assist pull or have the cleric tell you which one to pull.  <br />
<br />
I dunno, I think with a few more attempts and getting more familiar with the dungeons, you should have no problems.<br />
<br />
If you are jumping around different dungeons, I would agree that you should stick with one theme as each theme has its own little differences.</div></div><hr />

Just for the record, my son 5 boxes LDoN adventures just fine most of the time... 65 paladin, shaman, enchanter, cleric and mage.  He took my advice and rolled a paladin for agro control about 5 months ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm Sbod has 2 augmentation slots?  All my weapons, admittedly older content only have 1 type 4 slot.</div></div><hr />

As stated to the original poster, I think your approach is simply wrong on the dungeons Sam, if you're having that much trouble.<br />
<br />
Also, your group setup doesn't look very optimal. For a dungeon that you multi-box you'd probaby do much better going with more offtank options since you depend so much on the chanter for slowing.<br />
<br />
And it's not surprsing that dependency on wizards for DPS in a situation like that would lead to too much med time.<br />
<br />
IMO, it actually tells me LDoN's design is still pretty sound when I hear you have trouble multi-boxing in it. And to hear you state that you have too much med time reinforces the usefulness of melees that I always thought returning to &quot;dungeons&quot; would bring.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure some will overcome the design and begin to multi-box effectively in there.<br />
<br />
Also ... something to consider ... 4-boxing is probably a better option for you than 6-boxing. The adventures scale based on numbers in the group.<br />
<br />
A kill 54 for 4 people isn't going to be the same as a kill 54 for 6 people. <br />
<br />
Least they haven't been for me so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right my weapon is just one slot 4 heh... <br />
<br />
Humm didnt think about that adventure scaling based on numbers in the group....<br />
<br />
Ya LDoN seems a bit mroe mellee friendly given the time limits. Least they could have done was let us use horses for medding inside the dungons. Oh well can't have everything. I have not tried the dungons with my warrior yet, we'll see how it goes once he has some AA under his belt and is 65.....<br />
<br />
Well one thing I alwasy did collections or slaughter trials for some reason that might not have been to smart....  Maybe on the collections they redid the drop rate now....</div></div><hr />

 Tell them NO.<br />
<br />
 Tell them that you WANT to use your Warrior. You're probably not the only Druid or Rogue in your guild, tell them to use others for some of these occasions.<br />
<br />
 If they bitch about it too much, it's not the right guild for you.</div></div><hr />
