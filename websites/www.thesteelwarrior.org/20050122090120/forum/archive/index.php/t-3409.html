<br />
I've tried using the 2 different setups to tank.  I seem to get aggro better using dual weild, but I cannot be certain.  What I don't know is whether dual weild will give better DPS or better aggro or both.<br />
<br />
With LDoN, I'm working towards augmenting ykesha or perhaps anger III.  I also don't know whether i should go for augmenting my GSoT for better aggro or on the dual wield weapons.  Thanks in advance for your input ! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you aren't nuts.  You are wielding two decent weapons, one with a hate proc, one without, vs one fast weapon with a great hate proc.  The hate generated by your procs procs should equalize, though I think a slight advantage would be given to the dual wielding.  However, when you count in the dps increase that you get from GSoT, I think it will prevail more often than not, and should almost always in the long run, not to mention being better dps than your dual wield combo will ever come close to touching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's the only buyable combo aside from a SoD/BoC that is better than GSoT.</div></div><hr />

I run the slower too so i can do lots of controlled experiments with the timing.  The guage i use is Mob's HP.  I can slow an HoH mob when he is at 93% HP using GSoT before proccing and shaman doesn't even get a look.  With BoC/CHoS combo i have to wait until 92% HP on the mob or he will take a nip out of the shaman's froggy butt.<br />
<br />
Before proccing, GSoT gives more agro than BoC/CHoS.  After proc the BoC/CHoS starts to own GSoT.</div></div><hr />

loot from the velious era that is still one of the best dropable weaps in the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it never hurts to be versatile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT is a chump toy weapon compared to SoD and BoC.  If you have either of those weapons go with 1 hand for agro and dont look back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say try to get a GBoS, BoC, 2nd SoD, or a good ssra weapon to go with your SoD. Augment each in your dual wield setup with ykesha, and don't look back until you get a high end aggro 2hander (ie BoW or SEWS).<br />
<br />
Believe me, there's nothing more I'd like to do than use a 2hander for aggro (I have SoD/BoC/GBoS, and GSot4W for 2h/DPS), but dual wield really is the way to go pre-eles.<br />
<br />
GSoT is a good weapon for the &quot;average&quot; warrior out there, but I don't think it can compare to two high end Velious or Luclin weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daimadar</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your inputs guys!  In this case, think I'll stick w/ SoD and CHoS when i need aggro.  Heh.. sold my windblade and got a GSoT back then, so I guess my non-aggro will GSoT :P<br />
<br />
I do have one more question though, given the proc of SoD is 288+stun and CHoS is 179+stun... would that yield more dps on average compared to GSoT?  Thanks again..</div></div><hr />
