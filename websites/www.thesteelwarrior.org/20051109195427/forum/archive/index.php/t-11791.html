So far I'm still using newbie stuff and I'm sure it'll last me a while, as I'm only lvl 6 on my new toon, am i missing any newbie armor quests? What newbie gear did you find helpful and what should i shoot for?<br />
<br />
I've already setup a second account and im working on a priest bot on my 2nd acct, though she hasnt been too awefully useful so far considering the relative ease of killing stuff solo (compaired to what im used to, anyway :p ).<br />
<br />
so whats the top 10 quests/items i should shoot for?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Yeah, 2-Boxing isnt really as effective/useful as it was in DAoC/EQ.  Ill have to say though...you screwed up going N3lf, heehee.  My motto?  Go Horde or go Home!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">05-27-2005, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a blacksmith, so I made most of my gear over the levels. Around level 15 there should be some kind of dungeon that you can go to get some green stuff ( don't know what it is called for the alliance ).<br />
<br />
But for the first ten levels I mostly wore what dropped off mobs. Keep the gear up and you should be able to take out mobs +2 levels over your own with consistency.<br />
<br />
Later on two boxing is going to be insane, in the bad way.<br />
<br />
And Horde FTW!</div></div><hr />

<br />

Firstly: At about level five you can visit a profession trainer in a city and learn trade skills, ask a friendly Guard and they will point you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Secondly: In the Capital Cities for your side, there will be Weapon Masters who teach you different weapon skills, additionally they train in different weapons at every capital so you will have to travel about to find them all. Good news is that the guards can point you to them.<br />
<br />
Thirdly: Trade skills are different than in EQ, You will need to get up to 35 skill before you can attempt a recipe that requires 35 skill, but you won't be able to fail it once you can make it. ( Unless I am just an extremely lucky guy, and I don't have that kind of luck  :D ) Skill-ups are easy as well, just find some cheep orange recipe and make them at one per skill up until they yellow out, then move on.<br />
<br />
And lastly: If it wasn't for Gnomes, NE's would be the most hated race for the Alliance. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">05-28-2005, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like NE :p<br />
<br />
oh, and thanks a ton - thats exactly the info i needed :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, just like any other horde or alliance character, You'll see gear drop as you level, but being a Blacksmith does help also when you're a warrior, it can provide some nice equipment for a while.  That's one of the good things about this game, gear seems to be random, like a shirt coming off a boar, or boots coming off from one of those snake people. And unlike EQ, the armor you can make at your level actually is USEFUL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Extra-Long-Eyebrows. <br />
<br />
There is more of course, like the huge amount of them and that shadow meld power that makes them think they are clever, but the two foot long eyebrows are the thing that makes you step back and say ewww...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">05-28-2005, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">shadowmeld is kinda neat but nothing too special really. i personally like the night elf look hehe. i miss the troll look from eq though.<br />
<br />
anyone know what city to visit for 2 hand slash training?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">05-28-2005, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess would be:<br />
<br />
Stormhold - Crossbows and 2H blunt<br />
Ironforge - Guns and 2H slashing (they use axes right?)<br />
Dolanaar?(night elf city, been a while since I played) - Bows and 2H pierce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">05-29-2005, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you have to be 10 to specialize weapon skills is that correct? so in order to train my 1hs/2hs etc ill have to hit 10?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">05-29-2005, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hold up here, to unconfuse people that may be reading in:<br />
<br />
You train per weapon type.<br />
<br />
I.E. Two handed sword and Two handed Axes are separate skills not the same 2hs skill like in EQ. <br />
<br />
Axes Swords Maces all have one and two handed variants (two separate skills each). Then there is crossbows, guns, bows, staves, daggers that you can train in. All of those are at level 1 IIRC. At Level 20 you can train in dual wield and Polearms. All of those are skills you can learn to use.<br />
<br />
You can specialize in a weapon type via the Arms talent tree; Axes, Swords, Maces, or Polearms. Using a talent for Axes, Swords or Maces will get you the benefit with both 1h and 2h types. You need 20 points in arms tree (min level 30) before you can spec Axe, Sword, or Mace, and 25 points before you can spec Polearm.</div></div><hr />
