<br />
Each level of the ability raises what is the max level you can execute a finishingblow on. And after 24 aa you max at level 59.<br />
<br />
There have been reports you can execute a finishingblow on any mob that is fleeing, that is of the right level, even if it is 20% rather than 10%.<br />
<br />
The chance to execute a finishingblow is based on your chance to crit.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that it sucks. but would have been cool when i farmed acrylia caverns all the time.</div></div><hr />

if you got the important other stuff done, it's one of the more valuable aa's out there i reckon.<br />
<br />
use your ranged attack to catch runners. seemed to fire pretty often for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My wife the ranger trained all these, and I must say I'm quite jealous... it goes off a LOT, and for some mobs (the red bruisers in GoD for example) that have huge melee mitigation it's a treat when they flop over dead in one hit, instead of after 30 more seconds of beating on it's back.  Worth the AA?  Well, I'm getting all the &quot;required and expected&quot; ones done first, but finishing blow/coup de grace are high on my list of optional ones afterwards.  I'd say she flat out kills 1 in 3 or so runners when xp grinding or farming blues (say in riwwi or similar).  Nice time saver/annoyance reducer.<br />

You know, the ones that before they walk away cast Protection of Discord or something similiar that make melee hit like ass?  Yeah, those ones~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't find my screenshot of Finishing Blow going off on the Statue of Rallos Zek, but to 32k a raid mob made it worth having to me, just for the amusement factor.<br />
<br />
It went off alot during all the LDoN missions I did, so if you plan to max out the Adventure's Stone at some point I would say it's worth investing into once you have the important stuff out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mobs in LDoN normal seems to range from 57-62.  My experience is that you can slay about half of the mob that are running.  Of course it also depends on the theme (undead don't run).  It is actually very useful on Mastruqs which otherwise takes forever to kill by melee.  Finishing blow also works on most mobs in the entry GoD city zones, and some of the mobs in sewers (Crematory in particular).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely useless?  No.  Still, I'd look at it in the 400AA range perhaps.</div></div><hr />
