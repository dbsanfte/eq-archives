You are smart and witty.<br />
You love to travel around, and there is nothing that can stop you.<br />
You can beat just about anybody with your wit, and it would not be wise for<br />
them to enter a verbal banter with you.<br />
You love fantasy and tend to choose that over reality.</div></div><hr />

This is interesting though, as I've begun to enjoy playing my cleric more as of late than I have before.<br />
<br />
I still like to kick A$$ though!!</div></div><hr />

Hey look at it this way guys, next time somebody says &quot;reroll a pally if you want aggro&quot;, we can point to this and say with pride, I AM A WARRIOR, get lost you whiny altar boy.  :D<br />

You are misunderstood. Most people think you are odd, and few can see past that eerie presence of yours.<br />
