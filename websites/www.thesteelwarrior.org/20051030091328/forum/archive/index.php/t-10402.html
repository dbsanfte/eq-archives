The grouping crap is there! Yes, the boogey man is for real. WoW requires you to group up a lot after mid 40's. Now there's nothing wrong with grouping up, meeting new people, blah blah, but wtf I've always sucked majorly at putting together groups or organizing raids. My server is full of 12 year olds and retards and loot whores and the worst I've seen before from EQ1. When someone quits the group and stones out as soon as his quest is complete, and such people are my own guildies, this is deja vu, and it sucks. I know we can still grind exp and stuff and level up, but is that all? All the kewl rewards are from elite quests. And you need groups to complete those. Just spent a whole day playing and looking for people to go to ANY instance near my level (except fucking gnomeregan which the noobs are always begging me to help them with). It's given me a headache and I'm really disappointed with WoW right now. The LFG crap exists here just like in EQ1. And I was a WoW fan before this. <br />
<br />
To make things worse, all the motherfucking gold/plat ebayers have found there way into WoW. I see ridiculous gold prices on loot drops and people actually buy that stuff. And gathering that gold is just like you gather hundreds of kpp's in  EQ1.<br />

I guess either I'm fucked up or I should just give up playing MMO's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On that note:<br />
<br />
Why is it so hard to find a single player/LAN-multiplayer game that gives a similar experience as a MMOG (as in, the interface and play style where you roam through huge worlds using similar controls) that isn't a FPS?<br />
<br />
The closest I've come is Morrowind, but that world just doesn't jive with me.</div></div><hr />

WoW certainly has it's fair share of jackasses, just like all MMO's do.  I haven't run into what you did with people porting out right away, but I think I'd have been ready to kick some people in the head if I did.  The trick to it as always, is finding a good guild.<br />
<br />
The LFG crap is kind of annoying, but at least in WoW you do have the option of soloing if you want to.<br />
<br />
The goldseller crowd is what gets me, but to be honest I've seen stupidly high prices on anything blue + from the beginning.  At least it shouldn't be as crippling as FFXI,  with WoW having tons of sources of high end items from everything from quests to drops to instances.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I get unsolicited group invites all the time too :p</div></div><hr />

Professional lewt whores parked on every named spawn to sell the loot for $$. The elitist jerks telling everyone else how much better they are than you. Elitist guilds cockblocking, no one wanting to group for 3+ years because solo exp was better. Professional loot whores team playing characters parked on named spawns. GMs fired, SOE current policy don't ban no matter what (cheating is okay now, not bannable).<br />
   Lots of good Warriors are in high demand at 60, cause most 12 year olds suck at holding aggro, and adjusting what weapon(s)/shield use.<br />
   Just hang in there and remember-TEAM MANA BURN, BUY YOUR GREEN DRAGON SCALE FOR US OR NO EPIC FOR YOU, $200 OR FORGET IT! Yes, that is for real, really happened, and it took FAR to long for Sony to respond.</div></div><hr />

Almost all the groups start in Ironforge on my server. Either you sit in IF all day looking for more people to go to the instance or you can just forget about it and go do something else. There should be a LFG tool.</div></div><hr />
