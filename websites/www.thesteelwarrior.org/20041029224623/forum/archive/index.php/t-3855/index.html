<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have the Cord Hilted Spike Driver (mainhand) and the Copper Hammer of Striking (offhand). I am pretty close to finishing my Epic but one thing I still need are the dragon scales and I am just wondering if it is worth the money to buy the scales because the Blade of Strategy would increase my agro? Would it be better to offhand the Blade of Strategy or is the Copper Hammer of Striking just as good of a agro weapon?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you gotta buy any piece of the epic it ain't worth it ( besides the gems and vox tail ale )... the stuff out there burys the epics in any version by leaps and bounds.<br />
<br />
if you come across a green scale or red scale from a raid or smething..than do it. but if you gotta lay out cash; lay it out on a &quot;real&quot; weapon.<br />
<br />
Epics are Outdated bro. Believe me, i own them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Togr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a green dragon scale and was only an old Air and a chardok raid away from my blades.  Then I got awarded my CHSD.  After that I proceeded to sell my scales for enough to upgrade all my thurg/SS (save gaunts) to fierce heraldic, and I have never regretted this move (except I prolly coulda gotten another 10-15K outta 'em).  Definetely not worth getting them at this stage, of course I am still unwilling to destroy any of the quest items even now, darn nastalgia!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are looking at the epic as a weapon upgrade please stop now.  What you have is better.  Buying the scales would be a bad idea imo, you could get much more for your pp than the epic.  It is really sad as today by the time a warrior can get them they could have much better weapons for less effort.  They are still one of the coolest looking weapons in the game but that is about where it ends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cyquinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They're all correct. I spent 30k buying the green scale (an amazing deal on Rodcet Nife), and now I wish I hadn't. Don't get me wrong, I love my epics, they're really awesome looking - but last night I had to take a group down into Droga to get a Copper Hammer of Striking because using the epics just doesn't cut it on agro generation. I'll still use the red blade in my offhand, but trust me when I tell you it's not worth paying to get epified.</div></div><hr />
