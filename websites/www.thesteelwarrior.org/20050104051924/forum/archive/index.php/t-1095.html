What do you warriors think about this weapon?  I use to have a Greatstaff of Thunder but decided to sell it (price offered was rediculous).  So now Im looking to buy another one, but picked this little gem up in the meanwhile.  It only cost me 500 pp too!  Im using this primary and frosty offhand and Im holding aggro pretty well.<br />
<br />
I miss the damage of my GSoT but the BCA/Frosty combo is working out so well.  Was thinking about just using these till I get my epics (Damn that Queen) and using the cash to upgrade gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szerath</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the combo I currently use..and find I have little problem. The BCA does not proc as much as the Frosty..but when it does...you have  a fairly good lock on agro. Not saying it can't be pulled off you..but I have notced with just the proc fomr the BCA and the Slower can slow the mob and I do not have to worry. 2 to 3 procs and if the slow was resisted the first time the Slower still can not pull the mob off me with a second cast.</div></div><hr />

Proc was ok agro, but with the relatively bad ratio, if I did not get a proc, I was hurting bad for agro.  Proc rate seemed low to me, tho I would not swear to that.  WIth frosty offhand, agro was just horrible, frosy mainhand and BCA offhand was somewhat better, but primarily due to the superior ratio and more procs from the frosty.  Shortly thereafter, I got my GSoT and would not go back for anything(and I too was just offered an obscene amount for my GSoT, and said no thanks).  I think the recommended level should be a clue in this case.  36 to 55 or 60, I am betting it would do well, but after, it just does not hold up well.</div></div><hr />

edit:  except for frostbringer, have one of those</div></div><hr />

Still for the price they do rock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After reading all the hype about the GSoT I'm really surprised by this thread.<br />
<br />
Anyways.. I do have one. and I like to cycle betweem that and Frostbringer and Honed Blade of Ykesha.<br />
<br />
I tend to use Ykesha main hand and Frosty offhand most of the time, this way I get the Ykesha procs fairly well (kinda similar or a lil less than Frosty)<br />
<br />
I would like to use Barney axe in main hand honestly if I could, because of the added AC and STA on it, but I find that the low damage doesn't help me. I find that if I have it in main hand and it won't proc for the next 20 ish seconds I'll loose aggro to higher DPS classes and higher level groupies.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna give it a test soon, Barney main hand all the time, and switch off hand between Ykesha and Frosty and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChrisDaTank</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive currently been using the FB/BCA Combo, FB being in main.  Ive really enjoyed the combo although it is losing its touch.  I dont really have much of a problem maintaining aggro in the beginning (aka slows and necro DoT's) but I tend to lose aggro over the course of the battle to higher DPS classes.  Just my little tidbit, I would recommend this to Warriors from 30-58ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;After reading all the hype about the GSoT I'm really surprised by this thread.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not.<br />
<br />
Eh, The greatstaff is a wonderful weapons, but sometimes people just want to be different. Or maybe the thread starter gut such an obscenely great deal on selling the staff, he could upgrade his armor and his overall tankability by selling it and buying other upgrades.<br />
<br />
Or maybe he just wanted the axe for a toy.<br />
<br />
I have a monk friend who from about the time he was level 20 or so until today (he's ahead of me now at level 63) constantly barrages me with weapons questions.<br />
<br />
Eventually I got a little snappy with him and told him two things:<br />
<br />
1) X combo was his best DPS setup, bar none, no arguments. It just was, according to modals, according to parses, according to the ratios of the weapons even. BUT ...<br />
2) If Y combo are the weapons he liked best (and it was, he really wanted to use his fist of iron like really badly), then USE IT.<br />
<br />
In other words, in the case of my monk friend it wasn't worth stressing a 5 to 10 DPS difference between two weapons combos if you weren't going to have fun not using your favorite weapon.<br />
<br />
My warrior used his Praetor's Blade of Debility for a long, LONG time. I quested it. I LOVED the quest, I LOVED the weapon. Yeah, I took a hit on DPS by not upgrading it at times when I could have, but eh, I was having fun, I was able to do my job as a tank.<br />
<br />
My point?<br />
<br />
I don't know I forgot.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder is going to be a superior setup to Frosty/Barney Axe ... but if you really want to use a frosty/barney axe, and you have fun doing so ... don't stress it so much.<br />
<br />
And my underlying, sneaky point ... I'm kind of reached my saturation point with the Greatstaff. So many threads talking about it. It's like the flavor of this month on this board. Heh. This time next year, people will be hawking them for half the price and snubbing their noses at it, saying, &quot;GSoT is soooooo 2003, you really must get with the times.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all let me say 500pp is ok but could have been better.  I got mine for 280.  As far as agro, well if it procs you are good to go.  If it doesn't I've found that even wielding a jade mace on primary is godlike compared this POS.  Even worse part about it?  Though the proc kicks ass, I am positive its proc rate sucks.  The most I've had it proc is 3 times in one battle, the least?  17 battles no procs.  IMO Gay.  <br />
<br />
On another note guess what?  That is just me and my opinion, if you are getting what you need out of it and frosty then kick ass.  I've never had a GSoT but from what I hear I wouldn't have given up the staff for that weapon.  Thank god that wasn't your reason as I know it was to upgrade gear and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried it main hand for an hour or two, but was easy tanking in a PoD ooze group, where most pulls were blue cons, and damage wasn;'t so critical. Also had a 52 Paladin as secondary melee who wasn't casting so had no trouble keeping aggro.<br />
<br />
The BCA really procs less than Frosty or Honed Blade of Ykesha. Without DEX buffs I get it to proc once per fight.. if I'm lucky. With Shammy buffs it can proc 1 to 3 times a fight.<br />
<br />
I also have yet to steal aggro of any MT with the BCA proc, while Frostbringer did for me a few times.<br />
<br />
I keep coming back to my Ykesha Frosty combo atm, because I like the proc and looks of the Ykesha and AC on Frosty.<br />
<br />
I like the BCA because it is cheap, it is WAR only, it doesn't look bad, and when I have got a proc from ykesha or frosty I can switch it in for another proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like silken whip of ensnaring more, better ratio and the snare proc is always beneficial.  Maybe I didn't give the BCA enough of a chance but it just seemed crappy to me I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashurr</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frostbringer all the way for 1handers in that range.  But really I suggest getting a big 2hander, (windblade or the OVER SATURATED GSoT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well theres 3 reasons that I sold the GSoT.<br />
<br />
1) Insane Offer for it that wouldve given me lots of cash to upgrade gear<br />
2) GSoT seemed to proc less for me.  Also the knockback was getting annoying<br />
3) Im close to getting my epics so once we kill queen, I'll have a nice aggro setup.<br />
<br />
I'm also gonna be on travel for work for about three weeks so I wanted to sell now and hope that the price would drop by the time I get back.  Hopefully it will, but if not then I'll just buy the GSoT again.  But as of now, the frosty/barny combo is really cheap and good bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have a Praetor's Blade of Debility, Lorre ?<br />
<br />
I did the quest today, I'm wondering how it will compare to the BCA aggro wise.<br />
<br />
The proc is likely better as it lasts for 2min, and debuf STA STR and AC.. I have yet to see how much it procs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lorre, looking at your magelo, I've got just 1 suggestion- Switch your weapons around. I currently use frosty/barney axe, and have toyed around with them a lot. Putting frosty in primary gives a HUGE boost to dps, and I've also noticed that I hold aggro better. <br />
<br />
Besides, even ignoring procs, a 12/22 should ALWAYS be put in primary over a 9/21.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use a BCA and a Kunzar Kuchwhatever... BCA primary, kunzar secondary when i am tanking.  seems to proc a couple times a fight with no dex buff, more of course with dex buff.  works pretty well for me =)</div></div><hr />
