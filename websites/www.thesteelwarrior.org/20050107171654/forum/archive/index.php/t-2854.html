Less than 1k (since greatstaff of thunder costs 1k and it wouldn't make sense to buy something that's more expensive than it right?)  Level 20 if you want to recommend weapons with &quot;rec levels&quot;<br />
<br />
Etched Velium Battle hammer, 11 dmg 20 delay (main hand)<br />
Shaded Dagger 11 dmg 22 delay (offhand)  no procs on either.<br />
<br />
1hb and piercing and 1hs.<br />
<br />
for now my armor is okie dokie.  I can pretty much foresee that direction up until 50s.<br />
<br />
edit I have a haste item already if any suggestions in that regard are made, not the best but not the worst =P  24 percent</div></div><hr />

<br />
My combo is reaching its limit but it still does good... Jade mace in main and centi long in offhand.  I think I use a beetle stinger for piercer.  My 2hand skill is god awful right so nothing great is being bought for those until I can get them up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you have the cash grab a gsot now befor they go back up in price. if you havent. <br />
<br />
what you have is good only real difference is adding a proc on the more expensive stuff.</div></div><hr />
