The point of getting groups as a 65 warrior vs a (say) 62 warrior is dead on! I've never seen an ooc that says &quot;62 Warrior, with R3, regen3, ND3, CA3, CA3, AT, Lfg&quot;<br />
Get 65 first!</div></div><hr />

I wont bother about epic anymore although i had red scale for like 2 years and miss green scale, golem ball and spiroc blade still.<br />
But unless we go to PoA or PoF for epic pieces (for other classes) I probably wont see those pieces (AEing PoF is actually rather funny-40 minutes for a full clearing in a zone that gave us the creeps a year ago).<br />
Green scale is actually rather easy as it is for sale regularly for ~30kpp.<br />
As far as quests go i prefer to finish my 10th ring sometime soon to epic.<br />
After almost 5 months i finally managed to get non kos to dwarfs again and go through steps 1 to 9 in 2 and a half days including farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could someone explain to me why everyone rates CA before CS?<br />
<br />
To my mind, if you are a MT then you want CS first. CS results in smoother damage, CA in spikey damage. Your healers want you taking smooth damage.<br />
<br />
Just to use a few numbers to illustrate what I mean, with exageration of the affects. Would you rather get hit for 1000,0,1000,0 or 500,500,500,500. <br />
<br />
Perhaps someone has done some parsing and shown that the effects of CA are greater than CS?<br />
<br />
Obviously having both is best, and I'm keeping both equal, but I always buy the CS rank before the CA rank.<br />
<br />
Puzzled!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may be wrong on this, but I'm pretty sure that CS isn't really any smoother than CA.  It increases the chance that you'll mitigate part of the damage - it doesn't just reduce the top hit by a set percentage.<br />
<br />
Edit: So as I understand it, your above CS example might be 1000, 250, 1000, 250, with the outright misses being replaced by mitigated hits, and obviously the misses are better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I understand that CS biases your damage taken towards the lower end of the mobs possible hits but still, if CA and CS have the same net effect on the total damage taken then CS is the better skill due to it being smoother. <br />
<br />
If someone can say with CA you absolutely take less damage then with CS then I'll start working LR to 5 before I work on ID at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with spikes in damage there are other things to considered.<br />
Less hits on rampage mobs makes the life of the rampage tank much easier.<br />
Its one of the reasons our MA and myself (depending who is assigened tank for the encounter) use evasive a lot more now.<br />
With CA3/LR5 i was able to tank just fine (i went past CS1 only after I finished LR) in Luclin and PoP although we havent done anything harder than Behemoth,TT, Carpin, Grummus, Aerin'Dar.<br />
Less hits also means less stuns, so you will have an easier time holding agro, especially in PoP.</div></div><hr />

Chance to Get hit for 0   or<br />
Chance to Get hit for % lower then you would have before <br />

hard choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, its not even remotely that simple Riaden or I would not have posed the question. Gnomb's reply makes a lot of sense, avoiding being stunned is a very good point indeed.<br />
<br />
Indeed if it were the case of purely not being hit some extra times and being hit for less on average then my own first postulate would stand and CS would be better than CA. Given that each has the same increase in avoidance or mitigation* the mitigation is preferable as it leads to smoother damage taken, easier CHeal chains, less MT deaths, less tank switches, less wipeouts.<br />

Seems to me that I used to crit about 2% of the time, now it's more like 5% (1/20 attacks).  No way am I critting on 9% of attacks, that's almost one out of 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since this thread was about the AA skills warriors can buy...<br />
<br />
Anyone have any information - testing or rumor - about Fear Resistance (Archetype AA) and Warcry (Class AA)?<br />
<br />
How effect if FR? How often does it seem to affect your fear duration/resists? In particular, did you find it helping in fights against mobs that have stupid high pentalties to their fear resists (a la HoH trial dragon)?<br />
<br />
How long does Warcry last at each level? Does it function properly (allow total fear immunity to your group)? What is the range for it, when you &quot;click&quot; it, for your group members?<br />
<br />
Any information at all? It's 30 points to max out at Warcry 3, but it's an option I've been considering, in order to make a Dragon-slaying team...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CS doesn't work like defensive.  The average hit against you does go down but your min and max hits remain the same.  With defensive not only does your average go down but so does your max hit.  So with defensive a healer can reliably increase the time between CHs for the duration of the /disc because there is no chance that you will get a string of hits for the max damage or even close to max damage.<br />
<br />
The advantage that CA has over CS as others have mentioned is that you can't mitigate a proc.  So with CA you'll take 10% less damage due to misses and be affected by 10% less procs.  With CS you'll take 10% less damage due to mitigation but you'll still get hit with the full effect of all procs because you were still hit the same number of times.  Against a mob that doesn't proc anything the affect should be identical.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Combat Stabliity is every bit as good as defensive over the long run except on all but the hardest hitting mobs (&gt;3000).  The chance of getting a 'bad' round with sufficient AC are low enough not worry about it.  If it happens, just suck it up and move on.  I had one round in Fire where one of the Phoenixes did 7.2k in 3 hits and killed me, and that round also happened to be more damage than his last 8 rounds put together.  Freak accidents like that happen and there's no use worrying about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its rather moot anyway.<br />
If you tank major mobs for a guild you want both avoidance and mitigation maxed anyway.<br />
Progression through both CA/LR and CS/ID was noticable when you exp in the same spot (CoD entrance duo with my cleric).</div></div><hr />
