<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rhaagar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail.. first off all i would like to say hello, being that this is my first visit to this forum.<br />
<br />
Iv been playing Everquest for about 3 years now, but recently i got back form a long break, and now i startet a warrior, he is twinkd for about 250k, i hav a 65 cleric a 55 druid and a 62 chanter that i hav access to ( old chars) but i can only play my warrior and 2 of the 3 at one time. ( lack of computers ). <br />
<br />
NOW.. my question is, is it worth Pllving alle the way to lvl 65 or is it not an option? if it is an option, anyone know where it could be done??<br />
<br />
-- OuT --<br />
<br />
and thx :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You twinked your War for 250k so normal leveling is not possible for him. You can go soloing but the amount of twinkage is already a part of powerleveling.<br />
<br />
So you can also skip the lower levels and push him with chanter and healer.... to any point of level.<br />
<br />
But some stuff is to remember.<br />
<br />
1. Whats about his skills ( offense defense weapons )<br />
2. Whats about your skills ( how to get aggro and hold it / how to see whats possible with the group ..... .. ... )<br />
<br />
So minor the stuff is a warrior can do ( you know hit attack hit taunt hit kick .. .thats is .... as the ppl. always think ) so major is the stuff you can learn around this basics ( positioning Mob and Pets / positioning your tank and Mob / distance tank and mob and mob and casters / timing of taunt and kick / weaponchoice when fighting different mobs/ distance pulling / aggro pulling / non damage pulling/ how to pull in different groups ... ) And this is mostly a part of practice in a real group and a real surrounding.<br />
<br />
So you can push him to 65 and be a moron in nice gear in nearly no time or you can let him take experience in playing in a group from time to time in different zones / groups to learn more than the mechanics.<br />
<br />
Yeah and where to powerlevel? real simple. Go for a surrounding in which are enough mobs with short range to pull, with low hp for fast kills with low damage for no risk in zones with a good exp modifier and kill stuff like mad...... this way or another :).<br />
<br />
But dont forget .. the fun was the biggest one when you were young and exploring the zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, one way to look at it is this: If you know how to play EQ, you'll be at least decent at any class. I could pick up any class right now and be at least passable within 30 minutes. I'd be good within a few days. If I was going to play a character from scratch, the main goal would be to get him gear and levels as fast as possible so I could get to high end again. <br />
<br />
That being said, definitely make sure your skills are kept up. Piercing is the least important, but the rest are very good to keep up. Defense should stay up as long as you are tanking the mobs. Remember, if you have a DS up your offense goes up but your defense doesn't.<br />
<br />
It should be very easy to get levels with that crew. Choose mobs that are far too high of level (10ish above), almost kill them, then memblur. Have your warrior finish the mob off for full experience. That will get you past the first 50 or so levels no problem. Afterwards, just have the warrior tank the mobs and make sure he does the majority of the damage. Any time he might not get exp, memblur the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well till lvl 55 or so it should be a breeze with druid DS and chanter haste/mana regen(slow decreases dps). After that I'd get your druid to 58 or switch to cleric and slow the mobs. With that setup you can solo anything xp group can do. I mean you got your essencials tank-healer-slower. <br />
<br />
And if you played EQ for 3 years and still have to ask... That scares me. I'd have higher opinion of you if you said you E-Bayed the toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spots da Cat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For a first character, I dont think its a good idea.  <br />
<br />
In your case, since you have leveled a previous character up that high, it shouldnt be a problem.<br />
<br />
Im finding it hard to get a good spot to 2 box with my 60 druid now that the warrior is almost 62.  A cleric might work better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dirtyfleur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fitemore put it really well. If you have been playing EQ for along time you will have a handle on how to play most classes. I powerlevelled myself up to 60 then made 61 - 65 in regular exp groups. Sometimes I wish I would have exp'd all the way and experienced how it is to be a tank at lower and higher levels but I'm impatient and that would have taken ages :D. I wanted a warrior to duo with my druid so I chose to PL. <br />
<br />
Anyway. I do think powerlevelling is worth it, just take time to max out your skills or you'll be as much use as a tank, as a wet paper bag would be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, defense does go up with a ds on now. Was pl'ing a new Bst in Paludal other day and his defense was going up. Was surprised.</div></div><hr />

Stat not skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonnas Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Last i checked there was no defense stat....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No. I don't care how experienced a player you are. There are things about playing a class that can only be learned by playing that class in a group.  Given how ridiculously easy it has become to level a lower level toon, I'd say PLing is not only a bad idea it's uneccessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's worth it... if you are like me and loath lower levels. Raiding is where it's at for me, all this exp, quests, etc etc is just blocking my way . But since it sounds like you arn't in a guild that raids consitantly, I really wouldn't worry about powerleveling. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you do powerlevel, take a couple levels and go group someplace, it will help quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the most frustrating part of the damage shield part of powerleveling is getting up to level 10 with a weapon skill above 10 or so. it will eventually catch up but personally i recommend starting with the full 5 points at the trainer on the weapon skill you plan on starting with and using a very fast weapon. you will likely want to go back and train again around level 5 or 6. dont be surprised when at level 15 your skills are all severely lagging but again they will catch up eventually at least for your primary and secondary 1h weapons or a single 2h weapon. eventually you will need to practice up the rest of your weapons and its just something you will have to live with.<br />
<br />
you are far from alone when you say you want to pl instead of getting up there the hard way. casters used to do it with kei and potg all the way from level 1. and trust me if i could still get kei i would give it to my baby enchanter to level him up too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gleb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have played up two warriors and after an 8 month break I came back and started a warrior from scratch.  It too me 1.5 months total.  10 days played with a good 3 to 5 days of raiding time.  My skills (importants ones) are all maxed at 65, and were maxed by the time I got to 50 (where I had to skill up again).  <br />
<br />
If you never played the class before, you are going to miss some key things about playing a warrior: positioning, and when to use discs at cetain times come to mind.  However, these are all learned and you will get them. <br />
<br />
Personally,  it was a non issue.  All my friends were 65 with massive amounts of AAs.  I had to PL to be able to group with them.  Once I get 55 I spent most my time in PoV and we all got good xp (grouped from then on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>XCrovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a warrior alt who was heavilly twinked by the time he was level 20.  About the point he hit level 45 I deceided to invest a ton of money in his gear and start the PL train.  I took him up to level 62 PLing in Velks with a 65 cleric using DS and CH to pretty much clear the entire bottom floor and some of the ramps before repop.  My reasoning was that at level 62 he could sub out for my wizzy on those days when a tank wasn't available.  At 62 he could come into BoT with my friends and family.  At 62 he qualified for raids with the folks I raid with.  So I am sitting here with a 62 warrior, twinked out the yahoo, and very little knowledge of how to play him.  Sure I am learning, but I am the first to admit that a there are warriors in the low 50's that are probably better warriors then my level 62 with over 7k hp buffed.  I am the equivalent of an Ebay at this point.  On the upside, I can now hang with my friends, many of whom are helping me learn what I need to learn to become a functional tank.  I can also better understand a lot of the stuff that I read on these very boards.  Is it worth it?  I think so, but that doesn't mean I didn't lose out on a lot doing it this way.<br />
<br />
PS, My skills are pretty much maxed.  PL or not, you just need to switch out weapons periodically and mash your buttons to keep the skills ups coming.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I started my warrior untwinked not long after I started my wizard. I got him in to the 20s without PLing. I put him away for a while and played my wiz to 60. By then I had a good chunck og change and I started buying up as much good warrior gear as I could. I also can into a 60 druid at the time. I PL'd from mid 20s to around 55 or when the exp started slowing down. All of my skills where maxed at 50, and I kept up with them to 60. I did all of my leveling 55-65 in exp groups, usually 2-boxing with my wizard. I've gotten to tank all kinds of mobs including raid mobs in lower PoP and I have never had any problems (well, other than the normal warrior agro problems before I got my BoC). If you have already played a toon or 2 to 60+ then you have already experienced what it is like to level a toon the hard way, I don't see any problem with PLing.</div></div><hr />
