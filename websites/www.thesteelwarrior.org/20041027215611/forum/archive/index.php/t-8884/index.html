<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I have been using an anger3 augd Bloodfrenzy and an anger3 augd AHB for about a year now. Last night I picked up a BoW, stripped my anger3 aug off my AHB and slapped it on my BoW. <br />
<br />
I haven't had much of a chance to test it yet, but my question is this: Going from that 1H combo to the BoW, will I have a harder or easier time holding aggro (for the most part it wasn't an issue with the 1H)? It may help to note that I have maxed 2H AAs but no ambidexterity or sinister strikes.<br />
<br />
Also, is double riposte and flash of steel worth the AAs spent to get them...or should I save up for OoW instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I switched to BoW it wasn't the best untill I got my offensive AAs to produce more swings. But it was nicer aggro, i noticed.<br />
<br />
I'd save AA for oow defensive skills (CA/CS 3.0)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I have read in previous post, the Bow will give better initial aggro.  You 1hs combo will probably hold better continous aggro over a long period of time.  I do not have  BoW so this is the conclusion I have gathered from other similiar thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I switched from a3 aug'd boc and a3 aug'd gbos (about 9 months ago) to my Sews it took quite a while to get use to. I would agree with Dima; the offensive aa's help it a long a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bow is different from your dual setup in terms of agro generation. A good portion of the boost comes from the raw dps upgrade that happens going from luclin ratio 1h's to upper pop 2h ratios. With WA5 I rarely notice problems, but I do have all the offensive aa's covered. Flurry is especially nice with a bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its a moderate step down in aggro but still enough aggro with great dps and stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have ferocity, punishing blade, flurry, and WA AAs. From what I'm seeing here I should see a miniscule loss in aggro with a huge gain in dps. That sound about right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aggro at start of the fight will be a lot better (no need to proc to keep mob).<br />
Less aggro after a while, but still plenty enough.<br />
Gain in dps.<br />
<br />
Aggro management will be lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bargran...for the record:<br />
<br />
You have BOTH torque of the wyrmlord AND crimson sigil gloves; therefore, I hate you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Imo,overall BOW is better aggro for me when raiding then my present 1hand set ups.I had used a bf/ahb and mostly an a3'd bf/boc combo before.The bf combo has more hate potential imo,but,in my experience the a3 BOW is generally better.People have used both weapon sets to MT everything thru time and into god though.Hard to go wrong with a bloodfrenzy or  BOW until you can grab a dbotw/GOD/OOW weapon.I MT'd everything for my guild since luclin and that's what I've found.</div></div><hr />

  Quoted for emphasis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Derailing my own thread, BUT...<br />
<br />
Does Torque of the Wyrmlord still drop? Over the past year and a half, I have killed Emperor Ssra over 40 times (I used to lead PU raids on him a lot) and NEVER seen that thing drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, I've seen one semi-recently. Unless they revamped the loot table for Emp, which I find very unlikely, they still drop. The last one I heard about dropping was about 2 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well,<br />
<br />
If it's still &quot;dropping&quot; the drop rate on it makes me sick to my stomach just thinking of it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Still drops, always was one of his more rare loots. Gloves on the other hand, thems is very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">got my torque 6 or 8 months ago, dont remember exactly, so yes, it still drop, just rare. dropped once after 12-13 kills.<br />
we got 2 gloves after 20 VT cleans or so.<br />
<br />
Was happy to get them, if you can get them, try too, it's priceless :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Siranah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kogur ....you don't trust me?  :p <br />
<br />
I can actually not pay attention while using my BoW with the anger 3 aug.  I don't have all of the offensive aa's you have, but trust me, you will love this thing.  I've had other classes try to take aggro from me and just can't do it.  <br />
<br />
Grats friend on your new toy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lmao!<br />
<br />
Hey hun: I didn't even know you knew these boards exist (you lurker!!). I knew it would produce suffiencient aggro, I just wanted other warriors perspectives on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Siranah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Look at the number next to my post.<br />
<br />
Now laugh again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">kekeke~</div></div><hr />

Symbol of the Planesmaster and Veil of the Inferno drops alot  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Even with veil you'd still want torque!!  Torque owns for sure, yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Symbol of the Planesmaster and Veil of the Inferno drops alot  :D<br />
<br />
Veil of inferno + torque of wyrmlord effects stack.<br />
gloves &gt; symbol (better range items to get in time than symbol, and 0,5 sec cast on gloves owns).<br />
<br />
And according to his magelo, Kogur have acces to gloves and torque, but not time yet .. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I got my torque about 6 mo ago (maybe more actually /shrug)  but my guild has seen their second and last about 2 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Oakinbier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Did Emp with Kogur tonight and yet again, no drop. /Taunts Kogur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">VoE gets one every kill *more taunt* =\ Lies</div></div><hr />
