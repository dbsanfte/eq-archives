I am currently playing a 65 warrior on Vallon Zek, member of &lt;Aduentus&gt;. Trought my quest of upgrading my gear, I have stumbled on a problem: a haste item. Our guild currently has access to all of PoP pre Sol Ro, and the rest of the EQ world. At the moment, I am wearing a Cloak of Flames (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=11621). Trought my research, I have stumbled on  Valiant Belt of Fallen Heroes (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=15873). Any suggestions/ideas would be appreciated. To see my magelo, click on the Lemon in my sig.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there arent that many haste droppers and its normally rare except off yelinak, only guaranteed 41 haste every kill, 2 hastes if you are done with ST.<br />
<br />
earring of speed from doomshade<br />
range slot from XTC<br />
BP of speed, boots from VT<br />
boots from emp<br />
neck from poi dragon<br />
belt from dgarn the destroyer<br />
dozekar bracer/cloak<br />
<br />
best are yelinak and poi dragon, poi u can do everyday, honestly we did him once lol and forgot about it though, some guilds farm him. if you are doing VT, i see you got emp ring, most ppl CoTH straight to blob 1, but the front two named drop haste boots real common. they also drop 30ac cloaks with 100hp, few FT items, good bracers etc and they spawn 1-3 days. most the time they are left up so something to check out. i would give you the name but i only know them by TVX and not 100% sure on that heh, lame VT names.<br />
<br />
it doesnt get more common in elementals either, mud ring should drop two bracers everytime, it doesnt...</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
yelinek, poi dragon, and tvk prob easiest way to get good haste/HP. anything else is pretty rare.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
tvk drops 3 haste items it looks like hehe, anyways, great mob for haste and there are 2 of them, one on each side.</div></div><hr />
