<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made a post about a month ago here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8277) , where I stated that I was going to attempt to start progressing my way thru GoD, with a single, non uber group, in order to basically prove that it could be done.  I've been requested numerous times to keep people informed, and that's pretty much the first thing I get asked in chat now too, so there is apparantly some interest in how it's going.  Here's monthly update number 1.<br />
<br />
We decided to go with the group of Warrior, Shaman (both me), Bard, Rogue, Cleric, Enchanter.  Of course only having 3 of those characters existing already, the others needed to be created.  Currently our Bard, Cleric and Enchanter are all 51 and are in the process of finishing up Run 3.  Fear not..we're not slacking here, and it took an entire month to get 3 toons to 51/3.  <br />
<br />
The cleric is outfitted in full Skyshrine quest armor because I had a shitload of that stuff rotting in my bank from our HoT farming days.  The enchanter isn't far behind...he's got extremity pieces of Thurgadin and Skyshrine stuff.  The bard we just rolled up as RZ, which makes his gear extremely easy with my 250 Human smith.  <br />
<br />
Besides Claws of Veeshan faction work, we also finished the cleric epic last week, and did the bard epic last nite.  We kinda got lucky on Cleric camps, he finished all his piddly camps in one weekend, then it was just a matter of spawning Ixblat and pretending he was a challenge, smacking around the overking (dude is such a pushover now it's unbelievable), and shakerpaging Skyfire for shards to spawn Ragefire.<br />
<br />
Bard epic wasn't bad either, took us a little over a week to get the bard piece from Phinny, and in the process we found out that the goddamned wizard staff that dropped 3 times in 5 kills isn't MQ'able in any way that I can figure out. I had an Amy tendril from the last time I was in Fear, and I'm kinda pissed off about this guy named &quot;Snipahxmule&quot; having loot from every dragon on Norrath (i'm not kidding either) on his trader and essentially forcing me to buy the white scale from him (Can we put the fucking white and green scales on the Scalekeeper yet PLEASE?).  The Hole is actually EASIER now than before the revamp in my opinion.  I kept expecting us to get overwhelmed by mass numbers of roaming mobs, but it never happened.  Fought down to the scalekeeper in about 45 minutes or so and showed him the bottom of my boot for the red scale. <br />
<br />
(Derail inc -- feel free to skip)<br />
<br />
45 minutes to fight down to the scalekeeper.  I am not fucking kidding you, it took us a full 5 goddamned minutes to get all 6 characters out of the fucking water, and up on to the ledge in the Hole.  What the hell is your problem SOE?  You patched DX9, fucked all the collisions in the game up, and then 8 months later you STILL haven't corrected it?  The fact that the /rewind command even EXISTS is a tribute to your failure to code a game correctly.  FIX THIS NOW. It's gone on way too long, and there is absolutely no reason for you to be working on new expansions with such a ridiculous, game ruining buy in place.  It affects me every goddamned time I play, since I can't get either of my Barbarian characters to Halas without waiting for the fucking raft, because if I swim across the lake, I'm gonna get stuck trying to get out on the Halas side.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND UNNACCEPTABLE.<br />
<br />
/derail off.<br />
<br />
In a surprising end to that nite, we actually found the undead bard up in Sebillis right after we dropped Nortlav and so we headed that direction with a CoH bot.  Trakanon fight was pretty uneventful, he only lived a minute and 7 seconds with a single group, he only had time to cast 2 AE's, only one Deadly Lifetap landed on me, only one person got Trak Touched, and we didn't even have to throw a heal out.  The real annoyance for the nite was that 2 high end elemental (and maybe even time guilded) people at this point had died trying to farm the shroom king, and the fuckers followed us all the way down to the shrooms, and after looting their corpses and aggroing about 5 more shrooms, trained them on top of us expecting us to do something about their plight, without doing a fucking thing to help us out (IE : not even a goddamned Brells from the fucking paladin).  We succored out on those gimps.  Fuck that shit.  It bears repeating -- just because you're in an elemental guild does not make you a good player.<br />
<br />
So, after a month, i'm pretty happy with our progress.  We got our characters to a useful level to group with our 65's, we're in the process of finishing up Run 3, we've got arguably the best 2 epics in the game on our level 51 characters (Dance of the blade is sooooooo nice it's not even funny), they're geared appropriately (3k mana on a level 51 is damned decent), and we got all the crap out of the way, so we're ready to head on to 65 and get cracking on the GoD stuff.  Here's what we've got planned for the next month --<br />
<br />
-- Get the twinks PoJ flagged, basically so we can get them BoT and Tactics flagged before we can get them into the zone free at 62.  We need to make a quick stop and farm up some Ornate for them so we can stop tributing spell Focii<br />
<br />
-- Get them to 65, so that we can do LDoN's with them.  We gotta get a couple of augments quick, Haass needs some Yak augs, and the rest of the group can get a couple useful augments while they wait.<br />
<br />
-- Then from there, we just need to get critical AA's out of the way, like Spell Casting Mastery and such, so that we can start looking at doing GoD content.  I suspect that in just over a month's time, we'll be ready to start working our way thru GoD.  I haven't had time to research the zones or the progression yet, so I can't get too detailed on what I expect us to accomplish, but I should have a better idea in a month.<br />
<br />
And, from where I'm standing right now, I just hope that WoW doesn't come out before I finish this project, because as much as I hate giving SoE my money, I'm actually kinda having fun in EQ again.</div></div><hr />

Danke Raaj. Buy yourself something nice.<br />
<br />

<br />
A lot of people say such things, but keeping level 65's OFF of the aggro list is easier said than done.  Plus Bard, Chanter and Cleric isn't exactly the optimum dragon farming force to begin with.  <br />
<br />
And the wiz epic staff is mqable <br />
<br />
Ah yes, how silly of me.  Thank you for that informative post.  <br />
<br />
No, it's not.  Arantir won't talk to me, I /con the same to him as the wizard does.  I tried the invis trick to boost me up to indifferent faction and Arantir gave the staff back to me.<br />
<br />
That was an entertaining post, thanks Haass. Hit those &quot;hot spot&quot; zones to PL your cleric and bard! <br />
<br />
Well, hot spots are a good idea in theory, but bad in practice.  50-55 is Grieg's End now, and I dunno, that zone just always sounded really gay for some reason.  Plus it goes from green to assrape in about 20 steps, or used to, so I've got no desire to go there.<br />
<br />
Chardok is the 55-60 Hotspot, which I agree with, but we're kinda going the other way these days.  Cave lord sashes from Droga are selling for 20kpp each in the CT bazaar for some reason, plus we have the regal bands and cord stuff we can do in chardok if we limit our hunting there, so that's probably not gonna happen either.<br />
<br />
Howling stones, however, is really great for this shit.  65 warrior and 65 Rogue just mulch shit left and right and the 51's rack up the XP.  The cleric gained almost an entire level just walking from the entrance of the south wing to the zone out.<br />
<br />
Happy to note that even in the middle of the experiment, ran into Haass and Co. in Howling Stones last night and they were kind enough to give me a rez  <br />
<br />
Ya, I was gonna tell Xyyon not to rez you just to see if it would come back to the boards, but I decided against it :)<br />
<br />
Btw, we walked thru east wing that nite after all, and never saw that other guy's corpse.  You get it out somehow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Blue Crystal Staff should be MQable, I don't know why it's not letting you.  What's the message he's giving when he hands it back to you?  I always thought &quot;I will not aid beings like you&quot; meant he kept the staff, not handing it back (every time I get that message they kept the item).  Usually when he hands it back the message is: &quot;I have no need of this&quot;, which means one of two things:<br />
<br />
1. It's the wrong Arantir (there are two versions, actually, spawned from Dargon).<br />
<br />
2. It thinks he already has the staff, which is weird because he was just spawned.<br />
<br />
The faction necessary is high apprehensive.  There's a bug that was fixed two years ago, though.  Any wizard who started their epic before then is bugged I believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grieg's End was revamped way back when Hollowshade Moor/Grimling Forest/Acrylia Caverns was revamped.  It's much easier now, most things in there don't see invis, although the named are still difficult.  I don't know how much of a &quot;hot spot&quot; it is, though.  A few friends of mine did one of those hot spots and didn't think it was all that good.<br />
<br />
Keep it up, I'm one of those who are wondering if that list of equipment that casuals can get are truely able to be done by people who don't have 1800+AC and such, provided they have a good group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the time I tried it, the wizard obviously did the spawning.  Needed a potion off Dargon, and then ran to Erudin quick and came back and spawned Arantir.  I'm pretty sure it's the right version because I've seen other people spawn him, and they got different text than this guy did.<br />
<br />
He was apprehensive, and so was I.  The wizard could hail Arantir and have a conversation with him, he told me to go fuck myself.  After awhile of standing around while this guy talked to his guild, I just decided to try the invis trick (open trade window, invis the toon, so then you become indifferent on the turn-in) and Arantir handed the staff back to me saying that he had no need for it.  It's possible that the dude was a retard and spawned the wrong one, but I can't say for certain.  All I can say is that he didn't want to have anything to do with me, or my staff, so I ended up destroying 3 Blue Crystal Staves (wizards everywhere are crying now).  He didn't talk to me at apprehensive, and wouldn't take the staff at indifferent.  In my mind, that's non-mqable.<br />
<br />
Edit -- Yeah, just checked the quest, it was definitely the right version of Arantir as he specificly asked the wizard for the items instead of saying he was discovered.<br />
<br />

<br />
Aye, I get asked alot how things are going, so I figure there must be some interest in what the outcome is.  When we started, I was at 5606hp, and just over 1300ac.  I saw 1532ac a couple nites ago with shit for buffs and tribute, so I'm thinking that 1800 is going to be obtainable eventually :)</div></div><hr />

GoD cr is the pits, and when we started to build our group up, we agreed that a necro is absolutely required.<br />

The snared charmed pet is another problem that was mentioned.<br />
<br />
Setup that we have decided on is war/clr/chanter /necro/shaman/(druid or mage).<br />

The druid and mage are already at 65 and with decent AA.  We will probably flag both the druid and mage for kaz and possibly a 65 beastlord.<br />

Even easier.  Choosing a Hard mission bumps you up one level.  Get them to 58, choose a Hard.  You would have gotten a 60, but choosing a Hard gets you a 65 Normal.</div></div><hr />

So long as the necro can summon corpse then why do you need more? FD rezzing is useful but building a whole grp on its overkill. Bot the necro into rez if you are that bad off.<br />
<br />
This is especially true with Natimbi,Ferubi, etc. TLs/ports going into OoW. Wouldnt be suprised if PoK stones are next. People hate the CRs :)<br />
<br />
And wondering too about the charmed pet control. I use my pally to stun it quick but then I am psycho and often haste him (stand way back with pally's only mission to stun). You getting a clicky snare from somewhere?<br />

<br />
I don't think the issue is getting the corpses to a ZI, that's really quiet easy, heck if its an instanced zone just leave and re start it anyways.  <br />
<br />
The main issue is spending an hour or more in a instanced zone, wiping, and then having to start all over from ZI.  It can get monotonous.  One wrong move, one wrong re spawn, one small lag, one LD and you can easily loose your cleric... then what? start all over from ZI ... again and again and again ...  Just might think about having two ressers in the group, wether necro or Pali<br />
<br />

So stop wiping.  Don't move wrong, be mindful of spawn time, get a broadband connection and stop worrying about sucking at EQ.  I never needed 2 rezzing classes before...hell, for the longest time we did EQ with NO cleric at all, including our first Doze kill.<br />
<br />
Rez is for weenies too.<br />
<br />
Like has the druid and rogue looked for the potential upgrades in the sewers or whever? <br />
<br />
There's really not much to worry about.  If we get some new rogue gear, we'll give it to the rogue.  My group consists of 3 guys who have been playing EQ together for what...maybe 4 years now.  There's no loot argument bullshit going on, we farm it till we get what we need from it and we move on.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty unconcerned about loot distribution.</div></div><hr />

There will be more rez type effects inc. with OoW. Likely a summon to corpse funciton where the shammy can summon the cleric back to his corpse allowing him to loot the epic and rez himself.<br />
<br />
Charming is for weenies? Spoken like a tank :) You have NEVER seen a single grp fight like 3 chanters, 2 pallys (2 to max stunnage on breaks) and a cleric with 3 charmed hasted pookas. Talk about ripping ass, at least until 2 pookas go down at once...   3000+ dps ripping into a grp can be an amusing thing, till you all are staring at your bind point... CR inc.... :) <br />
<br />
Seriously you should considering charming and then a pally has a role more so than a necro, at least till the shammy summon to corpse goes in then you could consider some other setup. But in the end its how you guys choose to play and since it sounds like there is some boxing going on that has to be a consideration as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I was on a 53 war this weekend in GE and was surprised by how good the exp was.  Wasn't exactly my idea to go there, but warrior got at least 1/4 level in the first 20 minutes of fighting and dinged, and not everyone knew everyone else, so that's probably not maximum efficiency. Group was low 50s necro &amp; warrior (me), mid 50s shaman and cleric, a 65 beast and a 64 (?) monk. Didn't go terribly far in, and not sure it beats what you decribe in Howling Stones, but obviously the &quot;hot zone&quot; thing has some effect. i wasn't paying any attention at all to exp until I dinged, but I'm pretty sure the war was getting exp from the first mob in the zone, even with the 65 toon there.</div></div><hr />

Flip answers about what is and isn't for weenies aside...isn't group makeup a consideration for non-raiders? I know I don't have the perfect group everytime I try something new.<br />

<br />
No, look, seriously, here's the deal.<br />
<br />
Death in EQ is a penalty.  It's a penalty for being fucking stupid.  5 years ago, it meant a lot more than it does now, with click sticks and high XP mobs, but it's still a penalty.<br />
<br />
Drop everyone into the Hole, have the cleric rez them all, rebuff everyone, wait for everyone to med up.  Good plan..sit on your ass for 20 minutes, and have actually LOST experience, or just fight your way down to the bottom and gain a yellow AA.  Hrm, tough choice.  Rez isn't a way to bypass content, it's a way to punish you for dying.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand that the vast majority of people playing EQ need to have their rez backup to cover for their idiocy, but it's really not required.  Learn faster, and you'll spend less time dead.  I met Bourbon when I was playing my necro about 4 years ago..it was before the opening of Kunark.  At that time, we were Druid and Necro, which later expanded into 2 boxing for both of us, and we both switched characters a lot to find the best mix for us.  We picked up Rasco awhile ago, and except for a brief period last year, our normal group was Warrior, Warrior, Rogue, Shaman and Druid.  This was our normal group BEFORE druids got Tunare's Renewal.  We STILL did content that everyone screamed &quot;No, you need a cleric for that, I wouldn't rely on a druid to heal you.&quot;  News flash...if you're under 5khp unbuffed, a druid heals you EXACTLY the same as a cleric does 99.9% of the time, if he's not a fucking idiot, which is the caveat.<br />
<br />
Now, I'll admit, rolling up the new group of War, Shm, Brd, Rog, Enc, Clr, actually gave me pause for about 30 seconds.  I was PL'ing the toons in guk or something and thought &quot;Shit..we're gonna lose Succor from the druid when we drop him...that's damned handy for getting out of tough spots.&quot;  After a very brief discussion with my crew, we came to the conclusion of &quot;Well, we'll just have to not suck,&quot; and we left it at that.<br />
<br />
I understand that most people do suck.  But you have to understand that I played for almost 4  years without ANYONE who could rez in my groups.  You learn how to play this game REAL fucking fast that way.  I'll be damned if I'm letting people tell me I need another rez class in my group.<br />
<br />
As for charm, lets be serious here for a minute.  I&quot;m not doing this test so that we can see how far I can get off of a lucky Call of Druzzil.  What the fuck would that prove?  I can push level 51's thru the Plane of Justice trials all day long, and it doesn't mean a thing about the level 51's skill or gear or ability to play in Valor or Storms, why is this any different?   From the way some of you people talk, you can push just about any group, of any gear level, thru the GoD trials with a skilled chanter with Total Domination 3.  Woohoo, that makes you a real fuckin man doesn't it?<br />
<br />
What would you be more impressed by :<br />
<br />
A) Charming my way thru the trials.<br />
B) Taking a non raiding warrior, with a non raiding crew, and busting our balls to go from ground zero, to all the way thru the single groupable content without relying solely on a lucky string of charms?<br />
<br />
If Brutul says it's doable without charm, then it's doable without charm for me, so stop worrying about it.  If it's not doable, then I've still done my job and proven that it's a bullshit concept to require one class to progress thru the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with Haass on this. The only way I ask for a rez if it was my fault for doing something incredibly stupid is if I am with a cleric and they offer willingly. I cant count the huge amounts of xp I lost for being stupid but I always went back and learnt from my mistake and got the xp back by knocking off more mobs. Mind you tho if a cleric comes by and asks if I want a rez I aint gonna turn it down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think anyone said it was undoable without charm, it's just that it wont take half as long. Since this is your expirement, and the fact that it sounds like it's all you are doing in EQ, then time probably isn't an issue.<br />
<br />
You're just going to be fighting respawns and killing the next room slowly. Not much different from the charm, except you're more on the move. Hell, it's generally safer without a charm pet.<br />
<br />
If your cleric / chanter / paladin / whatever stun class you have is on the ball, charm is hardly a liability, and a lot less luck is required.<br />
<br />

Anyways,  have fun. It's a good test, and I'd like to see how far you can make it. After tipt/vxed you guys still have all three ikkinz single group trials ;)</div></div><hr />

It is easily doable without the charm, done it both ways, actually prefer without charmed if I have the time to do it that way. That being said I am not one for ignoring the obvious applications of a chanter. The difficulty level is about the same but the non-charm way takes a lot longer while the charm way is riskier.<br />
<br />
I dont think its luck really, if you are on the ball you can avoid a wipe 99% of the time (everyone stuns the bitch). In that way its not much different from the non-charm grp. The skillful chanter/stunner combo &gt; the average grp just like the skilled grp &gt; an average chanter with/without stun support. And running a non-raider chanter (from a progression standpoint) through using charm is an accomplishment in and of itself. Most chanters doing this are 6-8K buffed without runes. A non-raider would be nowhere near that...<br />

There is more than one way to skin a cat, and in the end the cat is still skinned :)<br />

Doing it charm style certainly de-emphasised the skills that I needed to bring to the table--in no way was the skill level need lower. In fact the shaman and druid seemed a bit slow off the mark and we did not wait for a lucky break on the charm. The chanter would take his lump or 2 he would recharm--while I was tanking our guest. <br />

Plus it goes from green to assrape in about 20 steps, or used to, so I've got no desire to go there.<br />
<br />
Chardok is the 55-60 Hotspot, which I agree with, but we're kinda going the other way these days. Cave lord sashes from Droga are selling for 20kpp each in the CT bazaar for some reason, plus we have the regal bands and cord stuff we can do in chardok if we limit our hunting there, so that's probably not gonna happen either.<br />

Recommend ChardokB.  Not bad experience (not fabulous, but not bad), gives you faction for spirit wracked cords and easy drops for VP quests if you ever plan on horning in on a VP dragon kill, and has a few items that randomly sell for a LOT of plat.  Plus, you can just rip thought shit in that zone.  Adds happen inside the castle, but with a chanter it won't be a problem.</div></div><hr />

Ya, we spent a little time in chardok B before I quit, it's not a huge deal to fight there.<br />
<br />
Plus I'd like IH4 cloaks for the Shammy/Cleric, so we're gonna head there when the twinks hit 55.  Also gotta go get the droga earring for the bard, and shoulders for the cleric, so our time from 55-60 will be split between Chardok B and Droga.<br />

<br />
If you plan to progress through GoD, your gear needs to be a hell of alot better, period.  Especially if you choose not to charm through Tipt and Vxed.  I tanked both, but we did have a charmed, unhasted, and unsnared pet.  Then of course to farm it, we'd use a hasted and snared pet, best Tipt time was 38 minutes.  After tuning v3.23490824092, it's still pretty damn hard, and those procs from a mob absolutely RAPE.<br />

Looking at your magelo, and then remembering you saying you were able to do Dozekar.. why don't you have any of the quest gear?  It is essential!

A couple of reasons we don't have any doze quest gear... bottom feeders kill Doze to outfit thier twinks, 2nd and 3rd teir guilds also kill him if they find him before the bottom feeders do, lastly, when we do find him up, only one or two of us are online, right now we'd need all three of us to be online to do him, we see this changing in the near future though, but we are keeping an eye on him.<br />
<br />
ST keys are also on our &quot;to do&quot; list. I don't see us doing SSRA, then again, mabey we will, I'm sure Haass will decide wether or not it's worth our time to go there. I also belive Haass will be keeping his current weapon set up, he's going to YAK aug his sapper and SoD I believe, he'll also be going for the AC augs. While he's saving up for those, the casters will be saving up for FT augs.<br />
<br />
All in all, I feel we've done pertty well so far, got the Bard, Cleric, Chanter 50+, got the epics out of the way, and now we're rounding out run3, after that it's grind, grind grind, to get those lvls, once the Brd, Clr, Enc get those lvls I'm sure we'll be taking down mobs like Doz etc when there are only two of us online.</div></div><hr />

Don't need to tell us that.  However, we've got some priorities at this point...we can either choose to farm gear, or we can choose to actually get the rest of our group to 65.  We chose the later for the initial first month of our process.  I'm sure you'll agree that's the logical step.<br />

<br />
Well, aside from Rasco telling you the plight we face on CT of fucking Elemental geared dickwads killing dozekar for their twinks, we also have a main problem here, and that is that I work weekends.  We get the group together for 2 hardcore nites a week.  If Dozer is up, we kill him.  If he's not, well, then we're fucked for exactly 7 days...and look at that, he won't be up again in 7 days will he. <br />
<br />
It's a shitty cycle.  Fortunately patches tend to occur during our hardcore days, so we can eventually get him and the HoT nameds down, for at least a couple of weeks, until they patch again.<br />
<br />
You're not ST keyed =( That's really easy to obtain, and will pump the dps of your bard and rogue fairly substantially via primal. <br />
<br />
It actually won't pump any DPS, as my shaman has 70% Enhancement Extension, and is quite capable of keeping Ferine Avatar on everyone in the group, including the bard.  Nonetheless, it is still on the to-do list, but like I said...we gotta get the toons to 65 first.  Hold yer horses.<br />

I fear when we start poking our noses into Ssra, we'll see the same situation we currently see with Dozekar...and that is people killing them for EB for the tanks that don't have them.  I would be extremely skeptical of pulling anything worthwhile out of Ssra.  Rhag 1 and 2 don't drop jack shit, and that's where I stopped looking because I assumed everything above that wasn't single groupable.<br />

Vadyn's loot table doesn't impress me.  3ac neck is teh no, but the burrower is on our list of shit to do as well.<br />
<br />
Don't worry man..I gots a plan for upgrading us before heading to GoD, but we gotta level up the new toons first.  Once we have everyone to 65 and in passable gear, I'll start worrying about upgrades for me.</div></div><hr />

I will say it again too. There is no point to running around calling everyone pussies cause they don't do it your way.  Yes a lot of people have tanked tipt and vxed without charm pets.  Do it a few times for fun.  Do I want to do that every single time?  No, I have better uses for my &quot;precious&quot; online play time.  There is no betting everything on lucky charms.

EQ has been the best game going for 5 years.  WoW is still nothing but hype.<br />
<br />
Even if WoW is amazing when it's first released, after years of planning and testing, will it be able to keep anyones interest in the long run without cranking out new content every 6 months like EQ does?  Blizzard has a history of releasing games that are stable and really fun but they're way too easy and I'm tired of them in two weeks.  Until they prove otherwise, there's no reason to expect anything better.<br />

This is one of my pet peeves with ppls complaints about EQ.<br />
<br />
Ever notice how in other games (no matter how amazing looking) the areas are just emptier and easier to naviagate than in EQ?<br />
<br />
Ever wonder why they all go for a 3rd person view rather than the total (fps type) freedom you have in EQ to just run and jump with isntant response wherever you feel like?<br />
<br />
Yes... EQ has some awful legacy collision and pathing... but they have (finally) started getting on top of that. But this doesn't negate the fact that designers of most of the other mmorpgs have gone for the 'cheap' option of a 3rd person view where ppl don't notice the simpler area layouts and so on.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard puts out good games but I've played all of the Warcraft games and all of the expansions and I have yet to see one that took me more than about 24 hours to beat start to finish.  I don't really care how good their engine is if they don't figure out how to create enough content to keep me busy.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I still plan on playing WoW when it comes out.  A fun game that doesn't keep me interested for very long is still fun for a little while.  I hope I'm wrong and WoW is the best game ever.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, I'm 100% sure that WoW won't be the perfect dream of a game that a lot of the beta testers make it out to be.  It's going to have its share of problems; the test will be whether its problems are worse than EQ's problems.<br />
<br />
By the way, when is WoW supposed to come out?  I still haven't heard an actual release date.  It seems like there are a lot of big hype projects out there (Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy, 3D Realms' Duke Nukem 4, Indiana Jones 4, the next Superman movie) that are supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread but they never see the light of day.  Has Blizzard given any indication that WoW isn't going to fall into this category?  Last I heard, it was supposed to come out &quot;at the end of 2004...this date subject to change&quot;. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">It will be released on October 15, 2004.<br />
<br />
Yes it's been pushed back allot, yes the beta testers who have been playing for 8 months will know a fook load more then you, yes every item and monster has been found and is on the web for &quot;strats&quot;, yes the game looks amazing, yes its something &quot;new&quot;, yes it will pull allot of people from EQ, yes it does create one word &quot;WOW&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't knock the &quot;steak&quot;, you'd be surprised how bad &quot;hot dogs&quot; taste after moving to a better product.<br />

It did not hold my attention longer than a few weeks, it felt like DAOC.. but that's just my opinion.  Have fun Haass and enjoy your steak.<br />

We are extending the stress test beta to this Sunday and adding thousands of additional testers from the group of gamers that are currently on the closed-beta waiting list. Invitation emails have started going out to the new testers already. The stress test beta contest will continue on until the end of the stress test beta, at which time all stress test accounts will expire.<br />
Please do not contact Blizzard to inquire about being added to the stress test beta; all the information needed, such as how to access the stress test beta, will be provided in the email going out to new testers.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the stress testers, the development team has gained a great deal of information that is proving to be extremely valuable in the development of World of Warcraft. By extending the stress test beta, we will be able to gather even more useful data, which will help us ensure a smooth launch for World of Warcraft later this year. Thanks again, and we'll see you online! <br />
<br />
End of 2004 is still predicted release.  It makes zero sense to do a stress test, and then let that equipment sit idle for long.  There are indeed many products which do not reach fruition. Logic does not support that conclusion in this case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I've seen, which admittedly is far less than you, WoW is going to be a more progression style game, ala single player campaign but with EQ style progression mixed in, than it is the multi-player &quot;chess match&quot; version of the game.  My experience is that the progression portion of Blizzard's games is far easier than a lot of other games on the market.  Again, I hope I'm wrong and WoW has the long-term appeal that EQ has already proven. <br />
<br />

I agree, SOE is not very professional and really doesn't care about their customers.  On the other hand, they do crank out content fast enough to keep people coming back.  Does Blizzard have the ability to do both?<br />
<br />
End of 2004 is still predicted release.  It makes zero sense to do a stress test, and then let that equipment sit idle for long.  There are indeed many products which do not reach fruition. Logic does not support that conclusion in this case.<br />
The stress test is a good sign but I'd still like to see a real release date announced.  End of 2004 is getting pretty damn close.<br />
<br />
Don't take my cynicism to mean that I don't want WoW to succeed.  I would love to see a new game that has the long term viability of EQ but with more stability, more polish, and less mindless grinding.  It's just that years of seeing promising games suck ass and years of experience dealing with the realities of software programming have jaded me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I understand your cynicism, in fact, it's really easy to be cynical about new games.  In fact, I anticipate Vanguard to be a steaming pile of shit.  Some people are putting their hopes on a man who's rigidity in EQ was completely uncalled for, and I for one, don't wish to go back to that type of game.<br />
<br />
However, I've seen the product, it looks good, the content works, the quests work, and there's already shitloads of lore in the warcraft universe.  We don't need to be force fed stupid campaigns to the moon or going to places named by mashing your hand on the keyboard anymore.  That's appealing to me.  I found Tyrande Whisperwind in Darnassus, and I found evidence in quests that Malfurion Stormrage is missing.  That right there speaks volumes to me about this game.  I'm not going to be killing mobs just because they exist.  What a change.<br />
<br />
I understand your skepticisim, I'm just attemping to be optimistic about the game.  And it's substantiated optimisim.  For me, it's the light at the end of the tunnel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">One thing folks seem ot be forgetting.  While Blizzard might be new to MMORPG's, they aren't virgins to online gaming.  Even if you disregard warcraft, Diablo 1 came out in '91 and STILL had a strong following of players almost 10 years later when Diablo II hit the stores  Diablo II will be going strong for a good while to come.<br />
<br />
Sure, Diablo isn't in the same dynamic as EQ or WOW, but if they can keep people playing for 13+ years on a series when their providing servers and support for free, I can only imagine the lengths they'll go to to ensure that a monthly per pay game blows everyones expectations out of the water and keeps them hooked twice as long.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind, I haven't hit the non-raider ceiling yet and I still very much enjoy EQ, but i know that cieling is out there.  When WoW comes out, If that ceiling doesn't lift by a big enough margin to keep me on an doable upgrade path i'm off to greener pastures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any case though the Diablo series and battle.net have been around for a fair number of years, certainly far longer than some of its competition back then.  The general point remains the same though.<br />
<br />
If they can keep folks interested in a game for multiple years for free its gonna be interesting to see what they come up with when its being paid for and theres more incentive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Riiight, because i'm doing such high endgame content in EQ right?<br />
<br />
Umm isn't this entire point of this thread that you are doing the hard content, pushing your group further than any group of normal or casual gamers would. <br />
<br />
And heck we are 65th--which per SOE is past where most players are going. <br />
<br />
Frankly I would call pushing your nose into anything past BoT on that level--where you start needing full ornate or breaking into EP level stats or quality time in VT. <br />
<br />
So yeah you are pushing it. <br />
<br />
And you sure do have a lot of passion for EQ...<br />
<br />
That said, yeah if the hype machine had not doen me in, the fact that I have found one other game than EQ to keep on coming back to it (PlanetSide of all things) does make me dubious that anyone can do a MMOG right--especially mutipul times. <br />
<br />
What would consern me most about a Blizzard game is their ability to get expantions out timely. Have they made any deadline within 2 years of its original projection?<br />
<br />
Frankly I hope you find WoW sucks after enough time... I think TSW is farm more interesting with you around playing EQ. But if not, have fun!<br />
<br />
Oh speaking of Battle.net...do remember how badly the game where hacked when they came out. And I think UO had already seen that happen so the problem was known (if not obvious without seeing it in action). <br />
<br />
Yes the fact that they run battle.net is a positive and probably means they will avoid some of the problems that say EQ had on launch with bad routers, but that does not make them proof from mistakes either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Well, you also have to realize that Blizzard spawned Bnet kiddies.

Just because they've made online games doesn't mean that they've cultivated a group of quality players from an enjoyable environment. That aside, I've enjoyed the heck out of Warcraft 1-3, Starcraft and both Diablos. I know that, at very least, WoW won't be some rushed, underfunded game. They'll take their time and put out content that is poorly tested.</div></div><hr />

Very true, blizzard release dates are more often than not pushed back.<br />
<br />
However it can also be said that blizzard has never had a royal snafu on release.<br />
<br />
Would you not have rather waited 6 more weeks for GoD to release and avoided all the initial problems?  its a small price to pay for a better quality product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but thats more the product of haveing a free gaming system.  If you dont charge a cover at the door, retards are gonna wander in.  Every game has their snerts, its a hard thing to stop.<br />
<br />
But look at the flipside, D1 was hacked beyond oblivion, they learned from their mistakes and D2 was impossible to crack, and they added in a hardcore system to give more replay value. Blizzard is really going to decimate the ranks of macroquesters if they keep true to form.  And that will help keep the economy balanced for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Oh I certainly agree with that, but if you are done with the current content wait 3-6 months for Blizzard to get the next expantion done can be painful. <br />
<br />
I know that EQ was a bit dull when I hit 50th and about as uber as I could get (crafted + bit of Potato armor, FBSS and dual Yaks)--and I for one started alting. But I am sure people left then. And the same could happen. Of course that is probably borrowing problems for WoW at this point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Well maybe not impossible, but theres no way the hacked characters, hacked items and clicky instant kills in dungeons or towns were as rampant in D2 as in D1.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Are you kidding me Daggorr? D2 was severely and constantly hacked. Unless you were playing on the official, characters serverside not client side server (I think there was something like that, I forget), you had to deal with all sorts of nasty hacks. You know, untargetable characters killing you and whatnot. Anyhow, hacking the game doesn't even come in to play when you're talking about a game where all important info is kept server side. You'd have to hack directly into Blizzard's servers, and that's not very likely at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What really kind of did it for me was all the characters you had to redo because they're were constantly changing things.  I liked the fact that they DID support the game and continue to update it.  But to have a really fun character get nerfed into unplayability just got old.  The expansion finally opened the way for a viable frenzy/leap attack barb, which was actually a fair amount of fun.  But by that time things were pretty stale and no amount of new and off the wall character combos could keep my interest.<br />
<br />
I never tried open Bnet because it was just an invitation to constant frustration.  Learned that from Diablo 1.<br />
<br />
I haven't checked into WoW at all, but given Blizzard's track record, they definitely intend to provide some awesome support for the game.<br />

The ONLY place I found refuge was with Falcon4, and European Air War online.  The learning curve for both games is tremendous.  The Bnet kiddies usually ended up as lawndarts and gave up.  Both games had tremendous player support, but virtually zero from the producers.</div></div><hr />
