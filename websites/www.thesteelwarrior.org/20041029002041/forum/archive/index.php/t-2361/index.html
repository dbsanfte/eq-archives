<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried Mudwalker ring last night and basically had to zerg it first try =( had 57 people which is pretty good for our guild. We did fine until boss spawned muddites. Does Aeing them work ? or is it normal to lose 30% of raid force by just concentrating on boss and burning him down ? was a fun event and a good break from Air from which we have been living in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few chanters with AE mez should be able to lock them down. <br />
<br />
But yes, we also usually lose a few people at this stage, mostly casters to primary agro from mudwalker himself though.<br />
<br />
If your chanters are asleep or not prepared for the muddite spawn then it can easily go down the way you describe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i think our strongest point in guild is Encs, they were using WoM chain on em. his gay ass AE root didnt help either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ez to ae, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i figured it would be an AE thing, mobs had no hps and boss was rootable. Forgot if they spawned on pull or at a certain %. Was a crazy ring for first try though cant wait to do again =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AE mez or just AEing them to death both work well for the muddites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kill them all, exept 1.<br />
<br />
It will prevent other mudite from poping. (at least works for us)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We just AE the mess of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are you talking about the splitters in the mud ring? The first ones you can AE but the Gorgers need offtanked.<br />
<br />
As for the boss, the Monstrous Mudwalker or his ph (a merciless mudwalker) there are no adds at all. Assume you mean the ring mobs and not the boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">12 or so &quot;A Muddite Mudling&quot; spawn during final boss. At least for us they do.<br />
<br />
The ones that split from Sludge Lurkers are called &quot;A Muck Mudlet&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">never seen the little mudlites spawn on the final boss, we normally pull to zone so maybe its a distance issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, interesting. And yes we usually just follow the zone wall and kill it all pretty close to mudwalker temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">never seen the little mudlites spawn on the final boss, we normally pull to zone so maybe its a distance issue. <br />
<br />
You just happen to have non retarded pullers!</div></div><hr />

We pull him to zone as well, and we do get the little adds sometimes.  They look to be spawned where Mudwalker is, but I can't say for sure.  The first few times I did this event they weren't there, but people were expecting them.  The last few we've done it, they did show up.  We just assume they'll be there :p<br />
<br />
But they're all mezzable, so it's not bad if they do show up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yep I stand corrected. Did Mud ring last night and had the little adds on the boss spawn. First time I have ever seen that though so maybe it was bugged before *shrug* Anyway, they spawn now on both named and ph for mud ring but they arent hard to deal with really, just a shock when not expecting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, muddites are a timed pop, he spawns them 5-10 minutes once hes aggro.. fought him with like 30(with like 10 rooted oor) once and it took so long to do we had another set pop on us at 30%, we had mezzed the first set so the next group really screwed it up.</div></div><hr />
