If thats out of the price range a Solstice earing would be an upgrade and can put them together for sub 4k on my server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">all depends on the coin ya got badaan.<br />
tear of the rainmaker is 75-100K...bloodmetal earrings 50-70K or so....good neck item is that black something or other collar ( look for wandor's warrior profile for the exact name ) which i only saw for sale once on my server for 20K....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">50-70k for a bloodmetal ear? Dear god, those are 19-22k on nameless bwahaha.<br />
<br />
I also advise ya to get a solstice ear, 5ac 5sta 55hp and saves is nice, only problem is you cant resell it when/if you upgrade further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barlaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Black Plated Collar is a nice neck item that drops in Tactics.  Just got one the other night in Tactics so not sure what the plat price would be.<br />

Slot: NECK<br />
AC: 11<br />
STR: +15 DEX: +10 STA: +10 AGI: +10 HP: +85 MANA: +65<br />
Recommended level of 56.<br />

Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD MNK BRD ROG BST<br />
Race: ALL That is nice, but will be expensive. I will look for it.<br />
<br />
There are alot of earrings out there.. I need to find the best one for the money, because it doesn't look like it's going to be cheap upgrading the Black Sapphire Earring.<br />
<br />
These are some guesstimates on how much real hp/ac I will get, listed in order from least $ to most $ (kinda).<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice: 10ac 85hp<br />
Mosquito Leg Earring: 17ac 107hp<br />
Shiny Cog Earring: 10ac 80hp<br />
Iron Cog Earring: 20ac 100hp<br />
Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement: 16ac 118hp<br />
Arachnid Antennae: 10ac 112hp<br />
Lizard Tooth Earring: 12ac 123hp<br />
Lizard Bone Earring: 4ac 130hp<br />
<br />
Anything past the Bloodmetal is just too expensive. 30k+ on an Earring just seems silly, maybe later.<br />
<br />
I like the CT Cog Earrings, but they are 20k+ and that would be tough to afford. I've camped the sewers alot and haven't had any luck with a Mosquito Earring (which goes for ~16k).<br />
<br />
I will most likely end up with the Solstice Earring or -maybe- a Mosquito Earring, simply because they are the cheapest.<br />
<br />
But I still like the Cog earrings, could a 65dru 63cle 63war 60shm 60war and maybe 60wiz or 60pal do it?</div></div><hr />
