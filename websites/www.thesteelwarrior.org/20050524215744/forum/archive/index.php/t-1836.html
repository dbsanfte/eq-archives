I'm pretty sure he didn't either.<br />

If we sit back and say, &quot;Would you care to look into class balancing? People have been sending feedback for a long time about it and we'd really like it fixed. So when you get the chance and you're not busy making lvl 4 armor Gnome Shadowknight quests, would you think about class balancing?&quot;<br />
<br />
That will get us nowhere.<br />
<br />
The best way is to demand shit be done. If they want our money, at least make it fair for everyone. Everyone has their role, now make it happen, devs.</div></div><hr />

A strike though, a warrior walkout.  If it could be corridinated and really carried out that would get their attention.  Hit them where it hurts the most, the bank.  Personally I respond to threats that remove product from my company better than I do name calling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Petitions only work because there is some kind of threat implied such as voting for the other guy or taking your bussiness elsewehre.<br />
<br />
Threatening with nasty letters is childish. Threatening with a sit in strike, a cancellation of accounts (aka we all cancell our accounts at the same time of the same evening), or mixtures of these AS A GROUP will get their attention in no uncertain terms.<br />
<br />
We just need to start picking dates and advertising them.</div></div><hr />

Think about the number of warriors out there that never even read this message board...<br />
<br />
A petition would be ignored (or so they say). However, I've noticed things change soon after petitions are raised.<br />
<br />
By far the fastest way to make an impact is to get popular press coverage over &quot;angst in the online gaming community over class inequity&quot; or something. That kind of attention gets pressure from people in Sony above SoE.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think the problem facing the developers and designers is that they have a TON of resources invested in making LDoN and what resources they have left for our problems today are woefully insufficient. Further, I'm sure management will not support adding the resources necessary to fix this.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure how big it was or how many others remember it, but no long after that we got criticals and beserk and the first of our HP buffs (I think).

If I understood correctly of course, if not I apologize but, wouldn't that kind of get attention?  contact EQCastersrealm and tell them to put something up about our complaints?  Or Allakhazams?

<br />
Of course the repricussions from other classes saying god knows what would be inevitable.  But is it possible?  Do we have &quot;contacts&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first Weekend Warrior Walkout was cause becuase we had less than 1 hit from an xp giving mob HP advantage, no skill advantage, and since no armor advantage on rangers. (About 50 HP in the high teens to 20th).<br />
<br />
Warriors, were quite accurately, rangers without spells but with kick. And no unique anything. <br />
<br />
I mean this happened in the dark ages of EQ. About the time they halved the XP loss from death. (Nothing like loosing a full yellow at 16th!) And the time of the first 50th (a rogue, uberly decked out in full Rubi--and I have no clue how he got to 50th with such massive XP loss.) I think he even had a SBD too. :p.</div></div><hr />

What is the point of paladins and shadowknights if there is not some situation in which they tank better than warriors? Is the definition of their class supposed to be: Well shit if they can't find a warrior, you'll fill in.&quot;<br />

They should be fill in tanks for when there is no warrior.  I realize that the game has changed considerably since release, but in the beginning, Knights were secondary tanks, who made up for lack of pure tanking ability with increased utility.  The fact that they could do so many things that we can't was a tradeoff, they couldnt tank nearly as well as we could, but they could still tank.  Now there is NO significant tradeoff. Knights get to be damn near as good as warriors at the only thing warriors do, and get to have the benefits of being a caster, albeit a somewhat weak caster.</div></div><hr />

The trouble is that currently, pallies and SK's tank better 95 % ofthe time.  The situation has become 'Well shit if they can't find a knight, a warrior will have to do'.</div></div><hr />

Actually it should be &quot;let's find a tank war, pal or sk will do the first to come&quot;. no &quot;any pal or sk lfg ? no ? let's take this war then&quot;<br />
<br />
it should be just like damage dealers in xp groups, interchangeable, when tanking is concerned. also there are specific abilities :<br />
- Warriors : the best for tanking bosses and named, due to their mitigation advantage and disciplines.<br />
- pals : usefull for added group hp buff, and occasional back healing. can also group very well with druids (po9+symbol+BSS, rez, CH...).<br />
- sk : useful to pull and great group taps. should be the best hand down at locking or giving aggro.</div></div><hr />

My 53 Palladin twink so outsolo's and outtanks in groups my Warrior when he was 53 that it's sick.  A 53 Warrior isn't in the same league by any stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
This situation gets even more pronounced at level 65. The only thing that saves me is often people want to go after mini-named and are looking for a tank that can handle getting slapped silly.<br />
<br />
Sure Warriors are needed in raids, but have you compared raid experiance with solo and group exp? I'm sitting at about 125AA with every Necro, Wizard, Druid, Ranger, Shaman, Rogue, and SK I know announcing &quot;Ding! 354AA!!&quot;<br />
<br />
With many healers 2-boxing their melee twinks and just about every other class able to solo the only thing I can imagine helping would be an AA ability - summon Cleric Companion.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I'm soloing so I have to heal up for the next mob. &lt;sings&gt; &quot;99 Right-Clicks of the BP to gooo, 99 Right-Clicks to gooooo....&quot;<br />

<br />
How about a write-in strike?<br />
<br />
We work up a list of things we want for the warrior class. And on the same day, all warrior players, send emails in, preferably at the same time. <br />
<br />
No, it wouldn't force them to do anything. But, it sure as heck would get their attention!!!!!<br />
<br />
We would need to coordinate it well, discuss what points we want to make. Perhaps have a draft email. And then all use our right to send legitimate email into Sony. <br />
<br />
The surge in emails is going to garner attention. And if it doesn't, we do it again. and again, and again....<br />
<br />
It's just a thought, but it beats doing nothing!!!!<br />

I cannot remember for how long the warrior apps for the top guilds have been closed, now the top european guild on TT is recruiting a warrior again.<br />
If our own roster shows a trend, the top guilds are in trouble.<br />
6 warriors who raid regularly, one who is a very casual player but still in guild as he was one of the founding members and although we are a raiding guild we still are rather close.<br />
17 knights currently on roster.<br />
I dont think we even had a warrior app the last months, only knights.</div></div><hr />
