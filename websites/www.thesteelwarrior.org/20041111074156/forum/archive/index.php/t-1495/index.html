<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nigaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading this board since i started a warrior alt and especially the warrior is broken arguments. I have seen suggestions for new AAs and hig end gear to correct the problem but this would not solve the problem for the warriors that are below 51. <br />
<br />
I was parsing my log from my latest outing. A group of four of us was hunting it was me a warrior, a shadowknight, a rouge and a chanter and i thought i would present an interesting case from the lower level warriors perspective here.<br />
<br />
The rouge and me is level 31 and SK was level 30. As for our respective gear i would say that it is roughly equal with the rouge having sligtly better gear than me and the SK slightly worse.<br />
<br />
A roamer wanders into our camp. The chanter is of course AFK for this fight.<br />

[Mon Jun 23 03:15:34 2003] a Lteth Val Gnoll's corpse says 'My comrades will avenge my death.'<br />
<br />
Final damage. Me 325, SK 291, Rouge: 266 (with reservation for calculation errors)<br />
<br />
So in this figt i did more damage that the SK and the Rogue. I succeded(?) whith 2 taunts and the mob tried to hit me exactly ZERO times.<br />
<br />
So what conclusions can i draw from this? It is an isolated fight but the trend is the same for the rest of the fights in the log. I get very little aggro, but still does the most damage of all three most of the time. I constantly loose aggro even when outdamaging the others and no spells are cast. The only time i seemed to be able to get some constant aggro was when i taunted a mob several times before breaking a mez. And even then i loose the aggro frequently. If the SK had been using his spells i would have had an even harder time getting any aggro. My conclusion is that i was unable to hold both snap and sustained aggro.<br />
<br />
Yes, the warrior is badly broken and in need of some sort of fix and this fix needs to be viable for warriors both below and above 50.<br />
<br />
I am sure that those of you that have played a warrior for longer than me can come up with better suggestions than i can. My point here is that the below 50 warrior is in as much need of a fix as the +50.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's clear to me in this instance that the Shadowknight you were grouping with was Taunting as well.  That's probably why he was holding taunt over you.</div></div><hr />

Here i have done 6 attacks, 4 of them succesfully for a total of 106 damage. The SK has done 2 attacks for 38 damage. He still has the aggro. Still no spells cast at all. <br />
<br />
Actually the SK was HIT for 38, he didn't hit for 38.  So far his contribution to the fight is 3 whiffs and a parry.  Do you have spell messages on? I find it hard to believe that you taunt successfuly, the SK taunts successfuly, you then hit for 6, 14, 14, 41 and 37, but the SK still has aggro without casting.<br />
<br />
And since the SK isn't casting -- he's a warrior.  Especially since this is a below 50 scenario with all the same skill caps and so on.  Weird example, but doesn't show anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i have spell messages on. And I DO think this shows something. The SK is acting like a warrior here, exactly like a warrior. A warrior that is 1 level lower than me at this point, and he holds the aggro throught the fight. If he then begins to cast spells he got the aggro. If he starts casting his stun i would have little chance to taunt the mob away from him.  So to me this proves trhat a SK acting like a warrior performs EXACTLY as a warrior, that is that the warrior has no dicernable advantage at this level at all over the SK. If he then begins to use his spells the warrior is left way behind. <br />
<br />
And yes! We do taunt the mob of each others but then i had a look at this part of the log:<br />
<br />
[Mon Jun 23 03:15:32 2003] a Lteth Val Gnoll says 'I'll teach you to interfere with me Nigaka.'<br />
[Mon Jun 23 03:15:32 2003] Rogue tries to pierce a Lteth Val Gnoll, but misses!<br />

[Mon Jun 23 03:15:33 2003] A Lteth Val Gnoll tries to hit Shadowknight, but misses!<br />
<br />
Now here i do a sucessful taunt. The SK does NOT succed with a taunt but still holds the aggro.<br />
<br />
This was one of the shorter fights in the log and that is the reason that i choose it. There where other fights where i did hold aggro from time to time, but i still less than the two others. My feeling of the fights this evening was that the SK was the MT and all i contributed to the group was some damage. Two shadowknights or a SK and a PAL  would have done a better job of it. <br />
<br />
Now what would a group looking for a tank choose? The SK or the warrior? In my mind the answer is pretty clear. <br />
<br />
Now i am not saying that the Shadowknight should be nerfed, far from it. The warrior needs &quot;something&quot; to give him some value that he could bring to a group. As i see it the Warrior is the second or third choice for groups looking for tanks today.<br />
<br />
Not that i am abandining my warrior. Far from it. It is a nice change for me to play a character that CAN'T cast spells. :)<br />

<br />
Well below 50 this is true due to skill caps - rangers don't really start falling behind until level 30 as itemization starts to catch up to them either.  I'm not sure what you intend to prove, but if the above is it, it's already well known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice simple explination by looking at the kind of dmg you are dealing and the kind of dmg the SK is dealing, it's pretty safe to assume that you were Duel wielding and the SK had a 2 hander. Well a little over a year ago SK's and Paladins after ages of whining finally got an answer to their complaints about maintaining agro in groups basically they wanted agro WITHOUT using spells, so Verant upped the amount of agro gained by using 2 hand weapons. so now 2 hand weapons get significantly more agro then duel wielding does. but the comon belief is still faster=better with agro, this is no longer true, 2 handers do agro better!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If he starts casting his stun i would have little chance to taunt the mob away from him. <br />
<br />
Do you understand how taunt works?<br />
<br />
He could cast his stun forever, literally he could stand there for hours stunning the mob, days even, and with one push of the taunt button (assuming it's successful) you would immidiatly get agro.<br />
<br />
Honestly you probably wouldn't of had any problems holding agro if the SK wasn't trying to hold agro aswell. In my day we would of just booted him from the group and got somebody that would atleast try to control their agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So to me this proves trhat a SK acting like a warrior performs EXACTLY as a warrior, that is that the warrior has no dicernable advantage at this level at all over the SK.

<br />
Um, so you are saying that with similar skill caps, an SK using the same skills as a warrior performs similarly? Yup, he will. This is not news. At your level, the &quot;discernable&quot; differences are in hps, and the fact that you can dual wield (which at your level still makes a difference).<br />
<br />
And SKs don't stun, paladins do. SKs use darkness spells primarily for aggro.</div></div><hr />
