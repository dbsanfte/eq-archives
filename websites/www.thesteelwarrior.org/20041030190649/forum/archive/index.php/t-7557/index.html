There are items you can get that are pretty much equivalent to deity-specific armor although cultural armor is nice because it's cheap.<br />
<br />
Ornate is pretty much on par with cultural armor with the exception of wrists and possibly boots (been awhile since I compared).<br />
<br />
You can also look into other types of player-made armor like Farwater (requires mob drops in EPs).<br />
<br />
Or do Tak LDoNs for the plate armor there (don't discount the armor that drops in hard LDoNs either).<br />
<br />
I'm agnostic and I was surpassed for awhile by friends sporting cultural armor, back in the day when there was no LDoN and any agnostic armor was either very hard to find, or sub-par to what I already had.<br />
<br />
It really is a lot easier to get different gear these days, and I'm able to feel no qualms when I participate in steamrollering gods because I don't pretend to worship them :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll be fine.  The best stuff in the game, armor wise, comes from raids, not cultural armor.  And the Takish armor is nothing to be sneezed at!  It may take a little more work or plat, but you can gear yourself out just as well as twink_RZ_worshipper_12345096.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's a stage in the game where cultural armor lends non twinks an advantage.For us it was a an important  factor in who tanked during Velious and most of Luclin.In vt the advantage wore thin and more or less vanishes by early EP's in a dkp guild.This was on Stromm when gear was hard to come by and none of us were twinked.<br />
<br />
It'd be easy to make a warrior with full ornate when they reach req level now for ep people.<br />
<br />
As above I wouldn't worry about it now.The disadvantages will likely soon pass. :)</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, Caldron, when I looked, you were nekkid, no armor whatsoever...guessing since it's authentic magelo, you died recently.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe. :)  LDON changed the equation for agnostic warriors as well.We have a kitty tank who bemoaned the lack of cultural armor until very recently.For raid tanks the hp/ac comparison thingy could be tough early on for agnostics.Although,due to difficulty and time involved farming components most of our warriors didn't get much cultural armor until well into luclin/pop when more cultural became available and they could afford to buy pieces.<br />
<br />
People without cash these days would probably prefer LDON.I remember one time handin over enough supplies to make 4 pieces and getting one back after fails from a gm geerlok smith who made rz armor a lot.It was quite painful hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meanfred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I appreciate your comments, I think according to you guys, I am going to spend alot more time in Nro LDoN.  It seems that they have a mean BP, and other plate armor.  If anyone knows the lowest point requirement for this armor set, please let me know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The alternative to North LDoN armor set (all 1492 points) has been the Everfrost LDoN armor set (all 760 points)...you will give up some hp/ac and minor stats for reducing the # of wins required to get armor.  It really depends on how fast you earn points, how likely you'll be to upgrade beyond either of these sets and what interests you at the time.<br />
<br />
Currently, however, there is another 1492 option that the development team leaked out too soon, it does not require points in any particular theme that I am aware of...and is very comparable (possibly, slightly better melee stats) than the North Ro armor set.  The warning with this, is, the devs may nerf the stats (or improve them, even).<br />
<br />
In the (near?) future, there has been talk about a better armor set than the current 1492...and questions as to whether LDoN bought armor will be redeemable for partial point refund.  This is all speculation of course, until any of it makes it to the live server.  Given that a level 65 gets 51 points per normal ldon win that takes at least 30 min for a really good group (not counting time to get adventure, time to form group, time to buff before going into dungeon) to a more normal average of 60+ minutes, it will take you some time to save up enough points for either armor.  A hard LDoN is 105? points for a win, but is really more like nightmare versus normal than 'hard', from what I hear, lol...um, and is much more likely to take close to the full 90 minutes for a win or end up with a partial.<br />
<br />
If you want armor semi-quick and have most of the faction necessary, consider farming armor drops in Kael / HoT / NToV.  There is no racial requirement, but it is no drop and requires faction with Thurg / CoV / Kael respectively...and scales from easy to kill, but rare drops to hard to kill, but with a decent drop rate (of course, not all the drops will be plate, etc.).<br />
<br />
That being said, either of the 760 or 1492 armor, will blow most of the armor away (excluding doze quests).  Decisions, decisions, decisions!<br />
<br />
P.S.  The BP I'm wearing in magelo, is the Tak/NRo/RA (all various ways of referring to the same) BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i remember a few years ago being told that making an iksar warrior was foolish for one obvious reason .. they cant wear cobalt.<br />
<br />
and see how much difference that makes now?<br />
<br />
likewise the time will come when you wonder why you were so worried about the deity specific armor. and dont expect the difference in stats to make much difference even now. better armor makes a better tank but not that much better. leapfrog over the cultural armor you couldnt buy today and shortly you will forget the minor loss.</div></div><hr />
