<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, I understand that this is a warrior forum and that posting about a class other than warrior is entirely constructive. However, this is a community of players who's opinions and observations I've come to respect. I know many of you are testing WoW right now and many others that have participated in the stress test and have some understanding of how the class and how it works. I understand that the hunter class wasn't introduced very long ago and is still in need of much feedback and tuning.<br />
<br />
It is this reason that feel that my observations are most valuable in a crucial point in this classes development. I'm without anohter outlet for public feedback since the stress test forum was closed. I'm going to assume this was an oversight on blizzards part and that they really do want feedback from the testers. It takes a while for my to gather my thoughts and evaluate things so I found that by the time I had enough to say, the forum had already closed.<br />
<br />
I understand that a few of us here have closed beta accounts. If someone would be so kind as to cross post this to the hunter forum, it would be greatly appreciated. With all that said, I'll get to the meat of this discussion.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to start with general feedback and then move into various specific topics of concern to me. I played the stress test nearly non-stop throughout the whole test. Mainly the only time that I was away was because the servers were down or a few time I simply couldn't play anymore without sleep. In which case, I got a couple of hours and was at it again. I have no life so I can and often play this was with various games. Games are my passion, especially MMOs and RPGs.<br />
<br />
General bugs/observations<br />
<br />
This game is in great shape. Especially the back end server structure/performance. This game is baby smooth. I could have probably counted on one hand the number of time that I experienced lag that was attributable to server performance. I experienced few client crashes. Those times I did, as with the lag, I used the /bug tool to report those incidents, so those are documented. I was very impressed. I've done beta tests before, but this really didn't even seem like it was a beta.<br />
<br />
The most obvious problems I had were the repeated errors I received while exiting the  game. This bears repeating even though I reported it because it happened every single time I closed the game, no matter which method I used. I'm sure this is an easy bug to fix because it occurred so consistently. There are multiple crash reports from my my machine, I'm sure they'll be no problem fixing the crash in a timely fashion.<br />
<br />
Another problem I noticed was that mobs were getting stuck in-game and not despawning, and giving no debug spam in chat, so I really have no idea what was going on there. These mobs were easily definable by the 100% evasion that was experienced if you tried to attack them. This seemed to occur most frequently in places were mobs had a small spawn/pathing area in which it would travel when not in combat or had static positioning. I don't ever remember seeing any wandering mobs with this problem. I noticed a few wandering mobs that were having pathing problem, but they always despawned with the debug spam in local chat.<br />
<br />
A related problem I noticed was with recently spawned mobs. Especially aggressive mobs it was most notable. When first spawning in, if you attacked they would often start evading as if stuck then after a few seconds the AI would kick in and they would defend themselves and return the attack and combat would resume as normal. I'm assuming that the AI is not properly synchronized with the spawning engine, or not properly being reported as active in the world yet? Thats what seems like is going on despite how the game actually works.<br />
<br />
Spell effects, such as nukes and warlock drains were not properly ending there path on target. Many times the graphic would go flying through the world with no caster in proximity nor a target there either. It would simply continue its path across the world until out of sight, seemingly across the entire zone.<br />
<br />
Often time I would attack a mob but they would run away out of sight, but begin damaging my character while the whole time being out of sight. This includes melee attacks as well as ranged melee and spells. I would be unable to return the attack because the client would return that the mob was out of range or not in line of sight, usually the former.<br />
<br />
I experienced the endless agro bug with passive hunter pets.<br />
<br />
Many ranged mobs do not have proper range values on their attacks. Especially noticeable with the Defias mage types in Westfall.<br />
<br />
Agro ranges seem to be inconstant on many human mobs, again defias bandits, in Westfall. I'm unsure if this is intended, but sometimes you could expect to get 1 or 2, other time the whole farm house would come after you. I couldn't really tell what was going on despite wasting a lot of time trying to figure it out.<br />
<br />
The rest of the problem I found were mostly inconsistent itemization, jumpy level progression in quests in certain level ranges, and lack of quest rewards for the various classes. These things I have full confidence that they will be addressed in due time, but it does bear mentioning. Often time I would complete a quest and get a lesser reward than the previous quest offered. Moving from Darnasus to Darkshore isn't very smooth, you end up traveling back and forth many times to train and buy/sell. Late teen progression in quests at darkshore is nonexistent. You are left moving on without guidance to find a suitable area or grinding the last few levels to help you complete the quest progression there. Grinding sucks, you've done a great job trying to remove it from the game, when you confront it, it sticks out like a sore thumb. Many quest would only have rewards for a select few armor types. Often times there would be rewards to choose for mail or leather, but no cloth, or another variation. Since almost everyone is doing the quests despite class and the fact that you can't sell the reward, there should suitable rewards for each class type. There's lots of cooking recipe quests, however, very few for the other professions. Weapon selection from quests is poor, again, there should be more choices of equal value.<br />
<br />
Hunter class specific<br />
<br />
I played a few different classes. I started with a warrior, in fact I leveled 2, one orc, one tauren, to test starting content. I played them both to about 10 or so. I also played a warlock to get a feeling for the caster side of things. Mainly however, I found the hunter class to enjoyable to resist, so indulged. This is a great skill class with many tactical options and great soloability. I leveled this one to 25 by the time the servers shutdown. The Night elf Michael Jackson dance was irresistible.<br />
<br />
Hunter specials<br />
<br />
In general, hunters have very little mana and the spells cost way too much mana.<br />
<br />
The attack que is screwy. Ranged special should fire on the next attack like melee specials. Currently you get the whatever “busy” error and it becomes a chore to time specials between fires. I'm sure this is a bug.<br />
<br />
Arcane shot  -  bread and butter, good damage. Recast is a little slow for burst DPS and all ranks are on the same timer to remove the possibility of working around that somewhat. Again, cost a bunch of many to cast and often times in a fast pull situation the hunter is left doing mediocre damage while the other dps classes continue at the same rate. The lack of regen to sustain our dps really hurts us. You can only carry so much drink.<br />
<br />
Concussion shot – Marginally useful spell, the agro mod is useful for pulling agro off your pet or the healer. 2 second snare is about useless though. I have something else to add about this later.<br />
<br />
Stings – The dot is decent a at the level it introduced, but like arcane shot cost too much mana, and doesn't scale as you level. Leaving you very weak right before its time to receive an upgrade. This make those levels very hard. Additionally, the strength debuff sting is unnoticeable. Is this thing working?<br />
<br />
Aspects – One aspect at a time although novel, really serves no purpose. Monkey is of suspect value and Hawks effect only slightly noticeable, and only in conjunction with hunters mark does the effect become apparent.<br />
<br />
Aspect of the cheetah – this one deserves its own point. This spell is about useless. The stun hurts more than the buff provides benefit. The speed increase is only marginal, but the stun WILL get you killed if you happen to land agro and aren't quick enough to remove it. I suggest it be put in line with the other travel forms. We can't kite mobs with it even without the stun. You have to be still to shoot, which is annoying in its self, but we'll live. Mobs already run fast enough to catch you in cheetah, so whats the point? This one like Monkey goes to the back of the spell book.<br />
<br />
Raptor strike - bread and butter, again, too much mana. Doesn't scale with levels. Recast is too slow for finishing off mobs, even if you had the mana.<br />
<br />
Wing clip – useful tool, great for keeping those runners at bay, however I doubt its 50% reduction in speed. Great for shrugging off agro while you travel. Simply hit this when you get attack and it slows the mob long enough for you to get a lead enough to loose agro.<br />
<br />
Disengage – bread and butter, since we aren't tanks, we dont need agro. However, mana issues are limiting and the agro reduction is small, ofter requiring many casts to lose even the smallest agro.<br />
<br />
Mongoose – completely useless, hard to time, same damage as raptor and nearly the same cost. Might as well chain raptor, theres not reason to use this. Maybe it is was a passive ability, 100% accuracy, or much lower cost. Unless is was passive i'm quite sure I wouldn't use this. Maybe make this a buff cast in combat to make the next dodge automatically fire this ability? That might be useful.<br />
<br />
Eagle eye - fairly useful, can be a little screwy sometimes with the camera angles, but I found myself using it quite often in unknown dungeon situations.<br />
<br />
Eye of the beast? - useless, limited range, still agros mobs, nothing more than novelty at the moment.<br />
<br />
Others - Theres a few others i beleive like the inspect one that tell you beast lore. Maybe useful under some unknown situation that I haven't encountered yet, I haven't seen a use yet other that inspecting other pets. The share senses one doesn't seem to do anything either. Maybe it hasn't been fully implimented yet.<br />
<br />
Overall  – This can't be stated enough. Too little mana regen, too high cost spells, too little mana pool severely limits the DPS that this class can do, never mind maintain. Recasts further reduce the burst DPS so that avenue is useless. Hunters are going to get groups for DPS, currently that DPS is lacking.<br />
<br />
Alternate solution – In an unrelated problem, due to our dual nature of melee, melle ranged, and spells. Hunters are in short supply of hot button space on that crucial 1 row. I suggest combing the spells into one set and reduce the total number of spell which must be bought and placed on the hotbar.<br />
<br />
Combine the like special from ranged and melee. Raptor strike should be merged with arcane shot. This remove the problem of the target being to close while trying to fire arrows. If there isn't enough room, when the mobs moves to close the hunter seamlessly moves to melee specials using the same set of specials. They should work both ranged and up close. This halves the required first bar of space. This has the added effect of keeping the hunter viable with his full range of special even if he runs out of arrows, which happens quite often on long instances.<br />
<br />
So the specials would be:<br />
<br />
Burst DPS (raptor strike/arcane shot)<br />
Stings (the various stings along with melee equivalents)<br />
Snare (modified concussion/wing clip /w perhaps a hate bonus)<br />
De taunt (Disengage and ranged version for hate reduction)<br />
<br />
This removes a lot of the redundancy in the specials. I also suggest over writing the lower rank version in the spell book like what happens when you train warrior styles and growl for the pet.<br />
<br />
Pet stuff<br />
<br />
There should be some clarity on how pets work. Personally, I think all pets should have the same stats when tamed. However over time we could train them with different stats and abilities learned from other animals.<br />
<br />
There is no clarity now whether elite pets should have better stats than regular mobs. Currently, some do, some done. Ol' Scooty has better damage than regular pets as do a few other elites. I'm unsure if this is proper or intended.<br />
<br />
Pets shouldn't change size as they grow. There should be more small pets, those big bears get in the way in crowed instances and dungeons crawls.<br />
<br />
Pet leveling serves no function. It just makes it s chore to train up a lower level pet that you like the looks of.<br />
<br />
Feeding is an annoyance at best. I can't see the opportunity for this to enhance game play, just like with pet leveling. It just seems to be a neat idea that really doesn't work out right in practice.<br />
<br />
For gods sake close my bears mouth. Its got to be dry.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of training learned abilities, Pokemon style, from pet to pet. It really makes find and acquiring new pets as you travel an interesting side game.<br />
<br />
Not being able to tame an animal except when your current pet is stabled is annoying. Maybe we could cage the beast in the wild with our current pet and then later tame it or something like that? Traveling to nowhere again to pick up a neat animal in rough country is very dangerous for such a weak class as a hunter. Most of our abilities hinge on our pet taking up the slack.<br />
<br />
We should be able to train different stats such as better damage vs armor, resistance vs avoidance, things like that. Maybe how a system where you can modify the pets current stats by spending point on either specials for the pet, when they are put in the game, and migrating say intelligence or stamina for strength for a DPS pet or other possibilities.<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
<br />
Losing a bag slot for ammo is harsh to everyone that uses ammo. Make it so that the quiver is equipable in the ammo slot.<br />
<br />
More bows. :P<br />
<br />
Buying food, drink, pet food, ammo really takes a toll on the bank account and bag slots.<br />
<br />
Arrows stacked 200 isn't enough even with a 10 slot bag. Long instances will use up those arrows halfway through.<br />
<br />
Food should be stackable more than is currently is. 20 stacks aren't enough for long expeditions.<br />
<br />
Closing<br />
<br />
All in all, although it sounds like I'm complaining. I assure I'm not. The game is a joy to play in its current state. The WoW devs should give themselves, and the alpha and beta testers are pat on the back. This game is coming on very nicely. Even now, I can see this game is going to blow the socks off the market when it hits. A lot of this that I posted was stated as fact, but is just my observations off the top of my head. You can take these with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
PS. No, I don't like the move to the rogue energy system idea. It seems like a hack and the pacing is all wrong for the class. The current mana system will work fine for what we want to do with the class with a bit of tuning.<br />
<br />
Note: Feel free to comment. I'm unable to respond at the moment, I just got a call from my best friend that his baby is on the way. So, I'm just about out the door. Hopefully this hurricane won't mess up my trip out of town to see his and his child. I have no time to edit, but hopefully everything I wanted said has been said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good comments, much of the same things crossed my mind while tooling about with my dwarven Hunter.  I know that the class is still fresh out of the gate, and there is still a lot of development on its way (like learning new skills to teach your pets, and I understand that pet damage doesn't scale well).<br />
<br />
You mentioned the pet levelling thing, and I actually liked that.  It meant that the pet could grow stronger as you levelled (not a big deal now, but it may be once there are a lot of skills for pets to learn, depending on how training works), and I liked it - it set the pets more as *pets*, and less as summoned minions (auto-levelled wizard pets).  And, it discourages people from being fickle with their pets, which I thought was a nice and engaging touch.  *You have tamed a pet - tend to it well.*<br />
<br />
Oh, and we could sell our unwanted rewards to vendors.  Which was sometimes worth a few silvers.  To us, reward itemization all around seemed even, although we did encounter *bursts* where one armour type or another seemed to have been forgotten (lotsa mail and little cloth, then suddenly we saw more leather, even cloth, and no mail).<br />
<br />
In withdrawal since the stress test ended ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looks like they'll be fixing the endless agro bug with passive pets on the next update. Still no word on a fix for pet damage, which is bugged to only minimum hits. Elite pets will no longer do more damage than normal pets. Some pet specials should be going in also. Looks to be a pretty good update.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for my closed beta invite :P<br />
<br />
I miss WoW. Warcraft III isn't doing it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No comments eh? Guess everyone is too busy playing the game.<br />
No, you said it yourself why there are no comments... its because this is a warrior forum not a hunter forum. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's no need to be snide. Evene with a :)<br />
<br />
There are no hunter forums and most WoW forums aren't active yet. That only leaves the official forums which are locked.<br />
<br />
Still no cross post over there...Oh well...</div></div><hr />
