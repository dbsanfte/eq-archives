The problem is that they are all naked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what I've tried so far...<br />
<br />
-Reinstalling video drivers<br />
-Downgrading to DirectX8.0<br />
-Deleting my TXC cache<br />
-Deleting Global files<br />
<br />
<br />
My velious textures are off, because I've heard that makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any ideas? I had them working at one point a while back, same computer and all.. but now that I can have them on, they appear naked!<br />
<br />
Please to be helping me in locating the magical secret that will get rid of the nude trolls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D<br />
<br />
good luck fixin it, first thing id do if i were you is post you config file for EQ, second thing list you vid card, driver version(video), ram size/type<br />
<br />
also make sure your video card IRQ doesnt share the same IRQ as your sound or lan ETC<br />
<br />
it will help us figure out what button you shouldnt have pushed :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a buddy of mine had that same problem about a year ago and im not sure how he fixed it but i will ask him in the moring and post what he did, hopefully you have already fixed the problem by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seveirn</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, The Naked Luclin char prob (and iam not saying everyone) NORMALLY happens becuase someone did:<br />
<br />
A: Turned on way more model's than there memory would support<br />
<br />
B: Has Luclin models on BUT! Has texture detail on low (this was the main cuase) , Try setting your detail on medium or high settings, See if that helps.<br />
<br />
EDIT: i occasionally see this problem pop up, i just fiddle with the texture details to high till it fixes, i even once had a screw up where my Wood Elf male Model was wearing a High elf females Red Dress :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont think he knows what value to change, hell i wouldnt eather.<br />
<br />
glad its not my problem, hate to have the gf walk in, see ya doing a CR with a few of your friends LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aight, I tried setting it to Medium (mycomputer crawls when there is luclin + high texture) and that didn't do anything. So I turned on only one model (female human, easier to see if they are wearing a shirt or not ;) ) and it was all messed up. When I say messed up, it looked like there was an attempt to render the cloathing, but it wasn't all there.. and the face wasn't textured or anything. I'll post a screenie later. (nevermind,  I can't duplicate it.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Video card is a NVIDIA Riva TnT2 Model64<br />
<br />
I went and downloaded the latest drivers (of which I'm pretty sure I already had).<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
also make sure your video card IRQ doesnt share the same IRQ as your sound or lan ETC <br />
Not quite sure what this means, I'm not a huge computer guy :p <br />
<br />
I've got 511MB of ram (which type, I dunno !)<br />
And my eqclient file is attached to the post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seveirn</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">soe no longer supports TNT cards,  Get something better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As you see here, these are the widely supported video cards, While some will still run EQ, No one said how well ;0</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah, I'm getting my car painted atm (it pwns), so I can't really shell out the cash for a new one till this summer probably. <br />
<br />
<br />
TnT just doesn't run the target ring =x<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully the price of the paintjob wont be whats in my bank account ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here ya go<br />
<br />

<br />
i use a dif model but the 9600 chipset is fairly stable, and SoE has finally fixed their targeting ring issue with it :) only 100$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Geforce 4 card and still don't see the target ring. No idea why. Have checked most of the settings. Even with all the bells and whistels on I still don't see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, like Binnamar shows up prefectly fine (see my sig), but other dwarfs have maybe a pair of pants missing, or something.  The barbarian guard in the nexus has full armor, yet a wandering guard in PoK is fully naked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats only with 3 of the models clicked. I havn't checked what it's like with full models, but I suspect it will be just about the same.</div></div><hr />
