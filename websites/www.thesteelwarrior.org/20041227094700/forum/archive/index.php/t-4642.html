Basically I am interested if you have any hard info on whether there will be new AA's being patched for us on Dec. 16'th or they meant that in the future new AA's could be created to further enhance the system. (ie the next expansion)<br />
<br />
I am basing this off of this quote, that was from the general forum's recap of the live chat:<br />
*Drewon-FoH* Will there be any new AA skills that are tied to, or create, these new melee abilities?<br />
<br />
There will AA abilites that will effect the new system yes. We don't have a hard and fast list for it yet though.<br />
 <br />
I'm currently saving my AA's, I have like 15 and can go up to 30 i believe. So if you have info, speculation, or an opinion please share it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) AA to increase the amount of hate given when using Provoke or like abilities.<br />
<br />
2) AA to decrease the re-use time of Provoke by 10% per rank (or perhaps 4 seconds per rank), 3 ranks.<br />
<br />
3) AA to decrease re-use time on certain Disciplines<br />
<br />
4) Increase chance of getting an opening<br />
<br />
5) Increase length of time an opening is available<br />
<br />
6) Endurance regen increase (ala Mental Clarity)<br />
<br />
Stuff like this is bound to be available at some point...<br />
<br />
I read it as new AAs being available for it in the next expansion, but it's entirely possible new AAs will be available before then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would expect a 2/4/6 endurence regen AA in Archtype.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, maybe a 5 or 9  AA class ability for ofensive/defensive openings /shrug. And probably something in PoP abilities. Overall, I think saving 30 would be wise, but then again, they might not be introduced on the 16th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure any new AA's will be comming in the next expansion in the spring.  I'd love to be wrong and get them sooner.  No new AA's for two expansions has pretty much sucked.</div></div><hr />

Basically, this is going to go into our &quot;bag of tricks&quot; that we pull from when giving out new abiliites and increases in power in expansions, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it, dual wield in the high end is pretty much dead because of the additional damage taken compaired to wielding a two-handed weapon if the parses I've seen are correct, it sometimes amount up to 30%-40% of all damage taken in a fight, while with a two-handed weapon, riposte damage was only some 12-15%. And though that's still a substancial amount, it's a big difference, which is pretty sad because dual wielding is one of the warriors main treats. Also, there are some itemization problems with no Phase 5 warrior two-hander, getting two 1 handed weapons is more expensive than one 2 handed .. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
It's mostly a late game problem though, pretty much POP Tier 2 and up.<br />
<br />
-SO-<br />
<br />
An AA I think would be nice to get would be an anti-riposte AA while dualwielding.<br />
<br />
Say, an AA that increases your ability to parry a MOB's riposte by 20, 40 and 60% on 3 levels of the AA. Make it's pre-requisite be ambidexterity and only work while dualwielding (or having a sword &amp; shield equipped) so that the amount of ripostes between 2H and 1H weapons gets narrowed down a bit.<br />
<br />
Yes, there will still be a *chance* of freak damage in one round, but it would be much less common and if you were afraid of getting one-rounded you could go for the good old faithful 2hander.<br />
<br />
Admittedly this has nothing to do with the new Melee system as such, but would be a nice balance tool, besides, I think it fits a warrior to know how to avoid ripostes better than others in the right situation and would make dualwielding fun again for the high level crowd.<br />
<br />
And since it wouldn't make you parry more on regular hits, it would not unbalance the class tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something like this :<br />
<br />
Heightened Combat Awareness<br />
<br />
AA ability<br />
Prerequisite : Ambidexterity<br />
Type : Passive, Warrior Archetype<br />
<br />
Max training : 3 levels<br />
<br />
Point cost :<br />
Level 1 = 3 points<br />
Level 2 = 6 points<br />
Level 3 = 9 points<br />
<br />
This ability gives the Warrior an increased chance of parrying an enemy riposte while dualwielding.<br />
The chance to parry a riposte is 20%, 40% and 60% respectively at the different levels of training.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, the name suck, but I think the idea is solid.<br />
Come up with a new name if it bugs you. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be an excellent AA, Anker.  Good idea.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see an AA to apply damage bonus on the off hand weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dual Wield isn't dead at the high end.  It's only dead when you yourself are trying the best you can to not die....<br />
<br />
But once Time, Quarm, and everything else in EQ becomes a farm and there is no more challenge.... you can dual wield just fine because you will likely have enough gear that one or 2 more hits are less likely to kill you, you have able people ready to back you up, or your healing is better than it once was, etc.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call it dead, BUT I think it's almost a requirement that every warrior have a good aggro 2h'er.... having some 1h'ers and dual wield is more of an optional thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hence why I would like a bit of balancing how much the riposte difference is on duwl wield vs. two-handed, so we can get them back as a viable tanking alternative before Quarm gets the dreaded &quot;farm&quot; status. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh I think that im one of the FEW if not the only tank (on Fennin) that doesnt use a 2hander for anything except DPS... Now before everyone goes off on me, YES I know about riposte damage.... Yes I know the numbers....  but ya know... I just never could bring myself to get a VDD or an &quot;aggro&quot; 2hander...  Whatever happened to switching out weapons?...  I mean its not like your THAT busy when your corner tanking :)<br />
alternative before Quarm gets the dreaded &quot;farm&quot; status. <br />
<br />
Hate to say it but Quarm already has this status on the majority of servers...  <br />
<br />
As to the whole we need a tier5 2hander... We do?.../blink  I mean sure it would be NICE to have but do we NEED it... No I dont think so...  SEWS has held up very well and I see no one complaining about VDD.  We HAVE our Tier5 weapon... Dark Blade of the Warlord.  And while it was panned when it initially dropped *I think more because of the lack of an original graphic than anything else*  its become increasingly apparent through parses that this weapon holds up JUST fine overall.<br />
<br />
Our job isnt to dish damage.... Its to take it and hold the attention of X mob on us.<br />
<br />
I guess Im just failing to see where all this, &quot;we need this... we need that... so we can do our jobs...&quot;  IMO we do it just fine right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh .. I meant &quot;farm&quot; status for whichever guild you are in.<br />
<br />
Wether or not warriors &quot;need&quot; a Tier 5 two-hander .. nahh, but it would fit into the theme of warriors being masters of all weapons, yet only get one class specifick weapon whereas Paladins for example gets two.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, there is a disparacy on damage intake between the two weapon types (one handed and two handed) which would be nice to reduce some so warriors have more open choices.<br />
<br />
And it would make sense since warrior Phase 5 class weapon is a one-hander, yes ?<br />
<br />
Also, not all warriors have equally good acces to high quality weapons of both types at the same time, so there could be periods where they have a better DW setp for aggro and vice versa. It would open up the possibilities a bit and give the warrior a choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavariel Baenre</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for posting Rytan.<br />
<br />
Basically the reasoning my concern was that Hybrids already have a system that is further enhanced by AA's. On the 16th we'll have a system put into place for us to balance this.<br />
<br />
Warriors have ability sets, Knights have spells.<br />
<br />
Balance is attempted to be made.  Now if you look at Knights AA line since luclin their system is further enhanced.  My fear is that our system is going to be put in bare like a pally spell book in velious. (Alternate advancement not available)<br />
<br />
Although Ryan assured me otherwise, I still have doubts that we will be brought up to pace without AA's to enhance our system.  Its in my opinion that this change is long overdue and is meant to bring us up to pace with hybrids. Their spell books have always existed, it has the potential to be enhanced by the expansions of luclin and PoP through alternate advancement. <br />
<br />
Ours simply will not. Will we be behind still then?<br />
<br />
Yes or no, one thing that bugs me remains. In Everquest we are not equal. People are stronger than others based on experience gained, equipment, and skill.  With nothing to enhance the system off the bat my system will be equal to the next 65 warrior next to me with little or no AA's. While a newly dinged 65 warrior who is working on run3, I can be working up my endurance AA's and skill enhancement.<br />
<br />
So wait for the next expansion I suppose, I guess I read this wrong:<br />
*Kilbane_luc* Will we have to buy a new expansion to use these skills too?<br />
<br />
This is a free feature. It will become available to everyone!<br />
