 Jaqyl, you mentioned your list did not include augments, potions and shields which is fine, but I was wondering if you have a list of DS items that are not quite so high level.  Meaning, my guild has only within the last week gotten to VT, and although I've been on two raids there, I imagine it will be a while before I get one of those type drops there, since I'm only melee, not MT/RT/anything.  The other items include places like Time and such which I don't have access to yet.<br />
<br />
Do you have items for use lowly little Warriors that would like to get some DS?  Or are they not on your list because there aren't any?</div></div><hr />

My list was as complete as possible.  I basically used personal knowledge plus the ever so wonderful stacking list on lucy.  But lets take a look at each set from the post.<br />
<br />
<br />
From the first self only clickable DS line, I've listed every item I'm aware of with the exception of the ring from BoT which only has 2 charges.  Your best bet is probably the Mantle of the Accused from the 7th Hammer or the Cloak of Icy Shadows is pretty common in VT if your guild doesn't start skipping the two mobs that drop it.<br />
<br />
The second set is pretty unique and the two items listed there are the only ones I know of, rumor has it the mail doesn't drop anymore, and of course then theres getting your guild to kill Tunare . . . <br />
<br />
The third set is the one that has stacking issues with Call of the Rathe.  For raiding purposes CoR is better, due to the AC, than all but the 20DS from the Time cloak clicky, and even then its an argument between people that like DS and people that like AC.  If you do want something in this line for when there isn't a ranger around, the 8th Coldain ring is a very easy quest, for a guild just breaking into VT it should only take a few days to complete, and less than a single group to do the final fight if you do it correctly.<br />
<br />
The clicky DS line that has stacking issues with mage/druid DSs is pretty short too.  Blazing Vams are really nice and I still use them, its just a matter of getting them to drop on a cleric epic'ing run.  The Chardok ring is probably out of your grasp atm, on my server at least this quest is still heavily camped.<br />
<br />
The worn DS line lists every item currently known, excluding some new shoulders from high end GoD.  The earring is probably the only thing within your grasp for the near future, but just looked at your magelo and you're going to need to work on your levels, hp, AC, and AA's before you can tank hard LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info, it was helpful.  Yes, with my level, any guild stuff that is done I am not tanking for.  The earring would be nice, I know of a few groups that do the Hard LDoN's so hopefully I can squeeze in on that.<br />
<br />
I already have plans to do the 8th Coldain ring (have all the stuff through 3 currently), a 65SHD/65DRU friend is going to help me get to 8, it's just that since we've just hit VT every single day is raid day!  Hopefully soon...</div></div><hr />
