<br />
We got agro too fast initially and it cost us a wipe on the first attempt.  The second time we had another mixup, but we recovered and took him down.  The main problems were we lost the slower early - before slow landed - and we only had a 55 and 53 druid for healing...the druids couldn't quite keep up with the heals the first time around...he was down to a sliver of life when I died, but then the casters died in a few seconds after I dropped.  The second time it was fairly close, but we won.  (druids at 20m, and me at 1 bub)<br />
<br />
This was the biggest mob my warrior (or any other character I have) has faced and it was a blast.  I got the map, so now I'm off to get the eyepatch of plunder.<br />
<br />
One thing that really surprised me is Lodi didn't mitigate my damage very much.  I didn't run a log, but I know I did much better dps then I normally do in The Grey or PoP zones.  Not sure if that's normal or not...<br />
<br />
By the way, thanks again for all of the great advice I've gotten from this board!<br />

<br />
I remember the first time I killed that turtle, at the time the biggest mob I had ever killed. He is a lvl 60 velious mob so his AC will be much lower than what you are used to in Luclin and beyond. <br />
<br />
Good luck on the Stormfeather camp, I hope you have some time on your hands. ;)</div></div><hr />
