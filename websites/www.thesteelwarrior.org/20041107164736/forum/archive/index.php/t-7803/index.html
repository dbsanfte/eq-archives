<br />
Damage shields and the (non-)streakiness of the EQ RNG are discussed.<br />

Brael posts a parse showing that shield AC works exactly the same as non-shield AC, which contradicts what SOE has said.  Who to believe?<br />

Easy LDoN's can be done with non-standard groups (such as all-melee, or melee multi-tanking and AOE spells, or shaman tanking with four rogues, or…).<br />

Damage shields are the most mana-efficient damage in the game.<br />
DS'es can take up critical buff spots on raids--but in XP groups, we *always* want them.<br />
Cuclain would even do Virtue/DS vs. Kazad/9's/WoG with no DS.<br />
Your friendly editor contemplates doing an LDoN without slow in order to get maximal use out of DS's to end the LDoN faster.<br />

RZ p0wz for twink warriors, ogres/small races/iksar/elfs all have advantages (frontal stun, corner-tanking, AC &amp; regen, high CHA), don't ask if Pally/SK better--we're a WARRIOR board!<br />

Other odd effects of charm, including rangers being able to gate and magicians being able to have more than one pet.<br />

The multipliers for ND/PD are:<br />
ND level 1: +0.02 (for a total of 2%)<br />
ND level 2: +0.03 (for a total of 5%, as specified in the online description)<br />
ND level 3: +0.05 (for a total of 10%, as specified in the online description)<br />
Thanks to Payn for pointing out the need for this clarification.<br />

Much debate on actual aggro capabilities of Warriors and Knights, with reference to dual wielding vs. 2-handers vs. 1-handers + shields.  Nothing conclusive.<br />

Coprolith, the meaning of whose name I am *not* going to discuss with you, determines (and displays graphically) that EQ's RNG is not, in fact, streaky at all.  Woot stats geeks.<br />
Battleblade points out (although not in these terms) that the problem is not that the RNG is a *bad* RNG--it's precisely that it is a *good* RNG.  Truly random behavior includes outcomes that violate people's statistical intuition, like &quot;I have a 60% chance to succeed at Taunt--how can I *possibly* have failed Taunt 3 times in a row?!&quot;<br />
Your friendly editor posts on this at some length.<br />

Lokkak says that someone should test the aggro (if any) of Tome of Throw Stones.<br />
