<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimon</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello!<br />
I currently play a Beastlord and my wife plays a magician.<br />
Now she wanted to try a druid so I want to do a alt myself so I can group with her.<br />
<br />
The 3 big downsides when grouping a melee with a druid is:<br />
1. Druid is lacking haste spells<br />
2. Druid cant slow mobs<br />
3. Druid lack healing power at certain levels (45-57)<br />
<br />
So, with that I think I will make a gnome warrior so I can use the tinkering armor that has 40% haste on it.<br />
<br />
What i lack now is a item or weapon with slow on, only item I could find was &quot;Truncheon of Doom&quot; that procs a max 50% slow.<br />
That hammer would be pretty ok if it wasnt a 2hb.<br />
I would rather have a 1h weapon (will proc faster because lower delay) or a clicky item. Anyone know of any other item with slow?<br />
<br />

The % is LOWER as your level is lower...canna remember the particulars, but I am sure one of the knowledgeable here will say shortly...</div></div><hr />

The proc of ToD is 50% slow, whatever your lvl is, if your lvl would affect the proc effect, a 65 warrior would land a higher slow than 50%.</div></div><hr />

Btw, is there any item that is pretty easy to get with spell haste?<br />
I think I will make a gnome because I can use the 40% haste on the tinkering armor, but is there any other item i can use so I dont need to be a gnome?<br />

<br />
and well worth it to get to avoid being a gnome :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enc + Druid almost the best combo. DPS comes from Snared/Ensared + Dual Wield + Hasted Charm pet + DS.</div></div><hr />

However, you're gonna want a ToD...trust me.</div></div><hr />

ToD - Don't leave home w/o it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and what's wrong with being a n0m3?  Clicky invis, haste, sow, str buff, dex buff (granted not til lvl 45) and damn good lookin!  Also, you'll never need to be shrunk!</div></div><hr />

Not until level 55. :(<br />
<br />
Ironically, the best melee partner for a druid is probably... a beastlord, which you already play.<br />
<br />
Have you considered a bard to partner with the druid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimon</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, yeah, wont make another bst :p<br />
Thanks for all the answers :)<br />
<br />
How often do it usually take for the ToD to proc?<br />
Seen alot of post with proc rates on BoC and other weapons and they proc about 1.5/min in main hand. <br />
The ToD have about double delay so would that meen it procs like 0.75/min? <br />
Would sux to tank a unslowed mob for like 90sec before slow lands and then switch to dps  weapons and tank him for another 60-90 sec then just tank him with dps weapons and finnish him off in 120sec.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, so you have to be 55 to be able to use the 30% haste on the ornate gauntles? hmmm, at that lvl you hardly solo/duo anymore and usually have a better haster in group :/<br />
The Gnome tinkering armor have some nice effects on them (40% spall haste, invis, sow, str buff, dex buff), but the downside with them is that it will cost about 5pp everytime you use them (mana batteries) and you cant use them until 45. Are the effects on the tinkering armor worth using?<br />
Hmmm....maby just pick a race with the best looks and then use sow and invis potions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimon</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually made a Bard to group with her at first, been very impressed by them at 65 in LDoN missions :)<br />
<br />
But I really want a cool warrior, the bard isnt that good at tanking (or?)...and its kinda tiring to twist all the songs :/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rugal Bloodwind</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo alot with a druid, its a fine combo, and even without slow is far from weak or unable, don't worry too much of procrate or delay. ToD is a lifesaver more so than the low delay wavecrasher (perception, I never owned a WC) however, the day I got mine, I did wonder &quot;how did I play without it?&quot; and its never gonna leave my bag.<br />
I don't slow everything, depends where and what we kill, as well as current mana count..I just depend on high dps rather than spending 30% of a fight wielding the big hammer. But there's too many situations you would wish you had that slow (your pull at 50%, you at 40, your healer partner just went LD yeeouw!) not to have it. Of course, this is from a lv65 point of view, your milage might vary (we started to duo in my early 50's, where slows were more crucial) .<br />
<br />
I'd like the ornate gloves, but since I have an eyepatch of plunder I can't get myself to spend money on the mold, and haven't lucked out with a drop. I do miss slow/haste sometimes, but we manage fine enough..and I'd miss soe, ports, DS too..:) <br />
<br />
Plenty utility around for your warrior/druid combo without the need to be a gnome for fancy clickies..pick a race that you like the look of:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is actually not the case, the chance to proc per swing scales with weapon delay and haste, so you are just as likely to proc over a given period of time with a 2 hander as with a 1 hander. So don't let that bother you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I remember a long time ago, it was believed that 2handers were given a higher chance to proc...wonder if that's really true or if it was only because of the slower delay that usually were alongside the 2handers.<br />
<br />
Anyways, on the ToD....Originally posted by Ealsur Helevorn <br />
A proc effect can change based on your lvl? Never heard of that *shrugs*<br />
The proc of ToD is 50% slow, whatever your lvl is, if your lvl would affect the proc effect, a 65 warrior would land a higher slow than 50%.  <br />
<br />
It might scale with level, but that doesn't mean it can go higher than 50%. Tepid Deeds (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=185&amp;source=Live) is the proc on ToD...it scales up to 50% at 60.  You cannot slow any higher than 50% from it, the spell won't go any higher...but if you're under 60, it can slow under 50%.  If a spell proc couldn't scale, as was said, the Waning Light Katar proc (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=917&amp;source=Live) would land for 84 damage every time...instead it lands for less if you're under 65 (81 at 62, goes up once per level).<br />
<br />
On the other side of the issue...Originally posted by Crystara <br />
Wavecrasher and Willsapper slow % scales with level, starting at like 1% up to their max at level 60, the proc from ToD is always 50% reguardless of level.   Not exactly....Willsapper can scale, Wavecrasher cannot.  In order to scale it must be coded to scale in the spell description...Breath of the Sea (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1978&amp;source=Live).  It's a set 20% every time.  Now take a look at the Willsapper proc Energy Sap (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1960&amp;source=Live).  Scales from 20% at level 1 to 35% at level 60...about 1% higher each four levels.  If you somehow get a Willsapper before then, it'll still be equal or higher than Wavecrasher (provided it can proc that low)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I duo all over the place with my druid friend in tow, ToD and Kizraks gaunts cover slow/haste good enough :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ToD is indeed a wonderful thing.  It is an item that every warrior should have in their toolbox.<br />
<br />
Just to give Wavecrasher some fair play; in LDoN where you have less than optimal groups and your slower through some mistake dies unexpectedly, its nice to have the Crasher slow available while being able to wield a Hate generating weapon in your off hand....the Tod doesn't give you this same utility  (although its slow is very much superior).  I have found myself using the Crasher at least 1-2 times a week in this context.  The 20pct slow while not as effective is usually enough to take the edge of off LDoN mobs.<br />

Yessir...this is an old principle...as wielders of the famed Executioners Axe will remember ;-)</div></div><hr />
