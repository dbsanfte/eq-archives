<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is your damage bonus (I think mine is +9 atm) just added to the base damage of the weapon? ie a 13/20 becomes a 22/20?  Also, is the equation for weapon damage known, what is it?  I think my max normal hit with CHoS is 64 from my last parse.  This depends only on STR (mine usually 255) and Damage Bonus right?  Or do other stats and your level(aside from higher DB) affect that?  Just trying to get a handle on the game mechanics :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That answered most of my questions...is this formula still valid?  I calculated that my max damage should be 70 and only get around 64 max hit.  Have I just not parsed enough fights? Last parse was ~100 fights.<br />

Thanks much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depending on your level there are different damage tables. Once you hit 65 you will be able to hit for max. Also take notice that since you are level 53 your CHoS is 12/20, not 13/20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe your max hit is governed by strength.  Your max hit may be higher than 64 with a strong strength buff.  Keep in mind that the formula is merely the most accurate one that we know of.  It will have been most strenuously tested at levels 60-65, and might not be 100% accurate at lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Forgot it was 12/20 still...works out perfect with that.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
