<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K so its been a couple months and I have yet to find a single decent tribute item in GoD. Do we need to have the bottomfeeding discussion again and why this is bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tribute's not part of the Discord expansion though. Anyone can visit the tribute master in their hometown. So it's not surprising that the best tribute items are found in the other expansions. It's the majority of the EQ content.<br />
<br />
BUT ... you know ... there's nothing preventing you from donating platinum for tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All 300 pp of it you get looting for a night?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have to have GoD to use the tribute master in your home town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;All 300 pp of it you get looting for a night?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not even sure what tribute it is you care about. I'm guessing the hit points, since this is a warrior forum. But, eh, if you wanted to loot plat, you know where to go. It's NOT the new expansion. It never WAS.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the best tribute items are worth (on veeshan) 4-5 tribute per plat spent on (tradable) item. such items are plentiful enough that it would seem a shame to donate straight platinum. if spending 5k on 24k worth of tribute points is out of your budget then you just have to wait till some day when you are more wealthy. there are a few tribute abilities that are interesting even for those who are not hyper-rich. if i remember right you can get 8AC for only one tribute point per 10-min or 16AC for 3. those are such nice deals even my caster characters use 2 levels of it. when my caster alts solo casters i often turn on magic resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The low level tribute buffs are very affordable even for the not-so-rich.  Spending some time shopping in Bazaar can net you a very good plat to tribute point ratio as well.  There's plenty of reasonable bargains even for the soloer.  For example Acrylic Chainmails are worth 4800 and certainly obtainable by a warrior solo (named at entrance of Acrylia) and can pick quite a few up while farming Acrylia.<br />
<br />
If you want the best stuff, then yes it will cost you, but then that's expected.<br />
<br />
Though Tribute certainly benefits casters more than warriors.  Although focus effects aren't a huge deal on the high end, the ability to get any essential focus effect, even a low effect one, is huge for casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The tradeable drops in LDON hard missions seems to be worth a fair amount of tribute points as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">shissar bow ; horn of hsraga ; swiftblade of zek, all good tribute... but then again that goes back into bottom feeding for the HoH and SboZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ravenscale mask is very very easy to obtain, and pretty cheap to buy and drops (if i remember correctly) just over 3k tribute... max hp from tribute costs 180 an hour if i'm not mistaken also...</div></div><hr />
