<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megunna</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on the race, Enchanted Dwarven is good, and cheap to boot (oftentimes the BP is the most expensive piece, at 1k). I would say it's a bit better than Acrylia, and, in many slots, Royal Velium. A good choice for a shorty.<br />
<br />
As for weapons, just pick up decent ratio weapons for each skill. Worry about upgrading them as you go on. Suggestions include (prices based off Innoruuk):<br />
1Hs: Velium Shortblade (10 / 24, costs maybe 100pp), Centi Shortsword (12 / 25 +decent stats, costs 200ish, can often find on merchants for less than 10 plat)<br />
2Hs: Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword (if you have 10k, chances are you have a character capable of taking the guy in Runnyeye down for this)<br />
1Hb: Cane of the Tranquil (11 / 25, 150ish)<br />
2Hb: Sarnak Battlehammer (30 / 40, costs about 50pp)<br />
Piercing: Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick (12 / 29, can often find on merchants for under 3 gold)</div></div><hr />

At that point your better off using a lamentation or such weapon as that with a low delay.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is great info, but a couple questions....<br />
1. What are Yaks?<br />
2. What about Centi Long Swords?<br />
3. How bout a haste item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Short Sword of the Ykesha, is known as a yak, or a SSOY. They proc a 75(?) DD (been forever since I used one).<br />
<br />
Centi long swords are decent twink items... and a FBSS or silver chiten hand wraps is a decent haste item (1.6k or so for fbss on my server, and 3k for SCHW I belive lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megunna</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem I see with Centi LS is they're expensive (1.5k on my server). Grabbing a pair of these would only leave you with 7k for the rest of your gear, which, quite frankly, sucks, considering weapons are the single most commonly upgraded slot for warriors (at least me, and all the warriors I know). Whereas you could get Enchanted Dwarven / Engraved Royal Velium armor which would last you up until you got Vellious armors in your low / mid 50s, you'll find yourself looking at new weapons constantly.<br />
<br />
That's why I believe it's best to just start with decent weapons from each skill (all of those I listed can take you through the 30s, possibly into the 40's (hell, I even tanked on occasion at 50 - 52 with Sarnak Battlehammer)), and it would keep your options open for when you see that great price on &lt;insert weapon name here&gt;. What if said weapon, however, is a nice 1HB, and all you've ever used is your Centi LS's? See the problem?<br />
<br />
Haste-wise, FBSS if you must get it immediately. Honestly though, I would suggest focusing more on armor in the beginning. Down the road, when you have an extra 1k - 2k on your main (I assume you have one, not being twinked by a friend *shrug*), then you can pick up an FBSS or SCHW. Either way works out well, though, I just can't see how much haste would help a lowbie (of course, I first got haste at 40-45ish, so I have no first hand experience in that matter).</div></div><hr />

Take the dreaded Moss Snake. Be UBA!<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Seriously, I don't think you need to worry about haste until your mid 20s at the EARLIEST.<br />
<br />
There's only two reasons to get a haste item on a level 1 ... A) You got the cash now and don't want to shop for one later on down the road, so you get it out of the way in the initial twink ... B) You plan on grouping a lot (as warriors are apt to do) and the lack of haste suddenly becomes noticable because everyone ELSE in your group of level 17s are ALSO twinks (is very hard to find newbs on some servers these days) and thus your lack of haste becomes way more pronounced than it should have at those levels.<br />
<br />
Your call man. You'll be fine whichever way you go.</div></div><hr />

Or am I just being a fool and RBG or FBSS work from level 1?</div></div><hr />
