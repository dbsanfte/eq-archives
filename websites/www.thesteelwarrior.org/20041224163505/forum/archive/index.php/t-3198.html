<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uira Tawhaki</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm asking this question from the point of view of my enchanter. I'm thinking about getting project illusion for one reason and one reason only: Illusion Werewolf. This illusion has a 40% haste that seems to stack with all other hastes except the ornate gloves.<br />
<br />
The difference between this illusion and NDT are as follows:<br />
<br />
Night's Dark Terror (200 mana, 12 minutes, recast time: 90)<br />
Infravision<br />
DEX +120<br />
Attack +45<br />
Liftetap 35<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Illusion: Werewolf (90 mana, 36 minutes, recast time: 6)<br />
Infravision<br />
STR +30<br />
Attack +60<br />
Haste +40%<br />
<br />
With maximum spell extention the durations in comparison are 20.4 minutes vs. 61.2 minutes. Because of the long duration and fast recast time, I could WW all the melee in the party and free up the spell gem for something. That's actually quite appealing in LDoN because it means I could mem another mana theft spell.<br />
<br />
Question, then, is...<br />
<br />
Is +30 STR, +40% haste and +15 attack worth more or less to you then +120 DEX and a 35 Lifetap proc?? (Please keep in mind this would overwrite the +30% haste on the ornate gloves).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just because the buffs stack doesn't mean the haste does.  The illusion is version 1 haste just like Speed of Vallon, so if you have SoV and get werewolf, the buffs will stack, you will get the other effects of the illusion, but the haste will not stack.<br />
<br />
It's no different than stacking Alacrity from a shaman with SoV.  You get the other effects of the buff, but no additional haste.  But go ahead and get project illusion if your guild fights anything that needs to be corner tanked.  I pretty much have to get gnomed for any cornered mob these days.<br />
<br />
Moving this to the Arena</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uira Tawhaki</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I was afraid of. Thanks for the prompt reply. In all honesty, I'd never really pondered the haste on werewolf illusion before because I don't have project illusion and never use it. <br />
<br />
Just to be certain, though, have you tested and confirmed this? I guess I'm unsure of what defines 'version 1' haste. Is that found in the raw spell data somewhere? I attached that info at the end of my post.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is that the Lucy's spell data specifically breaks down the hastes Illusion: Werewolf does and does not stack with. SoV, SoS, etc. are not found in this list, but (as you say) just because the buffs stack doesn't mean the haste does.. <br />
<br />
I guess another, related, question before I sit down and run some time trials on myself.. Does the haste from Miaculous Visions stack with SoS/SoV? If so, I would guess that this does too.<br />

Just a curious mind wondering :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been tested many times.  Miraculous visions haste will not stack with SoV either.  The only hastes that stack are Worn, Spell (SoV, WW form, MV, etc), and the special bard overhaste songs.  Icons mean nothing for haste stacking.  Lucy's stacking info is only icon stacking (which is all that is needed for most spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uira Tawhaki</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PS (and the reason for the further questions):<br />
It's no different than stacking Alacrity from a shaman with SoV<br />
Although SoV / VQ is a tricky one (added later and not technically a part of the ENC/SHM haste line nor are they listed in the Lucy's spell stacking data for ENC/SHM hastes), they are by all accounts in the same line. Miraculous Visions and Illusion: Werewolf clearly are not.<br />
<br />
I'm not doubting the information you gave, persay, I'm just wondering if anyone has actually tested it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Illusion : Werewolf (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=585&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Then add the Chanter AA to project illusions.<br />
<br />
No, haste &quot;icons&quot; might stack but the haste on them does NOT stack.  Only the bard &quot;overhaste&quot; haste does any difference when max hasted.</div></div><hr />

In fire elemental form you have an innate 16-17 point DS that stacks with the Druid and Mage DS lines. I *think* it stacks with the good DS potion as well. Looking at it in terms of damage : mana, DS's are nice. My enchanter friend that I regularly grouped with before RL got too busy never had the gem slots to keep NDT up all the time. So with the low recast time on fire elemental he would swap that in every...20-30min? It's nice if you have a spare buff slot<br />

<br />
Fire elemental illusion DS is slot 2, so it will stack with Mage and Druid DS's, but it won't stack with 8th ring, shaman potion, or call of rathe.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a problem for tanks typically but means it can't be used on a lot of casters...<br />
<br />
It's sounding more and more like I was right in my choice to work other AA's before project illusion. Ah well.<br />
<br />
PS.. With 70% extended buffs illusions will typically last 61 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />

I use kick because i know it can interupt mobs but what I forget is what level kick becomes able to do that....50 something i think and I've never tested it but can you still kick with boon, garou, and ndt?</div></div><hr />

I always corner tank with Dark elf + shrink (can be a PITA bugging the enchanters though - guess I need to work on Crown of Deceit quest).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me too omg. I got faction just need a r33t crown ( easy enough ). I run into the problem of logging on and the first thing I see is, &quot;We need a tank at ______.&quot; Wood elf + noamish shrinking device = win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna have to start using Barbie illusion to practice bash now Im thinking too.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what other stacking issues Illusion Werewolf has for getting the benefit of the +60 atk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me, it actually might be worth it to get the AA points.  The only time I would want NDT over the projected WW form would be if there were no shaman or beastlord for dex buffing, and even then, if the enchater said, I'm casting this, it lasts an hour, and then i can free the spell slot, my reaction would be... ok.<br />
<br />
The extra 15 atk is a good trade off for the 45 point proc.  The only problem would be those with procing weapons who want to make out dex, and you are thier only source.  Your point about raids is even more applicable, because suddenly instead of maybe 4 or 5 pumpkin heads, your whole RAID has plus 60 atk.<br />
<br />
All of this depends on what the ATK stacks with.  I would look into the following, common, buffs.<br />
Spirit of Predator, Ranger<br />
Spiritual Vigor, Beastlord<br />
Strength of Tunare, Ranger<br />
Grim Aura, Goblin Earring<br />
Ferine Avatar, Shaman<br />
Ferocity, Beastlord<br />
And finally, Avatar proc from primals.<br />
<br />
If it had no conflicts with those, or with only a few, the idea seems valid.</div></div><hr />

Won't stack with Avatar line because of strength.<br />
