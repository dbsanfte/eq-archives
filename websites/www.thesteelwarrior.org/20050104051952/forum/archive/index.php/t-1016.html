<br />
what i want to know is what would a good combo 1 handers or peircers(1h) would be(keep in mind i have to buy 2) or a good 2 hander</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghazad</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 * 1HS: Frostbringer and Silken Whip of Ensnaring ~ 10 k<br />
<br />
1* 2HS: Hmm, perhaps a Tae Ew Twohanded Sword ~ 10 k or some of those twohanders from CT<br />
<br />
Of course if you mention what you already have it would perhaps be easier to help you :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghazad</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends if you want agro or DPS, Defenders Lightblade is better DPS, Snare whip is better agro. For agro you could also look into the barnacle covered axe :-)<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm level 47 atm, couple blue from 48.  I have had great results with a Frosty main and Guard Captain's Mallet secondary.  A couple days ago I got a great trade and picked up a LSoEE for my secondary and it seems to be working even better than the mallet.  Something that may actually be better than a Centi LS and is normally cheaper on Prexus is A Serrated Pirhana Fang, its a 14/26 piercer with +8 sta and 65 hp.  It has a req lvl of 51 which you just said that you have, and like I said on Prexus it normally goes about 500pp cheaper than the Centi LS.  <br />
Hope that helped,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Barnacle Covered Axe proc isn't bad... I like to switch it in either hand after the Frosty or the Honed Blade of Ykesha has procced. It doesn't proc as much as Frosty or Ykesha though, and is kinda weak for off hand. I still like it because it's a Warrior only weapon :)<br />
<br />
If you are a little patient.. you might find Frostbringers as low as 5500p and maybe lower on your server (I am on Terris Thule). Then you could buy another nice proccer for offhand with a decent ratio.. Silken Whip is a nice weapon, I just didnt like the negative AC hit. It sells as low as 1300pp though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually try to avoid piercing weapons just because of the lower skill cap with piercing.  (i have one or two in my bag for skill ups, got to 200 skill and stopped working on it)  If I were you I'd work up 1hb and 2hb, 'cause at least for now, there are a great deal of really nice weapons that work off those skills.  For decent dps and good aggro, frosty and venomous axe of the velium brood is a pretty decent combo that's in your price range.  <br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i can wait, just keep in mind i had to sell all my wepoans except my defenders light blade, here is what ive seen at a glance<br />
<br />
frostbringer 7500p <br />
barnacle coverd axe 2000p<br />
tae ew longsword 9000p<br />
stonebladed axe of dismay 8000p<br />
etched zraxthire greatsword 6000p<br />
widebladed greatsword 10,000p <br />
 <br />
have 10k to spend if i also sell my defenders light blade<br />
atm im thinking og the widebladed greatsword or a barnacle axe and a frostbringer if the frostbringer price drops any lower, fortune is looking good because there are 2 in the bazaar and they have a price war :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh ya, im at 50 with 1hb (lol sad huh?),,, 205 2hs,,, 203 1hs,,, 100 pierce<br />
<br />
my dex is 94 (base 80, yuck)<br />
(almost level 52, and since i plan to pester naggy and vox im gona be adding AAs to innate dex and sta)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boub</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the gain from dex is way too low to spend any AAs on it unless you have abotu everything else, might as well save em up til you got everything from naggy/vox you want and then when ya hit 55, buy nd3 / cs3 and ca3  teehee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashurr</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">stonebladed axe - 44/44 one will do you well.. prolly better than frosty/ another mid range weap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i got the widebladed greatsword my attack is 1085 with it and my ac is 1072 (adds ac) and i cant loose agro for the life of me, BEWARE PALLYS hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, at that price range, the stonebladed axe of dismay rocks.  There is no 1H combo for the same price that can generate as much aggro or do as much DPS.  I might have gone with the widebladed greatsword for the extra AC, but that's just me.  Either of the two-handers is the better option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaanru</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defenders Lightblade is terrible for holding aggro. We have a lvl 60 warrior in my guild, who returned after quitting, and had to re-equip. A friend of his gve him a defender's lightblade for secondary. With Swiftblade of Zek in primary, and ok haste item, he was unable to consistently hold aggro in regular grind situations. <br />
<br />
We swapped out the lightblade for a tae ew LS (12/20) AND SAW A VERY NOTICABLE INCREASE in his aggro holding ability.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that SoZ and tae ew LS are not Great warrior weapons, but the SoZ was a gift, and the tae ew stuff I can make.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point, if I have one, is that defender's lightblade is only good if someone else is tanking. I recommend it to rangers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO Stonebladed Axe of Dismay is an awesome awesome wep, runs 3.5-5k on tarew, i have one, dont use it anymore after i got a Frostreaver (procs soooo much 125DD + Stun!) so dont really use it anymore, Req level of 51 makes it hard to sell, but its nice and cheap that way too ;) i reccomend this one as your 2hs of choice. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i can sell the widebladed for 11k and get the axe for 7k, but whats the differance on the dmg? ones a 43 43 and ones a 35 35 isnt that the same ratio?</div></div><hr />
