<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other night I got into a friendly arguement with a guildie.  I have a Frostbringer for my warrior, he has a Snowchipper for his.  And of course we each thought we had the better one.  We never really decided who's weapon was better.  So I am here to ask for your opinions.<br />
<br />
Frostbringer:<br />
12 Damage, 22 Delay<br />
Wt. 2.5<br />
+7 AC<br />
Effect: Frostbite, 60HP Cold DD, 15 AC Debuff<br />
<br />
Snowchipper:<br />
10 Damage, 20 Delay<br />
Wt. 4.0<br />
+5 AC, +5 Str, +5 Sta, +5 Dex, +10 Sv Cold<br />
Effect: Frostcall, 120HP Cold DD<br />
<br />
His biggest arguement was the extra stats on the Snowchipper and that it cost him about half as much as my Frostbringer(3k for his, 6.5k for mine.)  My main arguement was the higher damage and the AC debuff for agro.  Is there another side to the arguement that we are missing?  Or did we both overlook something that makes one a clear cut winner?<br />

<br />
There really is no comparison imo, well worth the extra 3k.  Here are my reasons:<br />
<br />
Better dmg/delay = More agro<br />
Proc = Much greater agro<br />
<br />
All the stats in the world mean nothing if you cant maintain agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends what you're looking for.  If you want dps, then they are probably about the same.  If you want aggro, frosty wins by such a huge margin that they don't really compare heh.  Snowchipper is ok dps, but it's aggro is small.  Frosty is also ok dps, but it's aggro is huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience I just got Frostbringer last night, but had Snowchipper, I like the Frosty Better, with the Snowchipper I would get Maybee 1 Proc a fight a very lucky 2.  Using the Frosty last night in The Grey I was getting 3-5 Procs a FIght.<br />
<br />
Also the Fights were Me and my Brother Cleric, and not once did I lose Agro to his CH's on me.   Easily Held agro for full fights.</div></div><hr />

It looks cool, but if that matters you would have made a bard...or half-elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used both for pretty much all of level 59.<br />
<br />
I found that they procced pretty much the same over time.<br />
<br />
The snowchipper was higher damage due to the proc.<br />
<br />
The frosty was better agro, except when one of the debuff classes cast a AC debuff on a raid, then you would get &quot;did not take hold&quot; messages and the agro drops ALOT!<br />
I am not sure what spell it was, and I have now upgraded, so I can not be more specific. :(</div></div><hr />

In groups I generally have my dex buffed pretty high, between 200 and 255 and proc alot with both of the weapons. Very nice team between them both.<br />

<br />
for aggro; frostbringer hands down. dps it's about the same. for stats the snowchipper is nice.<br />
<br />
didn't we have this discussion a week or so ago?  :D just sounds really familiar. no worries though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah i forgot.../smack gyzzdark...half elf pffft...Snowchipper screams Dwarf Only. :D<br />
<br />
It ain't big and bad enough to be in the hands of a Half Elf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I think so but I love these conversations lol<br />
<br />
I actually asked this same question here:<br />
<br />
http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=758<br />
<br />
DOH!<br />
<br />
nothing better than getting the opinion of people.....well ok maybe this question has been asked alot ROFL<br />
<br />
Right now I am going with Snowchipper and Frosty, with Infestation in my backpack for times when i really need some super agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny it sounds as most agree that the Forstbringer is (slightly?) better for aggro, yet, everytime I've checked the bazaar on TT lately the Frosty was 6-7k while the Snowchipper was always around 10k.<br />
<br />
I bought a Frosty and am very happy with it. Since I get my DEX buffed in most groups and on raids, the Frosty procs several times during each fight. It is rare that I do not see it proc during a fight.<br />
<br />
By the way, someone above mentionned the proc not stacking with some AC debuff.<br />
<br />
But I have read many times that as long as it procs you get aggro, whether it gets resisted or not. Is that correct or not ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snowchipper is 10/20 with a pure DD proc. Pure DD procs aren't significant aggro.<br />
<br />
Frostbringer is a better ratio, with a proc that, while it isn't quite as much as a chipper, has a AC debuff proc, which makes the proc give much more aggro.<br />
<br />
Frosty is far better than the chipper.</div></div><hr />
