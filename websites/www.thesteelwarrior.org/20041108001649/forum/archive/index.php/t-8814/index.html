<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting. Warrior proc of group Vie with a chance to resist spells on self. Sounds pretty neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is neat except for two things.  <br />
<br />
1)  Does it have any aggro?  I don't think lowering the incite timer to 20 seconds is anywhere near a replacement for a innate aggro proc on your mainhand weapon if the group vie spell isn't pretty good for aggro (it could be, group spells often are).  Also your END bar will drop pretty fast if you are mashing incite every 20 seconds.  Hopefully the proc is a lot of aggro.<br />
<br />
2)  Will everyone in the group hate you for taking up a buff slot by constantly proccing a group buff that most of the group doesn't want or need.  Not a big deal in groups but can be a real problem on raids.<br />

<br />
  *nods* And if you look, it just might be taking up 2 of your own buff slots, one for the Vie and one for the recourse (spell resistance). Which would be the devil. Perhaps it'll have a unique augment slot or something for an extra cool aggro proc?</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm, maybe pallies and warrs should switch procs? They get better mitigation through Vie and we get aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea, I think you guys are underestimating the power of a Vie proc.  This means you take 10% less melee damage all the time pretty much.  Sure some clerics keep it up already, but in my experience the vast majority don't, and a lot of guilds don't have a spare cleric to chain it on raids.  With this thing it will be up 90% of the time and that is pretty darn uber.  The group part bugs me, because everybody is gonna be annoyed by a group buff hitting them every 20 seconds and in most groups the warrior is the only one that really makes much use of Vie (of course we have all lived with bard proc group buffs for a long time now so maybe it's not that big a deal).  Also it may or may not have any aggro to it, but if this weapon can go in the offhand (which would dramatically increase it's life span so I hope it does) that wouldn't be a real big deal.<br />
<br />
DD + Stun proc on the paladin epic is mostly worthless to them.  I wouldn't trade personally.  At least they used some imagination on the warrior proc instead of Ykesha ver. 36.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Perhaps you are right, my initial impression of the proc was underwhelming, but after reading your post I am warming up to it.<br />
<br />
Just remove the group part and make both 1.5 and 2.0 offhandable, viola.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Symgharyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Firstly, I don't know if they're making the new epic to be 2h or 1hx2.  But should they go with the 1hx2 in mind, why the hell wouldn't you want to go with the Vie proc?  Oh boohoo, the rest of my group will get another buff they have to worry about.  How about you just plan better.  Maybe try putting in the rampage tank into your group.  How about organizing it so your raid/group benefits from this rather than thinking solely about how it effects the warrior and not being able to get aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for being so rough about this but I see the weapon being worth having on raids and in groups.  &quot;Every tool is a weapon if you know how to use it&quot; - Ani D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm pretty sure this epic will be a single 1-hander.  Not a pair of them and not a 2-hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">From what I've heard, it's 1 1hs. As long as it's offhandable, it should be an excellent option for anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tuddar Raddut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think you'll find the aggro off the proc to be damn good. This is just guesswork, only time will tell.<br />
<br />
We all know rune proccing weapons generate aggro. This is just from a self rune. Now think about the aggro generated from basically placing a rune on every member of the group.<br />
<br />
This proc actually has some of the properties I was looking for in the Epic. It extends benefits to both group and raid situations. The aggro, although I'm only guessing, is likely to be extremely good. It is in line with our definition as tanks, which is to survive the most brutal encounters. More mitigation in the form of a 10% mitigation buff is logical. It's powerful but not game imbalancing, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but it's original. There is no group Vie in the game right now, nor do I see any coming in OoW.<br />
<br />
I agree, taking up buffs slots from a proc sucks, but in this case I might make an exception. Especially with more buff slots being available.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If it has rune-like aggro then a group spell should be great for aggro.  I know a group rune spell would be instant death for a chanter.  Back before they made bard songs almost zero aggro their group rune song was very high aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, if it has aggro like the Guard line, or the Vie line, there will be next to none. Maybe hitting 6 people with it will generate some aggro from the sheer mass of it... But unless it has some specific modifier, the proc will *NOT* be good aggro.</div></div><hr />

Increases Paladin's healing ability + adds an additional stun + DD proc<br />
<br />
nuff said<br />
<br />
Take it. Its a fucking piece of shit effect, so us paladins are getting seriously screwed on this weapon effects. Want to know why?<br />
<br />
The &quot;focus&quot; effect is a +healing focus. That's it. Something any paladin that has these weapons should ALREADY have. Even the 2.0 focus effect is weak enough that the better healing effects from discord working at 90 and 80% efficiency (for fast and group heal respectively) will do about the same amount.<br />
<br />
But lets not stop there, lets look at the clicky proc. That's right, its a clikcy proc, meaning we *can't use it with our innate procs we already have*. So its one or the other, so even version 2.0 is at best a tiny dps upgrade over the 195 dd proc enchantement spell we get in oow, and at worst a downgrade over the 390 undead proc upgrade we get in oow. The stun effect? Aggro is always nice when you get it, but we don't really have aggro problems (having to chain stun to keep aggro is not a &quot;problem&quot;, we can keep aggro if we have to and other classes aren't doing stupid things like pressing taunt). The stun is a 0.0 sec stun, meaning its an interrupt. Relying on a proc to interrupt a spell being cast by a mob? HAH!<br />
<br />
But that's not all! This clicky proc REDUCES our healing modifier! That's right! The healing focus on the weapon is rendered even worse because the proc on the weapon limits the healing focus such that any basic healing focus we have on OoW equipment (or high end healing focus on GoD equipment working at 80-90% efficiency on the two heals it affects that we will use, as they are still working above those numbers) will be rendered useless!<br />
<br />
Yeah, warriors really got shafted relative to paladins didn't they, a group 10% vie proc that as a 1 min duration recourse will likely be up 75-100% of the time even on a tank. Yeah, you got screwed.<br />
<br />
&quot;nuff said&quot; indeed.<br />
<br />
P.S. This is to the one idiot paladin hater above, not to the rest of the posters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh, and just in case someone thinks having the proc in slot 1 for our innates and this one in slot 2 means they stack, they don't. NDT, werewolf form, etc is also slot 2 and it also does not stack with our innate procs (the +stats and illusion effect can stack as both buffs will stick, but only the first buff has its proc used).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you're going to rant, go to the outhouse. That's what it's there for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't think the proc is going to reduce your healing efficiency.  That would be retarded.  We just don't know how to interperet the information in the SPDat entry. <br />
<br />
Quite a few of the epic effects are a self-buff that adds a proc + another effect.  It's a way to add multiple effects to the epics, but if they can't make it stack with other innate proc buffs it's kinda lame.<br />
<br />
And yea, no ranting and name-calling in this thread please.  The fact that he thinks the proc on your epic is better than ours makes him an &quot;idiot paladin hater&quot;?  Please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Uuldare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">dont know how to Do Funky Quote boxes <br />
<br />
We all know rune proccing weapons generate aggro. This is just from a self rune. Now think about the aggro generated from basically placing a rune on every member of the group.<br />
<br />
If that is True .... I Will Eat every Word I said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Vie?  Who gives a shit?  If you want it that badly, you designate a bot cleric to cast it on you.  No one wants this group spell.  10percent damage mitigation means jack and shit if it's on anyone besides the tank.  The epic will have sub-par stats and a ratio, but they will justify it sucking based on this lame proc, and the ability to eat your endurance bar just a bit faster, cause we all have problems with aggro.. right???1?<br />
<br />
Yet another poorly thought out idea by the EQ developers at SoE.  Just think!  This was *AFTER* they pushed back the release date!!  I wonder what steaming pile of shit they had before they came up with this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The epic will have sub-par stats and a ratio<br />
Where did you get this information from?  I've not seen any info about its stats and ratio.<br />
<br />
From what I've heard from beta testers, OOW has item mudflation the likes of which EQ has never seen before.  Given that, I would expect the epic to blow away anything from previous expansions - even the 1.5 version.<br />
cause we all have problems with aggro.. right???1?<br />
How can you make statements about our aggro problems (or lack thereof) when you don't know how much aggro the other classes will be generating in OOW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shoot me, I'm a cynic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Come on, are you seriously expecting something great?  Where have you been the last 5 years??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The epics were pretty damn cool when they came out, and all through Velious too. It wasn't until high end Luclin that they started being commonly replaced AT ALL. They did a good job on the actual epic items, their mistake was simply not updating them at all with the times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm not saying this is the case, I'm just speculating -<br />
<br />
At least some Paladins have lamented that the LDoN Anger augs are Warrior only and have suggested that having to cast stuns to hold aggro both cuts down on DPS and costs mana. There ya go - a Paladin tanking weapon.  Halfway there, just add an aggro aug and you've got your own EoE with better DMG/DLY.<br />
<br />
Also, if history provides any guidance, the 0.0 second stun component is likely at release to be widely resisted. This is true of virtually every Warrior DD + stun aggro proc. Also, weapons that proc a stun have been reigned in quite a bit. The stun component isn't there to interrupt casters, it's there to provide resisted stun aggro.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how much aggro the Warrior Epic proc might generate. However it's interresting that Paladins are getting help with their aggro control and Warriors are getting help with their group utility. Some members of each class have made comments suggesting they were difficient in these areas, well we can't accuse SoE of not listening.<br />
<br />
Pardon me for saying so, but were I a Paladin I would have wanted a Hopebringer-like proc. To me that proc, the Fabled Ghoulbane proc, the undead DD weapon buffs, Soulfire right-click effect, and even Knight's Blessing are Paladin weapon defining, not an aggro proc with DD. Oh well, it's unique kinda.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Vie uses slot 1, this proc uses slot 12, the two stack.  It's only a question as to whether you'd end up with 20% mitigation instead of 10%.<br />
<br />
Another issue that you might want to consider, is the idea of &quot;How many mobs will be able to attack more than one person at a time?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">About the paladin proc, the wording is just confusing would be my guess.
