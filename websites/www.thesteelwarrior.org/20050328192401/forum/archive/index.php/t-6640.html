<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, the guild I'm currently in has probably 40-50 ele flagged people, although only 10-15 are online at any given time. We average around 40 people online nightly, with more showing up on VT nights, and other big targets. For the moment, the guild is doing mainly ssra key farming, ssra nameds and emp, and VT. We've recently lost quite a few key members, and should have the new wave of recruiting done soon. Once this is complete, we will probably go back to the tougher pre-ele targets as well as VT, so stuff like rz/lmm/agnarr/bertox/etc should be pretty routine (except maybe rallos, but thats another story)<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, we should be able to field ele (mini?)raids in a few weeks or a month, and I was wondering if any of you could point out some of the easier targets with the best risk vs. reward. Name, zone, general info would be great, or a full blown guide to a certain target in particular (or links to existing threads/guides) would be even better. Targets killable by 3-5 groups would be nice; we generally like to overkill new targets until we get the fight to go like clockwork.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoE mud and earth ring for 4-5 groups. most anything else is going to take 6+ groups.<br />
<br />
i guess the easiest elemental mold dropper until you reach earth b is the frog in pofire. all mobs are 3 day spawns +- 18 hours. frog you could probably do with 5 groups.<br />
<br />
you can make some pet mephits to help with dps if your enchanters are good, cut down some on the dps you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">New guilds tend to go after the twin birds in Fire, doable with lower #s but their common loots tend to be... common and will start going to twinks fairly quick.  Druav in Fire is good practice for Reparm.  Pyro is probably the easiest mob and is farm material with low #s.  Avatars in air aren't difficult, it's just dealing with trash clearings, but you can farm the first 3 once to learn the zone.  Splitting the confused elementals is fun.  Spider island.. just.. sucks.<br />
<br />
Fighting in water blows, but Wise isn't too difficult, same with hydro.  Krziik the Mighty you might need higher numbers til your gear catches up but KtM is doable with 40-45 with your gear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on your server's situation, you may be able to find some PoAir named up that don't drop molds, but have ok/good loot when you're starting elementals. Most guilds skip them from what I've seen, even if they're killing the Avatars in the same buildings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is soooo wrong !<br />
<br />
1) Raperm<br />
2) Ginto<br />
3) Wise<br />
<br />
Water + 2k5 Hitter + Rampage + 2000DD AE + AE Stun = Lame<br />
<br />
PoE Ring 1 (Peregrin) &amp; Air Avatars 1 2 &amp; Air Mini &amp; Pyronis/Fenix/Duav are  probably doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Air Avatars 1 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can do Wind, you can do Mist.  And of course Smoke is easy, and actually respawns now afaik. So yeah, make that Avatars 1 2 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ain't that the truth.<br />
<br />
I don't recall Magmaton being too difficult either and he's got some of the nicer Fire drops outside the Fennin script.</div></div><hr />

Wise only hits ~ 1.6 or 1.7k; haven't done him in ages but my previous guild did him with low 30s (army of 2boxers) as we were entering the elementals.  Wise wasn't effected by the change Sony did on most of the elemental mobs (more hp and more difficult to resist AEs.)  Bulwark of Alendar, bard elemental chorus, lev on your melee, and a somewhat controlled push and Wise isn't a difficult kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We killed Pyronis the first time we went to fire with ~24 people.  He's very doable for a small raid.  Probably the charm birds and maybe druav as well.  Of course finding them up will be the bigger challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avatar of Mist can be a pain with that 1500AE though if you aren't careful.  My guild usually has a hard time finding good Elemental targets up because we got so many guilds.  Another one just got Time access last week and they were hardcore so hopefully maybe we can find that Frog up for once.  Elementals are gonna turn to shit on my server before long because of this stupid open raid shit that has been going on as now they are starting to go after RZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
His AE is directional if ircc.  Easy enough.  Toggle attack off as needed for everyone but the MT.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no such thing as a directional AE.  The 1500 AE is centered on the MT.  It is identical to the AE procced by skygges and Kuanbyr in BOT sand tower.  If you figured those out previously, then you know how to handle this one too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avatar of Mist can be a pain with that 1500AE though if you aren't careful. <br />
30 range iirc.  There's no reason to get hit by it unless your tank isn't good at walking the mob and everyone stands by the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow looks like I have a bit of researching to do on all these mobs. Thank you all for the abundant and high quality responses. Not sure if we have many pofire flagged people yet, as I believe we've either done solro once or maybe never, and the people who are fire flagged probably tagged along with another guild. I will definitely look into all the ring events though, and try to get a few solro kills for the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep farming Jiva if your monks still need REBBs and you have low #s or something to do after the raid is done - it's a nice DPS weapon for them since Reparm's drop rate on FSoZ isn't has high.  The 1hs and finger item he drops is also great for other melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can take 2 or 3 groups to do him whenever he pops too, and pick up some ornate along the way.   :D</div></div><hr />
