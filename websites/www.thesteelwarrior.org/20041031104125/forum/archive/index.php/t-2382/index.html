<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in the process of trying to sweet talk some GM smiths into getting cultural atm. (no success yet. GM smiths must not be online the same time as me for some odd reason.) I was looking to do  mix of gear and I would like to hear some suggestions on velious plate to camp (read: camp for an hour get fed up and buy it.) that would be an upgrade to cultural. RZ worshiping OOger btw. Funds are limited to how much my pet druid ( Yeah I know. If it makes ya feel better/flame less I haven't played my druid since I made the war.)can farm outa rath. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, as an RZ oger the only upgrades to cultural you are going to get are going to be big ticket items - Helm of RZ, Boots of the Storm, Velium encrusted gaunts, some ornate molds (legs, maybe arms, maybe gaunts). A full suit of RZ cultural is pretty sweet.</div></div><hr />
