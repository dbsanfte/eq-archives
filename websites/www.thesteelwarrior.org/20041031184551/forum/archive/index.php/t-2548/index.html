<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at a bit of a dileema, we have been doing bot named alot lately and gotten quie a few ornate plate bps.  Alot of the other guild warriors tell me I should get a kizrak's to replace my vindi with. To me vindi is still better, only real dif bewteen the 2 are 18ac and 15hp....plus vindi is better saves and has AoB.  What do you guys think?  Mind you there are alot of other plate classes that could use upgrades also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had this same problem.  Initially I put off ever putting in for the Ornate BP, because its a much bigger upgrade for clerics and other classes than for a warrior who already has a vindi BP.  Eventually we got so many, though, that I got one and I do think its a nice if minor upgrade over vindi.  I mean sure I miss the AoB, but the extra AC and Hps more than make up for that IMO.  As for the resists, well just keep the vindi BP around as part of your resist gear kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ornate &gt; vindi IMO.<br />
<br />
Tanks I know either have upgraded their vindi to Ornate, or want to.  The Aob and resists are nice, but the 17 more raw AC really out does the ole vindi for most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With my various AA's I saw an effective 30 AC and 29 HP upgrade by switching to Kizrak bp.<br />
<br />
Now looking toward Luclin, it appears to me that there is no real upgrade from Kizrak's bp in Luclin except for the Aten bp - unless you need more stamina I guess (Seru/Cursed bp's have lots of stamina).<br />
<br />
The Shield of the Arcane effect absolutely rocks for xping in the absence of a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Minor upgrade, effect comes in handy sometimes.  But I'd rather get the legs than the BP (wearing Vindi).  Also the gloves would be nice just for the effect.  Otherwise I wouldn't want any Ornate.  Just depends on your DKP situation.  I might be wearing this Vindi BP for a good while... since Raex and Rathe BPs are so rare and I'd rather upgrade an earring, range item, bracer, etc before my BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After a deal of thinking I have decided to stick with my vindi, like Sulvar said its a bigger upgrade for alot of other people.  Oh and Splaktar I got the legs, won them off of Gaukar before drops were improved!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kizrak is :<br />
+ : More AC<br />
+ : More HP<br />
+ : Awesome effect (i dont have 2 comps &amp; a pocket shaman)<br />
<br />
- : Less resists (like who cares about these anymore)<br />
- : 14 less atk (big deal)<br />
<br />
It is the 6th BP in the game (Raex / Rathe / AHR / Seru / Speed).<br />
And as you can see the other 5 are either a myth, or insanely rare.<br />
<br />
Much better than Vindic/Statue. Much much much much better<br />
<br />
If you can get one, DO IT, you will never regret it trust me.<br />
If the dilema is you vs someone else, well thats your call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe my guild is a lot different from other mid range guilds out there, but we owned eindride icestorm enough times that nearly ALL of our plate classes ended up with ornate bp... hell, we saw 2 drop off him on more than one occasion.  There's no excuse not to have one if your guild can muster a 4 group raid party with avg lvl of at least 63, unless you are in a guild that is after bigger and better things, in which case you will likely have one of the 5 better bps that Emilia listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea we can do Eindre with extreme ease and have had a good many drop and sometimes 2.  I might consider getting in on one abit down the road thats for sure, but atm I think im good where I'm at.  We also only raid 2 nights a week so thats sorta a problem too, the lack of Eindre being up if/when we decide to raid.  Thanks for all the input guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Or if your guild just is unlucky with bp drops.<br />
No AHR bp in half a dozen or more kills (2 mails of judgement-wiscaster only, 1 robe), no seru bp in almost a dozen kills, 1 cursed bp (only off the last cursed we killed and that is not that good), although 3 bloodfrenzies so i wont complain here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get kizrak bp unless your guild does VT or Seru often.<br />

bp of speed / shadow platemail / yttruim bps own~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well ironically we did Eindre along with others tonight, 2 plate bp's again and I got one default so now I'm sporting one!  Just can't seem to let go of my vindi /cries<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The Chestplate of Vindication was the best in the game back in velious.  Even in Luclin stuff like the seru bp weren't a major upgrade thanks to the AC soft cap.  Well, those days are over, and people need to get out of  the mindset that 17 ac is a &quot;minor&quot; upgrade.  Remember when people estimated that 1 ac = 10  hps?  Is 170 hps a minor upgrade in your eyes?  Even if you only figure 5 hps/ac 17 ac is a huge upgrade.  Comparing Kizrak's to Vindicator should be a no-brainer.  Kizraks is FAR superior to the Vindi breastplate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kizraks is nice but if you're ahr / seru'able and are pretty much in lead for pts / merrit I wouldn't bother wasting either of them on one over a vindi. If you have no hope of the seru / ahr / txvd? bp of speed then go for it as others said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so a 28ac bracer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=32186) is better than Spirit wracked cords (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5723) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know my friends were happy to pull me out of my cobalt BP and get me in the Ornate BP, that's for sure!  I was almost constantly passed up for merits on it.<br />
<br />
If you want to use the 28AC, or the SWC, go for it, I'd rather just get a crystalized acid bracer and be done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This should be an absolute no brainer. Unless you already have Raex / Rathe / AHR / Seru / Speed, then get ornate and wear it until you can get Raex's. There is no excuse for not getting ornate for everyone in your guild. As many as 2 per 6 hours (8 a day) can drop if you stay on top of the spawn. 2 good groups or 3 balanced groups can take out the tower named so get some friends and start farming. You can probably get a dozen or more ornate plate BPs in the time it would take you to get any 1 of the 5 better BPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Your guild spends DKP on ornate legs?  Ornate legs are one-group-able.  It should not be an either-or choice of kizrak bp vs. legs or gauntlets.  For that matter, the ornate bp is extremely available too: 3 spawns a day x 3 loot slots / 6 items in the loot table, and that's just in BoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, so with your logic the thread poster should just get heavy yttrium and be done with it ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I suspect you had no better reason than being contrary for posting that stupid bracer thing earlier Trondiir, but I'll humor you. 28ac on one hand, 12ac 130 hp on the other (5sta x 6).<br />

250 + aob &gt; 280</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think saying &quot;1ac =10hp&quot; or formula like that is as stupid. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well then how about telling me how many HP AoB is equal to?<br />
<br />
If you're gonna bitch about him posting an example that defies your 10hp = 1ac logic, then please tell us exactly how many HP effects are worth.  From what i'm seeing here, AoB is at least worth 31hp.</div></div><hr />
