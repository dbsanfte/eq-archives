When I see all the new high end damage weapons still<br />

why warriors are touted to be about weapons and armor,<br />
obviously we're a distant 3rd for tanking choice.<br />

Other than that, we also have damn near aggro lock ourselves due to incite and weapon procs (which ARE common enough). Even beyond that, a knight has to be better equiped to have the same hp, due to our innate (though decidely minor) hp bonus. People have gone over this time and again, and I truly feel that the classes are as balanced as they've ever been. Where were you 6 months ago when everyone felt the way you're complaining?</div></div><hr />

<br />
we still have the capability of pouring out respectable DPS with mediocre_weapons plus now having the 'Incite' line f aggro generation..... if you think you're a 3rd rate tank choice you really need to take a good look at yourself and maybe invest some time/confidence in yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks to the lack of an off hand weapon, offense and weapon skills both 25 points lower, and time spent casting.. We generate significantly less melee DPS even with these 'superior' one handers. Which is the way it should be. Since there's little to no defensive benefit from wielding a shield, it's all two handers from there, and even the Pal/Shd/Ber 2 handers aren't that completely out of whack with warrior enabled ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  You do NOT NEED AAS TO HOLD AGGRO. Can't stress this enough. GoD just now released a proc increasing AA. Believe it or not, most warriors don't have this yet. Offensive AAs unfortunately aren't the end all for aggro either. There have been a billion threads on which weapons hold aggro well, cheap and easy to get. Especially if you can get them augmented with anger 2/3 or a stun, you will do just fine. You have incite at whatever level you are. <br />

<br />
&quot;looking to buy a good pally weapon if anyone has one for sale&quot;<br />
<br />
soooo..<br />
<br />
i do a quick search in the bazaar ( i am still in the process of finding a new neck piece so i can get my ST key   /rude ) and see 7..yes, SEVEN, Mace(s) of the Fallen Crusader ( that stupid 21/25 pally mace ) and i went ahead and tell the guy<br />
<br />
/t soandso, &quot;you know you'll get a much better weapon for 100 plat if you go buy ( weapon link )&quot;<br />
<br />
he tells me &quot;wow where did you find it and why does it cost 100 plat?&quot;<br />
<br />
i reply &quot;dunno, there's always 7 or more for sale on a given night; i'm guessing it's a common drop&quot;<br />
<br />
so the little pally runs off and buys it; 30 minutes later he's level 8 ( he was level 2 when he was in the bazaar before ) and vanquishing goblins in misty thicket thanking me for recommending it to him.<br />
<br />
Off Topic; but I guess helping the newb was fun. He sounded thrilled.</div></div><hr />

Knight 2H or 1H beats Warrior at the end.  Greatblade of Chaos is by far a better 2H than the Vanazir.  Let's not even talk about 1H weapons.<br />
<br />
Monks, Warriors, Knights are all on the same damage table.  Monks, who are supposed to be the best damage dealers from front, gets the best ratio weapons.  Logically Warriors would have the second best weapons, but we do not...</div></div><hr />

It was appropriate in terms of damage output to, say, Velious, where we got them. Swinging a 20/20 doesn't do nearly as much without the skill and attack to back it up. Mind you, I don't want more, just trying to point out that even with what appears to you to be an inflated weapon, the gap that should be there is there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forgot what the difference between the DBoW + EoE parse is versus Vanazir, but I've a feeling if you take Vanazir and then scale it to a 53/30 (Greatblade of Chaos) it'd do more damage than the previous combo.  So GoC has better ratio than DBoW + EoE, because if a warrior could use GoC he'd do more damage with that than DBoW + EoE.  That's not right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's something about this discussion that keeps creeping into the back of my head and makes me wonder a LOT about 2handers and 1handers. That's this badass little weapon that elemental monks drool over:<br />
<br />
Fiery Staff of Zha <br />
<br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 2.5 Size: SMALL <br />
Slot: PRIMARY<br />
  <br />
Damage: 35 Delay: 20 <br />
<br />
Damage Bonus: 14<br />
 <br />
AC: +18 Str: +18 Dex: +20 Sta: +20 Wis: +25 Disease Resist: +20 Cold Resist: +25 Magic Resist: +20 HP: +185 Mana: +185  <br />

 <br />
 Effect: Flame of the Efreeti<br />
2: Decrease Hitpoints by 100<br />
 <br />
Type: Combat <br />
 <br />
 <br />
This weapon in the hands of a monk parses out very very well. It also parses well in the hands of a beastlord. It's damage bonus is pathetically low because it's beneath 28 delay.<br />
<br />
What it has going for it is AAs (stuff like punishing blade for instance) ... as well as triple attack for monks (which beastlords don't have, but this weapon is still popular with beastlords so I'm not sure how big a deal triple attack really is) ... and it's insane ratio, which at extremely high levels of ATK really kicks it up a notch.<br />
<br />
Soooooooooo ...<br />
<br />
I'm left wondering why knight 1handers suck so much? Is it cause their ratio isn't anywhere close to a Zha's staff? Or is it something in the code? Is it the lack of triple attack? Or what?<br />
<br />
IF there were a paladin 1hander that was equal to a Zha's ... would it be viable?<br />
<br />
I dunno. I'm curious. Because Zha's really is a great monk weapon. And it helped the entire monk community rethink the value of big 2hander damage bonuses among other things.<br />
<br />
What happens when you switch from a fast, low dmg bonus 2hander like this, to a 1hander that has a great ratio?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">graderr</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO it is the combination of having DPS(of the weapon) lost from casting and the fact that knights don't get any extra attack AA's fro one handers like they do for 2hders that makes most knights choose 2hders over 1hders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage bonus for 2 handers is coded much higher than 1 handers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Only for over a certain delay (28 I think?). That staff has a 1 handed weapon damage bonus.<br />
<br />
  In my opinion, the main reason knights do less damage is because of lower skill caps. 225 in weapon skills (compared to 250 for warriors), 235 double attack (245 for warriors) and 225 offense (252 for warriors). Combine that with no triple attack with 1 handed weapons and you have a very significant reduction in damage. The insane ratio doesn't make up for all of those differences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the insane ratio does make up for your caps.  That's the problem.</div></div><hr />

At 28 the DB jumps from 14 to 35 for 2 handed weapons. I guess 1 handers cap at 13, not 14, which is a pretty insignificant difference imo.<br />
<br />
Actually the insane ratio does make up for your caps. That's the problem. <br />
  He was specifically talking about knight 1 handed weapons. I haven't seen a 1 handed knight weapon being used other than for pure tanking hp/ac &lt;shrugs&gt; I doubt there's any 1 handed knight weapon that does anywhere near warrior damage. Here's a link to some pally weapon parses, take note of the 2hs towards the bottom of the first post. Definitely below the 2 handers.<br />
<br />
 Also, if you look at the high end DPS parse thread in the Overlord's Sanctuary, you'll find that the best knight 2 handed weapons come up short compared to warriors. Whether or not knight spells add too much damage is a balancing question I'm not interested in.<br />
<br />
  Also, I am a warrior. If by &quot;your caps&quot; you're suggesting that I'm a knight, you're mistaken.</div></div><hr />

Both have a 1hander's damage bonus. But both are very competitive DPS for their level in the game.<br />

If a knight 1hander were given a ratio comprable to something like that, would it be viable?</div></div><hr />

No need to make them better.  Yes of course it loses to DW or 2H, because you're using a weapon and a shield.<br />
<br />
With shields actually having a significant effect at the high end (shielding mod, ridiculously high AC) I think it's fair for 1H to do 75% the damage of 2H.  If needed add some shielding mods or whatever to the 1H weapons too.  There's also no reason for Knight 2H to have better ratio than Warrior 2H.  That's like saying Monks should have less than normal ratios because they have better damage table and slightly higher skills (252 vs 250).</div></div><hr />

Take a look at the link that I meant to post. Pay specific attention to the Ornate Greatblade and Crow Footed Lance DPS compared to the SEWS DPS. Also note the Ornate Broadsword down at the bottom. With that low of delay/DB, I'm guessing that a 1 handed knight weapon with a 35/20 damage/delay would beat out a SEWS in DPS. There doesn't seem to be any hidden bonuses for using a 2 hander.<br />

Thanks for the link. Really interesting stuff there. Makes me ponder that question a ton more, heh. I'm starting to agree with you when you say &quot;I'm guessing that a 1 handed knight weapon with a 35/20 damage/delay would beat out a SEWS in DPS. &quot;<br />
<br />
2handed weapon biased AA's probably make a bit of a difference (don't knights get two of them? Like speed of the knight and knight's advantage? I dunno, I'm not up on my knight AAs these days and don't feel like digging out my book).<br />
<br />
But hmmmmmmm ... the DPS disparity isn't as huge as one would think. Better ratio 1handers might indeed flout convention and shift peoples' thinking regarding knights and 1handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, maybe a 35/20 wouldn't beat out a SEWS for a knight but I suspect it'd be getting pretty close. The 26/20 (+1 fire/undead) is coming up about 20 DPS less than a SEWS, but 8-9 (depending on how much you count the fire damage as) more base damage is very significant. <br />
<br />
Compare, in that thread, the Greatstaff of Misery (46/35) and the Spear of Fire (44/35). The straight melee DPS was 81.07 to 75.79, approximately a 5 DPS change from a change of 2 base damage. I'll now take that idea as a generalization (and probably not very accurate one) and apply it to the hypothetical 35/20 1 handed weapon (hereafter named &quot;Superfly T.N.T.&quot;), and use the Ornate Broadsword as a base.<br />
<br />
 First, I'm going to assume that the fire damage always landed in that parse, underestimating the damage, and call the Ornate Broadsword a 27/20 weapon. We'd have to change the base damage of the Ornate Broadsword by 8 to be equal to Superfly T.N.T. From the above, at 5 DPS per 2 base damage, we have Super Fly T.N.T. doing (70.39 + 20) = 90 DPS, almost exactly the same as the SEWS. And we all know the knights would rather be beating mobs down with Superfly T.N.T. and a shield than just some silly sword.<br />
<br />
  Disclaimer: What I did above was BAD MATH. Specifically, the base damage matters differently to a faster weapon than a slower weapon. It doesn't really work like I pretended, but perhaps it gives us some generalized estimation of Superfly T.N.T.<br />
<br />
JULES: You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm &quot;SUPERFLY T.N.T,&quot; I'm the &quot;GUNS OF NAVARONE.&quot; I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overlord's Sanctuary Parses (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3803) : Lots of interesting parses. Note particularly the GBoC DPS vs the DPS of a Vanazir in warrior hands, and in knight hands. Those caps mean a hell of a lot.<br />
<br />
Personally, given all this, I think the knight weapons are about where they should be. Not quite competive with what a warrior's dealing with pure melee: They shouldn't be. In general, there's a performance hit going from a 2 hander to a 1 hander and shield. 75-80% of a 2 hander is a reasonable sacrifice, I think. That's the way it should be. There should be a real defensive bonus to it before time shields, but oh well. <br />

Wubao, about the Zha staff: The primary reason knights gravitate towards higher bonus weapons over fast ones is very simple: Lack of attack. Without the higher attacks and damage tables, we hit for minimum damage much, much more than a monk. This is the way it should be. Therefore, it is more beneficial for us to prop op the low end of our melee as far as possible, rather than to go for weapons by pure ratio.  Enough vengeance makes up for this, making one handers a viable choice again, in ele/time double effect gear. Before that: Well, Pre-Luclin I went from a 25/25 one hander to a 40/45 2 hander, and went from 20 DPS melee to 45 DPS melee. It was.. an eye opener, to say the least.</div></div><hr />

They added the weapons to increase Knight damage - it worked for those that could get them or afford them.  In reality, knight weapons should be no better then any other class - SOE should have adjusted the weapons caps instead.<br />
