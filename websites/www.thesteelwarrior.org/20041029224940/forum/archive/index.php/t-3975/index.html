<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a quick and cheap way to upgrade my agro setup from my GSoT...and I think the best thing I can see right now would be adding a LDoN anger proc to it.  The AngerII proc aug (+400 Hate) is only 510 points in EF, while the AngerII proc (+600 hate) is 1150 points.<br />
<br />
The GSoT plus either one of these should hold pretty solid agro.<br />
<br />
Anybody tried this out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you spend most of your time XP'ing, I'd say go for it. GSoT works great for me when XPing, but isn't the greatest for raid tanking. Add the anger to it and I am sure it'd be superb agro for XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kurim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm a MA for a NToV-raiding guild.  I can't really comment on stuff higher than that level of content.  On the other hand, Anger 3 on my GSoT was one of the largest improvements to gameplay that I've seen since... er, well quite a while.  Although I can't say I've seen dramatic raid aggro increase, I have seen improvement.  XP group wise, the nukers &amp; slowers I group with regularly have commented frequently on the increase in aggro.<br />
<br />
If the question is, how does that stack up to an EB weapon or something along those lines, I wish I could tell ya ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as plain old XP goes, GSoT = CHSD/Red Epic approximately. I usually use the GSoT simply for DPS increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I replied to this in another thread but my experience with GSoT and anger 2 has been rather spectacular in run of the mill LDoN groups/exp groups.  For the cost of a GSoT and 510pts a fairly robust and economic agro solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would not spend the points for Anger3 to use on a weapon that you'll likely be replacing in the near future. Anger2 would probably be a better compromise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What would the average casual player likely upgrade to besides SoD+BoC? I'm not in a raiding guild, we have done Vindi, thats about it. I used GSoT and 10 seconds of solo then called assist, had aggro till 5 seconds into Enrage.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to seem sarcastic, it is a serious question for those of us with small guilds or short playtimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you can do two adventures a day, go for Anger III for now.<br />
<br />
If you do less, than do anger II or Ykesha (both 510 points) to get max effect asap!<br />
<br />
More agro = more people like you = more groups = more points!<br />
<br />
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</div></div><hr />
