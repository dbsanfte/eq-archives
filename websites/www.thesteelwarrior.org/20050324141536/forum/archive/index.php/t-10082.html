<br />
<br />
Just curious about the average hps and damage they dish out. I know Krigers in BoT are a pain because they have around 50k hps, but they are doable<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in WoS can only be partially slowed, while most (if not all?) mobs in BoT can be fully slowed. Some have chaos claws which is really lame, but then again some giants in BoT have 1500dd procs (but they don't go off nearly as much as CC). Mobs have about 22-25k hp from the damage I deal according to my parses when duoing with my cleric in WoS. Named have about 50k so similar to BoT.<br />
<br />
Kriger max hit = 717 iirc<br />
named max hit in WoS (field 2) = ~776<br />
normal mob in BoT = 560<br />
normal mob in WoS = 630-660ish<br />
<br />
XP in WoS &gt; XP in BoT by far, plus better loot.<br />
<br />
I tried duoing the Chimera Deathbringer and got it to 49% before I forgot to heal my cleric and he died from low health agro from the AE so they aren't very hard since my cleric died with 70% mana :). I am unable to duo wing bosses in BoT (well I haven't tried for a while since th xp sucks and I have no desire to go back:D)</div></div><hr />

South of the wall with a decent group you'll probably survive. I would in general say that WoS is significantly harder than BoT, payn's summary seems reasonable. WoS mobs can snare you, dot you, and otherwise debuff you more painfully than BoT in addition to mitigating slow, so in general it makes for more exciting hunting.</div></div><hr />

I always fight with my friends. 65 Shaman, Cleric, Monk, Rogue, Warrior<br />
<br />
So we usually grab a 5th for dps or CC depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
With a shaman slowing all the time and a cleric healing (they each have 75+aa) I think maybe it should be doable. We will start on the south, easy side to begin with. After I get a chunk of defensive AA's we will probably try North, and then after that, and some upgrades/more aa's we might venture in to mess with mPg (though I understand that is a far reach for me, but by the time im 70 , Cler and Sham will be 70 with better hp buffs for me :)</div></div><hr />

If we are flying in BoT I might get an AA in an hour and a half. The mobs in Wos have same or less hps, and give an AA in an hour I hear, so even if we kill a little slower maybe it will be comparable? Will definitely update the post with how it goes. This probably will be after the new years.</div></div><hr />

As you can see, the min damages stayed about the same.  The max damage went up some though, or in the case of a few of the one groupabled named like Warfiend it went up by a lot.  The biggest difference by far obviously is the partial slows.<br />
<br />
I may be off by a 20 to 30 dmg on a few of those, I didn't have 2 fights parsed for all of  them.  I was using a 2 fight standard for being sure I got min/max right.  But the vast majority of those are right.<br />
<br />
Not sure how much this helps, but GL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on level entirely!  At 70 I am lucky to get 1% AA per kill in the south field.  This results in an AA every 2.5 hours or so. And I get about 2% AA per kill in the north field, which is noticeably harder then south field due to the Elites (which means CC proc) etc. Which results in about an AA every 1.5 hours.<br />
<br />
In BoT I get 1% AA a kill. No matter where I go. Still about 2.5 Hours per AA.<br />
<br />
At lower levels around 65 or so you might see as much as 5% AA per kill in north field.  In which case with a good group you can see an AA every 45min.  Or in the South field at 65 you can get 3% AA a kill and get an AA every hour or so.<br />
<br />
XP scales down quickly as you level, to a point where the south field is not worth your time at level 68 and your forced to go to the north field for good xp in WoS.<br />
<br />
I am guessing its not an option, but you can still get 4% AA per kill at tables/c2 in PoFire at 70. If you can't go there, MPG is the next best thing at 4% AA per kill also, just quite a bit harder then PoFire imo.</div></div><hr />

I know for a fact he hits over 1800 because I have tanked him :P<br />

No Militis hits over 560, not sure what a Vind Druid is tho...</div></div><hr />

<br />
65 Shaman, Cleric, Monk, Rogue, Warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
No CC sucked, but we handled 2 a few times without wiping... <br />
<br />
<br />
I did fine on normal mobs. Monk pulled, I got aggro, and after it was slowed it was a walk on the beach. The problem is with their INSANE aggro range we got 2 or more a few times. Before they were slowed, I couldnt tank 2 at once very well, even disc'd... I need AoE taunt and some more defensives.<br />

bling bling, ND1 done now ;) 8aa total 7633 hps buffed with virtue and focus.. If I had conviction brells and wounshi, it would be closer to 9k</div></div><hr />

No Militis hits over 560, not sure what a Vind Druid is tho...<br />
<br />
On the Dragorn Champion, I have only had the one fight against him and I couldn't find the defensive message.  It seems I probably did use defensive on him then, so his max hit on me was for 1100 with defensive.<br />
<br />
As for the Militis thing, when I typed this up I was confused by it also, but there were three fights that showed a &quot;Vind Militis&quot; hitting for that hard.  They very well could of been the tower versions of Militis but after confirming it from three different fights I feal confident in saying your wrong about &quot;No Militis hits over 560&quot;. Either that or the nameless server has Militis that do steriods =)</div></div><hr />

I calculated it and with Wunshi, Oak, Balikor (sp?), and BBB you get just over 3000hp (I think it was 3001 exactly). Toss on Talisman of Fortitude if you already have max STA and you should get another 100-200, so 8600 does sound about right now that I look at it again. :)</div></div><hr />

The AA's will make a big difference, but I am wondering if maybe an AC boost may be another remedy you should try looking into.  I know...I know, easier said then done, but lowering the damage spikes from the melee damage can really help nullify the damage spikes from the procs.<br />
