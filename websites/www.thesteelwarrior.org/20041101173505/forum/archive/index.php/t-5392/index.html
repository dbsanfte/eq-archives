<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mrdull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard a rumor about a warrior useable dark elf illusion mask , supposedly from guk adventures . wasnt clear if it was supposed to be a drop or point buyable . but since i can find no info about it at the LDoN equipment site i research , Im assuming its just a rumor. Can anyone confirm or deny this rumor please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarn_Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There use to be such a mask, that was able to be cast, from the inventory. The item was called Guise of the Deceiver, I think.<br />
<br />
This originally game from the old Dungeons of Upper &amp; Lower Guk, not the LDoN Guk...<br />
<br />
They fixed it a long time ago, so that it can not be used from the inventory any longer, and hence only used by Rogues or Bards.<br />
<br />
When the Casino's went live, for a day or so, They offered this mask, useable by anyone, as a prize, all though very rare of a prize....<br />
<br />
Perhaps if the Casino's return, the mask may return, but perhaps not.</div></div><hr />
