can some one at least give us the foot notes on it or throw out the highlights. at least give up what spawned the entire thing. <br />
all this publicity's really sparked my intrest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So a young warrior named Zhenobia visits the boards. She plays on the FV server. She's into the roleplaying thing. She tries to make her presence felt with a few inoccuous posts like a hello everyone thread.<br />
<br />
Then she makes a comment in the Holy Paladins Crusade thread, which sparks an argument between her and me. Fine. Whatever. These things happen.<br />
<br />
Then she asks for some advice on horses.<br />
<br />
I offer some advice. She flips out, as is fast becoming her thing. I then get confrontational, since I was only offering advice on horses ... something I know a thing or two about in EQ. She gets more pissed off, and accuses me of stalking her from thread to thread. I back off, since a mod asks me too.<br />
<br />
A couple other people crack on her for freaking out. She takes these people for friends of mine. Homies jumping to my aid. Which is pretty funny considering how many people have called me idiot, asshat, retard and asshole on this and other message boards.<br />
<br />
The fight ensues.<br />
<br />
She takes it to a whole OTHER level ... and starts this thread in the outhouse about how the community at the steel warrior is a clique of immature male sexist jerks.<br />
<br />
She says to bring the flames, she's ready for them.<br />
<br />
The community responds by flaming her.<br />
<br />
This is where it gets good.<br />
<br />
Even Raaj says a thing or two to her, as she calls into question the mods, and the administration of the site and forums.<br />
<br />
At each turn she's getting cracked on, and pretty much owned EQ-style. But she presses onward, bring the flames to a raging inferno. Back and forth and back and forth. The thread lights up like a christmas tree ... surpassing the TSW record for posts in roughly 4 hours.<br />
<br />
One of my all-time best flames was in there. Sandwiched between some classic retorts in their own right, on lonely page 13.<br />
<br />
But by page 20-something, Shik and quite a few others have simply passed me by on the ownage scale.<br />
<br />
A female warrior stops by and takes digs at her, for totally missing the mark on the sexism issue.<br />
<br />
Oh it was good stuff.<br />
<br />
Such drama. Such raw, unfiltered flaming. So very, VERY outhouse.<br />
<br />
And it didn't have a thing to do with class balance or any of the old tired, done to death issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4487 &lt;-- the catalyst<br />
<br />
Zhenobia overreacted and threw a fit because I didn't deal with the &quot;offenders&quot; to her satisfaction. Afterwards, she threw out some self-pitying, hypocritical, and cliche arguments...she couldn't actually debate the issues at hand. Raaj, Shik, FyreStorm, and Frodlin pretty much owned her up and down. She eventually ran out of fuel and the thread died. A few hours after, the thread vanished.<br />
<br />
Like I said, nothing really extraordinary. =) Good for a few laughs but I've seen far better rants.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I was the only one that wanted to call her on her skewed sense of self.  No matter what would have happened, as she saw it, this already was the old boys club and it was her mission to snuff out the 'sexist male' views here.....views that until now, have been expressed, shared, and valued by BOTH the guys and the gals that come here.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure the regulars like Azlana, Raychael, Bunnie, Emilia, Hulanta, Redhenna, Vigdis, and any others that I cant think of right now would attest, they get just as much respect and probably far less jests than anyone else here.  I would go as far as to say that we (tsw as a whole) treats the gals that come here better than we would each other.  If not better, its definately equal, but by no means worse.<br />
<br />
I read these forums not because I have a warrior, not because I play a paladin, or sk, and their boards are crap, by all means.  No, I read these boards because they have more intelligent posts by more intelligent people than anywhere else.  No other boards have complete sentences by the majority of posters, as few mispelled words, members with nearly as wide a vocabulary, etc etc.  Out of all of the various boards, TSW and Shaman's Crucible are definately the most referred to boards on other classes boards, and lets keep it that way!</div></div><hr />

This community has always had a very respectful atmosphere. The beastlords are pretty respectful as well. (EDIT: BTW, I quote you, because I agree with you, in case that wasn't apparent, heh).<br />

<br />
Heh, well, mods say they never touched it.  It's not in the mods private forums.  It disappeared before the site crashed.  Do you have any other possible speculation as to how it left?  Because as far as I know, there is no other way for it to be deleted.  I don't think it's paranoia at all to believe she deleted it, as it is possible for the thread starter to delete the entire thread if they choose.  As for the hacking, etc, I don't have any evidence of anything, thus won't state an opinion on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, you guys haven't figured this out yet?  It's not paranoia.  We had a thread, the thread is now gone.  Who can delete threads?  The mods can, and the original thread starter can.  We have mods in this thread saying that it was not deleted, and that they didn't delete it, and that it's not in their &quot;deleted threads&quot; section that Shikarii has referred to before.  Whatever is left after you have eliminated the other possible answers must be the solution.  She deleted the thread and deleted her link to TSW afterwards, because she hasn't been back since.  It must have been some pretty hardcore Frodlin ownage.<br />
<br />
Jesus christ, sometimes 2 + 2 does indeed = 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pretty much caught that the culprit for the thread being gone was Zhen herself, due to the fact that mods say they didn't do anything with the thread. The only other suspect would be the thread starter.<br />
<br />
The paranoia/silliness/PUNCHLINE was me saying she was the one who hacked the site and brought it down for a week or so.<br />
<br />
The humor being, that right after her thread was nuked, the entire site was nuked. And she's been gone since the site came back up. You know the whole conspiracy thing.<br />
<br />
Now it's not funny anymore. And was BARELY funny before I had to explain it.<br />
<br />
Damn this sucks.</div></div><hr />

If someone actually can - I'd like to see it and we can get that fixed. I'm of the mind that if someone posts something they should think first, which is why I had that disabled to begin with. I'd remove the ability to even edit posts if I didn't make so many typos :(</div></div><hr />

I think we should ban her for destroying quite possibly the best piece of literature this board has, or ever will see.  It's an unforgivable offense.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rheven</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
I looked this over in passing and wanted to make a comment or two, please. I am redheaded wood elf warrior girl. Not a lot of us out there but some, girls or elfs. It is hard to be a woman warrior at times. I can remember when in my 20's every orge in the world seemed to be chasing me. I was getting proposals in /ooc and /shout that reverbed through the whole PC or HHK zone. It was highly embarrassing but funny now that I think about. <br />
<br />
I am a girl warrior. And I think good at it. When I'm not fighting I take my helmet off because I like the way my ponytail looks on black armor with red boots and guantlets. I like long bathes high in Kelethin when I decide to take a day down from the battles. I wish I could wear a dress sometimes like my cleric sister Joselle does. Something so nice about taking off that armor and putting on something casual, a graceful white gown, and then maybe opening some elven wine in the little house I have, up in the trees by Tunare's faithful. Can sit on my platform edge and look out over the forests where I was born. But when I fight that's what I do and I try to be the very best I can. <br />
<br />
I only really read and post here and on the cleric boards. I had more friendly and quick responses to really beginner questions here than anywhere else. No one ever said I was a redheaded girl and even worse a wood elf, now go away. People just treated me like I am, a warrior, and I thank you for that.<br />

That because to most people, it doesn't matter what you are.  To Zhenobia tho, it mattered for some reason, and it mattered to her.  She ended up digging her own grave really by taking everything to the extreme.</div></div><hr />

Yep, she kept shoving that chip on her shoulder into everyone's face and cried foul if someone was bothered by that chip in their face.</div></div><hr />

Actually some people do think I'm a ranger at first glance. And I do have a ranger sister of course, 40ish. But, she's the slut of the family. *lol* Takes me longer to offload the armor.<br />

I thought about a troll girl and passed cause they need so much support. wood elfs have much perkier little breasts. No one ever feared them though. Must be a size issue.<br />
