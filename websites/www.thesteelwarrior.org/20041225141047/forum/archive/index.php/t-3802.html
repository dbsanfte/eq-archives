  Most warriors tend to start backing up in this situation,trying to put themselves out of the mobs melee range.This rarely works and usually causes either one of two things.<br />
A. You dont get out of the way in time or the mob just takes a step forward and kills you anyway<br />
B.Mob turns on caster,stunning away the heal then proceeds to munch the group.<br />
<br />
Lately Ive started a new method that is much safer for me as well as the group.This is completely based on perception.No real way to &quot;prove&quot; it other than trying it yourself.Note:Only works well on large mobs<br />
When I am in a situation where a mob is probably gonna kill me before a heal lands,instead of backing away I actually run under the mob(assuming its a large mob )...Im still right next to it,but being behind it,it cant hit me without turning around, as it turns around, I back up to my original position,thus making it turn around again.Doing this enough will usually give enough time for a 3 sec heal or the CH to finish,but since Im still landing a couple hits every once in a while and I have the closest proximity Im not causing aggro on the rest of the grp.<br />
<br />
Works for me,and the cleric doesnt complain about lack of trust (Healers hate it when tanks backup)/grin<br />
<br />
I usually get the comment &quot;I dont know how you lasted so long at 5% &quot;</div></div><hr />

If so, you're probably living by avoiding riposte damage.  If I see a heal is going to be late I shut off attack to avoid ripostes and hold agro with taunt if need be.</div></div><hr />

And this theory is carfully worked out after you being able to loose aggro from a mob when you have 10% health and dump it onto casters?  Uh huh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Low HP agro, that means the mob will keep chewing on you till you are dead or get a heal :) what happens after the heal or your death, is a different matter.</div></div><hr />

What this guy is talking about is when you insert yourself inside some Mob's physical space and get the you cannot hit your target from there, they also treat you as though you do not exist.<br />
<br />
This happens all the time. I would be shocked if you had not experienced it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How else do you account for perfect MA'ing on Vindicator, then it gets pushed on top of you and 2 people die?<br />
<br />
You dont take a single other swing, get to where you can hit it again and it is on you for the rest of the fight :)<br />
<br />
I can't prove this with a log, but it seems to happen every time a mob gets pushed on top of you.<br />

Not that I think disagreeing with Solinar is good for the health HA HA</div></div><hr />

<br />
I usually try to turn off attack if I'm about to die, avoid that one extra ripoest.  Backing up can help too.<br />
<br />
other way is to find a healer that does not suck and watch too much tv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Im sure you know, Vindi is extremely proximatey aggro sensitive and that could be causing what you descibed.  I just have never experienced anything like you have described.<br />
<br />
Post logs if you can. Should be easy to see if the mob skips a round or if his melee delay is lengthened.<br />
<br />
If this was true, it would trivialize main tanking via simply running through a mob repeatedly once you have aggro.</div></div><hr />

I know the ranger was at archery distance but got killed anyway.<br />

Maybe they just overaggroed, but I also know it happened on the one second that I was told I could not hit my attacker from here.<br />

I suck at the logging :(<br />

I will try and turn it on for my next fight that is comparable.<br />

Only time I would use it is on a raid when MT goes down and mob can eat you before the first prayer of an /assist patch heal would land.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you turn attack off(given) and use evasive.  This should give a cleric the extra seconds to land that heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah turning off attack and hitting evasive are what I do if a heal won't land.  Either that or yell at the cleric to use divine arbitration already :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jakle, part of it might be that you are getting the cannot see your target message, so you aren't hitting the mob and thus not gaining any aggro.  I find myself quite often just a bit above the aggro of some higher aggro classes, so if I stop meleeing, they get summoned.  Also, are you sure the ranger was at archery range?  Due to the problems with archery, they can't hit cornered mobs, and have to be on the same wall as the mob if the mob is walled.  Then sometimes they can still be blocked by other chars.  Don't think any of our rangers used archery when we used to do vindi, other than right at the beginning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, being the SA on that fight I can attest to this fact........you died too =P That Vindi fight taught me why turning off autoattack on a late CH works. Jakle rules, period. Love the leezard.<br />
<br />
And as to the note on rampage by Chatja ogre, the ramp tank was a 65 paladin (Omaji) who lived through the fight. So death via the rampage list wasn't waht did it. But I just got back from the bar + Waffle House, so I can't really pay attention.</div></div><hr />

I dont think any of us want to LOSE agro, we just shut off attack briefly if necesary while waiting for a very late heal to land to avoid riposte... we shut off attack all the time on enrage ya know without losing agro very often  :P</div></div><hr />

I was talking about the first DA fight.<br />
<br />
I had ramapage on Renlor the warrior for that entire fight Chat man, and he never died :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me just say this then. <br />
<br />
Especially seeing the number of people who don't buy the theory just based on whether or not the mob can see you :)<br />
<br />
It seems as though you lose agro faster stepping inside the mob hitbox than you do just turning off attack :)<br />
<br />
Yes, it leads to a dead DPS class or two. One dead MA leads to a lot of dead everything classes though hehe :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just because your RT lived through the fight, doesn't mean he couldn't have lost rampage for a few rounds.  No idea if that's what happened, but rampage has a range, in addition to a few other factors...let's say your ranger was helping to pull.....he's really on rampage, but at max archery range is out of Vindi's rampage area.  Vindi gets moved a bit, ranger is now in range, ranger is very shortly dead.  Mage could've had the same thing happen, either through pet agro, or DSing or something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Attack off works for me. If you are low HP then the mob is rarely going to turn from you to look for another target. When it does you turn attack back on till aggro is back. I get asked all the time why I seem to be getting beat up and then all of the sudden my health stops dropping. Works great in a bind and raids. Almost always gives me enough time for someone to get a heal to land...=)</div></div><hr />

Tis nae me job to heal.<br />
Ill let the clerics get yelled at if I die on a boss mob.<br />
<br />
For grinding, I run like hell in a zig zag fashion back and forth.<br />
I hold low health aggro so as soon as the heal lands I turn and taunt or AE taunt depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Im ususaly the only tank class in grinding groups so if someone gets chewed on a little bit but I survive its all good.<br />
I die, they all die ususally.<br />

<br />
You sir have taken one too many hits to the head.<br />
<br />
The only thing you're accomplishing is to put your back to the mob, which, while it keeps you from attacking and taking riposte damage, also negates any chance for you to riposte inc hits.<br />
<br />
You're also EXPOSING YOUR WHOLE DAMN RAID to riposte damage! Turning a mob around is a BAD THING for the rogues.<br />
<br />
You can't dance around a mob to make it miss you, they turn instantly, every time.<br />
<br />
The only time I see this technique working (the spinning around of a mob) is when a rogue takes a massive riposte, gets low health aggro, and gets pounded into a grease stain.. yeah, you've avoided a round of melee.. grats you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with running is you expose your back. Negating any defensive benifit you have against a mob. If you just stay head on and shut attck off you will rarely get hit and usually when you do get hit the damage is less than if you have your back to the mob. <br />
Rarely use that technique on raids but it has helped in a bind where everyone is dead, mobs at 5% and we still have melee up and swinging. Get low HP aggro, attack off, taunt, and hope to hell the other melee can kill it before it kills you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Spliskin <br />

<br />
Yes I know that... what I mean is trying to run inside a mob to purposefully bug it into ignoring you completely is a really stupid thing to do (if it even works... which I doubt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify guys, Dakryn is NOT talking about losing agro in the first post, not at all.  What he means is making the mob turn around to look for him, so it will hopefully either lose an attack round, or at the least delay the mob's attack round.  And then, to repeat this a few times until a heal does land.  <br />
<br />
However, from numerous posts here, I'm thinking that it won't work.  I've said to myself before on numerous occasions &quot;damn, those mobs ALWAYS are in perfect attack position&quot; on whomever they want to hit at the moment.   Don't think I've ever seen a mob have to spend time looking behind itself for a target.  AI radar or something :p  As well, from my own experience;  sometimes, when tanking, I'll have to turn away from a mob... Sometimes I do it to check for adds, or to check positioning, whatever.  It seems to me that I've sometimes noticed that when I get the &quot;you can not see your target&quot; messages, when I turn back to the mob, it's beating on someone else until I turn back, and then it's on me again once I'm attacking it.  Of course, that could also just be proximity agro I guess.<br />
<br />
For myself, I prefer just turning attack off, and hitting evasive if it's available.  One other thing we've done with success a couple of times, is if there is another warr available, to have the other warrior (s) /shield the MT in a situation like that.  It gives the non-MT non-add warriors something to do.</div></div><hr />
