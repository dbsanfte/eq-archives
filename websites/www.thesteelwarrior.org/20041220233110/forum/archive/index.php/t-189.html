I had shadow heart, frostbringer, longsword of freedom, mith edged short sword, and flaming dirk to pick from.  shaadow heart and longsword of freedom is best DPS, but what about aggro?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Shadow heart / mith shortsword / flaming dirk paired with frosty should be the best aggro combo of those weapons you listed :)</div></div><hr />

Pick one or both from that thread...</div></div><hr />

<br />
but i listed what i have not what i want.  What i need help with is what combo should i use now given what i have.  Personally i'd like the BoW but since my guild is not that far in PoP not really likely that i'll be looting one anytime soon.<br />
<br />
What would be helpful is if someone could give advice on which of my weapons i should wield, and which should go in what slot.  <br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
frotsy / longsword of freedom - would think this might be alittle slow<br />
<br />
shadow heart / frosty - would be fast, but will frosty proc enough in this config?<br />
<br />
frosty / shadow heart - ???<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
     I am leaning towards the shadow heart / frosty combo ( i would think this generates most aggro).  I was wondering if anyone else had any thoughts.  Sure i'd like every weapon on the hate weapons list,  however, what should i use given what i have now ? . . . . <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, first off Frostbringer is your best bet initially.  Thats the best aggro weapon you'll have, but you might want to look into getting another aggro weapon as well, Shadow Heart isn't a very good aggro holder and eventually warriors need two good aggro weapons to hold aggro over some rogues, monks, and rangers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i knowits not what you hve now but i would look to the near future at getting a hammer from poi dragon and in the mean timekep frosty as secondary weapon .</div></div><hr />
