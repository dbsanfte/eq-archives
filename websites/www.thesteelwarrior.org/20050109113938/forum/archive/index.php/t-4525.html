<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey - I have a question about a bizarre incident that happened to a druid buddy of mine.<br />
<br />
He was soloing in Lake Rathe and happened upon a &quot;Royal Fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
He killed it, because he'd never seen one before and thought it might be part of a quest he was on.  <br />
<br />
When he killed it, he got a message something to the effect of &quot;You have brought down the hatred of an entire race upon yourself&quot; and now he is KOS to High Elves.<br />
<br />
He's been looking everywhere to find out how he can repair his faction standing with High Elves, but so far no luck.<br />
<br />
Has anyone killed a Royal Fish?  If so, do you know how to repair the faction hit?  What mobs should he go after?  For info, he is a Halfling druid, Firiona Vie server.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any insight anyone might have on this topic.<br />
<br />

<br />
you killed the &quot;jesus fish&quot; used to be part of a quest and the fish was somehow related to a god and its power, forgot what exactly its been so long, but anyway alot of people didnt like the way the fish was set up to look like a jesus thing(gods son/fish) so the EQ team being sensative moved him to a lesser quest but didnt remove the faction hit, GL raising it</div></div><hr />

This looks promising ... http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=611<br />
<br />
I don't know which faction the High Elves are one,  but this will correct at least the # King Tearis Thex and The Clerics of Tunare faction hit (eventually).<br />
<br />
You can find out more by clicking on the ffaction links on the page Gerick linked to.</div></div><hr />

LOL... well, if its any consolation my friend just spent the day on a newbie quest slowly getting back his faction with High Elves.  Too bad there doesn't seem to be a &quot;royal fish&quot; equivalent for those of us who want bad faction with Dark Elves :)   Woulda saved me killing so many guards in Nektulos.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm theres an erudite with a fishing pole in Toxx, hes a Necro or SK, low lvl. To get to him, go out off Erudin and hang a right till the beach, then follow the beach (I think it was that way, long long ago). Hes alone fishing and he raises some Erudin faction when killed (I did it for a quest to raise Freeport faction in Erudin :p). When I did it, theres a high lvl Erudite not far away from him, he wont agro you if you kill the fishing one in place, but if he somehow runs to the higher lvl one... erm... gate or run :p</div></div><hr />

I spent so much time there with my ogre camping cleric epics for my guild, I was able to bank in Kelethin and Felwithe for a while. And yes, that is many, many, many goblins.</div></div><hr />
