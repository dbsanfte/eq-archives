Guild tried him first time ever on Monday.  Needless to say we wiped at 90% yeah go ahead and laugh if you want to :D  Main thing I want some help with is we had plenty of off-tanks and healers but only 1 Chanter and our bard was lagging to bad to mez.  I know a good chanter can keep 4 mobs mezzed but once mez broke and chanter died all hell broke loose.  <br />
<br />
So from experience the people that have killed him every did him with 1 chanter or would it be easier to just kill the 8 bodyguards and wait till they respawn a few minutes later?  Well anyway thanks for your time :)</div></div><hr />

We use a single group to do CC on emperor.  This group consists of two Shammies, two SK's, and two Enchanters.<br />
<br />
We pretarget all mobs, with temporary offtanks assigned to the 4 &quot;secondary&quot; mobs.  Each of the 4 crowd ocntrol people also have both of their assigned targets pre-targetted (using the &quot;toggle target&quot; hotkey)<br />
<br />
We pull blood, enchanters mez their primary targets, toggle and mez secondary targets.  SK's engage primary targets, build some agro, then toggle and engage secondary targets.  Shammies slow offtanked mobs, mages and shammies debuff mezzed mobs (malo/'sini)<br />
<br />
From that point, the enchies can easily keep two mobs each mezzed, and the SK's can easily offtank two mobs each.  The shammies keep everyone healed and the offtanked mobs slowed.<br />
<br />
Once the 8 are locked down, I call assist on blood, we kill him and move into position for Emp.<br />
<br />
Crowd control is key, and I strongly recommend you take your team to Ssra sometime when the emperor is not up and practice locking down his room a few times.  Make your CC team hold their mobs for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Once you have that part of the encounter down, the Emperor himself is fairly easy, so taking the time to practice when he's not up makes it much easier to ensure a success when you have the competition breathing down your neck and it's do-or-die on the Emperor himself.</div></div><hr />

No, the mob's in Emperor's room can not be dismissed.<br />
<br />
You are most likely thinking of the High Priest fight, which has a similar crowd control issue to the Emperor fight.  HP has 12 guards (instead of 8) 4 mezzable, 4 undead (dismissable/charmable), and 4 slowable (for offtanking)<br />
<br />
Given our small forces and the fact that we only have one necro in our guild, we generally just offtank all 8 unmezzable mobs.  We use the exact same CC team as we use for the Emperor, but each SK offtanks 4 mobs instead of 2.</div></div><hr />

The Disciples during the HP encounter can be banished.  The Emp encounter is similiar, but you cannot banish any of the mobs.  Can prolly be done with one enchanter but I havent heard of anyone trying it as no one wants to blow their chance at killing emp.  With all the damn lag you need all the enchanters you can muster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure its impossible for 1 chanter to keep all 4 mobs mezed in there cause I think they have to use rapture &amp; that has a recast time thats almost half the spells duration so you need a 2nd chanter or possibly a lvl 65 bard (dunno if they can mez those mobs or not would assume they can).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also believe that enchanters must use rapture to mez the emp/blood guards.  I'm sure an enchanter can't lockdown more than 2 unless they also have ancient rapture.  Personally, I would never even consider assigning more than 2 mobs to a person.  If you have 4 CCers, then put one per mob, and let them each also contribute to the fight as they can (rebuffing, new enchanter spellshield is very helpful for emp, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies guys just sucks usually on raid days we only have 1 chanter most of the time :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have to agree, doing emp with 1 chanter isnt very smart, typically we try to have 4 chanters, 1 for each mob, when we go to keep the stress off any 1 person. you can go with less, but i wouldnt really advise less than 3. the entire encounter takes about 30 mins, so your enchanters will need to constantly mezz for half an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rapture recast time is too slow to even mez two mobs. Bliss however works on them and will let you mez more, but mana can be an issue. Now that bards and enchanters can actually do CC together, it's easy enough for 2 enchanters to do it with a bard or two helping, but one is not enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duskin</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One chanter should be able to do it if they have the ancient rapture(mez) otherwise pretty tough/impossible.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to keep 2 chanters doing it.  Also if you have low enchanter attendance, bards can keep one under control fairly easy.<br />
<br />
Good luck..<br />

He comes out the box strong and catches u off guard if u havent read every forum spoiler in the world. We got his beef injection the first try back when even with SSra gear ))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having Ancient anything pretty much requires you to have already beaten Emperor Ssraeshza, unless you're lucky with Seru or for some strange reason you want to do the Vulak ring.<br />
<br />
People used Rapture during Luclin era because no other mez is high enough.  However with PoP any of the level 60+ mez will work (Apathy/Sleep/Bliss).  However Rapture is unresistable, while the other mezzes are not.  I have no idea what kind of resists those snakes have so this may or may not be an issue.</div></div><hr />

I beleived in until we killed them! Respawn time is pretty quick but its not instant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually I never killed emp guards while emp was up so dont know if its special then but i've killed em after and they took a few mints to respawn.. not advocating killing them CC is much better just saying...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I heard of a bard in one of the top guild of my server that could handle the CC alone but i never seen him do it.</div></div><hr />
