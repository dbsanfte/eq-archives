We tried for like 10 minutes and gave up, was wondering if anyone has had any success with it since the patch came out?</div></div><hr />

Just put up selos, aggro, pull DA, swim like hell out through lava, wait a little outside then up from lava and bring to raid at fort1.<br />
<br />
Pyronis, Blazzax, Magmaton and gang though was sorta impossibe to pull unless you did track-aggro-sit-splat style pulls.</div></div><hr />

3 months of elementals tells me otherwise.  <br />
We are talking about post patch issues.  As you might know, this patch gayed things up quite a bit.<br />
<br />
-edit<br />
<br />
I pulled him the day after the patch, wednesday?, no problemos. Just put up selos, aggro, pull DA, swim like hell out through lava, wait a little outside then up from lava and bring to raid at fort1.<br />
<br />
Thats what we tried, he would just warp right back to where he was and not move til aggroed again<br />
:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how many monks where you using? we had 3 to pull him out after the recent patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried him tonight and we could not get him out of his cave.  Bards were trying thier thing....i kinda wish i would have windowed out and came here.  Well after about 15 minutes with no pull incoming we kinda came up with an idea of getting a mage into the cave and we started COHing everyone into the cave.  We eventually wiped, it was our first time with him and we got him to 6 percent when everyone died.  We would have gotten it done if we tried again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We haven't done him in months but we only ever did him in the cave, it's not really that hard if done correctly, I wouldn't give up just because you can't pull him out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post patch he died the same way he did pre-patch, out in the wide open field. You can still pulll him, no more difficult then any other fire mini post-patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeador goldenharp</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pulled tonite, still just a pain but unlike fennin dident have nearly as many problems with the stuttering / warping on pulls, on  inital aggro he wasnt comming off the island at first however on the 2nd pull it was resolved, i would sugged a 2 person pull team incase he does get caught on the walls as the first puller will be unable to see in the lava this happing and the back up puller swiming behind him can land a DA / bellow combo if a bard and is then able to reaggo to free from walls / bring to C1 with out any of the resets or warping back to the spawn point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes pulling him for now is a pain in the ass cause he'll get stuck on the rocks in the lava and warp.  You can still do it but you just have to guide him more and it may take a bit.  Also hard to guide cause you can't see anything in the lava heh.  Not too many problems with the other minis, well Pyro kept getting stuck on a rock and warping around but was doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks got him out a couple of nights ago.  NFI how but it's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeador goldenharp</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a fun pull, it  really daunting when you first start but with practice it gets easyer, once birds are clear have a monk or bard and a healer swim down to his room ( though my x-GL used to pull as well and hes a druid and my current GL will pull sometimes and hes a war), then heal up, use lev and get ready, aggro him and pull him though the lava, when you are about halfway though the tube as a bard sing DA and let the bird get right up to you so he doesnt warp back and reset ( keeping in mind you have low visibliy, have to gague where he is, and not lose composure while Shadowsteps are thossing you around), once you get the Invu message pull him out the tube and pause at the surface of the lava, wait 1 second then pull him to camp, when i first tryed to pull him i died alot, but like anything else with  practice it gets easyer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanek</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah we've been able to pull him fine the last 9 months, just this new patch is homo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raargh</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we managed to pull him, but was much harder than normal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard got him out on Saturday</div></div><hr />
