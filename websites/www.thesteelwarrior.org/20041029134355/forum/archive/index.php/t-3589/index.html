<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xasam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I am the last one to know (I usually am), but as an FYI the LDoN mobs go from level 57 mobs if your group avg. is under 63  to level 59 mobs if your group avg is exactly 63 or over.  I don't know if there is a higher batch of mobs for groups avg. level 65 (does anyone?).<br />
<br />
I have verified that it is exactly level 63 that triggers the mob increase.  62.8 avg. level gets the lower mobs.<br />
<br />
The level 57 mobs max at 243 or so with 10k hps and the level 59 mobs max for 390 or so with 15k hps.<br />
<br />
So, at any rate if two people are lfa and one will drop your average under 63 and you are mainly after adventure points you might wanna get the lower guy.  If you are level 65 the xp difference for killing a 57 vs. killing a 59 is hardly noticeable since neither have the xp bonus.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if the drops off named differ between the two sets of mobs, but I think the higher level zone gets more named in general.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm usually with lvl 65 peeps from the guild or pick ups. the mobs sound like they are the same for lvl 63 peeps. mobs hit for 390-ish and the boss hits around 900 (if there is a boss). <br />
<br />
not sure of the loot issue as i haven't really done any with a group lower than 65, so can't comment on that, but i'm sure it may be close the same loot for the 60+ adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've heard of people doing hard missions and bringing 2 59 twinks/alts with them to get the average down some. Makes the mobs hit for like 600-700 or something instead of usual 950ish.<br />
<br />
 not totally on topic but sorta kinda related=P</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, max hit is 390ish mobs are 59-61 for al 65ers on Normal adventure.<br />
<br />
but I think the higher level zone gets more named in general. <br />
<br />
Ive had several adventures with no names and a couple with two names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maelissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's a dungeon rank for every 5 levels from 20 to 70 (20, 25, 30, etc.).   The breakoff point for the next highest rank is at the midpoint of these ranges, rounded up.  So, in other words, any average level ending with a 3 or an 8.  Choosing a hard mission will give you a mission 5 levels over what the normal difficulty will.</div></div><hr />
