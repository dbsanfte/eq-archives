<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in dire need of more HPs. Being able to be buffed to 6.5k HPs is cool and all... But I need more. I've been trying to secure some SS armor to replace a few slots here and there. <br />
<br />
Also looking at the Bracer of Benevolence. Is it worth it? Also, what type of graphic does it have? Leather?<br />
<br />
Here is my Magelo:<br />

Yraen - 65 Overlord (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=313342) <br />

Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BoB's are certainly an upgrade to Champs, and many people have duo'd the quest, ask Gaylon for specifics. Agnostic cultural are still nice bracers w/ resists and hps, I dont know much about Tunare cultural so I will let someone else answer that.<br />
<br />
Champs bp is 90 hp + stats, Myrm gaunts are a heck of an upgrade from champs, which I recently upgraded to as well. Myrm Vambs are some nice stats as well and make  fine upgrade. <br />
<br />
AA's are free hps. Innate STA and Improved Innate STA are well worth it if you don't max easily on buffs. ND3 will show a nice improvement as I see you have ND2. Physical Enhancement, Planar Power, and some defensive AA's will certainly make an impact on your hitpoints/mitigation.<br />
<br />
Others have some good advice and I am sure they will chime in shortly.<br />

/Salute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try getting a Vindi Bp. That would be a pretty nice upgrade to you. The myrm armor would also be nice HP upgrades for you, as you said you were working torwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
500th post, woohoo...! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when you get some more AA get ND3,PD,PE,and PP if you max out your stats and have some that can spill over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wear the Full Mithril bracer instead of my Myrmidons I have in the bank.  The saves and hps are pretty nice on those.  As far as the Myrmidonn armor, I suggest concentrate on getting the guants, 90 raw hps is hard to beat.  Also I agree with the Vindi BP.  Vindi is downright single groupable now so most midlevel guild can take him out without breaking a whole ton of sweat and the BP IMO is better than anything short of Ornate.  Yes that means I prefer Vindi to Statue, I'll trade a couple of AC and 5 sta for the AoB and 8 more to all saves.  My sta is capped in the presence of a shaman anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, the way I bumped my hps quick was go Innate Sta5 (after Run3) then ND3, then I did PD3 which put me over 8k.  By far not uber, but then not too shabby for an elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Besides what everyone has said here I'd swap out that Grodan's Idol for an Idol of the Thorned.  Unless your at max Sta.  IoT will get you 60 hps vs the 25 on Grodans.  Not huge, but hey, its something!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Few things here ...<br />
<br />
Finish up your tanking AAs, those help a ton. ND3 = ND2 x 1.5 so get that asap. Then get PE and PD, that should give you a couple hundred HP itself. DO NOT WASTE AA ON INNATE STA. I can't stress this enough. You should not be putting AA into innate stats until you have everything else maxed. You are not that far off from being able to max your current stats max, and once you get to that point, those AA are totally useless and you don't get them back. So what if they are free HP for 2 weeks, they are still wasted as soon as you get 200 STA.<br />
<br />
Also, don't waste AA on Planar Power until you can actually use it. Really the only stat I would care about is STA, once you can get STA over 280 buffed, then consider getting enoug planar power to make use of any STA over the cap you can get buffed.<br />
<br />
Some easy upgrades:<br />
Darkwood bow of suffering for ranged. Not only do you not have to swap in a bow, but it has 30HP 5STA 5AC. BoB are nice for the 8STA, but they are a little lacking in AC. You might consider a second cultural bracer. Myrmidon gaunts are the way to go as well, plate gloves are common drops in ToV so should be easy to get.<br />
<br />
Your biggest upgrade will be your BP by far. Champ's or Mrymidon's are both huge upgrades in AC and HP or if you can swing a Vindi BP, all the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Benevolence bracers are definetly worth the rvr, a 65 druid with DC can solo the quest for you or you can probably duo it with a good healer. Vindi bp is a great bp and very easy to get, Myrmidon's armor is fairly easy to get altho somewhat rare.  Fill out your aa's and ya should be just about set :)</div></div><hr />
