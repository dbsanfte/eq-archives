<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zogbull</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted some advice please on which augment you all think is the best type on augment for the Tak BP. I am planning on buying this today and plan to put the 40 HP Augment in slot 2 and the 8% Dodge augment in slot 3. Any thoughts for the type 1 slot or any changes to what I have planned??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you want to you could get a 30/30 aug from tipt which fit in any type or the AoB or 15atk augs I think also fit in any type.  Other than that there's dual resist ones 8/8 or 10sta for like 300 points I think if you needed it.  Or just a junk stat buff that drops during clearing ldons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zogbull</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the best overall type one aug, in your opinion??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavariel Baenre</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Put a 15 hp aug from a ldon hard if you can't get a tipt one. All the sold ones are garbage, be patient and it will pay off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 15 HP aug from the hards are type 7, not type all. You'll have to use a 12 HP aug from the normal. Depending on your stamina / shaman availability, a 6/7 stamina aug may be more HP than a 15 HP aug anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the Dodge 8% better than the 40 HP augment (I think that was the correct HP value) I've heard recommended?  Does it improve our dodge beyond our cap?  Obviously if it does help us not get hit more, it would seem &gt; 40 HP, but I haven't heard many people recommending it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the dodge aug is going in the type 3 slot and the 40hp aug is type 2.  If you wanted something other than the dodge aug it would be something out of GoD like another tipt aug(30/30, aura of battle aug or I think 15atk aug)  For BP's not sure what all the ldon type 3 augs are that are available, dodge and regen 5 are all I can think of atm.  Also yes it raises dodge (190 x .08) + 190= new cap.  As for it being helpful I have no clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zogbull</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the name of the tipt aug?? Anyone??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Type 3 can also be filled with the ldon regen 5 or vengance 3 augs.  The ones in question are both CHEST only and are quite cheap.  I know, I know, neither is exactly crucial for a warrior but neither is the dodge one.<br />
<br />
Tipt has two 30/30 augs: Gem of Bolstered Power (30hp/30mana) and Sparkling Gem of Protection (30HP/30End), as well as the AoB one.  All are very easily farmed off the first named.<br />
<br />
To the original question though, the 'best' for the slot would be a BiC aug but that kinda is true for any slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zogbull</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forgive my noobnees, but do not know what is the BiC aug??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">breakdown in communication quest reward</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, for someone who isn't in a raiding guild (no Time, no Tippt, etc.)...essentially, LDoN only, and weighing bang for buck (can trade in later if maxed everything else) for a 1 group tank in Hards, Sewers, etc.:<br />
<br />
A) Dodge 5% for 150 points (Dodge 8% is about 760 points)<br />
<br />
B) Regen V<br />
<br />
C) Something Else<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm guessing A?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svan</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dodge augs were parsed and proven to pretty much suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the +2 dmg shield aug for type3 on breastplate. Either that or regen 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with Aura of Battle myself. /shrug<br />
<br />
Guess it depends on what you think you need more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ignore the dodge augs, they do suck (the increase in lost-HP/time is nothing of note and it's all lost spike, which is even less valued).  Other than that, I can't help you much at this point.  Use stat/HP augs I suppose and seek AC and such.  LDoN gear is great down the road (given it's many slots) but the decent augs don't come until much later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN dropped hp augs *were* all types at one point, but summarily got nerfed to type 7 a few weeks after release. So yeah, any new augs are type 7, but if you have any old ones laying around still, they're still all types.</div></div><hr />
