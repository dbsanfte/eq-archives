<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Occurred to me last night as I was working on my fishing skill in Natimbi.  SoE is on record as saying that you don't need any expansion to play any other expansion, all you need is the basic game.  But consider what it takes to get to the meat of GoD if you don't have LDoN.  That's right, unless you can snag a punt to Natimbi, you have to get to Nedarias landing, so lets see...<br />
<br />
Port in to Surefall (invis if you happen to be evil)<br />
Run to Jaggedpine<br />
Run across almost all of Jaggedpine to reach Nedaria zoneline<br />
Run across Nedaria<br />
Wait for boat<br />
Ride boat<br />
Zone to Abysmal<br />
Ride boat<br />
Zone to Natimbi<br />
Ride boat<br />
NOW run invis through 1 to 4 zones full of kos mobs...<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, if you don't have lev, there is no physical way BACK.<br />
<br />
Don't need other expansions?  Sure.  Just like a canoe doesn't need a paddle.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Port in to Surefall (invis if you happen to be evil)<br />
If you're gating in to Surefall via druid, they can gate directly to GoD.  If you're talking about taking the Knowledge stone to Surefall, who's to say you have the PoP expansion either?<br />
<br />
Wait for boat<br />
Ride boat<br />
Zone to Abysmal<br />
Ride boat<br />
Zone to Natimbi<br />
Ride boat<br />
<br />
Yes, having expansions like Luclin, PoP, and LDoN do help people get from place to place avoiding long boat rides.  This is not new.<br />
<br />
NOW run invis through 1 to 4 zones full of kos mobs...<br />
<br />
Everyone, even those with all the expansions, need to do that part.<br />
<br />
Finally, GoD is for level 50+ characters.  If you're a 50+ warrior and don't have LDoN, you're not a warrior people are going to want to group with these days.  So far, the only place to get weapon augments is in LDoN and warriors need them.  Maybe they'll drop in GoD, though I haven't heard tale of them.<br />
<br />
I suggest buying LDoN.  It's a wonderful expansion that's well worth the price of admission.  It's fun to actually move around and dungeon crawl rather than sit and camp a spawn.<br />
<br />
Your only other real choice if you don't want to buy the expansions and you want to function in the 50+ game, is to have your character on the Fierona Vie server where you can buy augmented weapons from other players.</div></div><hr />

Don't need a Warrior with weapon augs? How about the lame CASTERS who are flowing thought ZERO (Or lame earring FT1 if that) when FT augs are out there? I am dead sick and tired of grouping with casters with a mana pool of NADA. My fuggin ALT has decent stuff he BOUGHT, because alts don't receive raid loot in most guilds I have been in. LAZY people of ALL types sux!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont see the lie. You proved in your first post its possible to get to the GoD zones without LDoN. Enjoy the boat, or buy ldon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt...some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks.&quot; - The EverQuest Team.<br />
<br />
So I don't trust a Sony person as far as I could comfortably spit them... the key word, comfortably<br />
<br />
Personally, I buy all the expansions because I like the Green &quot;all expansions enabled&quot; text. But yeah, on topic, LDoN great expansion for Warriors.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't actually aware that there was a druid port to Natimbi.  But my point remains.  Its significantly easier to access this expansion if you have LDoN.  They are tieing their products together in a way that they said they would not. On SoE's part, it is a smart business move to encourage people to buy their other products. Sure, you CAN get to GoD without LDoN, but its sooo much easier if you drop another $20!<br />
<br />
They're doing nothing illegal and they are true to their word that you can access GoD without having any other expansion. But like someone has mentioned, GoD is a 50+ expansion (which really means 60+ because we all know PoP isn't for 46+) so anyone who only has Classic EQ wouldn't get much out of GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlckMg</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess nobody remembers velious anymore...when that came out everyone constantly needed to get ports to CS so they could make it to raids on time, and there was no other expansion you could enable to make that content more accessible.  Only thing I haven't figured out is why the 800+ taxi druids in PoK haven't gotten the Circle of Natimbi spell...you don't need GoD to purchase or use it, just like CS back in the day.</div></div><hr />

Evil races can access Jaggedpine Forest through Blackburrow. The level 10 gnolls won't attack you. Believe me on that one.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, afaik, if you dont have LDoN, you can still get a adventure stone and use the Magus port system.  Done it on two different accounts. (one has recently added ldon, my 3rd doesnt still)</div></div><hr />

True that brother!  So you CAN do it.  Now mull over in your head whether its worth droppin $20 to skip that hassle.  Yup.. SOE has you.</div></div><hr />

Port in to Surefall (invis if you happen to be evil)<br />
Run to Jaggedpine<br />
Run across almost all of Jaggedpine to reach Nedaria zoneline  <br />
I went through Surefall and Jaggedpine with my level 52 dark elf warrior without any problem.  I didn't even get aggroed.. all you need is a brain and a sow.  I know sow is easy to get in PoK, but unfortunately KEI does nothing for people's intellect in RL.  It's easier with LDoN, of course SoE wants to encourage people to purchase all of their expansions.  <br />
<br />
On another note, I get so tired of reading people whine about SoE &quot;lieing&quot; to them.  The game is dynamic, deal with it.  As the game changes, some of the comments from Abashi/Absor/Whoever from 3 years ago make no sense in the current game.  Pointing to them and saying &quot;SEE WE CAN'T TRUST THOSE BASTARDS&quot; is disingenuous.<br />
<br />
&lt;/rant&gt;  :D<br />

<br />
Btw, even these days, you still need a port to CS hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by BlckMg <br />
I guess nobody remembers velious anymore...when that came out everyone constantly needed to get ports to CS so they could make it to raids on time <br />
<br />
1) Port to WL run to SS use zone out inside if you werent killing yeli.<br />
<br />
2) port to GD &gt; EW &gt; KD ( /cheer RZ worshippers not starting KoS!) &gt; WL &gt; SS &gt; CS.<br />
<br />
Now if you didnt want to do the run through SG you needed a evacer but it was still possible to get to CS w/o a port dircetly to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yes, there are ways... and a clicky invis makes that run much much easier :)</div></div><hr />

Potion vendors sell those at 10 pp a pop :P More interesting though is that someone up there said you didn't need LDoN to get an adventure stone to use the magus...True? False?</div></div><hr />

So far everyone I know w/o a stone that has tried cant get the Maguss' to port them.  I know that when I tried to use it w/ my frog sham they wouldnt listen to me at all (didnt have stone), but once I got the stone i was able to travel nps.</div></div><hr />

you can take the port thingy in blackburrow if surefall is not to your taste.</div></div><hr />

I can't confirm it personally as I have LDoN on both of my accounts and everyone I game with has it.</div></div><hr />

I guess i just miss being a noob when the game was pure and more fun....these days its more like work :)~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">H8 NK run =\</div></div><hr />

I still remember the first time killing gnolls outside the paw when someone said&quot; ya know you can bind at the arena or gyps camp dont ya&quot; and my reply was &quot; bind?&quot;  rofl  Hell if it wasnt for being bound at the arena my swimming skill would still be sub 100 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can bind in Abysmal, I think?  And I thought you could take a shuttle back from Natimbi to Abysmal, although I never actually tried it.<br />
<br />
And you don't have to run &quot;all the way across Jaggedpine&quot;.  The 3 zone outs in Jaggedpine are all very close to each other.  If you enter via Blackburrow then you don't even leave the cave system, and you pass no aggro mobs.<br />
<br />
In terms of accessibility without utilizing other expansions for travel, the only expansion that has GoD beaten is LoY, and that one's on Odus so that's debatable.</div></div><hr />
