<br />
Was just wondering..heard that you cant do LDoN's after 65, is this true?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance if you can help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Apparently you can't do LDON *normals*.  You can still do *hards*.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stommper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I'm hearing in-game is that if anyone above level 65 is in an adventure group, the adventure giver will only allow you to select a &quot;high difficulty&quot; adventure, not a normal...</div></div><hr />

OMG, gonna go de-level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stommper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And from the last dev-chat transcript<br />
<br />
\Brekkee - *Bigfan* Since OoW is raising the level cap to 70, will there be harder LDoN adventures giving more points for people level 66 and up? How many LDoN points will a level 70 person get for a regular LDoN?<br />
Prathun - The level 70 LDoN adventures are functionally identical to 65 hard. We have no plans to implement additional level ranges (such as 70 hard) at this time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So basically if you were 65 doing normals and just dinged 66 you have to do hards...thats alot of crap. My group was not able to do hards. Guess no more LDoN for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just finished a normal LDoN with a member in the group being lvl 66, everyone else being lvl 65 or lower.  So the above &quot;anyone&quot; in group statement must be incorrect somehow.  I'm not sure what it would be then, but something along the lines of average level above 65 would make more sense.  We did have a few people that were 64 in group, so our average level was still probably &lt;= 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Floorpunch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I started my first adv all 65's and a 66 enchanter. During the adv i dinged 66. After it finished i went back to get a new adv but i couldnt. It said to check lvl of other ppl...etc. I made the 65 monk ogroup leader and she got the adv for all of us. Soooo i guessss if you wana do easy normal advs jsut get a lvl 65 to request an adv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So I'm gonna get screwed soon.  I used to be able to 3-box LDoNs using my warrior/cleric/wizard, but they're about to become unpullable, hence completely undoable.  I'm going to have to barrow my friends SK and shaman from now on if I ever want a chance in hell, and will probably have it real rough trying to win cause of lack of DPS (there's no way in hell my &quot;main&quot; since 1999, the warrior, is not going to be one of the ones getting the points, so no wizard).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">im a 3boxer sk/cleric/bst 66/65/65 anyways normally grab ldons with my sk dinged yesterday then went to bed. So i logged on this afternoon planning on 3boxing another ldon normal and got the someone in you group is oor messsage or whatever. So i thought maybe since i dinged 66 i needed to do hards nope same message. Later ran my cleric to get the ldon and that worked but i really did plan on getting all 3 of my characters to 66 (maybe 68 on sk and 67 on the bots to keep the ldons in normal mode) anyways really sucks that when they all 66 i wont be able to ldon no more.</div></div><hr />

You've got slows and the ability to get single pulls at least.  While it will be considerably harder on you, you'll at least have a fighting chance still.  A chance that you'll still be able to grow into and get better and better at.  I'll have to barrow a friends feign puller and slower to even get to kill mob one in LDoN from now on myself however :(  Unless of course levels 66+ bring a new pacify spell for my cleric that will actually work in high risk LDoNs.  If there's a new pacify, then I'll be all set, be it still rough without slow... but at least attemptable.</div></div><hr />

Woops lol, sorry.  Missed the point of what you were saying there.  I'm sure that's just a bug, and that a level 66+ character will be able to start an LDoN once all is said and done.  That bug won't last long if no one can get LDoNs anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tinmari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My experience the other night was that if you were 66, you can't request &quot;hard&quot;.  We got the 65 in our group to get it.  I haven't tried since then.  I also will be upset if we can't do ldon if no one &lt;66 is in group.  I have long way still to finish my charm aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zannuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is most unsettling news</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">best thing i can hope for is they make it so that leveling to 70 ldon still see's you at 65... im not a heavy raider so even though i do have pulling/slows/heals my gear + the fact that sometimes im too lazy to even grab a kei in pok (will loook for 5-10mins if not will just go ahead) i do the ldon normals cuz they are relaxing and i feel like im accomplishing something more then just getting exp and a slim chance at a rare drop. Bah you know i finished the ldon we were doing today and forgot to look at how many points lvl 66 gained for normals anyone know if points went up and by how much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You should only be stuck with hards if your group's average level is 67ish.  I thinkin this is a bug and will be fixed eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah you know i finished the ldon we were doing today and forgot to look at how many points lvl 66 gained for normals anyone know if points went up and by how much?<br />
<br />
Pretty sure the points will rate the same they always have.  If you do a level 65 normal, it will be 51 points for the top leveled person in the group, and like 2 less points per level less for anyone under that.  Same with level 65 high risks, 105 points for the to leveled person, deminishing points for everyone below his/her level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I thiiiink I'll aa a while while waiting on fixes for this.  I'm not a heavy raider, and ldon gear is an upgrade to me.  If I can't do a ldon with my friends and guildies, leveling past 65 is NOT worth it.  And not all of my friends are capable of doing hards at 65 juuust yet.</div></div><hr />
