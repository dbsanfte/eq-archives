<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">More of a couple of things that are REALLY important to know about the zone rather than where the leet drops are and what not.<br />
<br />
Starting with the most important thing: The zone in tunnel. This is perhaps the MOST dagerous place in the zone, the 3100+ hitting mobs not withstanding. The reason is there is a serise of deep alcoves along the tunnel that spawn mobs. Many people (including me, mty first time though) do not notice them. And if you are invis they will not agro. However the frist time someone visible runs down the tunnel, they will agro.<br />
<br />
OoW non-named mobs don't hit particularly hard (probably no more than 600) but they can quad and are reletively fast attack. And darned near everything is sow speed or faster.  A not inconsiderable number summon too. You will not go wrong to assume that everything can run you down and summon you. And if you are paricularly lucky you will find one that procs infected bite-- a 100/tick dot that lasts for 50 ticks--or a 5k dot. <br />
<br />
So if things go bad in your group in WoS--your healer goes LD, is stil rezing, what have you--most of the time 1) you will not make it to the tunnel 2) if you make it to the tunnle you will not survive the extra 4 adds in it 3) if you survive all that and hit the zone line you will probaby die from the dot. Additionally, for some reason groups like being dragged to the ZI for rezzes and what not.  So if you run for it--most likely you will just die tired and maybe train near dead folk at the ZI. Perhaps even your brother warriors who don't have invis to make the run up the tunnel.<br />
<br />
So if things go bad-take it like hero. Minimize down time. Get everyone else out, pop defensive and have everyone else do their damnest to get out...BUT MAKE SURE THEY INVIS FIRST!<br />
<br />
While others are calling it the new KC--really the zone in is more like the bridge in Lower Guk. We warriors are probably just no going to make it so we may as well make sure everyone else does.<br />
<br />
Make sure, too, that you educate your groups about the mobs that spawn in the tunnel. And that casters can and should bind in WoS. <br />
<br />
The second thing to know about the zone (and its high number of named) is that many folk come for the loot only. Make sure the loot rules and the target (ie XP or loot) of the group are known to everyone. I am still learning the zone, but I think most camps will have a shot at least 1 named if not more. Be clear on loot rules and focus.<br />
<br />
Expect to be trained--and its probably by accident. Anyone who has pulled in WoS while there are more than just a couple of groups in it has probably, at least once, brought their pull to the wrong camp. It can even happen with named. I have been trained by a druid who had at least 2 mobs and 2 named--by accident. <br />
<br />
My own experance has been incredibly variable there--sometimes with very little change in group composition. Murphy lives in this zone and at times you will not be able to get him off your back. Other times you will be able to grind for hours, get multipul named and begin to feel you are in your own instance. Good days here are particularly good, bad days mean a lot of time at your spawn point and idiots training the tunnel (see above).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wanted to add a couple things.<br />
<br />
1. Due to the outdoor and open anture of the first half of the zone, pulls can be long.  These mobs are very very fast, and can run you down at times. One type of mobs, the Bazu proc/cast something called Bazu Grasp that is basically a root. If you get hit with that far from the group, weigh your options of calling group to your aid or taking a death for the team. Decide if they have time to help you, or if it could just lead them out into the open and end up a total wipe due to adds or whatnot.<br />
<br />
2. If at all possible get a tracker. So what else is new, hehe?  Lots of nameds here that roam and spawn in random spots. Having an alert tracker can help increase the number of nameds you can grab.<br />
<br />
3. Trash on the Nobles causeway side of the zone is Blue to 66.  Mob level goes up if you go past the wall. Lots of mobs in the ruins past wall that are white and some yellows to 66. Nameds are yellow and red, and include some raid targets that you want to steer clear of as a single group.<br />
<br />
4. Most things here do not see invis. However, there are a few nameds that do, one of which you pass very close to when heading through the wall on way to MPG. Also, the last part of the tunnel to MPG has some cubby holes in it that have see invis kyvs inside em.  It is close enough to MPG zone that you can get agroed and still make it to MPG zone np. As always, call your trains.<br />
<br />
5. Travel to and from. a Very easy run from PoD's in Draniks through Nobles Causeway if invised. I have yet to find anything in Nobles Causeway that sees invis. Im not saying there aren't any, but i have never seen one running to WoS. Also, could someone confirm there is a port spell for porting into WoS. Do not know details of how to get spell at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a few see invis scowls in Causeway, but you gotta be really lost to find them heh.<br />
<br />
From Walls, I highly suggest you pick up the cloak off Noc Bonecleaver with form of defense 1. Clickie 27ac, must equip. but still freakin awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On my server, this zone is crazy with too many people and camps stepping all over each other in frenzy to get XP and the named mobs.   I am really looking forward to this zone when it settles down.  <br />
<br />
As said before, the mobs are easy to tank, but get resistant to mez and slow the farther in you go (I buff up to 8400hp, 1600 ac, 88 AAs).  Yesterday, I was there for 4 hours steady in a group.  When my group did not go far into zone we had very few deaths (only puller when he wandered too far, and got rooted and killed by named).  XP per mob was good, (I am level 66) and our group had no trouble handling mobs, even when we had adds or named  (War, Druid, Bard, Ranger, Beast, chanter all 65-67).  Only trouble was we were fighting other groups for pops, not enough mobs to go around and that  slowed xp down.  <br />
<br />
When our group moved farther in, and we started to get a lot more deaths (some group members changed, but not much).   Most deaths were due to adds that resisted mez, named that rampaged, named we could not handle, and LDs at bad times.  The mobs in this zone are very very fast.  Tanks have to be on there toes and tag them fast when they come into camp, or else someone is going to die.   The mobs would often be inside each other as the raced to camp,  coupled with there spead, it mad targeting hard for chanters and rooters.<br />
<br />
After about 4 hours (in a group, add one hour waiting to get a group), I ended up with about 4% normal XP.  Not good, but low amount is due to deaths (loosing xp, and also recovery time).  We  also moved around a bit in zone experimenting with different spots.  If my group would of stayed closer to zone in, and did not have to compete for mobs, we would of got some good xp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another word in regards to the named mobs.  Within seconds of a named popping, they usually got tagged by someone, often in a reckless training  manner leading to trains and then wipes.  My group avoided this type of wipe, but saw a lot of group wipes in this zone.  You also have too know what named in zone are 1 groupable, 2 groupable and what ones are raid mobs.  I saw some groups get wiped pulling raid named.  (Sorry, forget named of big bad mobs, but the real large ones standing in middle of zone  outside a passage way through he wall in middle of zone are ones you do not want to touch).<br />
<br />
I  plan on putting a bit of time into OOW the next few weeks, hopefully I will hit 67 (yes, I think it willl take weeks)  For me, WoS seems to be the best xp spot available.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some of the mobs in the northern half of the zone hit pretty hard if they get a bad round in.  <br />
<br />
The Elite Nocs (PH's for the nameds) proc Chaos Claws, just like in GoD, and have a chance to proc on every hit.  So it's possible to take a Quad round of 600 + 710 x 4 damage per chaos claws proc, which is in the 5200hp range in a round.  You'd have to be extremely unlucky, but it's possible.<br />
<br />
The Elite Kyvs are just mean and have a fairly high attack rating.  Expect to get hit fairly hard before they're slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not bad xp, but in terms of newness and excitement this zone is great.  Also the # and frequency of named makes it fairly exciting as you root for your puller .  <br />
<br />
A druid can heal heck even a shaman could easily keep up heals near the zone in mobs.<br />
<br />
There is a huge contingent of the BoT kr3w that have moved into WoS so going in deeper is not a bad idea if you wish to avoid the continual training and noobness.  But it is also refreshing to just sit with whoever ya pick  up a group with and meet some new folks no matter how bad they are.  Not like you're gonna die.<br />
<br />
Past the wall it gets a bit rougher.  The trash is still not bad, but the named can actually be pretty wicked. (The ever Present Discordling Warfiend being the biggest PITA b/c of the AE/Stun).  Our group sat in the field where he pops for approximately 3 hours and we took him down 4 times (and whiped 1 time .....defensive was down).  total we took down 13 named in that time and all of us walked out with about 100k in sellables and spells.<br />
<br />
A very fun zone and a VERY refreshing change of pace to have a zone with 40-80ish people all LFG and xping at any given time.  It reminded me of South Karana back when all the spires were camped aviaks were camped there were groups at the bridge and skellies and folks tryin to get brave adventureres for inside paw.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm.. .maybe I have to go to the north end of the zone then.  My groups are having a very hard time getting named closer the NC zone because so many people are camping there.  Named are practically insta pulled.  And last night for instance, a group of uber guilders was set up right in the middle of that part of the zone while most groups were near walls.  Many named apparently roam right through the middle when they spawn, so if you can hold a camp there (easier when tons of people are in the zone keeping mob population down), you'll get most of them before other people do.  We got 1 named in 4 hours.  The day before we got 2 or 3 named in 6+ hours.<br />
<br />
Suggestion:  Can we start listing raid named and single groupable named?  They all seem to con red to me, so I can't tell them apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;(The ever Present Discordling Warfiend being the biggest PITA b/c of the AE/Stun).

<br />
<br />
This is quite impressive.  The Warfiend  can grind up a group before they know what hit them.  This mob is considered a two group or more mob on my server, and single groups are not touching him if they know wha is good for them.   I saw him wipe a group of uber people from one of the uber guilds on my server.  He also has a high agro range. <br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree, this is  a good zone.  As a warrior, I find it refreshing that  I am not getting quized on hp/ac, anyone can tank the xp groups in this zone. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We got the Warfiend down to ~15% with one group, a total of 2 pieces of elemental armor between us: War, SK, Mnk, Clr, Shm, Ench. War would have buffed to about 10k HP / 1800 AC, I was floating around 8.6 / 1700. He never hit our warrior over 1700, undisced - At least, I don't /think/ he popped a disc. Never hit me over 2100, but by then, our cleric was out of mana. With a better heal strat and having been ready, we would probably have won - word of redemption wiped out the cleric's mana pool fast. He's a lot less mean than he looks, because he responds so well to AC / Mitigation AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warfiend is very easy if you can tank in vxed and survive - you don't even need to do a good job of it, you just need to barely be able to survive.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I'm strictly speaking concerning the gear level of a Warrior. Basically, pop furious then defensive, and have the cleric use quick heals. I was in a group for around 8 hours that, once we tried this mob and realized he was basically doable, spent the last 3 of those 8 hours killing him as soon as my defensive refreshed. It's most likely a bug but he near insta-respawns on death. Hauled a good 18 pieces of loot from killing him alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The best thing about WoS is watching people wiping to nameds they'd mistaken as 1 groupable mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I kind of like the idea of uber mobs wandering around exp group areas :)  Reminiscent of Gorenaire terrorizing the dreadlands or a Sand Giant wiping out newbies in Oasis.  Adds a little bit of danger and excitment to the old exp grind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing better to get the blood pumping than a good &quot;oh shit&quot; pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just fought in WOS for the first time yesterday night... I LOVE IT! Granted I was playing a shaman, but still.  It seems exactly like BoT 2.0... or as we also agreed last night, something like The Overthere 5.0 .   Exp was amazing for my non-EP shammy who was slowing mobs with very little resists and they were all partial slows but the good kind not the bad kind.  We also fought there for like 2-3 hours and got about 8 named.   This was with around 4 groups around us.  Mobs seemed to be cake.  Around 20-30khp and max hit on my shammy was like 597.  Warrior in group was 10kish unbuffed, and if I had to I could have easily kept mobs slowed and him healed with Q without even needing C3.  Overall I've got to say I really really like it.. I just hope the tardies will find a new place to hang out and ooze their way outta WoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;I just hope the tardies will find a new place to hang out and ooze their way outta WoS.&quot;  Hehe, wishful thinking fuzz.<br />
<br />
If you want a little peace and quiet in the zone you can make some nice experience in the WoS caves too. Was grouped in the Murkglider/squid caves last nite for about 4 hours and got a yellow of regular exp. Really easy to pull, all blue to 66, hit very light (max 500ish) and fairly slow.  No CC necessary, beast slow will be just fine, so you can add dps people to group and just fly through.  Down side is we did not see any loot in there. Anyway, was fun change o pace to the camps outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Busstin1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Too many trains for me to like this zone, If you ask me Proving grounds is way better. Alot less trains and some nice loot too + higher end runes and more exp :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Says the 10k HP, 2k AC tank.  ;) <br />
<br />
WoS has been packed on Xev with on average ~100 people in the zone.  Trains galore - don't even consider camping near the NC zone, casters should bind somewhere along the south wall for easy CR's.  Lag can be brutal with that many people there and also makes mobs are hard to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Killing the Warfiend is not that hard so long as your group knows what to expect.  ie.  AE damage en masse on the group (can chew through lower hp folks) and Faster Big heals on the tank.  I only had a cleric in the group (group was war, bard, ench, necro, cleric, Wizard)<br />
<br />
The cleric had a nice mana pool  (though unguilded) and enough AA, healing savvy to keep all in the group alive.  But he is very very doable with a single group.</div></div><hr />

Get lucky with ramp? or use some savy? or are all those folks very end game geared?  :) <br />
