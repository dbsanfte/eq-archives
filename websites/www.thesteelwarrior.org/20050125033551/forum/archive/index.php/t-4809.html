<br />
Symbol of Planesmasters listed the proc to be about a 3850 DD. I wish!<br />
<br />
Fury of the Chosen had it's stamina regen component removed, and nothing else added (NERF). <br />
<br />
A number of other items that gave stamina were given ultravision, serpent sight, etc.  Making many of them fairly useless...<br />
<br />
There were a few others...<br />
<br />
Patch server is all screwed now for the last hour or so, and now it looks like servers are dropping...</div></div><hr />

Typos in descriptions are annoying but not game breaking. Some people are having true problems though, with 20 hour refresh on discs and whatnot, and that is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since there is no longer a stamina bar (it's called endurance now), items that gave stamina regen have been removed from the game. Since the stamina bar was meaningless anyway, this was not a nerf. If you got a free insta-click buff, count yourself as being ahead.</div></div><hr />
