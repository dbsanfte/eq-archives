<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or do warriors have to be a higher level then all the others and more requirements then all the other classes. example: one guild<br />
warrior:<br />
level:65<br />
aa:run3 nd3 aetaunt<br />
helpful aas:all defensive<br />
<br />
sk<br />
level:61<br />
aa:run3<br />
<br />
they have one or two more warriors then sk. it seems when i was looking at websites for good ideas for ours that we have to be alot higher or more aa then any other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigrr7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For most guilds, 1 or 2 more of a class tends to mean they're a) full or, b)not full, but not really looking for anyone..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Couple reasons -- warriors are usually a dime a dozen to recruit from. We are the worst class to equip for duty from a resource perspective and we need the aa's to do that job to full effect at raid levels.<br />
<br />
Putting very high reqs makes sure you don't waste tons of time or resources equipping a new recruit, especially when you don't need more pretty much. It also means anyone who does pass and join is less likely to bail on you having said aa / etc already (well in theory anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warriors tend to be a key element for a successful raiding guild.  It really doesn't make sense to waste an hour or so of setup time and the potential time of CRing on an under geared, under AAXPed Warrior when you can just as easily recruit one who is geared and AAXPed appropriately, or so some people figure.<br />
<br />
Since the Warrior is the linch pin around which the raid rotates, usually, it only makes sense you want him maxed.  Warrior requirements will tend to be higher than for other classes because it's such an important role to fill and there are so many Warriors available, or have been until recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They also seem to be higher because after you have enough warriors on a raid, we are just added lag with inferior DPS to most classes unless you have the levels, aa, gear, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This has always been true, not just for raids either.  I remember a few years ago, a cleric buddy of mine started out leveling me because he insisted on going to zones that I couldn't effectively tank in yet.  He leeched xps off groups that were a few levels higher than him, and I had to grind in places appropriate to my level.  We have to be appropriate level/gear/AA or whatever, because we actually take the beating.  A more dramatic example of that is the fact that with KEI a 34th level shaman can kill a hill giant,  at 51 it was still a close fight for me.   And, as was previously stated, if a guild is recruiting raid tanks,  all they really need is one warrior for most situations, and in many of the cases where they'd need a tank rotation, a knight can fill in for us and has utility in the bargain.  Fortunately I'm in a guild who's recruiting policy revolves around strength of character rather than strength of 'toon. :)<br />
