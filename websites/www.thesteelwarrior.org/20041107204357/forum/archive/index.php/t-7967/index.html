<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in chardok tonight helping a guild chanter kill prince, anyhow we pulled his entire room and kill them all then pulled him and got about 15 more mobs from somewhere.  We killed him and had all the adds left, so I hit Ae taunt and grabbed em all and was tanking fairly well.<br />
<br />
Here is where it gets weird, when I got to about 10% I noticed that they were dealing me literally no dmg and it was taking them forver to kill me(cleric had already died).  Then I noticed I only had 500hp left and they were doing about 20dmg in all combined out of the 10 mobs left and looked up and saw that both my str and sta were over 400, something like 454(i was at 305 each before this).  There was a bard in the group along with shaman/cleric buffs.  Anyone know if this was a bug or something else I never knew about?  I wouldn't think there was a bard song that did that, he told me there wasn't /shrug.<br />

The only thing I could possibly think of is that there were a bunch of casting mobs and perhaps the cleric Marked a ton of them before squishing.  CD is oldschool though, you might have been getting that odd code that only allows three NPCs on a target at a time I suppose.  Then I notice the BBB and wonder if you were just out runing the incoming damage perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thats weird, only thing I could guess is you died but had a heal that got you up - because when I die I see all of my stats uncapped, as did you with str and sta</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's no 3-target-limit anywhere, I've tanked 10 at once in Chardok.  It sounds like the game thought you &quot;died&quot; which allowed your stats to become uncapped, making you practically invulnerable to the level 50ish mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same thing happened to me, but my stats stayed normally capped. I was with my 55 cleric, a 53 rogue and his 62 druid, and a 65 mage and after the cleric and druid died (we set off the undead trap right outside the castle and they got swarmed cause they were sitting) I had about 15 mobs on me, and they were hitting me for so little that I was able to regen  out of berserk by the time we killed them all (I had gotten down to 6% health when the healers died). I couldn't figure it out because they were missing almost 100% and when they did hit it was for 5-10 dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yecch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In a somewhat related story (stats overflowing,) friend of mine in the bazaar well over a year ago looked at his AA list to find the AA regen reading something like 30000/3. (As if he had 30000 AA points into regen.)<br />
<br />
Sure enough, he goes into the arena and gets hit, and regens any amount of damage back instantly.<br />
<br />
It went back to normal after he zoned.</div></div><hr />
