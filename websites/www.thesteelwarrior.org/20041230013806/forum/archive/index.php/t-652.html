<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now that I am 40th and I can &quot;group&quot; with some of my friends we are going to sebillis to test out my toons durability under EXTREME stress.  Anyways, I am going in with the attitude that dying isn't a bad thing as its just part of us testing certain things.<br />
<br />
The group composition is going to be 60 Cleric / 57 SK / 58 Mage / 55 Druid / 40 Warrior (me) / 58 Necro<br />
<br />
We are of the thought (we will experiment) that my warrior in his current state can tank (shitty) but he can tank and won't suddenly die.  Obviously our main tank is the SK but like I said we will experiment with me as MT just to fool around.  (is kind of our fun night with the guys)<br />
<br />
So, just wanted to see what the predictions are..  I get owned?  I do ok?  etc... I will post results after our fun night in seb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">u should get buffed up ok but with no slower youll be dropping quick i think. plus ull find it hard to keep aggro. but shouldnt die i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I am thinking that me being able to keep agre is going to be nearly impossible.. only agro I actually imagine getting is low hp due to much lower lvl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should actually have good agro - just by virtue of your level. Mobs &quot;hate&quot; you more at lower levels, I am sure due to them being less afraid of you. You should do fine against Seb mobs as well.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that when Seb opened, the warriors of the time did not have much better stats than you have now, even at considerably higher levels. You will also have better buffs and I am sure the rest of your group is geared way better than people who where in Seb a couple of years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll die fast as hell with no mezzer/slower <br />
<br />
1 on1 will be no problem though but when you get jumped 5 it turns the tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I'd still say that's a bit low with even a higher level group. I'd say 48-50 is probably the lowest I'd goto Sebilis at. I did do a lower Sebilis group once on my Paladin when he was 52 (he was my first character a couple years back), so it is possible. I had a full group of 60's who were nice enough to group with me though, so they carried me :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume the SK will tank for the group so you should be fine.<br />
Dont try anything fancy, Seb is a deathtrap since the npc caster changes waiting to get you.<br />
My 52 rogue was parked at entrance and when trying to get out using sneak/hide he got owned several times.<br />
Some wizard/shaman frogs see through it and you can see first hand now how efficient root/dot or root/nuke can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll be pwned by caster mobs as stated.<br />
<br />
Watch for range aggro and spawn aggro. Any casters that spawn or you walk into range of will root you, nuked and kill you quick.<br />
<br />
At your level you have next to 0 chance of resisting or partially resisting anything your way, and the wizzy mobs can nuke for over a 1k damage in 7 seconds.<br />
<br />
Be wery wery careful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;with no crowd control...&quot;<br />
<br />
What are you smoking? He's got a necro, an SK, AND 2 priests in the group - if they can't control adds (with or without the level 40 warrior in the group) they have no skills at all.<br />
<br />
To date my most successful OS group EVER was pre-Velious, with a warrior, 2 rangers, and a necro, holding b3 for ~3 hours (no deaths).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry didn't mean 58 necro mUWAHAH heheh meant 58 enchanter..<br />
<br />
P.S.  will post results after lunch.. they are better than one might htink =)  we did have 2 wipes if you must know but we went DEEEEEEEP!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would guess adds adds adds. Would really be curious how many double and tripple mobs you had on incoming. With crowd control and a healer though it shouldn't be a problem.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kineada</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the plus side ... You'll be getting an exp boost for fighting mobs that are red / high blues to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">expect to see frogs...<br />
<br />
on the other note I doubt you with lower lvl/skill caps/bonus/dmg/no spells will be able to tank at all. my guess mage pet can tank better. but with level 60 cleric there it shouldnt matter.</div></div><hr />
