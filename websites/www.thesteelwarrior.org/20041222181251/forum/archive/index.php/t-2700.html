Go to Sky.<br />
Kill the mobs on the island (except for the dorf dude) and have all 24 people loot the keys.<br />
After the last mob is killed, the uber halfling will spawn.<br />
Hand him your keys and move to next island.<br />
Repeat until you're on the correct island. :)<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can elaborate better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not true my friend, PoA with People=Keys is a PURE BLAST<br />
(and a challenge for bzzzzzats/spirocs/ Veeshan Twins)<br />
<br />
But as soon as there's som SC'ing the zone sucks.<br />
<br />
Its a 2 day trip, as for the difficulty ...<br />
<br />
I would say 4 PoV/PoS/BoT capable groups wont have trouble.<br />
(Dont remember what islands are safe, but camping a rezer<br />
on some islands is a wise choice).<br />
<br />
There is a guide out there, just lost the URL.<br />
<br />
PoA with 24 and a puller that knows the zone = Fun<br />
PoA with 40+ and little spoilers/info = NIGHTMARE<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw : make up some nice DT ooc/shouts<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's gonna get her ass kicked ?????&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenzyBarbarian</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a question..<br />
<br />
How do you know if somebody MQ's the Spiroc Wingblade. I have done multiple MQs and know how they work. Will Kargrek say something or turn around towards you? just scared if it fails all my epic stuff will be gone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luczifer</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not as hard, no need 4 groups, we did it with 2 groups.<br />
And that was overkill.<br />
Ya need some DT eaters only at spirioc island and fghting lord.<br />
If enough DPS then 2-3 DT eaters enough.<br />
And now when island keys don poof, ya can every time go and farm items<br />
Best way to have necro SC with keys and cleric for rez.<br />
They run upto Spirios's and all group killed at dorf buddy, then SC rez and start where ya need</div></div><hr />

<br />
this link has links to many guides for raiding, including several to the plane of sky.<br />
The thing is, they are just guides and no guide can give you the experience to pull this raid off like actually being there and doing it for yourself.<br />
My suggestion is to review the guides, then gather 24 of your friends/guildmates and go get yer wingblade.<br />
