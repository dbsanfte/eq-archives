<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gleb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was on an 8 month or so leave until just recently, so I missed the beginning of LDoN, and since I had to level up to 65, I skipped it until now pretty much.  <br />
<br />
I have been reading a lot about procs added to weapons, but I am curious since I couldn't find a thread specifically on this topic.<br />
<br />
If I have a CHSD and I added AngerIII to it, will they both proc?  I assume so from what I have read, but will they proc independently or when the weapon procs, will it be a chance for one or the other?<br />
<br />
I think I may have worded that badly, but I think it's understandable.</div></div><hr />

There are a few links to a some good dicussions with parses on both the order that procs may fire in, and their frequency.</div></div><hr />
