<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a post on the official boards.<br />
<br />
I'd like your inputs on the current situation.<br />
<br />
In the past couple of weeks I've noticed a very disturbing trend.<br />
 <br />
I only pvp in the arena of a blue server, and in the past months my resist have only upgraded, however, the resist have been changed. Lifetaps from necro land on me with more ease then they ever did, and Enchanter can nuke me to smithereens with my 444 mr. This is ridiculous.<br />
 <br />
Now to add more frustration, priest get even more powerful regeneration, and ultra powerful heal over time. My dps is so pathetic on any caster running around that I can not even begin to dent them that they regen faster. <br />
 <br />
The game engine is so badly designed that any semblance of realism is destroyed. Whats the fun or the challenge in knowing its impossible for me to defeat any caster of my level of gear? Theres no point, the best I can do is pick up on people who are definitely below me on the gear curve.<br />
 <br />
I nver envisioned warriors as the carrion eater of pvp.<br />
 <br />
Caster get massive aa that are useful for pvp, where we get none. We're basically non-summoning 9-10-11khp mobs with pathetic dps, pathetic following, and useless resist.<br />
 <br />
The game has been stripped of every insta dispell item that existed. Someone has 3 dmg shield like a druid, and with a couple clickies can keep up with our useless 2 second casting time pumice.<br />
 <br />
I hit for less on a druid then I do on mobs of the same level. thats wrong, the druid stands there, channels heals with focus that totally blows my efforts, and lets her ds kill me, and I'm using a blade of war. What is wrong with the picture of a tree huger letting an armored man with a 25lbs chunk of metal beating on him, and he just takes it with a smile, heals once in a while and laugh as he dots me, and runs around me when he's bored.<br />
 <br />
Do you realise how powerful it is to give caster 50% spell haste on their beneficial buffs? Enchanter with Arcane runes are indestructible. Suspend minions, is evil.<br />
 <br />
There is one solution that would begin to cover the main problem, the inability of a PC to hit another running PC. Thats totally unfair, 99% of all my duels have me running innefectively after the other person. You need to extend dramatically my melee range, or make sure I hit on people who's heel I'm on.<br />
 <br />
BTW, as a side to melee VS caster upgrades, you went from one end, to the other and didn't do a very good job at it. To improve our dps we have weapons, haste, attack, and aa. Caster get Spells, mana regen, spell haste, aa, on top of that they get dmg focus, mana preserv focus and range focus. Give us dmg focus equivalent, range augmentation, the playing field is heavily slanted toward casters.<br />
 <br />
It's pretty frustrating to see our biggest dmg asset, haste, being made totally useless by a caster on the run.<br />
 <br />
The only fix I can thing of, for most of our problems, is to increase our melee range, as I spend the vast majority of my dueling time right behind a caster, and seeing &quot;your target is too far away&quot; scroll by.<br />
 <br />
I'd suggest getting everyone fiber optic lines, and make sure the server client always precisely know each' other's location when it comes to peoples location, however, I don't think it would be realistic.<br />
 <br />
Also, the debuffs that do 50% more debuff in pvp are insane. Its plain sick to have given caster such crippling tools, especially when we don't have anything of the sort. We have no way to make caster more susceptible to our weapons. <br />
 <br />
I'm thinking that duels are meant to make pure melee know exactly how underpowered they really are.<br />
 <br />
I can't solo as a warrior, no matter how good my gear is, about every casting class can solo, we even hear of &quot;solo LDoN&quot; will the warrior/rogue/monk dungeon be filled with 5hp mobs that hit for 15-20? <br />
 <br />
The principle is simple, in a game where the npc are so stupid as to be godlike to give a challenge, caster who own the tools to defeating those npc are overpowered for the melee who can't do anything without caster support.<br />
 <br />
I have a 65 warrior main with 456aa, my 65 wizard with 18 aa can solo any non summoning mob in tier 1-2-3 of pop without fear of dying, unless I go LD or get trained, but my warrior can't even think of soloing PoV normal mobs.<br />
 <br />
You could always make it so like NPC that whenever we're in range of something we're attacking, our attack rounds refresh precisely at that moment, and that our attack connects. What caster do with us when they run us around is ridiculous, they would never get away with it against NPC.<br />
 <br />
I've said my piece for now, hope this turns into a good discussion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah its probably not worth it for them to spend time on this, since 99% of this game is spent in PvE not PvP.<br />
<br />
I do respect your ideas thought. I think this is a very thought out post and I can definatly atest that I have experienced these kinds of problems myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just fed up of the grinding and raiding, once in a while I like to pvp a bit.<br />
<br />
I have like 456aa, and gear to match, and any puny caster can solo me easier then a PoV mob.<br />
<br />
Its not knowing I'll be defeated that stings the worst, its getting beaten by a system thats so poorly conceived and applied that I don't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
Up to a couple of weeks ago, I could at least resist a lot of shit, now I get enchanter who nuke me to death with 444mr... come on.<br />
<br />
I want an aa thats called &quot;shake&quot; when we are in front of a caster, we click on that and spit in their eyes so they lose their concentration.<br />
<br />
Caster are so overpowered its not funny.<br />
<br />
You know whats the most insulting thing, its when a wizard is doing 350 sustained dps, and he tells me &quot;I'd do more, but I'm afraid you won't hold aggro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">personally I see an easy fix give warriors(and other meles) pvp only root/snare thats short refresh/short lasting and unresistable but doesnt work 100% of the time. That in itself levels playing field immensley.<br />
<br />
I dont mind chasing casters but dueling pet classes is totaly fucked and I wont even mention bards.</div></div><hr />

I play on VZ where pvp is very prevalant, and I can assure you that we Warriors can do pretty well againts robes, can even win if they stick around and die.  The first thing you need to do is get a higher dmg 2h BoW is king for PvE but its sub bar for PvP, as the dmg is too low.  Get a Plankton Laced Greatsword(shouldn't be hard with your AA/Gear and lack of pvp in PoW) then pretty much rip up any pure caster (that doesnt just pet kite you).  The only thing the caster can do to beat you is Ghost (which you shouldnt have to worry about in the arena).  Aslo get like 4 insta clickies (AoN, Ring 8 ect...) so you cant be really dispelled, carry Crimson potions for when you fight Chanters, and with your stun kick they should even be able to get off a nuke (same for most other casters) and when they try that Plankton with full Offensive AAs will hurt them bad, since they cant heal you will usually be doing pretty good.<br />
<br />
As for your problem with Priest casters well you are out of luck they rock us hardcore, Hybrids also pretty much rock us~  BUT we do have a chance against Robes so we are not helpless!</div></div><hr />
