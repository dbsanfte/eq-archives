<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vasto</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a very vague response, heh:<br />
<br />
I think you should get rid of the crustacean greaves, for one. Neg stats are never good. Also, dump the cobalt stuff into your bag to use as clickies only.. Yeah they have alright AC, but if you can fit some sta/str/hp/anything in there, why not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rookz</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, maybe I'm missing your real haste item in the mix here, but the only one I saw was a 16% haste... that's just gimping yourself.  I like the belt for the regen and all, but honestly you'd be a thousand times better off if you scrapped it for a soulscream.  Also you have a ton of stat items with no hps.  I feel a slot with no hps is a slot wasted, unless the AC difference between a hp piece and non-hp piece is large.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katieah</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok well I just  bought a few new things, I replaced wrist 1  finger 1 and the neck.... My HP count is actualy 2.8K AC of 1017 and Atk of 1044<br />
<br />
just updated magelo...<br />
<br />
as for coin I'm not the rich type,  but I do manage to pull in about a 1.5K from saving each week. <br />
<br />
hehe still  dont understand how people can pull in so much cash  :p</div></div><hr />

Well with most LDoN plat drop rates gimped all to hell, that's one place you won't get it.  I guess Sony wanted the cheaters who duped tons of plat to have a huge financial advantage forever, so they made sure legitimate players get lower plat drop rates now.  :p  <br />
<br />
Basically you have to know where to hunt and get friends to go there, too.  When PoP was fairly new, I had a group of friends that did mephits for awhile to sell amulets made with the blood and sell the extra blood.  It was fun fighting and exploration, too.  We also outfitted our wis casters with judgment rings from PoJ and then farmed more components and sold the rings to split with the group.  Later we were doing it with bloodmetal earrings from Tactics.  None of these things are worth near what they use to be and we didn't make huge amounts of plat by the time we split it among our groups, but we did pretty well at finding the elusive good exp AND good drops.   <br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't know what the good spots are anymore, but there may be some out there.  I jump around to so many different groups and areas now instead of having one group of friends I'm with all the time.  Well... earthen rings sell for about 60k on my server, but you have to be able to grind elementals to get those components and I don't have access... :(  <br />
<br />
You can always go farm gems off the ships in Ykesha.  Heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katieah</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the tip I&quot;ll check it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">isn't that mask of the dragon slayer worth big plat?<br />
you could sell that, replace it with a face mask of frozen mana,<br />
and have quite some cash left for other slots to upgrade...<br />
<br />
only works if my memory didn't betray me, of course ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might also look at some velium fire wedding rings<br />
<br />
6 ac 65 hp is hard to pass up.  While your existing rings have comparable stats, you could gain another raw 100 HP or so from that switch.<br />
<br />
Also, once you hit 55 I highly recommend you pick up a Greatstaff of Thunder.  31/30 is solid DPS and the proc is great agro as well.  If your 2hb sucks, well tough it out, it is worth it :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pisco_ssour</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">uh... dont get the fire wedding rings! get the valorium rings of gallantry x2. best bang for the buck. but other than that i think ur on a good start. just take a look at my magelo.. might give u some ideas. there's only 1 thing on my magelo that i didn't buy by myself so i mean if i can do it anyone can, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yiktin Voxbane</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your 2hb sucks.<br />
<br />
Get a shovel 4/27, to my Knowledge is the fastest, easiest available 2HB in game and will skill ya up VERY fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pisco_ssour</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">uhh.... your right. a shovel is probuably the fastest but it also suck dmg wise and it has no proc so it sucks for keeping aggro. and since u can only skill up on mobs u get exp on (correct me if i'm wrong): a shovel isnt ur best choice.. i suggest you stick with the  greatstaff of thunder (only about 100pp).<br />
<br />
P.S. a lvl 30+ should already have a haste item which is atleast SCHW. so the haste from that brings down ur delay to about the same as a shovel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The major problem I see is that your AGI is over 200 while your STA is sub 200. Try to get those 2 stats reversed. AGI is useless as long as it's over 75. Go for hp/ac gear and look at str, dex, and agi as bonuses if they happen to be on the gear. Do some LDON adventures and pick up Everfrost plate armor unless you have the time to get North Ro plate armor which is even better. <br />
<br />
Of course you could always re-roll and pick a god that lets you wear kick ass armor ;) cough rz cough</div></div><hr />
