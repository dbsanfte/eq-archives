<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say ban him. <br />
<br />
he contributes nothing constructive to the community, and causes nothing but negativity.<br />
<br />
I don't say this lightly, either. but in this case, there's ZERO reason to keep him around, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, don't ban him.  He is an idiot, but last I heard, that was not really a reason to be banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I agree he contributes nothing, and I agree with the sentance on number 2 after the yes, but as far as I know he hasn't earned a ban... yet.  I trust the mods will ban him if he crosses the line.  As for me, I can't stand him, so I keep him on ignore.  He is the poster boy for sullon zek idiocy and immaturity (not saying all are, but he is exactly what the common sz image is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's not much of a troll. I've seen far better.<br />
<br />
His bragging is easy to ignore, because it's sooooo blatantly obvious. You'd have to have really bad self-control to let it get to you much. <br />
<br />
I mean, come ON, he spends paragraph after paragraph, BASICALLY saying &quot;Neener, neener, neener, my 4 wizards could toast your lone warrior in a lopsided fight!&quot; Why would anyone even bother to respond to that? He uses words like winzor and pwnzor. If you can't laugh at that, you need to take a step back and maybe read the post out loud to HEAR how ridiculous it actually is. <br />
<br />
And sadly, I have to admit that on the PLUS side (yes, there is a tiny bit of a plus side) ... He does have the unique perspective of the 6-boxer to offer ... and SOMETIMES (not often, but sometimes) that does add a bit to the message board and the community.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, however, he should not be banned YET, simply because he hasn't blatantly broken any of the rules. He hasn't done anything stupid or obvious to incur the ban from Raaj, Shorty or any of the moderators.<br />
<br />
If he breaks the rules, I'm sure he'll be dealt with.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, let Raaj and crew do their job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wish they hadn't added PvP to EQ in the first place.  It adds nothing to the game.  Having arena's is a good thing, and instead of PvP servers, they should have added more PvP zones.<br />
<br />
What's really fun is to go to EQFaces, and look at the people that play on PvP servers.  I'd have to say, on a scale of 1-10, they average at LEAST 2 points lower than on regular servers.  Seems that PvP not only attracts the immature and ignorant, but also the hideously ugly.<br />
<br />
I'd say ban him, while he has not done anything that directly crosses the bannable line in a single action, the combination of everything is more than ban-able.<br />
<br />
Should someone that speeds once get their liscence taken away? What about someone that runs 1 red light? Or someone that drives on the shoulder to get around a traffic jam once? Surely none of these things would warrent that, but if someone did such things repeatedly and constantly, they most certainly would.  Its much the same with his posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes folks, it's the ignore feature. It's wonderfully effective yet easy to use. <br />
<br />
He hasn't broken any of the rules, he's only been inflating his self ego from what I've seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes he is a troll by all means, no sane person would call himself the MIGHTIEST OF MIGHTY OMG<br />
<br />

Too bad the outhouse is dominated for a week by his thread. Ignore only works if most ignore him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't ban him. And he's not a troll. But for fuck's sake someone get the man a fucking messageboard muzzle. He's not baiting people intentionally even though it looks like that sometimes. The garbage he posts he genuinely thinks it interesting and important. Sadly it's neither, ever. At best it's mis-informed drivel, more often it's just dragged out moronitude. It's either really obvious crap he's just discovered and he thinks is some deep secret, or shit he's just told himself is true and spouts out as fact.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, he's harmless. Stupid, annoying, and vocal, but harmless. And yes I have called for him to be banned before, but mostly just because my brain hurt after reading one of his posts. If you ban him I have about 5 other names that should be banned for the same reasons.<br />
<br />
EDIT: If anything, implement some kinda post limiter for him. Like one post every day/other day or something=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about a post per month? I think he used his allotment for the 17 years or so if that was the case.  Yea, lets do that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only people sam is bothering are the ones that let him get to you.<br />
<br />
any other thing sam has done to get him banned ( like his old sig ); he was told to correct it and I'll tell you what; he complied to it as fast as humanly possible and all was well with the happy_fun_ball.<br />
<br />
the rest, grimmlokk summed up perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, I blame things like warning labels on coffee cups for this problem.  Human society has been coddling it's fucking inferior members for far too long.  What we need to do is get rid of all the superfluous warnings on everything and let nature take it's course.  All we need to do is that and people like Sam will take care of themselves.  The gene pool needs a little chlorine, if ya catch my drift.  Nothing malevolent, but JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.  Natural selection works for every other species on the planet, it can't be all bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's like reverse Darwinism=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is exactly reverse darwinism.<br />
<br />
The more able human society is able to support the infirm, the mentally challenged, and those afflicted with disease, the longer those people live and the increased chance that they will produce children, which leads to a general weaking of the species by not removing genes that nature would have eliminated naturally That probably will be the reason a massive disease wipes us out at some point.  That is aliens don't take one look at us and sterlize the planet first!<br />
<br />
The only alternative (preventing certain people from having children) is not acceptable in human society for the most part in today's society... but I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen at some point if the world population exceeds the world's capabilty to feed them.</div></div><hr />

Annoyance isn't bannable ... where's the &quot;No, but some days I wish he was&quot; option?</div></div><hr />

Come to think of it, there are more people in this world than are being fed.  But it looks like that guy in NinjaBurger's .sig isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />
