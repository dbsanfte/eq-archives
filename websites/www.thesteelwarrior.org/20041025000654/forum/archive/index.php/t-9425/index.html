I turned the decrepit hilt to Korbuk but my graphics were bugged.  I saw the yellow text for the exp gained for the hand in and figured I was safe.  I then rebooted and logged back on.  I still have the decrepit hilt but Korbuk does not respond to &quot;cleaning up da hilt&quot; nor does the chick in FV respond to me when I speak in Elder Elvish.  Bravely, I even handed the hilt back to Korbuk.  My hopes were dashed my him handing it back saying its not needed.  I also tried hanging the FV chick the plat bar and got the same response.<br />
<br />
I petitioned and the GM's response was along the lines of me not following the quest correctly.  I have followed everything in order so far and think I am bugged now.  While my guild and our other allied guilds could easily kill the Devourer again, I just hate to rally people for the same kill again due to some quest bug.  I know another warrior in the alliance that did the same turn in today with no problems.  <br />
<br />
Am I just screwed or what?<br />
<br />
*EDIT* I went back to Korbuk and tried handing back other items.  I got text from handing in the blade again so i tried the potion and *whammo* I am back in business.  I am not sure what happened but this did resolve it.  I know I handed the potion in once before.  I think I just got lucky.<br />
