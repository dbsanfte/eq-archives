<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oulurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any stratagy about taking the final mob in this event.  We had a raid force of 30+ avg level of 64 and he beat us down 4 times.  MA has 8k+ hps raid buffed, SA 7k+, me 6500+.  MA lasted a while with the CH cycle, even had druids and 1 extra cleric tossing in quick heals, but the still went down in a minute or so.  The rest is just a matter of time, as this guy triples with max hits of 1253, he never took more then 12 swings at me before I went down.  <br />
<br />
Wondering if anyone could suggest what disc to use, CH cycle, etc.  We lack chanters, only had 1 there level 64.  Had 3 bards, and plenty of DPS.  We've done AoW, and this guy owned us all night.  Trying again tonight but was hoping to get some feedback before hand.  Really fun event except fighting this last guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's slowable right?  This guy shouldn't be wiping 30 AoW level people.  I think we killed him with less than 3 groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hes at least partially slowable, would of course help to have an enchanter there to haste and tash - bot one if you have to. 2 group doable even, you just let your tanks die, wouldnt matter if you had 60 ppl there if you let your tanks die. <br />
<br />
paladins got to be rdy to LoH the next tank or mobs will in general will just steamroll ya in general. ppl not ching need to be tossing small heals. more than likely you had some afk hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oulurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Amazing what another cleric will do to turn the tides of battle.  We stomped this guy tonight with less dps then last night, but we had 1 more cleric in CH cycle.  <br />
<br />
Yes he is slowable, but only partially, and when he is slowed you don't really notice it.  Maybe we just had bad luck last night and he got all the right RNG's for hits, but I still don't see this guy being a 2 group encounter, or 1 like suggested on Alla's.  If we didn't need to do him to get the key for Saryn, I'm sure we wouldn't, his loot otherwise isn't worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mightyberge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">he does not have alot of hitpoints so  basically clear mobs in the area and then pull him, MA engags, go defense, and then everyone justs burns him down  fast. we do him on a reguler basis to get flags and loot not all together junk yet for us.</div></div><hr />
