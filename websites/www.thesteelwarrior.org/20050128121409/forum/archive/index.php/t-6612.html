<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay for advertising on boards that are paying their own way via donations.<br />
<br />
/rolls eyes<br />
<br />
Oh well, guess the silver lining is, I don't have to worry about that (or any further) donation to help keep the board ad-free.... nor does anyone else who helped come up with massive donations to pay the board's way, when the question of advertising to pay the bills came up, as the donations were taken and the ad put up anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sHORTY</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ehh dude, don't get your panties in a bunch... the donations weren't taken out - vB3 doesn't support the donation system we were using before so it was moved into the thread where they used to be.<br />
<br />
The donations made were made to keep the board ALIVE, and to pay the bills.. does anyone really mind a little one line text ad for products that most of us already use anyways in order to help contribute to the donations?<br />
<br />
If it's really that big of a deal, I'll get rid of it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, personally, I think this is just fine.  One line of text from reputable companies isn't anything to be pissed over.  If it was IGE, or people of their ilk, then yes I would be annoyed.  However things like Think Geek have actually been interesting for me to see, as I hadn't known about them before.<br />
<br />
Frankly, free money from decent companies that sell useful things for just one line of text is a good deal.  If you remember back when we had the old yantis / ige debate, many people suggested ads from reputable people, and now we have the opportunity.  In fact, most were in support of it then.  It isn't a pop up, or huge ad.  It isn't spyware, or from some shit company.  It is however helping with new features, like the arcade.  And it is providing us with useful companies.  Jesus man, we get a good opportunity to work with decent folks, and you're acting like ige has pop ups here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said, ya got your plus's and your negatives. <br />
<br />
Plus is there's advertising revenune.<br />
<br />
negative is that people who would and have donated to keep the site ad free, will most likely no longer donate.</div></div><hr />
