<br />
Now that i can actually get back in my corner to some success im having difficulty finding hit-boxes, seemingly randomly, on non-aerial mobs.<br />
<br />
Im wondering if anyone has had the same problems and what works best to help find hit-boxes (i.e. ~ walking backwards, looking straight down, etc.)</div></div><hr />

All you need is to have the target ring on.  The center of the mob's hitbox will be the center of the target ring.  Just stand slightly outside of the center.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah things had just about got back to semi-playability and now theyre back to being screwed up. If every patch is going to break the game I think i'll take a pass on OoW until they work it out. Looks like Woody was right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OH, yeah cornering has gotten the hard raw end of the stick after this last patch. I had just tanked aten ha ra great. Did some ssra yesterday. Every tiem the mob was pushed towards the wall, you could no longer hit it. Then if you back away it summons you and you fall through the zone.<br />

Ended up fighting Emp in the middle of his room. But I still got his torque. /h8 the fix</div></div><hr />

Atleast /rewind works, but it has too many restrictions. I got locked up in a corner killing GoTS in the Hole and couldn't get out until after he was dead. Luckily I had enough aggro to carry me through, but it was dicey at times. I've had more problems since all the &quot;fixing&quot; started than I had the day Dx9 went live.</div></div><hr />

<br />

anyways we got him to 8% after MT was trying to pull him out of the wall he end up warping on the clrs....  just dumb dumb  thy dont test this out before going live   :eek: :mad:<br />
<br />
now i heard something that the push in the walls is something to do with pets anyone hear anything like that???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not just pets, after we had a few get pushed into the walls we had all pets killed and it still happened, pets do make it harder to get them back out though.</div></div><hr />

NOW  you  all know how us rangers felt when the MA's  always  cornered  mobs.   But  yes this is a  tad different. Sony's Dx9 implementation  SUXKS!</div></div><hr />

No more easy corning kt, vindi, or aow  go go go circling  =/</div></div><hr />

Yeah, thats pretty different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We did TZ and VZ though, even though VZ spawned way too many VS's in the second wave. Arent there supposed to be  5 in the first, 5 in the second and 5 in the third?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like you were with us on VZ. what happened was we killed the wrong VZ too soon in the first wave and that spawned the 2nd wave before we were done killing the 1st. Someone aggroed one VZ form wave 2 and it just happened to be the wrong one so we have wave 2 and 3 at the same time. Much more fun than when it works normally lol.<br />
<br />
And yeah I think if we could have cornered RZ we could have killed him, we just couldn't get the dps we needed without using pets and with melees constantly having to adjust to keep from pushing into a wall.</div></div><hr />
