<br />
I was just thinking lately for no particular reason at all.<br />
<br />
What's your guild leader's class usually on your server?<br />
<br />
I see most the common are Warrior's and Monks as guild leader of a guild. I have not seen a ranger as a guild leader before. Occasionally there are druids and necros and cleric guild leaders but I think the ranger class is the least.<br />

As I was expecting, usually the melee classes are the guild leaders most of the time. It's kind of interesting. Anyone want to figure it out on why just for the fun of it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>FarlanderB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yah I know why melee classes are guild leaders / raider leaders. It's because we have nothing else to do while everyone else is casting their spells or buffing people up. Might as well TELL them what to do. Besides.. melee classes are superior anyway. /nod</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't noticed a clear consistency with leadership class. Personally, I think that casters may make better leaders because they can stand back and watch the excitement without actually being _in_ it. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, while our raids don't really have a &quot;leader&quot; per se, a male ogre warrior would generally be thought of as the raid leader.  This is primarily because he is an officer and the main tank - it just makes sense for him to be giving the instructions and directions.</div></div><hr />
