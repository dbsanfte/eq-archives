<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of easy upgrades would be Amulet of Mummy Wrappings (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=43405) and get rid of the Solstice earring and get another Bloodmetal earring of Engagement. Maybe work on ornate Helm and Gaunts or the North Ro/ EF LDoN's for armor from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">stick with the solstice for now ... it really is the absolute best bang for your buck, and since you have several other slots that can use upgrades, your money is better spent elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I would suggest perhaps ornate arms/help and drops from regular and hard ldon (droppables) which can upgrade you such as amulet of mummy wraps, face mask of frozen mana ... the hard ldon drops are quite pricey, but are worth it and can always be resold when you outgrow them.<br />
<br />
I see you worship the tribunal ... you may want to look into some cultural armor by slot as those are always relatively cheap alternatives to ornate which can always be resold.<br />
<br />
your bp, gloves, rings, earings, weapons, bow, belt, cape, shoulders and legs are all pretty strong.  your 50k would probably be best spent on your other slots.</div></div><hr />

I would recommend the plate from EF. Unless you are really into LDoN. If so go for Nro pieces.</div></div><hr />
