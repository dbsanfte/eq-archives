<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maolas</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the introduction of the LDoN proc augments, I've been mulling over some weapon choices for a few days.  Would like some input.<br />
<br />
I have the following weapons currently:<br />
<br />
The Sword of Ssraeshza<br />
Guadralek, Sword of the Sky<br />
Great Blade of Storms<br />
Keen Edged Cleaver<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
<br />
Right now (LDoN, mostly), I've been using the Guadralek in groups because of the aggro proc on it.  The Sword of Ssra works ok in some situations, but when a high-DPS rogue or monk comes along, I sometimes have problems.  However, the stats from the Ssra are hard to give up (I lose about 130hp going to Guadralek).  I don't usually end up grouping with shamans, and I'm only at about 250 STA discarding weapon stats.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm trying to decide if I should stick a Force of Ykesha proc on the Guadralek or the Ssra Sword.  Any ideas on this sort of thing?<br />
<br />
Another option would be trying to get together some money for an Ornate Greatblade, which pop up in the bazaar occasionally, and sticking Ykesha on that.  From what I can see, the OG would give me better DPS than the Ssra Sword, not to mention marginally better stats (-25ac).  I will have Avatar from primal most of the time, and my attack is usually about 1500 in a typical group (group with rangers a lot).  I read some reports on the board that the OG is only brought to a good DPS point when you have an ATK to overcome the AC of whatever you're fighting, but it seems like LDoN stuff has relatively low mitigation (have not parsed, but similar posts + anecdotal experience seems to support this).  Should I aim for the OG and ditch the rest of the weapons?<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a good balance between all the aspects of these weapons.  DPS, stats, aggro.  Keeping in mind that Guadralek provides me with a decent level of aggro, what would you suggest I make my weapon goal?<br />
<br />
I'm not guilded nor will I be for a while, if at all, so my only available options are going to be working with what I have or buying stuff in the bazaar.  I would prefer 2handers for the DPS and riposte reduction, as I anticipate I will still be hitting PoP fairly regularly.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Update:  Just wanted to add that I realize that a call like this is highly subjective.  My intent of this post is just to get people's opinions and the backing reasons, so I can get a bit more data on which to make my decision.</div></div><hr />
