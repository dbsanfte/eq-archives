<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roneb McRae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have gotton to where I can tank succesfully in matters of enough HP's to tkae damage  from mobs in Plane of Justice. Now I ahve ANOTHER problem.<br />
<br />
Aggro.<br />
<br />
Casters get pised when they get aggro and I can't get it back even when it is sometimes there fault from nuking x 5 in 10 seconds :P<br />
<br />
I taunt like crazy but it doesn't seem to work....I hack at them and I hit  in the high 30's low 40's every 2 seconds or so....<br />
<br />
Is haste a reason why I cant get aggro? I am currently doing eyeptah of plunder (hour 4 of sotrmfeather camping :(  )<br />
<br />
Please help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, gear being difficult to get on Stromm when it first opened Gunnar had a hellish time until he got a GSOT and soon after the Droga weapons so be prepared for a bit of a haul.<br />
<br />
The stromfeather haste is SPELL haste to be used when you lack better haste from a spellcaster.You need to get some WORN haste.Three obvious spots that come to mind are; lower guk for an fbss 21 pct haste,velks lab for schw for 22 pct haste(I did this lower than you in worse gear),and soon Veksar in the smith camp for a soulscream belt... er 31 pct haste if I remember.I did that at about 50.Worn haste is very important for aggro so fix that first.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately though, haste alone with less than uber dps weapons blows for aggro.It's one part that you need,however,you also need weapons that have a decent hate proc to them.I don't know what kind of pp you an raise,but, troll forged ykesha swords ,frostbringers and the droga weapons etc fit this bill.Do some searching here for aggro weapons based upon what is available to you .Your dexterity is important to frequency of procs.Gear and mostly buffs will help you raise it.<br />

Read these boards alot hehe. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could try some new weapons, try a Black Blade of Tormenting and Frostbringer combo, but wait on the Frosty until you hit level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">he is on mac server, there lots of missing content and even more missing player. So he's unlikly to find anything in the bazard (at least he can't count on it).<br />
since you still don't have any haste, gunnar got it right, the FFBS (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=1365) fron a lvl 44 mob in lower guk (becarefull!! heavy train!!). and since you are in lower guk with a whole group (since you can't solo here), go deaper for either the big boss of either side (living side :  The Froglok King  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3445) that drop A Mithril Two-Handed Sword (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5401) vs dead side :  The Ghoul Lord  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=1421) that drop Short Sword of the Ykesha (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5500)).<br />
the MTHS will provide you the haste a a decent DPS (but maybe less than your curent polarm), but a couple of SWotY with good DEX and superior Haste (CoF, Soulscrean, ...) will give you more aggro.<br />
if you can find at least five other player for lower guk farming, you will learn how to deal with the more dangerous dungeon of Antonica cuase of its so famous trains and add. deffinitly the best place to teach to every member of a group there role. and a great place for loot (at lesat for you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wanted to throw this in.. All the above are good suggestions and by all means adhere to them. As far as maintaining aggro goes, it is the entire groups responsibility to help the Tank Maintain Aggro. You can only do so much. If a caster is over nuking or a Knight is stunning during the fight (For example) then they are NOT doing their part in helping you maintain aggro. It can be frustrating at times believe me but there will be times when others are only making it more difficult for you. If I am the MT and I see another group member with an aggro proc weapon I ask them to replace it with a non procing wep if possible. If you get things straight from the start then usually the others will do what you ask. Some on the other hand take it personally and wont help out. Don't ask me why.  I weild the Sword of the Bloodsworn (Pri) and Copper Hammer of Striking (Offhand) The stun on the Bloodsworn works on mobs up to level 65, Hammer up to level 55.  For a two hander I use the Greatstaff of Thunder. GSoT Stun proc also works  on mobs up to lvl 65. For a non-raiding (PoP/GoD) warrior, these have done real well for me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup aggro is a team sport.However,without haste and appropiate weapons you render some dps classes practically incapable of functioning these days hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ibiudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my 2 cp's.<br />
  get a worn haste item, buy/ grind the best weapons you can get.<br />
 if you have LDoN, go get some pts to use. there is a 41% haste augment, weapons with 3 aug slots, and Hate augs,, these are underrated,, a augment that proc's pure hate, no dmg,, just raise's you on the hate list fast.<br />
  keeping agro isn't always about the dps you can do, if you can proc pure Hate you'll keep agro better.<br />
 <br />
on the other hand have the MT keep agro is the group's responsiblty as well:<br />
  healers not overhealing and keeping as much range as they can, distance is your friend.<br />
  casters not over nukeing,, or nukeing then rooting the mob so it can' t move.<br />
        wizard CC= nukeing it,, then rooting and sitting<br />
 slowers / debuffers not doing there thing to fast<br />
  pets haveing taunt off<br />
<br />
  and more things besides that.<br />
