<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">God dammit. I've done this same mission like 4 times now, and yesterday I had to do a mission 5+ times before I didn't disconnect and have to restart. Man... it's just so dang irritating. Does this happen to other people? Is there a fix? Inquiring minds want to know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GAAAHHH!!! That time, I was actually in the middle of killing the boss. Woulda taken me another 20 seconds, tops, to finish the mission. This makes frozen baby jesus cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Happened to me repeatedly on the Doc Vahzilok story arc the first time around. My server (Justice) can get reaaaaaal unstable at times.<br />

We've been getting that from time to time, as well.  And the past few days have brought an auto-rewind when we do lag out that's making areas hard to navigate sometimes.<br />
<br />
We get either or both those issues in bursts ... we're fine for a few hours, then fux0red, then fine, and of course peak times are when most of this happens to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This happened to me only once.  I think it is because all the servers are pretty crowded. I do not think that they expected so many players right  from launch.  I hope they are planning to add one or two more servers and allow a certain percentage of players from each server to transfer to them.</div></div><hr />

We suspect that this is the case ... we can't be sure, and we're checking with our ISP (recent lightning strike in the front yard resulted in bad stuff happ'nin to our cable modem and both computers ...), and we've noticed the problem with *rewinding* since then.  But, we were also off for 4 or 5 days as a direct result of it.  I have also spotted a thread with CS involvement on the official boards discussing the *rubberbanding* issue, and so I figger it's not just us, they know about it, and they are examining it and evaluating solutions.</div></div><hr />
