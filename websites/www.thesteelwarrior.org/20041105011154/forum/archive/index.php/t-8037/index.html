<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering where to go for single group gear upgrades. And, since it's patchday, I was hoping some of you more experienced warriors have time to browse through my magelo (left-side box link) and hopefully give me a few pointers as to where I can get some single groupable armor/weapon upgrades. As it is now, all the upgrades I see are on guildraids, but I wouldn't mind working on my character on my own time as well. Any and all help is very welcome and much appreciated  :)</div></div><hr />

I am not that experienced but the thing I see is a Stonemite Mask from Sewer trial (see my Magelo). Maybe you can get those nice 31 AC Horn Spiked Shoulders from Nightmare although I doubt they are 1 groupable.</div></div><hr />
