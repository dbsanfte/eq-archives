<br />
i am a 56 warrior, CS1, ND1, Run3<br />
<br />
i am looking at tanking ixiblat fer in about a week for my cleric, along with a couple other clerics (we gonna take him down a few times i HOPE)<br />
<br />
this is what the raid force looks like so far..<br />
<br />
<br />
56 ogre warrior (5k+ hps buffed)<br />
56 cleric<br />
59 bst (with epic)<br />
62 Ranger with epic<br />
62 cleric<br />
56 epic rogue (or shaman)<br />
57 Necro<br />
57 Druid<br />
58 Cleric<br />
59 Mage with epic<br />
56 Necro<br />
<br />
we might have some more show up for the fight, but that is what we are looking at right now...<br />
<br />
the reason for the rogue or the shaman is of course that the rogue also has a shaman...  might also have a 65 ranger PoT equipped show up along with a 58 cleric... not certain on that.<br />
<br />
should we be looking for someone with a higher lvl slow... should we take the shaman or the rogue?<br />
<br />
i have been to an ixiblat fight before, but that was as a 52 druid and i did not organize it...<br />
<br />
looking for input here and suggestions, thanks!<br />

64 CLR<br />
65 WAR<br />
65 WAR<br />
64 SHM<br />
65 RNG<br />
65 WIZ<br />
took about 1 min to kill him.<br />
<br />
Ranger did FR buffs SHM slowed he dropped fast, <br />
might want to pull with Dispell dont recall but I do believe he has a DS then slow him and give em the beat down, hes not that tough really you should be set with DPS, considering you got 2 necros.. <br />
Sucks you gotta choose between the SHM or ROG but I recommend SHM just for slow..BST dont get a good slow til 60, then 65, but if you wanna feel safe with DPS, drop the SHM after buffing and log ROG for DPS, have the mage malo and BST slow.<br />

<br />
The radius on the Ixiblat AE is targeted on the MA. <br />
<br />
Back before there was a lucy, we thought it was a cone.<br />
<br />
I think it is akin to the Tallon Zek targeted AE around the MA.<br />
<br />
I know we used to turn him around so he wouldn't face anyone. <br />
<br />
We thought his AE was frontal only back in 2000...<br />

<br />
also, bst epic procs a 50% slow... and i can tell you, that damn thing goes off ALOT (thank Rallos for the Provoke line!)<br />
<br />
something i just thought of...<br />
with disc's unhooked... before he is slowed should i pop furious, then defensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daoga,<br />
<br />
I did Ixiblat Fer a while back and I was really nervous about attempting him as I did not want to blow it.  Here some more info, sorry I don't have more, but I've only done him once.<br />
<br />
I 6boxed the following:<br />
65(60aa) warrior - ended up pulling Ixiblat (arrow)<br />
65(40aa) enchanter - DC'd Gylton as pet &amp; 70% slow on Ixiblat<br />
65(37aa) necro - w/rogue pet<br />
65(22aa) magician - w/rogue pet<br />
65(39aa) cleric<br />
65(39aa) druid - died on the pull because I cast a debuff<br />
<br />
I pulled with an arrow in the end and walked him back, hugging the zone wall.  I was able to avoid other mobs this way and easily outran Ixiblat with sow (might've been only run3, cannot remember, think it was just run3)<br />
<br />
I fought him right at the Skyfire zone area, as it is plenty big and I figured I could run the cleric to the zone if things went overly bad.<br />
<br />
Everyone was in full Skyshrine (SS) armor at the time, no epics, nothing overly great (war had shortblade of lightning(off) and copper hammer of striking(main)).  I went defensive off the bat.<br />
<br />
Things to keep in mind, which almost cost me the encounter:<br />
<br />
1)  Stay in range of the cleric's heal spells, or better yet, keep the cleric close to you.  The cleric CH spell has a fairly short range compared to other quick heals, so you may just want the cleric to run in near you to heal, then back off.  If possible, I'd simply keep your main cleric near you while another, further away, heals just him.  The duration should be short enough that you can do this no problem.<br />
<br />
2)  Get FR up there, but it really isn't his big killer, his melee is.  Get the mage damage shield on you (Adds FR), get druid circle of seasons (or protection of seasons at that level, whatever they have).<br />
<br />
3)  Once you spawn Ixiblat, he spawns ACROSS the zone from the guy you handed into.  I didn't know this.  Basically, if you hit the giant fort entrance and keep that to your back and go straight out, you will bump into Ixiblat's spawn.  He's huge, very berry orange and ready to stomp your guts into the potmarks of Norrath's landscape, you won't miss him ;)<br />
<br />
4)  With the new changes to EQ, I would (personally) pull him with Incite (or closest to it) to get aggro up there.  Reapply it constantly.  I would then furious with a high dmg 2hander to further aggro (once in position), you may wish to mightystrike him, if the dmg is ok at this point.  Then hit defensive.<br />
<br />
5)  If you have an enchanter with DC, you can DC Gylton or one of the other wurms in the area as they are low enough.  That will do quite a bit of dmg for you.<br />
<br />
Finally, here are the stats from my single encounter.  I was quite nervous and didn't nuke much as I was so tense, I could only concentrate on &lt;taunt&gt; and &lt;ch&gt; macros.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duoed him with my DC'd level 57 cleric (56 at the time). Fought him at his spawn point, adds are a non issue if you just back up to avoid them. Slowed with ToD, cleric could stay well out of AE range. Hits like a PoV mob.</div></div><hr />

i have worked hard to not let my earlier experiences hinder me too much, but... well... it does not always work<br />
<br />
BST will most likely pull with cancel magic (she is also my wife IRL)  our plan is to pull to the SF zone.<br />
<br />
and haass, i realize this is not kunark, but not all of us are wearing Ornate or better either =/<br />
<br />
as for 6 boxing... /salute<br />
i have a hard enough time 2 boxing lol<br />
<br />
thanks for all the input folks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well unless you're wearing crafted and a treeweave, I seriously don't think you're going to have any problems.  Oh, and you don't have to pull to skyfire, kill him where he spawns.  There's not enough shit roaming around to bother you.  I don't think we got one add when we dropped him last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since you've probably already killed ixi by now heres a hint about ragefire<br />
<br />
we killed him with 2 warriors a pal a cleric a bard and one more..<br />
the pal is really decked and cleric is good but thats about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slowmotionz</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ixibat is easy... He's like a PoV mob. Most people pull the guy all the way to the SF zone for convenience.<br />
<br />
You shouldnt have too much problem with that setup... I mean I was level 57 and tanked Statue when 2 level 60+ warriors got dropped for a minute or so :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope, haven't dropped ixi yet, that is NEXT friday heh,<br />
<br />
once we drop him, will come back and let you know what happened =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also if you plan to try him multiple times be warned, it takes between 60-90 minutes for the trigger mob to respawn now. Course that gives you time to run to Skyfire in between kills and hunt for shards if the cleric doesnt have them yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed Ixblat two nights ago for a friend. 7 of us level 65s turned up and it was a total slaughter. The wizard who came along just went nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke. He was just messing about and I couldn't have got aggro for love nor money. Died damn fast though - about 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Could easily be duo-ed with a shaman/cleric/druid.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is this mob was the first ever raid encounter I did with my guild somewhere between 2 and 3 years ago. We had 3 guilds there at the time chain spawning him for various people's epics.<br />
<br />
Killed him where he spawns to save messing about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnawbone</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you've done tier 2 planar mobs, you should be used to hits for 500 and know how to deal with that. This fight isn't really any different.<br />
<br />
If you haven't, well, your defensive disc will make it feel like a normal Tier 1 planar mob.<br />
<br />
Couple of quick ponts if you are overly anal:<br />
<br />
- If you pull to SF zone, you can hide casters from the AoE behind the rocks. It is a directional AoE, so MT in front, other melee in back.<br />
<br />
- Slow is the key (just like any planar mob). I'd rather have a dedicated slower than wait for a BST proc, but you'll have the healing power either way.<br />
<br />
- His HPs should range into the 20k iirc. <br />
<br />
- Chaining Furious and then Evasive/Defensive discs will pretty much get you all the aggro you need for the fight.<br />
<br />
- You have plenty of overkill. The 59 epic mage can nearly solo him. For that reason I'd have the shaman come for the extra buffs and reliable slow.<br />
<br />
Unless the healing gets fubared royally, I'd be surprised if you lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did him a few months back for my GF's twink cleric who was 52 at the time.<br />
<br />
We had 1 group - 65 warrior, mage, shammy, rogue, boxed chanter and 52 cleric<br />
<br />
We assembled at his spawn point, had the cleric bind there so she could trigger him then gate back to the group.<br />
<br />
Triggered, tagged with an arrow, the cleric gated back to us and spam cast fast heals (probably divine light at that level) - shammy slowed and everyone else worked on killing him, fight lasted about 30secs.<br />
<br />
disc furious then defensive or just defensive, whatever you are comfortable with.  Make sure all casters have their FR up and FR buffs on, dont sacrifice hp/ac for FR yourself tho cos you will have heals landing anyway.  Have the clerics spam heal you with quick heals, dont worry about CH chain, fight isnt going to last long enough for anyone to run out of mana.  Incite, give yourself 10secs alone with the mob then call everyone else in and have them burn him down.  Will be all over before you know it.<br />
<br />
And yeah, the first time I tanked Ixi I was lvl 56 still wearing a treeweave with a couple of bits of crafted and a couple of bits of cobalt.  Back then he was bad ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, thanks for all the encouragement guys.  i got some gear upgrades the other day, Fierce Heraldic BP, Vallorium Ring of Gallantry, FH girdle, Visor and some other gear.  now with just 59 BST and 56 Cleric buffs i clear 5100 hps.<br />
<br />
humorous story... not too long ago we tried to single group VSR, i did not realize that his proc was a 1500 lifetap... (my wife kept calling it a HT lol)<br />
<br />
i waited for a CH, started casting at 40%, BOOM he hit me twice with it... i died, we rallied, got another 4 people there and dropped him in 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
i guess what i am saying is that mentally i know we should be able to do this stuff, but deep down i have not convinced myself of it at times heh.<br />
<br />
again, thanks for the encouragement and advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Gnawbone <br />
- If you pull to SF zone, you can hide casters from the AoE behind the rocks. It is a directional AoE, so MT in front, other melee in back. <br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
First, reading the above....there is NO such thing as a directional AE...they are ALL either targeted around the mob/caster (PBaoE) or targeted around the target/tank.<br />
<br />
I will give 100k to anyone that can provide a link to lucy that shows a directional ae. Anyone?<br />
<br />
Second, he is easily soloed by a decent shaman, he is that gimp.  I have done it myself, with a few heals tossed to me by the cleric I was killing him for, tho they werent &quot;needed&quot;.  He has low AC, and kunark mob resists, slow landed the first time.  His AoE is centered around his target, iirc, and its easily resistable.  He doesnt do anything that would make him hard.  Think PoV Golem with minor aoe...wait, pov golems proc a galss shards thing, so I guess he is nothing more than a pov golem.  If he had a dispel or lifetap, it would be diffent, but he doesnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done him before with 5 people...2 clerics, 1 paladin, 1 shaman and 1 ranger, all under 62. (Shaman was actually 3boxing the ranger and cleric)  Done him many times, in fact, on my cleric and beastlord in my present guild.<br />
<br />
If you get 5100 with 59 bst and 56 cleric, with proper cleric/shaman buffs you should hit 5500-5700 or higher easily.<br />
<br />
The AE isn't exactly AE...it's a small targeted AE around the MT (no such things as cone spells in EQ, they're all just targeted AE).<br />
<br />
My recommendations:<br />
If it's your guild's first attempt, go ahead and pull him to SF zone.  You can also fight him on his spawn, but the smaller adds from roaming wasps are annoying if it's your first shot.  Get a ranger over near his spawn point and hit him with a debuff (no damage) to get him to chase the ranger.  It's a really long run to SF zone, and the ranger will most likely outrun Ixiblat (he's slow).  Make sure not to outrun him as Ixiblat can turn and start running in another direction.<br />
<br />
Since you sound as if no one in your normal guild has done him before, and you've got 3(4) clerics and a druid, I recommend a celestial before engage and then spam small priest heals on the tank as he engages off the ranger, just in case, until Ixiblat is slowed. (The 62 cleric technically should be enough just by himself after slow and probably before though, IMO)  After that, just normal cut-n-paste debuff/slow/debuff and whittle the guy down.  Position and keep everyone behind him so they don't get hit by the targeted AE, and just beat him down melee and nuke, keeping agro on you.  One dead elemental, one piece for cleric.  Fire nukes will definitely land, btw.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the only &quot;hard&quot; part is the initial engagement (when agro is questionable), it's cake after that.  I'd recommend the 65 ranger tank if he's PoT equipped, but if you want the experience (a good thing) you should.  Once you've done him once, if your healers are actually paying attention and at all skilled, they should be able to figure out how much healing is necessary for you on any subsequent kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, thanks to everyone that posted suggestions, here is what happened this weekend =)<br />
<br />
we had 4 full groups show up on friday night!! (i was amazed)<br />
<br />
from memory (will have to look at my logs at home later)<br />
<br />
63 cleric<br />
63 warrior<br />
62 cleric<br />
62 ranger<br />
61 Shaman<br />
61 Monk<br />
60 druid<br />
59 BST<br />
59 Cleric<br />
59 Mage<br />
57 Rogue<br />
57 Cleric<br />
57 Druid<br />
56 Warrior<br />
56 Mage<br />
53 Enchanter<br />
51 Druid<br />
<br />
there were more i think... will have to pull it up hehe<br />
<br />
anyway, as you can guess, the 63 warrior tanked, 61 shaman slowed and crippled and he was cake, twice.<br />
<br />
then another guidl showed up and wanted to &quot;squeeze in&quot; this sucked, but they did get back to the spawn point for naxot before we got a cleric there, so we gave it to em.<br />
<br />
most people had to log at that point, not wanting to wait 2 hours for another spawn, so we decided to regroup on saturday.<br />
<br />
my wife logged her druid back on later to go do a port i beleive, and found the guild that &quot;squeezed in&quot; all dead!<br />
<br />
they wiped on ixiblat.  so.... we ported people in, and i talked to the raid leader, asked if they were going to regroup and try again, they were, so we held off, they engaged, and ixiblat proceeded to bounce from person to person, flattening them.<br />
<br />
after they were all dead, we jumped in and finished him (the raid leader had said they would do one more attempt and call it if they failed) so, we got the piece from ixiblat for my wifes halfass cleric (she has the shell to trigger him)<br />
<br />
i tanked him that fight! /rar!!!<br />
<br />
my wife offered to trigger him again for the cleric, and i offered to tank him if they were up to it, the other guild declined the offer.<br />
<br />
ok, so shoot ahead to the next day,<br />
<br />
2 groups show up in BW, we trigger him, bst pulls with cancel magic up to SF zone.<br />
<br />
i engage, hit berate.<br />
<br />
agro jumps to the shaman, i spin and get agro back, too late shaman dead, i don't even think about, just keep wailing on him, forgot to hit defensive.<br />
<br />
so i am healing with my cleric when i notice that i am at 9% health!! so i pop furious at 7% health, ixiblat is at 8%, and bam!! ixi is down!!<br />
<br />
that is when the shaman says, &quot;if only i could have gotten him slowed&quot;<br />
<br />
i was like... he wasn't slowed? i tanked ixiblat, at 56, with about 5500 hps, unslowed? RAR!!!! /phear Da Oga!!<br />
<br />
now to do the Overking in Chardok...</div></div><hr />

They are all level 60 so they cant be stunned.<br />
<br />
Normally we just ae down to king / queen in 30 minutes.  But just watch your pull if you see them, they'll eat your enchanters for lunch while they are chain stunning.  <br />
<br />
Also, got a Spirit Wracked Cord drop last night.  I didn't know this was mob dropped.  Anyways, came off one off those named.  The end in a III</div></div><hr />

<br />
she could do the same with the king, we just have to figure out how to get her through the locked doors with only 1 rogue. (who IS kos)</div></div><hr />

Took us all of 5 minutes to run down there, clear the roamers, pacify the shit and pull the king to the hall, where he died a quick death.</div></div><hr />

Just need a non-kos cleric to drag a mage down and rez them.  If you have a non-kos tank or enchanter that's nice to protect the mage/cleric from roamers until the mage gets enough mana to start CoHing.  If the mage is non-kos it's even easier.  Also need a non-kos or SoS rog to open the door.</div></div><hr />
