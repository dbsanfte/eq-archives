<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norbs</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a bit of troubles with the magelo site and was hoping someone might know what I am talking about and how to fix it. Everytime I try to go to www.magelo.com, I am prompted with a &quot;save file&quot; window asking me to save a file called &quot;magelo&quot;, the file type shows up blank and after I download it my computer doesnt know how to run it. I get the option to have my computer search the internet looking for a program that runs the &quot;magelo&quot; file, but haven't found anything yet. And after I save the file the webpage still doesnt load up. Has anyone else had similar problems with this website? Could it maybe be my internet settings? I was told I might have java script disabled but I don't know how to check it or enable java if it is turned off. <br />
I run windows xp<br />
No firewall (to my knowledge)<br />
Cable internet.<br />
Thanks to anyone who can help me out here.</div></div><hr />

I don't get a &quot;save file&quot; thing though, not sure why that happens for you.<br />
<br />
The admin posted this on the Magelo forum :<br />

&quot;ya there is something going on with the network, either on the server(network card dead ?) or something else. I gonna move the application to the new servers in 2 weeks and those servers are hosted elsewhere, it should solve many issues, in the meantime i apologize for this pretty bad performance/reliablity.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Clear your cache and cookies. This should alleviate your problem. You can just delete the Magelo cookie, but it can be a pain to find one cookie out of potentially thousands.</div></div><hr />
