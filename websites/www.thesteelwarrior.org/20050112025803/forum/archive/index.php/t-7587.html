  The way i see it, the mobs does not fully clear the agro list.  Just set the tank(the one on the top) to 0 agro. While all the rest keep their agro.  So the second person on the agro list gets agro after the blur.  This right?<br />
  If though it had to be this way after looking at the fight we have done.  And how the mob behaves and who gets agro after the &quot;blur&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on the mobs, I think.  I know the actual memblur spell completely resets aggro.  This obviously is not happening, though, because there is no &quot;pull emote&quot; that one sees with memblur.<br />
<br />
Either way, though, on these mobs the way we normally do it is to set up multiple tanks to fight him, and assist heal (sorta like VZ in time).  Normally, one of them is able to pick up aggro again relatively quickly (wait till warlord in poeb!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mem blur is the gayest, most retarded thing I've ever dealt with in EQ.  The mobs in Air don't seem to mem blur very often, but the mobs in Earth seem to mem blur at least every 5-10 seconds.  It gets to the point where it becomes ridiculous, especially when you're watching Target's Target and you see name after name after name go cycle through in just a short order.  AE Taunt?  Sure.  You'll only lose agro again in about 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Knights are good at tanking the mem blur mobs, especially paladins.  I've never fought Warlord Gintolaken, though I will soon, but every mem blurring mob I've fought also has significantly lower damage output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, the absolute worst mem blurring mob I've ever fought is, hands down, A Perfected Warder of Earth from the dust ring in PoE-A.  I've never seen agro bounce around so freaking much, all in the while dealing with red con, unmezzable adds, that seem to pop in droves.  <br />
<br />
I can't imagine the most well kitted, finest, and most organized small bunch of players beating this script.  It's like the only the goddamn Red Army can beat it.  =/</div></div><hr />

Air has always been like zero to two times about.</div></div><hr />
