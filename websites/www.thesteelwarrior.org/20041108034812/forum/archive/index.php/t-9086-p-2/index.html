I got a sword hilt (will get name tonight and post it) from a murkglider (?), the umbrella looking things floating around in Nobles Causeway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Vyrance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i just killed the girplan devourer with 14 people, some time gear, easily.  some info on his DoT:<br />
<br />
the DoT has a resist check of 150 against disease.  it does a 500/tick hp reduction and also does a minor AC reduction.  just keep your first slot cleared before fight and his knockback will keep dispelling his DoT.<br />
<br />
also, he hits really low compared to what his max hit is, i maybe got hit for max 3 times the entire fight.  also, he can be slowed.  he does rampage and occassionally flurries.  hes not a hard fight, but he has a decent amount of hit points.  the max hit i got while defensive was maybe 1200s, wasnt watching too much because there was really no danger.  even without defensive though, his usual hit seemed to be in the 600 range.<br />
<br />
log from turning in the hilt to korbuk is:<br />
<br />
Korbuk Grimblade says, 'What a worthless specimen this is.  I don't understand why my vision would show me dat creature if all it had was this mediocre quality hilt.  I also don't understand why there's energy emanating from da hilt when it cannot be used to wield a blade in its current state.  I think we're going to have to look into [cleaning up da hilt].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'cleaning up da hilt?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Grimblade says, 'Right now it would fall apart if you tried to attach a blade to it.  We're going to put some luster back into da hilt and I think I may know someone who can do it.  I don't remember her name or even where I found her, but I do remember running into a [shady jeweler] on da outskirts of one of the larger cities of kunark.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what shady jeweler?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Grimblade says, 'She worked on da outskirts to sell to less reputable individuals, like myself.  She didn't live on the outskirts though, only worked there.  I want to say she was part of da port authority, but I can't quite remember.  I also don't remember her name, or if I even ever knew it, but I do remember dat she was one of da best I ever dealt with.  Take da hilt to her, if you can find her, and see what she can do with it.  One more thing, she's a fan of her own tongues, so be prepared for dat when you speak with her.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Sounds like Firiona Vie or the Outpost in Overthere.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Vyrance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Okay i found the person in question and her name is Corfia Nultethen in Firiona Vie.  She is a high elf located at -3820, +1400.  This location is on the large dock that leads to the Translocator, shes located on a small room on the left.  To talk to her, you must speak Elder Elvish.  I got my friend Phelon to PL me for 10 minutes to max the language.<br />
<br />
Here's how the text goes from here and the tasks she asks of you:<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Corfia Nultethen'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Yes, what can I do for you?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Korbuk sent me'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'That's really quite fascinating, but doesn't mean a whole lot to me.  I really don't care who sent you.  You don't have any [items of value] to me, so be gone.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What items of value?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Well... if you must know, I'm in need of a platinum bar so I can continue my work.'<br />
<br />
At this point you go and buy a platinum bar for roughly 105pp, can be bought a few hundrd yards away in FV.<br />
<br />
Hand platinum bar to Corfia.<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Aha, something worth my time.  But I've changed my mind.  I'd prefer if you made me something that really showed me how interested you are in my craft.  We jewelers are hard to please, but if you can present me with a [Nocturnal Mask of Acuity], I'd be more than willing to atleast speak with you.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What Nocturnal Mask of Acuity?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'The mask is an interesting blend that will allow me to see much better in the darkness, where we elves can sometimes have trouble.  To make it, you'll need an enchanted electrum bar and two darkened star rose quartz.  Show it to me when you've made it.'<br />
<br />
The items needed to make this mask can be bought off of her really cheap, maybe 5pp at the most for each of the three items.<br />
<br />
I had my friend with a 231 skill in jewel craft make the item.  She enchanted the electrum bar, then combined it with the two darkened star rose quartz successfully on first try.  The result was the mask:<br />
<br />
Nocturnal Mask of Actuity<br />
Slot: Face<br />
CHA +2 INT +2 HP +2 MANA +2<br />
WT. 0.1   Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Hand mask to Corfia.<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Well done, but not great.  It doesn't have the sight properties I'd hoped for, but it looks nice nonetheless.  I half thought you'd shy away from creating such a lustrous piece of jeweled metal.  You didn't though, so now you have my attention.  What is it that you have for me to look at?'<br />
<br />
Hand in hilt to her.<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'What a filthy piece of rubbish!  This will need a good deal of work, I can guarantee you that.  I have a small repository of supplies that I only rarely use, and one of the things I have is a cleaning solution.  I don't often use it for most mundane things, but I'd be willing to part with some if you're willing to do me a [favor].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What favor?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Yes indeed.  I've been spending such a long time in the city lately that I just haven't had time to go on the expeditions I used to.  Such a strong and capable person as you would be able to fill in nicely.  You see, I've always wanted to explore the depths of [Veksar] to find out what treasures are hidden down there.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Veksar?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'I've heard plenty of stories and read a number of tales about artifacts of great wealth down there.  In fact, I was able to get a sneak peak into the ruins some time ago, but not enough to find what I needed.  One of the most interesting things I've read about is a tome of bones made for a necromancer named [Galuk Drek].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Galuk Drek?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Oh, he was a beast, to be sure.  One of the nastier creatures down there, but also one of the most brilliant, from what I've read.  Drek kept the tome full of information on various crafts, and one of them just happens to be jewelcraft.  I'd love to set my hands on that tome, and if you can find it, I'd be more than willing to finish up this hilt for you in no time!'</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok so went back today and beat his arse down. <br />
<br />
Took a 66 druid, 65 cleric, 65 pally 9khp, and a boxed 66 shaman <br />
<br />
Killed him pretty easy with hand add - he was actually in the building on the right where there is a hand on one side of the stairs and a ph / named on other side. He was in and left of hand in a room with a hand. <br />
<br />
Pulled him out smacked him down and got..... <br />

Skeletal Tome of Galuk Drek <br />
Magic Item Lore Item No Drop <br />

all/all race/class <br />
<br />
NO STATS at all <br />

must be some quest <br />

Oh and I found that ancient nobleman red con just around the corner under the ramp that leads to masters upstairs. He is indifferent but would not respond to hails. <br />
<br />
That's my 2 cents worth</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Vyrance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">yes i killed galuk drek last night also easily, with me (66 warrior), a 65 beastlord, a 65 druid, a 67 cleric, and a 68 paladin.  we pretty much owned him while we were fighting 2 adds also.<br />
<br />
he doubles for 1800, without defensive, and can be slowed.<br />
<br />
he casts an AE that takes 72 counters to remove, and the recast on it is 120 seconds.  i believe it has a resist check of 350 disease.  the AE does a minor hp dot it seemed and lowered all stats by 200 or so.  he wasnt hard because sinec hes a caster, pretty much the first half of the fight he kept trying to cast until he went oom, thats when he started meleeing.  its a good idea to fight him near his bind point, because at low health he will try gating.<br />
<br />
when he died he only dropped - Bone Tome of Galuk Drek.<br />
<br />
i took the tome and handed it to Carfia in Firiona Vie, and in exchange she gave me the - Glistening Hilt.<br />
<br />
i forgot to log the text from her, but it was pretty much stuff like &quot;oh thank you for returning with the tome!  here is the hilt i promised, i took extra time to make it extra nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
so then i ran back to draniks scar and handed the Glistening Hilt to Korbuk, and he gave it back and then delivered the next set of text.  i forgot to log the info of when i turned into him, but he said something roughly like: &quot;ahhh yes her name was Carfia, i remember now.  it seems shes turned this hilt back into shape.  ah take it back!  when i touched it i had another [glimpse] into a vision.<br />
<br />
here's where i started to log it:<br />
<br />
You say, 'what glimpse'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'It was a series of images, really. One was of a [young combatant] within da Muramite ranks. One was of a [gorge] somewhere. Da third was a [maze] of some sort, and da final one was in a [field of blood]. At da end, I saw four eyes dat appeared in da center of da hilt. I'm guessing da eyes go in those four holes on each side of da hilt and dat one each can be found in those four places.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what young combatant'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I noticed a creature dat walked like a man but looked like a dragon and was near a fortress. I can't say where exactly it was, but I can say it was a powerful looking creature unchanged by da onslaught of war. I'm guessing he is a relatively new champion of their people.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what gorge'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Giant creatures lumbered over da eye. I can't really say much else because dat's all I saw. They were massive and didn't look terribly friendly. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'what maze'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Near a great crystal tower within da maze, I saw da eye gleaming up at da sky. You should take caution because da tower is unlike any I've ever seen before.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what field of blood'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'In a field of blood, near a large fortress, you'll find da fourth eye, though it may be out of da sight of prying eyes.'<br />
<br />
<br />
......so it appears that to put the stuff together and make the sword, you need to fill the hilt with these 4 eyes.  im assuming by &quot;field of blood&quot; for the 4th eye he means going to the bloodfields again.  the maze im thinking he means walls of slaughter because i heard it was like a maze there?  i think the young combatant might be in bloodfields also. not sure on the first and second eyes though.  any clues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Vyrance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">after thinking, maybe the gorge and the giant creature he saw was of Bone Cracker in Nobles Causeway?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The maze could be Harbinger's Spire, I was exploring there with a group when OoW came out and down the mainhall way there is a spot where the tower itself is and it just goes up and up and up.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Vyrance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">ok so the first clue is in fact the Dragorn Champion in Walls of Slaughter.  he drops the Stone of Eternal Power - Northeast Eye, what people saying on Allakhazam.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">You say, 'what young combatant'<br />

Korbuk Brimblade says 'I noticed a creature dat walked like a man but looked like a dragon and was near a fortress. I can't say where exactly it was, but I can say it was a powerful looking creature unchanged by da onslaught of war. I'm guessing he is a relatively new champion of their people.'<br />
<br />
This is the Dragorn Champion located in Walls of Slaughter.  He's basically behind the fort right against the wall, opposite side of velkitoren/cipheron.  Already reported as dropping &quot;Stone of Eternal Power: Northeast Eye&quot; maybe one groupable but sounds like two.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You say, 'what gorge'<br />
 Korbuk Brimblade says 'Giant creatures lumbered over da eye. I can't really say much else because dat's all I saw. They were massive and didn't look terribly friendly. '<br />
<br />
This has to be one of the red con bazu's in Nobles' Causeway, there's like 3 or 4 to choose from though.  The one I'm thinking is a red con one that is KoS but you can't attack him, probably can hail him and spawn a raid encounter like how the necro 1.5 epic's mob was.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You say, 'what maze'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Near a great crystal tower within da maze, I saw da eye gleaming up at da sky. You should take caution because da tower is unlike any I've ever seen before.'<br />
<br />
This is probably the proving grounds but I don't have much experience there really.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You say, 'what field of blood'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'In a field of blood, near a large fortress, you'll find da fourth eye, though it may be out of da sight of prying eyes.'<br />
<br />
This is obviously the bloodfields, sounds like it's a ground drop maybe behind a hidden wall in the fortress or something?  I'd have to look around, really just past through the Bloodfields to get to The ruined city of dranik when I was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Yeah, here's the scoop<br />
<br />
Stone of Elemental Power: Northeast Eye is from Dragorn Champion<br />

Stone of Elemental Power: Some other eye I picked up as a ground spawn in Muramite Proving Grounds, kind of near Riftseekers, I'll give loc later, it respawns at the same place fairly regularly.<br />

There is a giant, lumbering creature in Noble's Causeway named Bazu Smasher.. or something similar. He is in the northwest corner if I recall. I know him well as he killed me twice when I took a wrong turn. Hits for 2k-ish and VERY fast.</div></div><hr />

When you're looking from the ramp, down to the fire that goes off and on every few seconds, it's exactly to the left of it when looking from the ramp otw down.

I hailed Wendin and Wendin said something like.  &quot;Be specific with your questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Btw this portion is not in the epicless one part.  So I am thinking it is something down the line.  It definately has to do with the epic sword I am thinking.   I just dont know what question to ask him.  <br />
<br />
The only reason I was intrested in him cause of the &quot;Where is the beef?&quot; line and his name is Wendin.  As in Wendy's  slogan Where is the beef?  LoL  And he is a Dwarf and one of the epic NPCs talks about him.  Someone who is a little bit farther along the way might want to pay these two NPCs a visit.</div></div><hr />

I'm not entirely sure how... wait, I know! We need to have a gem setter put these back in place and I know just da one. His name is Gridbar Galund and he makes his stay out in da towering mountains of Butcherblock. He owes me a favor or two, so I'm sure he'd be more than willing to help you out with this.'&quot;<br />
<br />
This is what our Ogre friend tells us just before we go to see the crazy dwarf Gridbar Galund.  He indicates that Gridbar is a gem setter (i.e. the person who will put the gems into the polished hilt).<br />
<br />
Now, since there is a hilt, 4 gems, gemming tool, and Spell: Fire, these can not simply be handed in to Gridbar all at once.  This makes me think that perhaps you hand Gridbar the Hilt, the Gemming Tool, and the Spell: Fire at the same time (giving you an invisible flag) whereupon perhaps he will ask you for the four gems.  In return, perhaps you'll get the jewelled hilt?<br />
<br />
This is purely speculation on my part, but it's the most reasonable thing I can think of at the moment.<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier, if we can purchase the Gemming Tool then I don't see any need for us to smith one.<br />
<br />
EDIT: In fact, Gridbar says &quot;Did you bring the stones?&quot; before mentioning the Gemming Tool or Spell: Fire at all.  I imagine whoever got this text had to hand in the four stones to get him to go further?  In that case, it's likely that you simply need to give him the Hilt, Gemming Tool, and Spell: Fire to get the final result.</div></div><hr />

I got it tonight, you can invis to it, there are 2 routes you can take if you have the map, I marked the loc everyone else said it was on my map -3766 -730 when I was exping near Tactician spawn.  Checked it today using invis, one see invis mob blocked the way, went around the back way and got it without aggro and got back to the zone without invis fading.  Its in a pretty obvious spot and not a corner, so hard to miss.  Bring a Swirling smoke potion with you in case you aggro something, if your close just use fort, pick up the bag and hit swirling potion(insta gate). Its known to have a pretty long repop, I camped there for 3 hrs and it didnt pop one day, but than picked it up the next night.  Basically it SHOULD be up if no groups have fought through there and picked it up on mistake thinking it was a good item, people tend to do that with baggy's.</div></div><hr />

I went to MPG having never been in the zone, and having never having seen a map of the zone.  Zone was empty.  I stumbled around the zone, conning every mob, and identifying places where I could re-invis when needed.  Eventually I got to the location and the stone was right there.<br />
<br />
Invis dropped twice on the way in and once on the way out, but the mobs are very far spaced out, and don't have very high aggro range despite being all red to me, and roamers are pretty rare (and don't move much).  I was using gnomish vanishing device and did not have any insta-clickies with me.<br />
<br />
I may have been fortunate, but for me, getting through Walls of Slaughter to the MPG zone line was harder than actually walking around MPG itself.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt we'll be able to walk up and buy the gemming mold off a vendor.  I'm guessing there's an NPC somewhere that either drops it, or will give it to you upon completing something else.  I'm curious about the Ogre named &quot;Beef&quot; in Highpass.. and I'm also still curious if there are any new NPC's around named Wendy or something similar.  Cookie, Horse, Beef, and Stars are all clues that haven't been deciphered yet.. or they could just be gibberish to throw us off..</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Yes buying the 'gemming tool' maybe the correct path. The combine may be a red herring. Only a person at that step can tell us.<br />
<br />
2. That we may need to hail new mobs for unsolved side quests and hope to get lucky. Heck if you are at this spot talk to the horses, you've got a dorf that thinks he's a horse maybe we have a Mr. Ed hidden among us?<br />
<br />
3. Its not what we think it is. Maybe the mold is a file mold? or chissel? Roll up sleeves and try.<br />
<br />
the big thing is that people at this step need to try and report if they get lucky. So far i've seen you can't even loot certain items if you aren't at a particular quest flag level.<br />

I'm stuck still a Girplan. Need to kill him.</div></div><hr />

patch message..warrior pages not mentioned????<br />
<br />
Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I've been keeping an eye on the progress you have all been making and I wanted to come and let you know that I found a logic error in the script that spawns the pages. The bug that was occuring was an obscure one which is the reason that it wasn't caught earlier. I won't bore you with specifics, but I did want to pass along that it had been caught and fixed as of about 15 minutes ago.<br />
<br />
We'll be pushing the fix to live as soon as we can, but I wanted to give you guys a heads up since I was able to pinpoint and fix the problem. I apologize for any problems or irritation this may have caused you all in the process. <br />
<br />

If it was found and fixed on their end days ago why isn't it going live with this patch??</div></div><hr />
