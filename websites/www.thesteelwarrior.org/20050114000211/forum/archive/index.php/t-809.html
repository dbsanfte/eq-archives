<br />
I have been having a bit of trouble with aggro in the PoP zones when a shaman or enchanter casts slow on the mob. Currently I use a Snowchipper/Frostbringer combo. I have tried telling them to hold off a bit on casting but most of the time they dont listen or if they do it seems like I still lose aggro some of the time.<br />
<br />
Another warrior told me to get a whip of ensnaring (i have a limited budget at the moment and my play time is such that getting into any decent raiding guild is difficult) He said that the snare would give me the aggro I need early on in the combat.. Has anyone else tried using this for &quot;early&quot; aggro?<br />
<br />
Another thing I am wondering is there anyway for us warriors to get &quot;instant&quot; aggro like a Paladin or Shadow Knight get with spells?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you may give me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its all about timng the taunt.  Have group spells on and hit taunt when you see slow/tash land.  Beyond that, get tatical mastery.<br />
<br />
Some other tatics you can use are: get a dex buff from the sham or get boon of garou or nights dark terror.  If you get a dex buff then ask for trickters animation.<br />
<br />
Other tricks you can use is to have them stand next to you when they do cast and then you dont lose agro from dps.<br />
<br />
Also, chanters get hate reducers/enhance spells.  the reducer spells is 200 hate or so and the enhancer is 10% but both these spells have upgrades and you need to check lucy.  Lets see:<br />

If those 2 spells dont work then your casters are screw ups.</div></div><hr />
