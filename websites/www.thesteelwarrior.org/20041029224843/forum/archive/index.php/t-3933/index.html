<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd prefer not to turn this into a discussion of the relative merits of soloing - I know it's harder than grouping in almost all cases.  I just happen to like to do it and I like the challenge of trying to put together the equipment to do it.  And it fits in with my playing time. <br />
<br />
I would just like to get input on approaches to doing it at level 55 plus, and information on how hard it would be. <br />
<br />
I had soloed a warrior to 52, but that was well over a year ago.  My haste was only 21% - armor and weapons were relatively crappy compared to what they are now and I didn't have a truncheon of doom.  I had a fungi, but, as you would guess, by that level the fungi wasn't cutting it any more - that's why I stopped.  It was still doable, just painfully slow. <br />
<br />
I'm considering resurrecting the idea with the improved equipment that is available (and cheaper) now.  With the idea that new equipment vs. old-world (preferably) or Kunark Dark Blue mobs might still be feasible. <br />
<br />
I'm a long way from being able to afford the equipment I'm listing here, but I'm patient and would like opinions on approaches to soloing at this level: <br />
<br />
I'm thinking that equipment-wise, you would be looking at Fungi Tunic, Truncheon of Doom, 35% haste item (CoCW) and Kizrak's Gaunts (or possibly the Eyepatch of Plunder).  That's about 150K worth of stuff on my server.  I know there's lots of other things that could help, but I'm figuring those are the basic required items. <br />
<br />
I'm also thinking that while I'm trying to save up plat, I could put everything into AA's - do some LDoN and eventually get 6 extra regen in AA's plus be able to get another 6 or 7 points in regen from LDoN augments or other regen items.  That would give me close to double the total regen I had with just the fungi. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking that bind wound, in general, is not going to be that helpful,  (i.e. - it's not worth putting AA points into increasing the base percentage you can heal) because it's too slow, relatively speaking. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking that because of that, total HPs are not that important - if you have enough to safely survive the mob you're fighting, then the only thing that matters is trying to minimize the number of hp's you lose during the fight, and minimize the time it takes to get them back. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking that high Dex would be important - to get the Truncheon to proc early if nothing else. <br />
<br />
I don't really know what level of AC to aim for.  If I'm fighting the lowest old-world dark blue mobs I can find, how much AC is going to be useful?  I just don't know.  <br />
<br />
So, considering that I would plan on doing this without any external buffs, what other equipment (hopefully affordable) would be essential?    What else would you change in the approach I've outlined above? <br />
<br />
What would be the easiest DB mobs I could fight from 55 to 60?  How about above 60?<br />
<br />
If you have soloed a warrior above level 55, what is your experience with it?<br />
<br />
And lastly, is this still going to be prohibitively difficult even with the additional equipment?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">used to solo spiders in Velks when the cap was 60 for aaxp. Alot of warriors used to solo shrooms in FG for aaxp also. Not sure how much regular xp you would get or when you could start because i never really tried until i was 60, but that was before ornate armor and some of the really nice weapons that are droppable now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What would be the easiest DB mobs I could fight from 55 to 60? How about above 60?<br />
Pretty much the easiest mobs you will find anywhere at this level are the undead frogloks in LGuk.  Most dars and their caster equivalents are dark blue at 60.<br />
<br />
I have no firsthand advice for after 60 but I am inclined to point toward Nurga.  I know bazaar warriors who XP solo DB's in deep Nurga at 65, and the same can probably be done in the easier parts of Nurga at 61-64 (and perhaps even in the 50's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sol B - Buggs and bats will take you till 54 ish, LDCs will take you to 60<br />
<br />
Lower Guk - Froggy king's room is mostly dark blue at 60 I think.  Probably some camps on the dead side too.<br />
<br />
If you're set on soloing I would look to get some way of healing to full after fights.  A cobalt BP or velious BP for invigorate would be one options, or otherwise BW + AAs which apparently is even faster when all maxed out.  From my own experience sitting down after a fight and waiting for your hps to come back with a fungi just isnt an option once you have 2k+ hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd try Velketor, and probably shrooms in FG aswell... and new Nurga yep. But there is something I consider essential to solo efficiently - maxed Bind Wounds + AA's that increase the healing limit. It isnt that slow at all - well it is if you use ONLY BW but, with regen from Fungi + regen from AA's + regen from LDoN aug + regen from PoT9 it becomes efficent. Just do the math - one use of BW is like one tick and if your skill is maxed, you get like 80 hp back from it; your base regen should be like 4hp / tick at lvl 52 + 15 hp from the Fungi + 3 hp from AA's + the other stuff... Well that makes something like 100+ hp back in just one tick. Considering that the cast time on Thurg and Cobalt BP is like 2 ticks... i'd say screw them. And yes, some form of additional haste is essential too - go for Ornate gaunts. I'm very aware of all that stuff because I'm used to farm HGs in RM for my part, and they hit for 90+ sometimes, so I have to rest from time to time (especially if I pull 3 or 4 of them at once). Honestly, didnt try solo for exp yet, cause I dont think it is very efficient (doing LDoN adventures is much better ;o), but what works at HGs should also work for Velk-like mobs.<br />
<br />
About AC, well, 1100+ should be enough, but 1200+ would probably be much better, dunno. Anyway, good luck. And let us know how it goes ;o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the tips.  Once I get a decent set of equipment together I'll probably try SolB and LGuk first, but I'll hit them all eventually. <br />
<br />
Cobalt BP is a great idea - they used to be so expensive that I never even thought of it, but they're cheaper than Fungi and would give considerably more hp per min between fights.  Plus I could use it as a full-time BP now, which would be a plus. <br />
<br />
However, a couple of you mentioned BW, which surprised me, so I went and did some reading up.  I know that right now I'm getting about 1/4 my skill, and it's 2 ticks between attempts, plus the fact that I can only heal to 50%.  <br />
<br />
But I get the impression that it gets a whole bunch better at skill 201.  Is this true?  I've read things that say that at 201 you can bandage to 70% and that the healed amount goes up to like 80 pts per attempt.  True?  Does that also mean that the 3 base AA's would then take you to 100% healable?  If that's true, then the healing on BW would at least equal the invigorate BP's (and be a lot cheaper).  I had no idea. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know what level you have to be to get skill 201?  I'm currently level 55 with a skill of 184, but I haven't used it a lot the last 2 or 3 levels (I only have like 2 skill points to spend currently).    Also, are skill-up wis/int based?<br />
<br />
I picked up a Truncheon of Doom cheap yesterday (4K) so I'm at least partly on my way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qaladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Level 57. If you have all the aa, BW is faster healing than a cobalt BP. On top of that, you can wear a fungi while binding and its considerably faster than cobalt.  You can also BW while invisible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When you have 201 + in BW, you can heal to 70 percent.  When you get the lev 51 first aid AA skills, you get 10 percent more per level so 3 AA spent will allow you to go to 100 percent.  Also, this allows you to bind wound others to 100 percent.  It is very nice to help the ocasional newbie you see and kind of satisfying to watch one bandaide take them from 10 percent health to 100 percent.<br />
<br />
The level 59 BW AA I don't really know how much it helps since I dont have it and there is a PoP AA as well that adds to it.  I think those just increase amount per BW attempt so they are more of an efficiency thing but still probably useful if you solo a lot.  <br />
<br />
You also will probably want to squeek in as much regen as you can.  Look to get all the regen AA, as many aura of battle and regen items as you can.  I don't have one but I bet a fungi tunic helps a lot.  It may not seem like a lot but just the 6 regen/tick from AA points gives you an extra 60 hp in a 1 minute fight and 300 hp in a 5 minute fight and could mean the difference between you soloing light blues and barely dark blues.  I have 19 standing regen now and I don't have the level 55 regen AA or a fungi so its not hard to get up around 25 to 30 standing regen a tick at level 65.  Ornate arms are 3, vindi BP is 2, spirit wracked cords is 2, stonewood bow is 2, belt of dwarf slaying is 2, fungi tunic is 15 I think, and 6 from AA is also possible.<br />
<br />
To skill up BW, get a bunch of bandaides and go to lavastorm and stand in lava to get hit points down to around 100 then get out of the lava and bind back up until skill is over 201.  This takes just a few hours to max the skill so its not too bad.  Also, get an enbalmer's skinning knife which has a proc that summons a stack of bandaides.  Very useful if you solo.  <br />
<br />
I partially soloed for many levels (when I was around 51 to 54) when I was bored but it is so very slow.  You may not want to do it very long (especially if you don't have a lot of hit points unbuffed) but if you can't get a group it is at least something to do to pass the LFG time.<br />
<br />
Also, I used the PoG BP back in my soloing days and bandaides plus regen are way better than any 15 second clicky bp so don't even bother with one unless you already have it.  If you have a cobalt bp, probably it would be better to sell it and get a stonewood bow then you get good hit points and some regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just wondering if theres any mob that a 65 can kill &quot;safely&quot; and still get some exp. Yeh... a 65 warrior can solo for exp?<br />
<br />
If its posible, what equipment is a must to have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have soloed in VL, and Fungus Grove<br />
<br />
Its about .75 % per kill in both. Its ok but not worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks again.  On everyone's advice I will bypass the invigorate bp's and just wait till I get to 57 for BW.  I have an Anizok's gauze press so bandages won't be a problem.  A little more expensive than the knife, but less hassle. <br />
<br />
As I mentioned, I already have the ToD - and I've managed to save up about 35K so another 50 or 60 K should get me a 36% haste item and the Kizrak's gaunts.  I'll probably try it without a fungi at first (not sure the cost / benefit is worth it) but I'll be working on getting some additional regen in other slots. <br />
<br />
So, then I'll just have to get 2 more levels and... umm 16 AA points and I'm good to go. :) <br />
<br />
In reality, I'll give it some trial runs once I have the back haste and the ornate gaunts and then decide whether it's worth pursuing. Both of those are items I would really want whether I was soloing or not, so there will be nothing wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">65 warrior can solo new droga and poInovations xp will be shit, but its doable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was solo'ing parts for my VP key. (yah i know. don't go there). and the KC basement camp was better than I imagined.  Area marked with 1 on EQ Atlas KC basement map.<br />
<br />
It's rarely ever camped and away from all the trains.  There's 12 spawns in 3 different rooms and they are all on 25 minute timers.  95% of the mobs were light blue cons with the occasional dark blue con.  Easily solo'd @ 65 self buffed and without ToD, sometimes 2 at a time.  Plat wasn't that bad either (about 2-4pp / kill) and lotsa bone chips / words / pages.<br />
<br />
Once you learn the pathing, you can single pull all of the mobs easily.  If you happen to kill all 12 mobs before spawns, you can  head over and kill a lot more just on the other side of the steps. <br />
<br />
Dungeon xp bonus and a 4 minute run from pok make it nice and cozy solo area.  I just have a 10 shot IVU potion just incase i need some extra BW time.<br />
<br />
Just watch for the VP key mob.  He's a dark blue con with quite a few hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Decently equipped warriors can solo the front of Droga, but deeper Nurga is easier, and still dark blue to 65.

<br />
I kinda like the Neriak Priest of Discord.<br />
Never camped, no trains or adds, and he runs at 10-15%, spawns fast, Dark blue to 65, and he cant hit the broad side of a barn.<br />
(But when he does, oww)</div></div><hr />

Take a look at my inventory if you want to see some of the toys that I use to make this work well.  I don't even have my offensive AAs maxed, nor do I have my regen AAs maxed, nor do I have ANY bind wound AAs.  I just rely on regen (troll and all), runes, slow, snare, and lifetaps.<br />
<br />
2% AA per kill.<br />
<br />
It's no where near the exp you could get in a good group, but it's a hell of a lot better than sitting in PoTranq LFG for 6+ hours.</div></div><hr />
