<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I asked this question before and was told that after 10/10/03 Patch the anger procs had been made available to 2-handers.  I am not yet close enough to look for myself but I did look at a website from the Phantom Raiders Guild on Bertoxx Server and from the screen shot I saw it says anger 3 is still restricted to 1handed weapons.  So, can someone please tell me that this is wrong?  Someone that has augmented a 2hander already?  Perhaps the image on this website is incorrect?  Here is the link I was looking it up at.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kurim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anger 3 is definately *not* still restricted to 1h, i have one on my GSoT.  No screenshot to prove it tho :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats ok is not that I don't trust anyone hehe, I just wanted to make CERTAIN!  The screenshot taken on the website above just must be old or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Likely PR site just hasn't been updated in a bit, give Jimette a nice kick in the ass and she will get it takin care of I am sure.  She does alot of stuff with that site though and is generally busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meyni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, err it isn't restricted and that item on our website is wrong in another way.  The type 4 anger 3 is in everfrost, the one in Sro is type 8.  I augmented BoW with anger 3 augment from everfrost, if that makes better sense hehe =)</div></div><hr />
