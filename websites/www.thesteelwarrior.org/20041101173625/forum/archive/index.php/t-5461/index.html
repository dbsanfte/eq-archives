<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">** Please note: I have no idea if this is true, as I was not a part of the GoD beta... this is based on rumors and speculation. **<br />
<br />
I heard a rumor that GoD would be introducing mobs that were resistant to certain types of weapons (e.g. &quot;Takes full damage from piercers, but little to none from blunt or slashing&quot;).<br />
<br />
Obviously I'm not asking any beta-testers to confirm or deny this, but rather I'd like to get people's thoughts.  Will this be a big deal to any of you?  Do you already carry around a decent selection of weapons?  Will our lower-capped piercing skill become more of a big deal against these new mobs?<br />
<br />
For myself, I already carry both blunt and slashing weapons, but it looks like I'm going to have to find myself a decent piercer.<br />
<br />
Also, since this may become an issue: What form of damage are shields counted as?  I would naturally assume &quot;blunt&quot;, but I could see Verant coding them as &quot;Hand to Hand&quot; or even giving them a special category.  Depending on how shields are coded, I could see warriors perhaps giving them a try for specific mobs.<br />
<br />
Then again, with the work that Brodda and others did on this site (from The Library), it seems that aggro generation is independant of whether the weapon hits or misses, so maybe using piercers will have little effect other than to lower our dps a little.</div></div><hr />
