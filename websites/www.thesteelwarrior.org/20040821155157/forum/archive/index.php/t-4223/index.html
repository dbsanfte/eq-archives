<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted a link to the stand in on 3 Brell boards and have gotten a lot of grief over it.<br />
<br />
I also got it deleted off of the EQ Traders board in the primal scream room.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else getting this on their boards?<br />
<br />
Are Warriors hated that much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">someone else beat me to it on emar, we have about 70 peps at our stone now</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't give a fuck about the game, for the most part. JUST AS LONG AS THEY KNOW WHEN THOSE NEW RECIPES TRIVIAL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQTraders is not the place for it.  They won't consider class balancing nor agro as part of tradeskills unless they're able to make something that seriously affects it (like say, a worn effect of Voice of Thule or something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQtraders has a Primal scream board just for bitching about in game things and all subjects are ok.<br />
Just till you decide to do something about it then it is not.</div></div><hr />

I'm just hoping that it's the idiots posting as usual, and not the general community of players on MM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Folks on the Xev board have been very supportive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've gotten a lot of flack from my guild over this, even some of those warriors. I love them dearly, but only a few of them even come close to understanding the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Quellious appears to be in line, according to the thread on Quellious Collective. It was posted in the Flame Board section just in case, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hate to say this but my guild has not been very supportive either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">post was deleted on tribunal message board in general forums.<br />
<br />
i posted it again in the warrior forum, i expect it to get deleted as well though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gingles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think it may be a bit much to expect the nameless to show resounding early support. Not very many active nameless chars read their forums in the first place...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Goladus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">People are unsupportive for any number of reasons, the main ones I can think of:<br />
<br />
1.  People don't believe there is a problem, or don't believe the problem is really that huge.<br />
<br />
2.  People think that you don't really know what the problem is either, and are just jumping on the &quot;rebel against the evil empire&quot; bandwagon because it's fun and dramatic.<br />
<br />
3.  People think that this is a bad way to go about getting things done, even if there is a problem.<br />
<br />
4.  People have played classes that were at one point far worse off than warriors are now, and made it through without staging in-game protests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What the fuck do you expect when you tell people &quot;So sorry, but I'm gonna disrupt your gameplay this day. Please join me in being a pain in the ass for random people.<br />
<br />
 Christ I mean think for a fucking second. I'm all for civil unrest and damning the man, but don't go expect a hummer and a cookie for telling people you plan to be annoying. The idea is to piss people off, regardless of what uppity noble reason you give that is the desired result. Enough pissed of people and you hope they make enough noise that you get heard.<br />
<br />
 Not saying it's right or wrong or stupid or smart, just...don't expect real positive responses when you post it. And don't act surprised when people dislike your plan to fuck with them for nothing they've done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Yaulynk Dawnmis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">didn't look to bad on bert by the stone.  aside from the usual &quot;you are all ebayed newbs&quot; and the &quot;learn to play your class&quot; shouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ymmajin_Achione</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We had 10 or so people on Bertox when I logged last nite to include an Anon Guide. Three Guides did show up earlier to see the site but left.<br />
<br />
There were several hecklers and many supporters. One supporter even shouting &quot;I have learned a great deal from this and that is who the idiots are that you DONT want to group with&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think the best part were those who sent me tells. I gave them the skinny and told them to visit the page. Many of them returned a /tell saying they supported it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you get any shit, just link em to this site they will find all the info they need....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Babadski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I haven't got a lot of response from the couple of places I've posted it, but I have later seen some folks from there making new posts to this board under the Stand Down thread, so I guess a few of them saw it &lt;grin&gt;.<br />
<br />
I've only seen a couple of other participants on Test.  So far I haven't seen anyone being negative to us on Test, and I've had a couple of people cheer me as they've gone past.<br />
<br />
We'll see how it shakes out over the next couple of days.</div></div><hr />

I seen it was deleted as well and want it to be known that the moderator of that forum doesnt speak for us all. He is a jack a** who knows nothing.<br />

<br />
I also didnt move your post, an admin did :)<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.<br />
<br />
Thanks for telling me you posted it again though. Making more work for our admins = bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">it didnt get moved....did it?  <br />
<br />
And barraind I have no beef with you<br />
<br />
-edit-<br />
<br />
and I only posted this once...I dont know how you got the notion that I posted the link twice, somebody else posted it in the general forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I just know its been posted about 5 times now, and we are getting sick of keeping the clutter down.  I have no problem with it being in the warrior forum of the trib boards</div></div><hr />

The talk is generaly against. Alot of &quot;just a game&quot; and &quot;this is silly&quot; stuff. But some constructive also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Terveck DaTra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Barraind I cant remember the name of the person who deleted the post I was refering too. I'm sure it wasn't you cause I don't recognize your name. Whom ever it was I am refering to didnt delete the Thread they edited it and dropped the F bomb. Something along the lines of F off and whine somewhere else?!<br />
<br />
That is the peron I was refering to, if that was you then my opinion stands, if it wasn't, don't jump the gun and assume I'm refering to you.<br />
<br />
Heres the URL I was refering too from Darkoan's post<br />
<br />
http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2866.topic<br />
<br />
but it seems to be gone now. Hell it might not even be the same forum your on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have no problem with it being in the warrior forum of the trib boards <br />
<br />
You have problem with it being in other forums?<br />
<br />
Its not a flame so whats wrong with putting it in general discussion?<br />
<br />
This is not a topic that concerns only warriors imo and I'm sure most warriors are well aware of the problems with our class.  It is actually better that this issue gets more publicity witch it would in the general forums mr. Lord protector.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering what your agenda is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Goladus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm wondering what your agenda is.These kind of comments sound funny from people engaging in a civil protest, especially one that is not directly related to the problems you're actually facing.  Martin Luther King's civil protests involved doing things that were illegal but forced people to start asking why the hell they were illegal.  The actual Stand Down has nothing to do with warrior problems.  If there's anyone with a questionable agenda, it's the protestors.<br />
<br />
And I'm really not sure that linking them to this site will be as helpful as you might think.  The signal to noise ratio here is moderate at best.  First impressions will most certianly not be good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HUH?<br />
<br />
Please enlighten all of us.<br />
I sure would like to know what other agenda my subconsious has cooked up.<br />
<br />
(little voice inside my head says drat you found me out, now I must kill you and take over your body)</div></div><hr />

Uh, don't know if you maybe MISSED this or not but ...<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=4109<br />
<br />
This is where the ACTUAL stand down idea comes from.<br />
<br />
It originated on this board. It comes from this board. It is linked to this site, because it was started from, THIS SITE.<br />
<br />
The actual stand down has everything to do with warrior problems since it was the brain child of warriors, to address warrior problems.<br />
<br />
AND ... it is linked to this site ... (again, for clarity) BECAUSE IT ORIGINATED HERE.<br />
<br />
Sorry to use caps. Just wanted to make it as clear as I could.<br />
<br />
The protest comes from here.</div></div><hr />
