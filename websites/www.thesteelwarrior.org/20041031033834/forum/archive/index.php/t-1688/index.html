<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 36 WAR, two buddies that are 32 CLR and 34 BL.  We've been in Splitpaw for awhile now and are thinking of 3 optoins.  <br />
<br />
1.  Should we stay in Split paw push deeper into the lair.<br />
<br />
2.  Move to kaesora<br />
<br />
3.  Move to Sol B<br />
<br />
Unless someone has better advice, I believe we're going to push further into splitpaw.  My only concern is the rosch charming the WAR... Otherwise it should go pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ToFS is another option and quite fun/challenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I loved Echo caverns I PL'd myself with a Bot CLR there from 35 to 52, and the drops are a cpl pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd do Echo over deeper in Paw.  Deeper in Paw, there are mobs that charm.  Nothing like getting killed by one of your groupmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&lt;3 Sol B<br />
<br />
Can be a bitch without a snarer tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kremib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would think about The Overthere. Went from 30 to 40. Then move to Dreadlands. This should get you to 48 then off to the plains.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to Crystal Caverns.  Orcs are good exp up to low 40s and it have some really nice loot; gems, velium, and weapons.  After that go back a little bit deeper to the geonids or tentacles.  Only problem is you can't bind in here, but there is a bank and a town of dwarves to sell too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lower guk would be a good place to start at that level, if it weren't the nuclear bomb testing grounds for lvl 65/200AA AE groups working on faction ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Deeper inside Paw isn't worth the risk for the reward you get, too many caster mobs that as said, will charm your own groupmates to kill you. this happened to some of my lower level guildies, and wasn't fun.<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns doesn't get talked about enough I don't think, for mid 40's - 50 after leaving Crystal Caverns. Went 35-43ish in Crystal Caverns and saved enough velium and silks to keep me in Thurg gate potions for months after, then did 43-49 in Echo. They are both indoor zones, so you have to learn tactics a little better than the easy, boring outside zones like Overthere and Dreadlands. Don't know if there is an exp modifier for Echo, but exp there was always much better than the couple of times I went to DL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If there are only 3 of you you'll probably get your asses handed to you in kaesora at your level.  It is an extraordinarily fun dungeon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What zone is ToFS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kaesora is the best exp and by far superior to any of the options.. Only Sol A gnomes beat it<br />
<br />
TOFS exp is pretty weak, low ZEM, hard mobs...<br />
<br />
and forget Sol B or LGuk, their ZEMs are just slightly above the ones from outdoor zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ToFS = Tower of frozen shadow in iceclad, many caster mobs in there but rather fun place</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personally I enjoyed lvling in OT, much fun beating up Cocktrices :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grab yourself a wiz or druid buddy and hit up Kaesora!!  I love that place.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">at that level; hell, Permafrost can be fun too. drops are pretty much sh*t but some decent amount of coin drops.<br />
Also, you'll most likely have the whole place to yourself too except for the auld sk00l bearpit experience grinder(s).</div></div><hr />
