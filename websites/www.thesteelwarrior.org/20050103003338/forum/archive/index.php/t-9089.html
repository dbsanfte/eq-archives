I started picking up the other groundspawns also. Somehow I think there is a limit / relationship to the number of groundspawns that can be out there.. or it could just be the 'Pika pika' sounds I keep wanting to make gathering up the damn pokemon, I mean groundspawn...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  30 minute (roughly, some slight variation here) spawn<br />
2.  Only ONE of the pages/cover spawn at a time.  In my 12 hours, never once was there more than one up at a time.<br />
3.  It seems all spots spawn in sequence.  In the 12 hours, almost every spot spawned with no repeats.<br />
