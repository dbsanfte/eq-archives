Don't disagree with the mods is my only words of advice or hurt thier feelings or you will get banned.<br />

Mods are supposed to be beyond petty crap like this but I guess they are not :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is the thread where he got pissy and locked it cause he was not making me see his point of view it has since been unlocked. lol to think I thought mods were actually decent people and put thier pettuy differences aside. I still think it's funny as hell my own class board has banned me. all because I am openly trying to get pallys balanced to warriors and not warriors balanced to pallys. Oh well I went 3 years without going to PoN no big loss to me. I have been playing on rodcet since the week it went live (although my first char was a gey ranger I deleted at 50 after 133 days palyed cause rangers were so broke hehe)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah, that is kind of a lame way to end an argument. However I can relate if people were just bitching about moderation style; the boards are usually not the place to do it - they promote a mob/antagnositic mentality instead of a rational one.<br />
<br />
Some mods aren't beyond petty crap, but if you perceive abuse of power by a mod, you're just asking for it by calling them out en publico. I think you're smart enough to realize what you were getting into. =P<br />
<br />
Also, your link seems to be erroneous, but if it was yet Another Thread About Balancing Warriors, I think Gil is just tired of people rehashing the same arguments over and over, kinda like I am. The only way SoE will &quot;fix&quot; warriors is if we back some of the ideas (there are many good ones) already thrown out there. If everyone keeps &quot;pitching in their 2cp&quot; as it were, the devs will have much more to read through and may just ignore it all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And yeah I knew I was playing with fire but I deal with VP's on a regular basis at work and if that aint playin with fire i don't know what is. and let me tell you VP's may not like me and crap but i still have a job because why? because I do my shit and I may be a jackass but I only rise to the occasion at hand and they understand that, and they understand I am very pasionate about my work and my my views, here we have a mod that is being petty and instead of admitting he was wrong or trying to make me see his point just bans me so he does not need to argue his BS points with me.<br />
<br />
oh well like i has said before I went yers without using my class board so I realy don't need it but it's the principle that pisses me off. people abusing power makes me fuggin see red.<br />
<br />
I am one of the few people in my group that has told not one not 2 but 3 different vp's no when they came by and wanted something without going through the proper channels. later i had to give them the crap but only after my manager said to do it. I guess what i am trying to say people in power do not scare me. people in power abusing it and if i see the abuse I will call them on it no if's ands or butts!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If some of the crap being said in that thread is representative of PoN in general, I can't imagine you being bothered by being banned from their board.   I did like the fact that some of the pally's can see the problem, see that they do indeed have game breaking aggro, and see that maybe breaking the game more by giving warriors knight aggro isnt a good idea. And seeing Frod and Glatius pick apart some of the more pompous and delusional of them was highly entertaining.  Keep your chin up Apothes, you're welcome to drink with us any time.  And you are OK...for a paladin. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHA. Sooooo true. Had a paladin complain to me JUST yesterday that he didn't get healed during a fight. 2 of the clerics said that they were watching the tanks' health first. I nearly fell out of my chair laughing.</div></div><hr />
