<br />
Ive seen the Armsman in one place. You go up the stairs as you zone in, you keep going and get to the pit (but dont drop), turn left and keep going, you will get to a room with 2 entrances and an arena in the middle (kiting room). The Diaku Armsman has spawned for us outside those entraces (not inside the room, the room is safe).<br />
<br />
And the zonein is in the circle of stones to PoV/ HoH, etc. Its the first one starting from the right, with a telescope and a compass (or sorta looks like it) drawing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hinvat, Shadow Master, and Anvil can spawn all over the place.  Seen em on the way to TZ, VZ, and RZ, I beleive they spawn in the paths to those mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone clarify more where Overseer, Supplier, and Armorer spawn? Do the directions to them (lower hallways/rooms attached to arena) apply to the Armsman also?<br />
<br />
How would you group the named as far as difficulty goes?<br />
<br />
I forgot to put the levels of the mobs in parenthesis, I'll do that in a few hours when I have more time (on lunch break atm)<br />
<br />
Thanks Crystara and Edone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not sure about Armorer, maybe Im making a mistake here but I *think* it can spawn of any mob (not in pit tho). Again, Im not sure about this, if someone knows might want to correct me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Crystara said, I believe that Hinvat, Vinta and Anival can spawn in any spot that a yellow/red ogre spawns.  I've never seen any of them spawn in the same place twice.<br />
<br />
As for the armorer, I always thought he only spawned in the room behind the door on the right beyond the cafeteria... but then last time we were looking for him, he spawned in the kitchen instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sass, do you mean yellow/red con? to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does this map look right so far?<br />
http://www.dragonmaw.org/modules.php?mop=modload&amp;name=Upload&amp;file=index&amp;op=getit&amp;fid=39<br />
<br />
Is Vallon or Tallon at the top-right corner of the map?<br />
What is down that hall in the right-middle? &quot;RZ triggers&quot;?<br />
Is the brownish spot in the middle the Pit?<br />
What spawns in the darker-gray area at the bottom-left of the map, 2 1/4 squares up from the bottom?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your link sends to a restricted area.<br />
<br />
Hinvat can spawn pretty much anywhere in the path to RZ trigger.  If you go to the top of the pit (and don't jump down), then go west is the RZ corridor.<br />
Vinta can spawn in pretty much any spot on the south corridor near the zone in.<br />
Same for Anival, but north corridor.<br />
Since I can't see your map, I'll refer to the EQAtlas map.<br />
Armorer, Overseer, Glykus, Supplier all spawn in the Basement / Pit map.<br />
Glykus is at the very end of the south path, which is shown as grey instead of the same color as the rest.<br />
Out from the pit you have North Hall and South Hall.  Inbetween those two, on the west side and not the pit side, there is a tiny room, that connects to a larger room to the north.  The small room is where Overseer spawns.<br />
The room north of the pit, where you have to go out through north hall, go north, then turn right is the dining room.  In there both Supplier and Armorer can spawn in one spot just north of the doorway at a table.<br />
Looking at the map, there is a place with lava.  South of that there is a four way intersection.  The room west of that has the other Supplier spawn.  If you go east, then turn north immediately when you can, is where the other Armorer spawn is.<br />
Tagrin spawns in the room north of the lava.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A War Boar and Daiku Armsman are not named mobs. They may drop some decent bazaar loot but they are not &quot;named&quot; in the traditional sense.<br />
<br />
Also, The Daiku Overseer AE Rampages and quads. Can hit for 1100 if not defensive, per hit.</div></div><hr />

no eqmaps.com maps on yet (and what exactly do they want money for again?) so I have to make myself.</div></div><hr />
