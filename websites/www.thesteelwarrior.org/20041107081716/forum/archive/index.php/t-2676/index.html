<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hapheastus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why must yall criticize and hate when someone just asks a simple question? Slammer has posted a few times asking for strats and help on mobs. I dont see why its so hard to just help him out instead of hate on him.  Yall are judging him on how bad a tank he must be and blah blah blah, when none of you have seen him play. I know Slammer in game and he is prob the nicest and one of the smartest people i know in game.  If all yall think he is a retarded newb then why would the leader of his guild (EP guild) say i wish i had 10 Slammer's. He has helped me out a lot in EQ and always is there to help me with something and offers his advice with whatever i ask him. So next time he posts why dont yall just answer his question or give him advice rather than hate and criticize his playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well said, and I always offer advice to those that ask for it. He has blasted on a few folks in some of his posts though. Actually, he started by playing with Furor if memory serves...<br />

edit:<br />
Furor u can BITE my right NUT and make my left one jealous i have played EQ for almost 2 dame years and have probably forgot more than u know..  <br />

<br />
Yeah, and while we're at it, why don't we just tell him how to easily do everything that remains challenging in this game.  Hell, why don't we all just post all of the strategies our guild ever uses, so that everyone else on our server (and in the game) can learn and use it in order to compete with us.<br />
<br />
strats and help on mobs works when you're asking about kunark mobs or velius mobs.  But gimme a freakin break, if you don't know the twists on mobs in elemental planes, and how to deal with em, it's time to do what we all did and grow the hell up and learn it on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gren, you are right there and we have done that its worked out much better for our guild to..As for Hap, He is just some warrior one day i started chatting with and we have become OK friends when he has trouble LFG, &quot;keep in mind he is like 51&quot; and i am not raiding we go down do OLE KC, Ill 2box my cleric pulling 3 -4 dogs at a time and grind grind grind, I do that for alot of warriors that i see LFG, hrs and hrs at a time..It kills me to see that shit ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair question, my own humble opinion on EQ posting:<br />
<br />
1) If you mis-type it/mis-pronounce/don't do your homework the flames will come (aka think before you write, re-read what you write before hitting post, a rule of thumb &quot;When I re-read this did it say &quot;exactly&quot; what I meant it to say?&quot;).<br />
<br />
2) Generally if you wish to get a succinct and polite response to a question the question must be presented politely and succinctly.<br />
<br />
3) If you get flamed probably the best move (if wish to avoid the flame to continue) is not to type one of your own. &quot;Suck my balls&quot; well...thats kinda not helpin yer case.<br />
<br />
4) As is true in life and business, you may be a darn smart guy with loads of charm and personality but if your presentation is not good with the communication mode you are using then all people see is that side of you.  *hint* this is a WRITTEN forum...its not personal to Slammer but man he did not present well in that thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slammer is one of the funniest posters on this board.<br />
<br />
(I don't think he is trying to be funny, but I laugh more reading his posts than most.)<br />
<br />
If Slammer wants to be taken seriously, he should type more carefully, not make sweeping generalizations when he means something more specific (see Fennin Ro thread when he talks about having ALL elemental armor in 1 month and then recinding his position and clarifying what he meant).<br />
<br />
I have no personal problems with Slammer -- he is probably a decent guy.  However, when I read his posts I picture a Junior High kid who doesn't have the patience to construct his thoughts and is writing more based on emotion than logic.  (See post on how Slammer &gt; Furor quoted earlier in this thread.)<br />
<br />
I used to teach Junior High and High School about ten years ago and have met several fourteen-year-olds who were very bright, mature, and capable.  We have some younger people in my guild that I have more respect for than some of our older members.  So please don't think I am being ageist by any stretch of the imagination with my Junior High comment.<br />
<br />
So, Hap -- I don't &quot;hate&quot; Slammer.  I have &quot;criticized&quot; Slammer when he says things that are inaccurate, inarticulate, or exagerrated.  I don't think I need to apologize for doing so.</div></div><hr />
