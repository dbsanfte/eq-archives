<br />
All night long there was never more that 4 or 5 people LFG on the whole server, and when I went to camp in PoK there was 18 people in the zone.<br />
<br />
Made me wonder if Sony is gonna merge servers soon?  It almost seems like a option because it's not getting easier to put groups together like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  My group of friends and I have had enough, we havent been on at all in a month, and dont plan to either.  The mpg trials were our current form of enjoyment but all the changes and the lockouts just added up to too much of a pain and no fun, so we quit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You had 3 time+ guilds, all with 70ish members.<br />
Of those three only 30 are left. Thats 30 out of 210.<br />
<br />
At the situation is the same for the entire server.<br />
If you are lucky there might be one group in WoS.<br />
<br />
The servers population has dropped by about 70 80%.<br />
And no its not bullshit.<br />
<br />
Do / all cleric 70 during prime time, you are down to 5-8 people.<br />
In early september you had a full list at 5pm.<br />
<br />
Want to get a small previous of Sebilis ?<br />
Log on your server at 4-5 am. And divide the population online by 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a quick check on Drinal.  Logged on a character who never done LDoN, he's 6700th place.  Back in golden age of EQ, that number is around 10-12K.  So, it's at worst 50% decline.<br />
<br />
A character shows up on the LDoN ranking list if they have at least one LDoN done (win or loss) and they've logged on in the last 30 days.  It is easily the best snapshot of a server short of having a script to do a zillion /who (and even then you would miss the anon guys).  <br />
<br />
And that really doesn't take into the account of the fact that no one does LDoN anymore when OoW come out so any newly created character after OoW will pretty much never be on the LDoN ranking list.  Therefore even if the population of EQ never changed, you'd expect less people on the LDoN ranking list now as opposed to back when LDoN first came out.  Drinal has always been on the lower end population, so I don't see any reason why we would get hit harder or not as hard compare to any other server, so I feel it is reasonable to use this to extrapolate to rest of the servers.  I'd estimate 20-30% population decline, which is reasonable.  Clearly all the people playing EQ2 and WoW had to come from somewhere.  Of course, your guild/server might get hit harder, but that's just how average works out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's no different than how out of the 88 WoW servers some servers apparently have 20K people and some have 800, and while you can say maybe people did try meet in certain servers to explain the 20K, how do you explain 800?  Everyone just decided this server name sucks so let's all avoid it like the plague?  It'd appear your server just happens to be like the WoW server with 800 people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that, I think that most of the idiots are gone, which makes me happy.  I could care less if people who sucked in the first place don't play EQ anymore.  EQ is -the- gamers game, and I really doubt there will be a game that will replace it for quite a while.  I've played WoW, and seen EQ2, and they offer nothing like that.</div></div><hr />

I know Test is.   The &quot;regular&quot; servers are fine though, except for the fact that there might have to be a little guild consolidation.  That sucks, but once the guilds normalize I think the lower population will be nice.</div></div><hr />

Wow, for some reason I thought FV was sort of the same as test for population levels :)   We have never had that many on Test in the 2 years or so I have played there so yeah I guess you're doin fine.</div></div><hr />

Fixed it for you.<br />
<br />
EQ has minimal new population coming in due to the effect of a) graphics, especially player models, in dire need of an overhaul (which was scheduled for end of last year, then forgotten about) and b) Why would Joe Public buy a box with 'Everquest' on the cover when there's a shinier box right next door with 'Everquest 2' written on it? <br />
<br />
Small and slow increase in new population - biggest drop in existing playerbase  ever, still ongoing (at a slower rate)  = ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xegony doesn't seem too bad right now, though compared to even 4 months ago there are a lot less ppl on /lfg list.<br />
<br />
What I don't get is SoE releasing an expansion that has stuff we really ought to get for free / patched in.  Guild housing was a free download with DAoC, heck, so was NF which totally changed the game.  Some ppl I hear are saying that folks won't buy this new EQ expansion because they are into WoW/EQ2.   For ppl like me, however, I am seriously against paying MORE money for content we ought to get for free.<br />
<br />
EQ1 is rarely patched with free goodies.  Compared to games like WoW which patched in free holiday quests, this is starting to look unacceptable.  You may argue that WoW is just starting out and needs to look good, but to be honest, EQ is starting to need to look good as well.<br />
<br />
EQ has a poor track record.  Releasing GoD without OoW was a huge mistake and engendered a feeling of ill will.  I know a fair few lower level / casual players that got frustrated and quit EQ over GoD because it had very very little to offer them.<br />
<br />
I dislike the fact that so many expansions are &quot;needed&quot; in order to put out new content.  Buying GoD and OoW seperately feels like having to buy 2 halves of a cell phone and then being stuck with a bill twice as high as buying a normal cell phone.<br />
<br />
I am an EQ diehard.  I have friends there (although the majority have migrated off) and still working through guild progression.  I am pretty jaded and only have two questions left that I really would honestly like the devs to answer.<br />
<br />
1. What are they doing about cheats/hacks like MacroQuest that unsavory guilds/people use to exploit the game?  <br />
<br />
2. Do people even LOOK at /feedback?  Or is it one of those &quot;elevator buttons&quot; you click to make yourself feel better that doesnt actually do a thing?<br />
<br />
Look: I am not flaming and don't see any flames above mine, so you devs reading this thread please feel free to address my above questions via post or PM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2. Do people even LOOK at /feedback?  Or is it one of those &quot;elevator buttons&quot; you click to make yourself feel better that doesnt actually do a thing?<br />
<br />
Yes.  Definately absolutely yes.  <br />
<br />
I had pretty  much the same thought a couple years ago but then participated in LDoN beta where I met a dev and found out how important player feedback is to them.  Since then, I've moved to test full time and interact with devs a lot more then people on normal servers have a chance to and it only reinforces the fact that they DO use player feedback.<br />
<br />
I still don't have a lot of faith in the corporate people who get to make the decisions about when to release new expansions etc.  But the devs who create and actually work on our game definately care about it and want to make the best game possible and really do care what the players think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we took a big hit right after the new games came out. Pretty sure without consolidation we will never see those numbers again. Atm more people are coming back than leaving. At least thats true in my guild. Of course EQ is on the downhill side. Still the game has a lot of time left.<br />
<br />
 WOW and EQ2 failed many people despite their desire to see new stuff and do new things. Depsite the fact that SOE has irked them so much in EQ hehe. Quite a few of our members that left are still playing casually in whichever of the new games they prefer but raiding and playin in EQ as well. Many seem to have dropped the new games altogether.<br />
<br />
Better games for many people on the horizon I imagine. Some of those may have greater impact...</div></div><hr />
