    Quote: But what I do notice is the fact that There have been no low level pure melee discs to help them out? I've been testing LDoN beta since first day and these are not there just content which is fine. But How come noone thinks to help the lower level melee as well?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:-Well, I'm not going to claim to be an expert here, but I don't think low level melees need any changes.<br />
<br />
    Quote: Also, I'm with Nathan on this. What is going on with Pure Melee, and the promised revamp due at the end of this month? I can understand pushing the new product, but I don't quite follow the runaround and dodging of the valid concerns of the pure melee classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:-We've never said anything about it being done by the end of any month. We listed it in our future plans just to let you all know that we are planning to look at it. I'm not avoiding anything, I'm just telling you that I don't have any answers for you at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Quote: Why are comparable melee and hybrid armor so similar in ac and hps and yet the hybrids get focus effects and mana to further increase their function?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:- Way off topic, but easy to answer.<br />
<br />
A hybrid and a warrior with exactly the same AC value will not get the same use out of that AC. Warriors use their armor better.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Quote: How do you plan to address melee balance issues in LDoN when all of the spells are going to be bought from vendors (at least that's what I interpreted from your mage forum post). Casters will have 2 upgrade routes (gear and spells) and one upgrade they will be able to get immediately without grouping or raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:- Expansions are not about class balance. Issues of that nature should not be addressed with an expansion, but outside the expansions. And you misunderstood, they will be able to purchase spells at the same place and in the same way that everyone else purchases items from the Wayfarers, using their adventure points.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Quote: In regards to this though, how worthwhile do you think raiding LDoN content will be to a PoTime capable/cleared guild?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:- If by &quot;value&quot; you mean will they be challenged and have fun? I'm sure they will. If by &quot;value&quot; you mean loot, they'll find that too. But let's not forget that the primary content for this expansion is geared for single group play, and even players in uber guilds can have fun playing with a few friends (fun, by the way, is the &quot;value&quot; that I look for in a game).<br />
<br />
    Quote: Do you plan on visiting the monk boards? And yes, what do you plan for pure melee? Please?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:-If by that you mean a Monkly Business, I'm afraid not, for the same reasons I've already given. But nobody is checking your class on at the door as you come in…<br />
<br />
    Quote:On LDoN which you wish, obviously, and not unreasonably, to focus on, what do you think warriors and monks bring to a group that will make a group glad they included them? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:- Every class has something to offer a group. That won't change for LDoN.<br />
<br />
    Quote:Do you see LDoN bringing 6+months of challenge to the hardcore gamer who's guild has cleared Plane of Time?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:- Well, that's hard to say. If they only want the content for the Hard 65th level raids, then no, that won't take them six months to devour. But if they want to do single group stuff they should have plenty to do.<br />
<br />
    Quote:An easy one... What is the most FUN thing for you about LDoN?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:- For me it's the single group dungeon crawl thing. I like seeing how far my group can go and trying to meet a challenge. Today we rescued a dark elf (something that a few of our group weren't happy about… inkies aren't that well liked) and had some fun teaching the orcs a lesson. I can't talk to 50 or 60 people at a time, so I've always liked smaller group stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Quote: Did someone assasinate him before he had the chance to answer Nathan's question?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor:- Just about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He kind of dodged that one question, since saying &quot;A hybrid and a warrior with exactly the same AC/HP value will not get the same use out of that AC/HP- errrr&quot; would make no sense.<br />
<br />
Ohh well, I wasn't expecting much else from them. The only thing more painful than losing hope is having it in the first place. I'll no doubt get a kick out of LDoN, but as for this, &quot;We're planning to take a look at pure melee's in the future&quot;... I'll probably have a better shot at being struck by lightning.<br />
<br />
And this quote pretty much sums it all up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't argue with that. I certainly understand the frustration. We put those things up there to let you know what we want to work on, but there are always a lot of other things to work on, and priorities are what they are. It's far easier to identify simple issues with mana to damage ratios for spells and things like that than it is to review an entire set of classes. And, while this won't make anyone happy, keep in mind that we are not saying that we'll make dramatic changes here. Classes are not that out of balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll agree to a certain extent that things aren't out of balance to the extremes, but... they are to a point and it's being ignored because it's &quot;far easier&quot; to work on spells and &quot;things like that&quot;. ... Nice.</div></div><hr />

It'd be hard for me to imagine why 100 HP is better on us than any other class.  I'd guess this is supposed to mean that we have high AC cap or something.  Whether that's true, I have no idea.  <br />
<br />
Still doesn't change the fact that even if we do make better use out of the AC, a Hybrid certainly makes a lot more use out of the mana/focus on items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering the message board is no longer running the ad that offended Absor's sensibilities so much, his reason is pretty invalid these days.<br />
<br />
Unless of course his reasons were that he just doesn't know much about the monk issues and has no answers for any questions the monk community would have regarding their class.<br />
<br />
Which seems to be the reason he has for staying away from Steel Warrior too.<br />
<br />

I suspect we won't get much out of Absor because he doesn't have much to offer.   It's really not in his hands.  He's ultimately just a mouth piece.</div></div><hr />

 That may be true, but the website the board is associated with still runs ads for a website in direct violation of the EULA.  It would be poor business practice for any SOE employee to associate themselves with MB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is where itemization failed Warriors.  Clerics clearly are going to drool over a 150 HP/150 Mana shared plate bracer.  Where are the 150 HP/-150 Mana shared items?  Heck they don't even need to mess with the stats. Stick an negative percent alteration mod on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can make more sense of it.  Warriors have a higher mitigation table.  A warrior with 1800 AC will take less damage on average per hit than a knight with 1800 AC.  It may not be a huge, noticable to the eye difference, but warriors do mitigate more per point of AC than all other classes including knights.<br />
<br />
Another thing that people often forget is that Hybrids are supposed to be balanced by their abilities, not their gear.<br />
<br />
Im not saying these numbers are correct, but for illustration<br />
<br />
Warrior = 100% melee<br />
Knight = 75% melee + 25% caster = 100% total power<br />
<br />
You give each a 100% increase to melee skills from some item upgrade.<br />
<br />
New Warrior = 100% * (100% +100%) = 200%<br />
Knight = 75% melee * (100% + 100%) + 25% caster = 175%<br />
<br />
Due to lack of caster% on that item, the knight has lost power relatively to the warrior.  A knight needs a 100% increase to both his melee and caster powers to stay relative to the melee.<br />
<br />
Now, I know the first argument I will get is that knights are actually 85% melee, and 50% caster.  So they are at 135% of the power of a warrior right off the bat.<br />
<br />
I dont disagree with that at all, but if you balance that with gear, then you will have to continue to both balance classes and gear in the future.  Much better to make gear equal across the board and balance the class itself.<br />
<br />
You have to give equal % increases to both the caster and melee parts of a hybrid, if you want the item to be equivalent increase in power to a pure melee item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Hanadan :)<br />
<br />
I see the point about class neutral percentage increases, but I think it leaves something out.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to make this point on PoN, with limited success so far, but class neutral percentage increases are not neutral in effect, because of declining marginal benefits.<br />
<br />
The key point is that the warriors and knights are not compared against each other in a vacuum: mobs are involved. Since the point at which people get exp from mobs is fixed, there MUST be a point of diminishing returns for extra mitigation. That means the class with a lower initial base gets more out of a class neutral percentage increase, since they have further to travel down the declining marginal benefit curve.<br />
<br />
We can argue about the magnitude of the effect of declining marginal benefit, but there's simply no question it exists, since the point at which people get exp from mobs is fixed.<br />
<br />
For example, here's a thought experiment. Is the difference between a 100,000 hp tank and a 50,000 hp tank particularly relevant, if the environment is unchanged? Is it as significant as the difference between a 10,000 hp tank and a 5,000 hp tank? Not really, even though that's 50,000 hps potentially we're talking about. The reason is diminishing returns, or declining marginal benefit.<br />
<br />
This is why hybrids are not losing out when they get the same percentage increase to both sides at the same time (despite whatever Thott says). That's true, even though the absolute amount of the attribute earned is smaller. In fact, over time they gain ground with those changes, since mobs are fixed. The only time the declining marginal benefit curve changes shape is when mobs are upgraded, typically at a new expansion. (Actually, it probably doesn't change shape, but people would be repositioned on the curve.)<br />
<br />
That's why LDoN scares me. If what I'm saying is true and has an actual effect, specialist classes in general, and pure melees in particular, are in trouble. Not only will the normal progression of mudflation mean generalists benefit relatively more (given their greater average distance from the point of diminishing returns in each of their skill areas), but here's a new expansion with no particular promise of greater mob power. For example, when people first zoned into a PoP zone like PoV, the damage output by the mobs was a little shocking, and the smidge extra mitigation offered by warriors had value. Similiarly with raid targets. Now PoV exp mobs are trivial, and rangers, bards or shaman tank them just fine. Mudflation pushes people down the marginal benefit curve, and benefits generalists (hybrids) disproportionately.<br />
<br />
There's simply no question the declining marginal benefit problem is real; the only issue is how strong is the effect.<br />
<br />
Note: here's where raids vs. exp is a real problem. It's easy to argue about declining marginal benefits on exp mobs; on raid targets with that curve so far out it's a lot harder. That's why warriors have to be balanced by additional utility or aggro in exp groups, not by extra mitigation that could spill over to raids, where the marginal benefit curve might still be in a challenging place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solinar, I think a better example would be this.<br />
<br />
Items of value to a Warrior:<br />
<br />
HP<br />
AC<br />
Sta<br />
Innate effects<br />
Other stuff (resists, dex, and so forth, of some value but not of huge value)<br />
<br />
Items of value to a Knight:<br />
<br />
HP<br />
AC<br />
Sta<br />
Mana<br />
Wisdom/Intelligence<br />
Innate effects<br />
Focus effects<br />
Other stuff<br />
<br />
Now, the Knight has 8 catagories he can grow in while the Warrior has 5.  If a Knight and a Warrior are completely balanced (just for the sake of discussion) when the Warrior is at 6k buffed HP and 1300 AC when the Knight is at 5k buffed HP, 1250 AC, and a mana pool of 2k, how does this change when the Warrior goes up to 7k buffed HP and 1400 AC while the Knight goes up to 6k buffed HP, 1350 AC and 3.5k mana?  Doesn't it seem pretty obvious that the combination of an increase of 1k HP and 100 AC is not as great as an increase of 1k HP, 100 AC, and 1.5k mana?<br />
<br />
You do not need to give an equal % increase to both the caster and melee parts of a hybrid to have an equivalent increase in power to a pure melee item.  Warriors compete against Knights solely in the pure melee aspects.  Mana is supposed to be there in order for the Knights to offset the differences between them and a Warrior.  But if all their Warrior like stats and abilities all go up in proportion to the incease in actual Warrior stats and abilities, PLUS you give them considerably more mana, they now have the opportunity to offset the differences between themselves and Warriors PLUS do more.<br />
<br />
And if you're allowing them to gain benefits in 8 catagories while allowing Warriors to only make gains in 5 catagories, and the gear less and less requires them to make trade offs to gain an increase in one catagory over the increase in another, then ultimately it's guaranteed they'll have more relative gains than the Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even tho he is the public mouthpiece for the company/developers, I still don't consider him to speak for everyone there.  There may in fact be developers that want to give melees a boost, but there's a catch.<br />
<br />
Casters spells can be balanced by two things.  Reuse(recast) times and mana cost.<br />
<br />
Melee abilities can only be balanced by one thing.  Reuse time.<br />
<br />
Considering the setup here, I have to agree with Absor on one thing.  It IS far far far more easier and simple to adjust mana costs and damage ratios and spell levels on a single entry for a spell than it is to implement a single new skill set for melee where they must go into the underlying code to add it.<br />
<br />
However, should that condemn these classes to miss out on upgrades?  Should that condemn these classes to be weaker and less useful than the casters?<br />
<br />
I can't even remember the last time a group of mine actually looked for a melee, much less invited one other than a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it is overpowered for the knight to gain the same AC and HP as a warrior, while also gaining mana.  That is why All All items in vex thal were deemed bad ideas, and the trend back to class specific armor was made for pop.<br />
<br />
That is why the warrior BP is 100 AC and 250 HP, while the paladin is 87AC and 210 HP (and 175 mana).<br />
<br />
Knight armor should be  less than warrior armor by the percentage of melee that knights are considered to be, and as shown above that is the cast, at least for visible armor.<br />
<br />
And if you're allowing them to gain benefits in 8 catagories while allowing Warriors to only make gains in 5 catagories, and the gear less and less requires them to make trade offs to gain an increase in one catagory over the increase in another, then ultimately it's guaranteed they'll have more relative gains than the Warrior.<br />
<br />
Thats simply not true.  Sorry I disagree.  Hybrids are balanced in the effectiveness of their abilities, not by their mana pool or gear.  A paladin cannot cast CH, etheral remedy, supernal remedy, group CH, Divine intervention, or many other spells that land clerics in guilds.  I dont want 5 paladins in a group trying to keep me alive in time against a god, even if they had 100,000 mana and FT 72.<br />
<br />
Likewise a paladin with equal AC, HP, and weapon ratio to a warrior, will 1) not tank as well, and 2) not do as much DPS.<br />
<br />
The knight classes are balanced via spell selection, innate mitigation tables, skill levels, and other devices.  Why do you think you have never seen a +2hs or +offense skill mods on knight usable weapons.  Thats how their DPS is balanced.<br />
<br />
Tugs point is very valid, and that is that mudflation brings higher value to multi class characters.  If mobs do so little DPS that the regen of a wizard can overcome it, then obviously the best group will become 6 wizards due to their highest DPS potential.<br />
<br />
I dont however see how tugs point has anything to do with what I was posting about :p<br />
<br />
I totally agree that % increases in hp, AC, DPS, etc are good things, because it keeps the balance between classes.  Straight HP/AC increases (such as buffs) are bad for class balance.<br />
<br />
Items which show these ratios like the comparison of the two BPs above, show good balance.  Knights having to choose between their 75% melee, and 25% caster parts end up up losing their relational power to other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That works well on class specific armors, but there are alot out there that are War/Pal/SHD usuable that are desirable for all 3 classes, but generally include mana and wis/int on them. The abundance of such items are what have made the gap between the tanking classes become quite narrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It actually does apply, in the following way.<br />
<br />
1. (a/b) != ((a+100)/(b+100)), where A and B are not the same. We can all agree on that I hope. This is why multi-class, multi-attribute items are a problem.<br />
<br />
2. (A*1.1) != ((.75A*1.1)+(.25B*1.1)), where A and B are the same IFF (if and only if) values above 1 for either A or B show diminishing returns. (Yes, I know this is kind of a stupid expression, but I'm just trying to illustrate how tanking and casting sides might be rendered.)<br />
<br />
That is, <br />
<br />
1. We all agree all/all itemization screws warriors.<br />
<br />
2. My further point was that, given the fixed position of the mob exp level to players, class neutral percentage increases ALSO screw warriors, even though they look the same. They just do it more slowly. Hybrids should get progessively smaller percentage increases over time, for proportionate balance, assuming no changes in environment. Otherwise, specialist classes hit the point of diminishing returns much earlier; that is, the more rapidly diminishing returns of the specialist should be balanced by the progressively smaller percentage earned by the generalist. That doesn't happen when everyone is getting the same percentage increase at the same time, including both parts of the multi-class chars. This is how shared AA hurts specialist classes.<br />
<br />
Mudflation and the fixed exp point are why balanced percentage gains by generalists kill specialist classes over time (in addition to flat-out bad itemization).<br />
<br />
Edit: here's an effort to illustrate what I'm saying, since I don't think I'm writing it well.<br />
<br />
all/all sucks and clearly disproportionately benefits classes that can use multiple attributes more than those that can't. so I'll leave those alone.<br />
<br />
But say a warrior is 100% melee, while a paladin is 75% melee adn 25% casting. You'd think that by adding 10% to all attributes it all works out, right? After all, <br />
<br />
100 x 1.1 = 110<br />
(75 x 1.1) + (25 x 1.1) = 110<br />
<br />
It's a wash, right? But now let's say the point of diminishing returns FOR ANY SINGLE SKILL (tanking or casting) was 101. Now the warrior just got most of his increase past a point of diminishing returns (and so did a specialist caster). And the further he gets past that point, the less value each additional percent has. Meanwhile, the hybrid got clear improvements well short of the diminishing return point on both sides. So even though the percentages and the cumulative amounts are the same, the effect isn't. His total growth path is much larger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
war at 100% going to 110% will realy not see much improvement since 100% is considered the max.<br />
<br />
pal/sk at 90% of the war going to 100% will see the 10% inprovemet fully<br />
<br />
even though their is still a 10% difference, but since the war gets no real benifit for being 110% it seams their equal.<br />
<br />
since you cant be over 100% everything has to be shifted back putting the war at 100% pal/sk at 90% setting the ones not near the orignal 100% back 10%<br />
<br />
the problem i see is the pal/sk that is at 100% of their luclin grouping with a 100% velious war. basicly they then become the same. if you apply say a 10% setback per expansion. mix and match stuff from expansion and well it just gets muddled.<br />

100% is only considered the max as that's how it is at this time. Moving from 110% is only a number relative to that 100% of present day. That 100% will change to include the Vie modifier, when it comes out. <br />
<br />
The new 100% would be a warrior with vie<br />
90% is warrior without vie/hybrid with vie<br />
80% is paladin without vie<br />
<br />
That 100% is only used as the maximum possible mitigation.</div></div><hr />

However when you add that 150 mana onto it the pali gaines quite a bit. Mana is power to a plai. I dont think the power gain of having a increseingly larger and larger mana pool is being taken into account enough. They gain with every peice while warriors fall more and more behind if both recieve the same peice of armor. Warrior will keep falling further behind if something is not done soon</div></div><hr />

<br />
A hybrid and a warrior with exactly the same AC value will not get the same use out of that AC. Warriors use their armor better.<br />
<br />
so we get a little more use of ac while they get 60 mana to be able to stun once more? very fair</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, given SoE's spotty record in even understanding their own game, can we take Absor's statement as being correct on its face?  There have been any number of things that SoE has claimed worked in X fashion that have in fact upon closer examination actually worked in Y fashion.  So while Absor probably believes his statement to be true, that doesn't necessarily make it true.<br />
<br />
Secondly the value of using our armor better is pretty ambiguous wouldn't you agree?  Exactly how much better do we use it?  For example, if a Warrior is getting hit regularly for 200 damage while a similar Paladin would be getting hit by the same mob for 205 damage, we are obviously using our armor better, but would most people call that meaningful?  Particularly when weighed against all the things a Warrior can't do that a Paladin can?<br />
<br />
And finally I'd like to understand on what exactly SoE bases their conclusion that pure melee aren't severely out of balance.  It would be interesting to see what they consider severely out of balance, since the fact that Warriors haven't progressed in specific class ways much beyond Kunark is pretty obvious.  How much value do they think /shield really gives us?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is why the warrior BP is 100 AC and 250 HP, while the paladin is 87AC and 210 HP (and 175 mana).<br />

Knight armor should be  less than warrior armor by the percentage of melee that knights are considered to be, and as shown above that is the cast, at least for visible armor.<br />

Thats simply not true.  Sorry I disagree.  Hybrids are balanced in the effectiveness of their abilities, not by their mana pool or gear.  A paladin cannot cast CH, etheral remedy, supernal remedy, group CH, Divine intervention, or many other spells that land clerics in guilds.  I dont want 5 paladins in a group trying to keep me alive in time against a god, even if they had 100,000 mana and FT 72.<br />
<br />
Likewise a paladin with equal AC, HP, and weapon ratio to a warrior, will 1) not tank as well, and 2) not do as much DPS.<br />
<br />
The knight classes are balanced via spell selection, innate mitigation tables, skill levels, and other devices.  Why do you think you have never seen a +2hs or +offense skill mods on knight usable weapons.  Thats how their DPS is balanced.<br />
<br />
Tugs point is very valid, and that is that mudflation brings higher value to multi class characters.  If mobs do so little DPS that the regen of a wizard can overcome it, then obviously the best group will become 6 wizards due to their highest DPS potential.<br />
<br />
I dont however see how tugs point has anything to do with what I was posting about :p<br />
<br />
I totally agree that % increases in hp, AC, DPS, etc are good things, because it keeps the balance between classes.  Straight HP/AC increases (such as buffs) are bad for class balance.<br />
<br />
Items which show these ratios like the comparison of the two BPs above, show good balance.  Knights having to choose between their 75% melee, and 25% caster parts end up up losing their relational power to other classes.  <br />
<br />
How sad, you're a Sony puppet now. Pathetic. Did they offer you l33t beta infoz inside the internal workings of things they don't even understand? I want to vomit just reading the above Sony propoganda.<br />

Let's just disregard that every single slot on your body can be replaced by a slot that you share with both PAL and SHD (and BRD CLR) in the Plane of Time. Every single item aside from the Raex BP is not just equivalent to the best item the WAR can attain but also adds UNPRECEDENTED amounts of Mana, Foci, modifications, resists, hps, ac, and myriad other crap, some totally useless to the warrior. <br />

I may as well be on the beta server talking to one of the army of people who need to be slammed in head with a clue-by-four. If this were a soloer's game, the above line of bullshit may almost be true. Note I said MAY because it would only work out if you applied it to Paladins that weren't fighting versus Undead. Even then, both classes, the PAL and SHD would dominate Solo versus the Warrior class. <br />
<br />
Putting a PAL and SHD in any group, raid or experience boosts that groups survivability and damage output. Doing the same with a warrior does nothing except take up a valuable group spot. This is why you see intelligent raid leaders make groups soley comprised of warriors, an arbitrator(s), and a bard. This is also why you see intelligent raid leaders use PAL and SHD in DPS groups to add resists/attack/HPS/etc... etc... Thus, the effectiveness of their gear is not only of monumental importance for their own survival, it increases the effectiveness of their group and thusly the raid. Do you contend any of this? Because of this inherent disparity in stackability between the Warrior and Knight class and its leak via inflation into the mainstream, the Warrior is completely marginalized as a Tank. Their role is completely diminished into 3 minute clusters +/- by luck/competence of their groupmates/guildmates on raids and totally unnecessary on an exerperience level. <br />
<br />
You do understand that despite the party byline given that warriors use their AC better than a Knight, this point is completely irrelevant to 99.9999% of the game. Due to the massive imbalances in itemization and class abilities of OTHER classes (Not the Knight/War), keeping a Knight in an experience group situation is ALWAYS a better decision than keeping a Warrior in the same situation. The 20 additional DPS that a warrior brings over a PALADIN in NON-UNDEAD areas versus JUST the massive utility of aggro lock that both Knight classes have cancels out the Warrior. There isn't even a point to bring up what an intelligent, or even just a monkey of a Knight can bring to an experience group via non-aggro utility spells.<br />
<br />
And lastly, it's just precious that you intentionally leave out the Shadowknight in your little line of bullshit. I parse regularly, I play regularly, I have some extremely well equipped SHD in my guild. If I'm grinding with them, they routinely demolish my DPS advantage, with or without tanking. Why did I say extremely well equipped? Just to further prove that the amount of gear and larger the mana pool of a Knight, the more apparent their advantages over a warrior become.<br />
<br />
Their DPS isn't balanced because this isn't a Solo game. Furthermore if it were a SOLO game, their DPS still wouldn't be balanced. <br />
<br />
Solinar when you post, make sure to post a disclaimer. Something along the lines of, 'I am a Sony puppet so take everything I say with a BARREL of Salt.' This is what is so wrong with empowering players. They become parrots of the uninformed, putting aside any integrity they may have had to preserve their own feeling of self importance by not pissing off the 'man' and having their privileges revoked. See Thott, See Moorgard. Pathetic. You're a poisoner of the mind. The minds of these people who choose to read and believe the trash you filter through... This is also why I chose to stop playing in Beta, I wouldn't drop my pants and take it up the ass like you have so I could have some pixelated perks.<br />

I do have to comment as well.  How do we reconcile this statement against Absor's statement that they haven't even begun to look at melee balancing because they've just been too busy?  How can we be pleased with the results of a change that they apparently haven't even begun working on?<br />

But since it doesn't, because aggro control is considered more highly desirable, it therefore isn't balancing.<br />
<br />
For an advantage to have meaning, it has to be meaningful.  If nobody gives a rip, then it's not meaningful.<br />
<br />
For example, prior to PoP no one really gave a damn that Knights could out aggro control a Warrior.  Therefore the advantage they had wasn't particularly meaningful.  Now, things have changed, and that advantage, the same exact one they had in Luclin and Velious, has suddenly become overbalancing in their favor.<br />
<br />
This happens in a dynamic game.  However, when the game changes and some classes reap a meaningful benefit as a result, it's not unreasonable for those classes who fall behind to expect some adjustments to be made to keep them relevant and desired.<br />

It's time for those adjustments for Warrriors.</div></div><hr />

I do.  I'd certainly be a lot more likely to live thru AE's and such than I am currently.  Whenever I fight ANY mob that AE's I try to make sure that I have at least 1 Paladin in group.  Generally though it's hard to find 1, let alone more.<br />
<br />
I don't want, and have no reason to want a warrior in my group on a raid.  Nor does anyone.  Warriors are like the new Necros of EQ, they can't do anything to help their group other than tank, they are purely selfish and needy (in a gameplay sense).  Even Necros now have group and MGB spells/buffs, so multiple Necros stack.  The only possible way that you could claim that warriors stack is either by using the lame ass /shield ability (which creates more people who need healing) or claiming that 'they stack when the war in tank order before them dies'...  I don't know any other class that requires others of it's class to DIE before they become usefull.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but for me it's been about 3 expansions since mana was a limiting factor in an xp group.  The last time I recall waiting on mana was early in Kunark pre-L60 in a south wing HS group.  Even then it was only healing mana not nuking mana.  The last time I recall the wizard I group with going OOM on an xp grind was at the time of release when I had my ranger tanking with chain snare.<br />
<br />
Regardless it's meaningless to this discussion.  If right now a Wizard can do 180 DPS and not get aggro and stay at constant mana, but with a Knight they can do 240 DPS and not get aggro and stay at constant mana, that's still a 60 DPS increase.  You can increase your DPS until mana DOES become an issue but in my normal xp group w/VoQ, SD, P9, Horse, LofW, we're talking ~85 - 90 mana/tick regen add in any ticks that you're not fighting (Grabbing the next pull usually in a short group) you'll see the mana bar stay at around 80% constantly.  Again, none of which really deals with Warrior/Knight itemization and relative value/stackability in a raid group which is what the rest of this thread is discussing.</div></div><hr />

I contend that it's not my READING comprehension that's at fault but instead, your rabid Sony fanboism and apparent borderline illiteracy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
Did I miss an absor quote saying that warrior aggro has no problems and will remain exactly as it is now?<br />
<br />
The &quot;melee balancing&quot; that was spoken of on the web site doesnt have anything to do with warrior aggro issues.  It addresses the fact that melee vs casters are out of wack at the moment.<br />
<br />
The exact EQlive quote is Class Balance<br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons<br />
<br />
That is a completely separate issue from warrior aggro issues.<br />
<br />
Ive bitched up a storm about warrior aggro taking a back seat to other stuff, and it is what it is.  Evidently its not as big a concern now as it was a month and a half ago when there was a flurry of activity associated with it.<br />
<br />
Ive said it before and I will say it again, the #1 problem with SOE is communication.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Are they working on Warrior Issues now?<br />
<br />
or not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Solinaar, I understand that you're tied to an NDA if you're really in possession of this information...<br />
but you've already affirmed us that Warrior Issues were in the works, and that we'de like it...<br />
<br />
so now you either confirm that, or deny it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I doubt heavily that anything is in the works... although I still hope.<br />
If anything really was in the works... SOE would hint something just to cool down the rantings, <br />
and mostly, to &quot;attach&quot; people more strongly to the game....<br />
<br />
you think Warriors that know a change will happen will dare quit the game before it happens??? no<br />
<br />
but lots of Warriors are quitting now because they lost hope.<br />
<br />
<br />
So either SOE is really really really stupid, and you're telling the truth... and something is secretly in the works...<br />
<br />
Or SOE don't give a shit, and you're a liar, and nothing is in the works yet (and never will be).</div></div><hr />

It's certainly possible Solinar is misinformed or wrong without his being a liar.  We should give the guy a little benefit of the doubt, even if in our hearts we really believe that SoE doesn't give a royal rip about Warriors.</div></div><hr />

  If right now a Wizard can do 180 DPS and not get aggro and stay at constant mana, but with a Knight they can do 240 DPS and not get aggro and stay at constant mana, that's still a 60 DPS increase.   <br />
<br />
Where does this 60 DPS come from exactly?  I certainly have seen wizards start running out of mana on 10 minute+ fights that has no mana drain component and XP groups last a lot longer than 10 minutes.  Not to mention most of these alleged problems are from the non uber end where people lacks significant focus, significant AA, or high mana regen.  <br />
<br />
If you get 6 damage per point of mana used (and I think that's pretty generous even counting specialization/AA/focus), and you regenerate 100 mana/tick, that's 100 DPS sustained without using mana.  Where does the other 140 DPS come from?  Yes you can't possibly have a mob in camp at all times but you can get pretty close.  To do 240 DPS sustained you'd need to get 14.4 damage per mana used.  Seeing this is better than the ratio you can get on a crit nuke, I find it really hard to believe this kind of damage can be sustained.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me people are just making up numbers on what they believe they can sustain.  No one is arguing that Knight aggro isn't better than warriors, but you don't do more damage just because you can cast SoS nonstop for 10 minutes unless you plan to have your group end after 10 minutes.  Would you even want to use up all your mana as fast as possible even if you can in the LDoN setting assuming the end is probably the hardest part?  I don't know of too many groups that likes to keep everyone's mana at 0 or 20 just because they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of itemization issues, I just checked my server's magelo profile on EQrankings and the top 2 paladins have 400/600 less mana (5800/6000 versus 6400) than the top wizard.  That to me seems a bit out of whack...<br />
<br />
There's definitely a problem with Knights mudinflation but I don't think having these exaggerated claims like 'wizards do 250 more DPS with a Paladin tanking' doesn't help the situaiton very much.  I think something ought to be done about Knight's dummy-proof aggro that is far more useful than whatever imagined DPS increase you get for having a Paladin in a group (yes I know SK do a ton of damage, but they apparently don't really exist on my server so I have never heard of anyone losing a spot to a SK).  <br />
<br />
BTW, didn't Knight spells used to cost 3 times the actual listed cost or something?  That change would certainly fix a lot of the mudinflation related problems.  If Hybrids are supposed to be 75% melee 25% casters then I think it make sense that they've 25% the mana as a caster too as opposed to 90%.  After all it's not like Hybrid spells aren't that good... in fact a lot of them are arguably better than the parent stuff, like the Paladin group heals or the SK group taps.</div></div><hr />

Hello, I would like to welcome you to the year, 2003. In this wonderous age, we have things such as Voice of Quellious, Spiritual Dominion, Flowing Thought, Mana Regen AAs, Horses, Bards, Mod Rods, Paragon of Spirit (massable), etc... etc... etc... <br />
<br />
In short, spare me the bullshit. Mana is a non-issue. Consider it endless in ANY situation. Don't make me pull out the 'How to design a MMORG stick,' and beat the fuck out of you with it...<br />
<br />
If Knights are going to wear the best useable Warrior items, they need to take a 75% hit to their mana and a 25% hit to their hit points on the same damn item - that is to say, when a Knight wears the same armor, he is penalized, sometimes heavily.<br />
<br />
End of fucking story. Then you don't need to touch our aggro or our hit points or our defense or anything, and all you pussy posers can shut your yaps.</div></div><hr />

My comment was to XP groups not raids.  In an XP groups you don't always have a bard song.  You'll rarely have mod rods or beastlord buffs.  Although it's very rare, sometimes you don't even have VoQ.  A pickup caster certainly isn't uber enough that you can still have infinite mana and have to worry about aggro being the limiting factor on DPS.</div></div><hr />

And I'm saying bullshit. Do you even play EQ? You don't see the army of people /auctioning, /oocing, 'Will buff XXX for XXX.' ALL DAY LONG in any number of hub zones? I also contend that you've never cast the spell Strike of Solusek in your life. Nor have you dotted the fuck out of a mob with X number of classes. Basically, I don't think you've played a class at its maximum efficiency. PERIOD. You don't need to blow your load casting SoS in an experience group to draw aggro. You don't even need to pile on 10 dots. Warriors are fucked, fundamentally. In short, stop trying to bullshit people.</div></div><hr />

I've had entire groups leave me standing there while they ran a group or two over to get KEI.  I've had people delay my play time for 10 or 15 minutes so they can get a KEI fix in PoK.   This world you play in where mana is a regular issue?  It's not the world the majority of us play in the majority of the time.  KEI lasts for hours and no one with mana wants to play without it if they can avoid it.  And you'll notice almost every freak has a horse.<br />

Now if you look at what the average PoV or BoT wizard is going to be doing, it isn't going to be nearly that high. If you assume B09, VoQ, SD, self buffs and familiar, Ft of 5, and horse, you are looking at 66 mana/tick. Let's also assume he has mana pres 4 (10%) and ID IV (1-20%).<br />
<br />
(2740*1.10)+(2740*0.2)=3562 average nuke<br />

<br />
EDIT: Before anyone goes crazy saying that they know wizards can do more DPS than that, keep in mind that this isn't DPS per mob, this is sustained DPS throughout the course of an xp session. If there was a mob in camp ready to go constantly, DPS per mob would average out to sustained DPS, but if there are long breaks between mobs, DPS per mob would be much higher. If 30% of the time, there wasn't a mob in camp, DPS per mob would be 126 instead of 88. <br />
<br />
Sustained DPS/% of time fighting a mob = DPS per mob.<br />
<br />
88/0.7=126<br />
<br />
185/0.7=264<br />
<br />
I don't know what the average time between mobs is for the ordinary pickup group, but I would think anywhere from 10%-30% isn't too far off.</div></div><hr />

I spend a lot of time in XP groups with Voice of Quellious up. If not that then the chanter has been replaced by a bard. Why? Because they're the two best classes for CROWD CONTROL in PoP.<br />
<br />
Also, even though a shaman is doing the slowing, it's sometimes needed to have a chanter for tash ... malo ... THEN partial slow on some nameds (you know the reason people get together in these zones sometimes, the loots).<br />
<br />
I frequently have grouped with beastlords or druids who ALSO have mana regen addition spells.<br />
<br />
Or just Blessing of Replenishment.<br />
<br />
And in Bastion of Thunder, a common and popular spot for XP, Mages are quite valuable assets to groups so Mod Rods are sometimes pretty common.<br />
<br />
I dunno. I don't usually group with ALL of these classes at once. But over the course of an evening in one of these XP spots, I'll run into a whole lot of mana regen<br />

Of course it doesn't do me, the monk, much good. But eh, I'm not complaining. Voice of Quellious is great for them tradeskill combines before camping for the evening!<br />

<br />
Using a highly overestimate of 1 mana = 10 damage, 6000 mana gets you 60000 damage, so over 1 hour you get 16.7 DPS.

Sorry but when you speak from a normal BoT exp group fight you should include the time the Puller is pulling mobs while the caster is sitting on his back medding.<br />
<br />
The better the group is in BoT the longer the ways the puller has to go. Most BoT groups are not the &quot;Mob is not dead Fresh mob is already standing there&quot; groups. They are mostly &quot;Mob is dead Puller is going for next one&quot; groups.<br />
<br />
So often the time you wait for a mob is nearly the time you fight the mob.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I was in an HoH aggro kiting group with my Necro ( Level 62 Ft 3 ) at GY for half an hour. The group has a bard included but she was normally behind the mob fighting so her manasong was normaly only up when the puller was out for the next mob.<br />
<br />
I casted in each fight the following Dots:<br />
<br />
Saryn's Kiss 191 Dmg per tic<br />
Funeral Pyre of Kelador 241 Dmg per tic *<br />
Cessation of Cor 100 Dmg per tic *<br />
Pyrocruor 111 Dmg per tic *<br />
<br />
Mana preservation 4 / Burning afflication 3 (*) / afflication haste 4 / Arch lich no horse<br />
<br />
No other mana buffs.<br />
<br />
I made this 30 Minutes and ended by 80 % mana ( like I started after making my 61th pet .. )<br />
<br />
When you summary this from a not very good equipped necro you will see a summary of around 688 Dmg/Tic ( with BA3) after all dots landet which would be over 100 DPS from a poor level 62 necro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Necro Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=186275) <br />
<br />
That to demonstrate the 88 Dps of a 65 Wizard in tier 3 gear with all his possibilities.</div></div><hr />

What are you trying to argue now? Reality? Are you trying to downplay a nukers DPS? To make it seem like we're not really missing anything in those EXP groups cause our nukers can't go full bore? When does the bullshit end? In your groups do you have mobs lined up like 'Wack-a-Moles' and machine gun through them like a hot knife through butter? Why don't you stroll on over to the wizard boards and start spewing your propoganda so they can shut your ass down and save us the trouble.<br />
<br />
Chain pulling != efficiency. Get that through your thick skull. I'm so tired of this goddamn argument and this goddamn thread.<br />

It's pretty simple. It is time for Warrior reparations. There is no argument that is acceptable against this demand.</div></div><hr />
