<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">AFter a lot of thought and owning all these weapons<br />
<br />
Wavecrasher<br />
SoLightning<br />
SoTB<br />
CHoS<br />
SBoD<br />
WMSB<br />
GSoT<br />
<br />
<br />
I went with the 14/19 (AC 20) SBoD [no proc] and the SoTB (12/19 but with stun proc).<br />
<br />
This combo provides versitily (can put the SBoD in mainhand when I want DPS and the Bloodsworn in mainhand for agro), and good looks (SBoD puts all others to shame look wise) and stats (can't turn down AC 20) <br />
<br />
There was no logic in owning all these weapons and using each on in a spicific situation. <br />
<br />
This combo should last until BoW or maybe BoC ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CHoS &gt; SotB dps- and aggro-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your SBoD is going to be lacking aggro-wise, as many people have told you. But, since you only box with yourself I guess it doesn't matter because you'll only have yourself to blame when your chanter gets smushed just when he tashes/slows. sorry to be so blunt :p CHoS would be better in mainhand, w/ Sotbs in offhand. GSoT would be better aggro than your setup right now, and im guessing around the same dps. Why depend on your offhand proc when you can have 2 procs at once at about 3 procs a minute. GSoT has comparable aggro to CHoS and SoTBS, but i would suggest some changes in your aggro setup if you want to go past PoV. Even PoV will be hard for you unless you chain SoS with your Wiz's. Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">19delay and 12 damage is a bit better than 20delay and 13damage, although the proc does do more damage on the CHOS... not considering the proc the SotB is a little better dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea of this set up is that when I need procs I can switch the SotB to the main hand so that it procs 2 times vs 3 times with the CHoS/SotB (do i have that right main hand procs two times as much as offhand?), less to be sure, but only 2/3s as many procs.... <br />
<br />
And the DPS and Looks and 20AC of the SBoD pays off.<br />
<br />
I constatnly EXP in PoTactics against the yard trash Daiku... PoV would be easyer....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go kill the PoI Dragon<br />
CHSD &gt; Everything you currently have in the aggro department<br />
Im currently weilding a CHSD and GBoS and have a whole lot less aggro problems than I did with a SotB+whatever.<br />
The Taunting Blow effect on the CHSD is +450 unresistable hate.<br />
BTW the most annoying weapon I know of is the CHoS..the knockbac kon it is rediculous and every noob holding one always likes to push the mob Im tanking towards the next nearest mob we havent aggrod yet.<br />
BTW...wtf is up with all the non tank classes duel wielding SotB/CHoS? As if we didnt have enough aggro issues already,not to mention the wannabes jumping on the bandwagon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya that knock back on CHoS I forget about how bad that is.... but the GBoS has the exact same effect.... <br />
<br />
Well the GBoS sure looks nice lower delay and more damage then CHoS.<br />
<br />
I am not so impress by the spike weapon:<br />

 I think the reason that the Droga hammer (CHOS) was mentioned is because it has the same proc as the Great Blade of Storms.<br />
<br />
I have the Cord Hilted Spiked Driver from Xanamech, and I bought the Droga hammer just to try it out in offhand. I find that the proc on the CHOS/GBOS is equal or better than the proc on the Xanamech hammer in terms of producing aggro. Force Shock appears to produce about 500 pts of hate, regardless of whether the mob resists or is stun-immune.<br />
<br />
I imagine the Great Blade of Storms' extra melee output would put it above the Xanamech hammer in overall effectiveness.<br />

<br />
Either way,Im getting excellent aggro with CHSD and GBoS,and plan on keeping the combo until I have access to upper tier boss weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would have to disagree with that post.Having owned the SotB and at one time dueling GBoS and Sotb, I can say my aggro is much improved with the CHSD.It procs more often than do the Force Shock weapons mainly. <br />
<br />
No, most weapons proc the same.   We gotta get this down people.  We got parses all over the place now, time to stop thinking that weaponX procs more than weaponY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry Haass, I still must refute this observation!  There simply must be a per weapon proc_rate setting!!  I've tried so many proccing weapons, the highest proccing 1H weaps I've encountered so far are Primal 1H and Anklesmasher.  Nothing else even comes close.<br />
<br />
Grrr...  I must parse.  Banker in Katta doesn't fight back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There simply must be a per weapon proc_rate setting!!Haass didn't say there isn't a proc rate setting, he said MOST weapons proc the same. It is common knowledge that there are certain weapons that proc more than everything else. Haass' entire point is that in every weapon thread someone always says &quot;my proc_weapon01 never procs so I use proc_weapon02 because it procs 10x a fight!&quot; - which 99% of the time is completely false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry Haass, I still must refute this observation!

<br />
I'm too lazy, but Dark, do a search if you want on various places.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of people who say &quot;Man, I wish my primal procced like XXX,&quot; or  &quot;My primal doesn't proc for shit,&quot; which is exactly my point.<br />
<br />
I feel like my SoD procs more than my copper hammer does.  I proved it doesn't on the recruiter a couple weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;This combo should last until BoW or maybe BoC ....&quot;<br />
<br />
Please explain to me your &quot;plan&quot; for getting a Blade of War?<br />
<br />
Or a cord hilted spike driver for that matter?<br />
<br />
I thought you were a 6-boxer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Although I thought the thread title was a little strange, I'll offer my input. It just seems like he's announcing to all of the steel warrior and his decision or opinion affects us in some way, like several of his other posts have too.<br />
<br />
Blade of Carnage is a decent weapon, but vastly overpriced for what you get. You can just get augmentations now to make a weapon nearly as good now though.<br />
<br />
As for the BoWar, he's gonna 6 BoXoR RoXoR Rallos Zek... or at least die trying! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm a bit curious as to how you plan to get it too, especially for a twink hydra character. Most guilds (yes you are going to need a guild to kill RZ) will only let you use points or loot items with one character unless something is rotting. And he certainly does not drop it every time (more like 1 in 3 kills on average).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well BoC is for sale on Sullon for 160K right now, and another guy wants to trade his BoC for a SoD (LOL), but no sods up for sale..<br />
<br />
Well my plan is to level my warrior and be more valuable to a guild.... <br />
<br />
And just last night a warrior with a BoW asked me to jion in a 3-4 group deal to do Cursed who might drop bloodfrenzy (the guy wants the bp of void). I have classes that are all in the highest demand (chanter, cleric, wizards and warrior) for raid guilds, we will see what develops. I can field 4 wizards, 1 warrior and a Cleric for raids, what guild would not want that?<br />
<br />
Ya its really getting to be a problem as to me getting DKP for each toon, I am pretty sure the best guild will offer 2XDKP, and a lower tier guild has offered me 6XDKP (but they might not be able to even to the Spike Hammer mob....). Its really a hassel. I think Ill just try and talk my way up into 4XDKP or Ill just play 2 toons warrior and cleric and take 2XDKP...     <br />
<br />
And its not like I really need to improve grear wise. Im on a pvp server and the goal is to win at pvp. Because its 6v1 I usually win most all the time. Rapture, MB and 3 lures and oppenet is dead (I dont use warrior for pvp) no matter if I am in time gear or the stuffs I have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would be very surpised if ANY RZ capable guild would offer even 2x DKP for multiboxing, unless the guild is specifically made up of multiboxing people. The fact is, no matter how cool your set up is and how good you are at multiboxing, a group made up of the same classes with individuals playing will always be better than a multiboxer. That is what high end guilds care about, not that you can field 6 toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Remember when you parse, it needs to be done multiple times in several different situations to prove accurate.Also,the FS effect is constantly resisted,Taunting blow is never resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lets take a very spicfic case; 4 wizards controled by one person vs. 4 wizards by 4 people.<br />
<br />
I really don't see how 4 people would be better then me because I have all 4 computers hooked to one keyboard. I press one button to nuke with all 4, just like they 4 press one button each to nuke. Its true I can't independantly move all 4 at the exact same time, but from raids I have been on you just stand at a certian place and when the boss calls &quot;burn it down&quot; you nuke and concussion, not all that difficult. I can't see why a guild, in this situation, would pay 4 dkp for 4 seperate wizards when they can get the same dps for 4... <br />
<br />
I know I will get 2 dkp cause their policy is full dkp for one alt. I might have to settle for 2dkp and maybe get first crack at passed items that normally go to prospects or something. I think I gonna have to make some approch and see what up.<br />
<br />
But ya in EQ2 I am starting my own boxer only guild so there will be none of these arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Let's take a very specific situation. You are doing RZtWL and the adds start coming in. On of them attacks one of your wizards what now? Let the 1 die? Kite it away so it doesn't jump the healers?<br />
<br />
Or maybe you get in a guild that is farming the BoT towers. Your job is to snare and kite both Hrani and Leister in the earth wing. Both resist snare and are coming full speed. Can you keep nuking+concussion with 2 wizards while kiting the 2 bees full speed and trying to resnare both?<br />
<br />
Or maybe you get lucky and get into a Time guild. You are doing VZ and your job is to strong root one of the adds. SR breaks early and now one of the adds in on you, are you going to kite it while still paying attention to the other 2 nuking? Or just let him die and eat the DPS loss?<br />
<br />
In any of these cases 4 people playing 4 characters have a much better chance at handling the situation without a death and without causing any more problems because they are independent people who can do 4 things at once. No matter what you say, X people controlling X toons will always be better than 1 person controlling X toons.<br />
<br />
I 3-box myself so I am very aware of what it takes to do it effectively. I also know that there is no way I could play 3 toons as effectively as 3 different people can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya if there are two similtaious &quot;emergency&quot; situations I am toast. <br />
<br />
If there is one emergency I can contiue nuke on 3 with one hand and costom move with the other, I do it many times.<br />
<br />
But two toons needed custom moving at the same time no.... i just hit the gate key heh..... <br />
<br />
<br />
But you are assuming that all 4 are paying attention, with one person, me (not married live alone no distractions) playing 4 all are paying attention - big plus as compare to 4 &quot;average players&quot; with parents, GF, or kids or whatever or cats etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ya I can see your point in fluid situations boxers do suffer, in repetitive situation wiht no surprises we are probabaly better.<br />
 <br />
For very good example I have my socials written so that I can cast mana burn with one toon and have 3 lures land in the same second insta killing my oppenet before he can move or gate or even exodus. No 4 people can do that.<br />
<br />
Also Im not even the best six boxer, yet<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well from my experience, a majority of high end players and guilds do not like equipping everybody's alts or bots with gear that is needed by main characters unless it's rotting. You'll probably have to sacrifice playing mutiple characters or not worry about only getting counted as one person on raids if you ever wanna see a BoW for your warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ehh do what makes you happy no real need to fret much over it when it's just you and not a normal group with 5 other people to deal with. also you have control over the whole groups agro wich is much better then the normal where you have people doing stuff they shouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;Lets take a very spicfic case; 4 wizards controled by one person vs. 4 wizards by 4 people.&quot;<br />
<br />
But you don't play 4 wizards.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
In any event, I don't know too many people in any guild that would be happy with you getting twice the DKP just because you bot a toon or 5.<br />
<br />
But whatever. Good luck to you in all of your endeavors. And if you do manage to score a blade of war ... well ... I'm sure I'll see the thread on here somewhere.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ya I have 4 level 65 wizards, 1 level 65 cleric, 1 65 chanter and the level 62 warrior (1400 AC with virtue woot). But only 6 can be in game at one time, I can log in the 4th wiz or the warrior but not both.... I use the 4th wizard for serious pvp and the warrior the rest of the time.....<br />
<br />
Also these are not &quot;alts&quot; or &quot;bots&quot;. I.e. you have one main toon you always use and another that you might share with friends or is used as a support toon for your main..   I play all 6 toons all the time anytime I log in. 6 computers, 6 accounts, 6 montiors, one keyboard. The main 6 are all about equal whereas the warrior is only 3 levels and 80AA behind (well not exacly only heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In a majority of the bigger/well off guilds you have one &quot;main&quot; character. All other characters are considered secondary and considered &quot;alts&quot; or &quot;bots,&quot; and are not subject to looting privledges like the &quot;main&quot; character is. All I was saying is, if you want that BoWar, you're gonna have to most likely go along with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The day Sam gets a BoW is the day I quit EQ :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Am I imagining things, or does Sam get on here, ask advice, and then totally disregard the advice given?  It seems to be a trend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well I have taken advise. You see two pieces of cultural aromor on me. You see the SotB which I had never heard of prior to seeing this forum.<br />
<br />
Also taking the advise I was given on this forum I focued almost exclusivly on AC and HP when chooseing armor and ignored everything else, and to good result now haveing 1400plusAC and almost 6000HP (with virtue, BP self buff and SoV) at level 62.<br />
<br />
Also if you read the threads carefully you will see that many times those posting answers do not always agree with each other.<br />
<br />
The game is a trade off. I want a weapon with the best looks, best DPS and best agro proc, and for it to cost nothing. Well thats not happening so I am trying and see what the best balance between all these is.<br />
<br />
If I am only losing 1/3rd of my procs going with SBoDoff and SotBmain then I dont consider that a bad loss for the extra 20AC, better dps and looks of the SBoD. If I am loseing 1/2 my procs I might want to reconsider.... <br />
<br />
Go to this thread if you can explain if I am losing 1/3 or 1/2 of my procs going with a no proc weapon in the offhand:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=3700<br />
<br />
I know that the CHoS/SotB combo has the best agro<br />
I know that the WMSB has the best DPS<br />
I know that the GSoT has the best agro/dps ratio (heh)<br />
I know that the SBoD has the best looks and 20AC<br />
<br />
Now its just a question of getting the best balance between the lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for BoW, either i join the top guild on my server or I wait for EQ2 - a six boxer never having to LFG starting the second the servers go live is going to have a edge in leveling fast... naturally people will gravitate to the highest level toons on the server. If the graphics upgrade in EQ1 dont measure up to EQ2 then I am off the day EQ2 goes live.... I kinda doubt I am going to be staisfied sitting around doing nothing while running 1 or 2 toons after playing 6 all the time.. There is almost nothing to do most all the time when only running 1 or 2 toons but we will see, I do want a BoW... Our top guild is very short on warriors also, and chanters, and clerics, and you can never have to many wizards......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Your job as a warrior is NOT dps.  Your job is to hold agro and tank.  <br />
<br />
Yes, you are losing out on approximately 1/3 of your possible hate procs by offhanding a non proccing weapon.  You're missing out on 2/3 of your possible hate procs by not augmenting two proccing weapons.<br />
<br />
Why not do adventures and earn points and xp...its certainly more challenging than Plane of Storms desert trash.</div></div><hr />

The pvp server is way more fun, I mean it never ends you don't get burned out or boarded cause there is danger behind every corner...... Even the most simple encounter can fall apart when an enemy bard shows up and trains 20 mobs on you, or the enemey team zones in with 20pkers..... <br />

You like the PvP aspect, but as you say, you're already in the thick of it with the gear you got.<br />
<br />
And the PvE aspect is a completely different horse, with its own set of politics/drama/whatever.<br />
<br />
Even on SZ I'd imagine big raiding guilds don't deviate from the norm too much.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

Behavior like that is not exclusive to red servers.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">true....but at least on the blue server the mobs arent controlled by people ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Training enemy raids is just a normal everyday thing, there is nothing even considered unususal about it. There are 3 teams evil nuteral and goods. The goods paid me a Tacticians Bulwark (8000ppish item) to guard the enternece to PoTactics against the nuterals [plus because I am evil they kinda got default evil protection also heh] while they were raiding VZ and TZ....<br />
<br />
Either you kill the tainer or your raid is done. <br />
<br />
Evils have made a pact with the NOOTZ that gave NOOTZ VT zone if they would not raid evil raids from what I understand. Goods and Nootz train each other all the time, but evils and goods kinda dont (at least the top guild on each team). But if you are not guilded you can tain as you wish, if your a training class heh.... <br />
<br />
Nootz can't train the top evil guild (hate) but then Hate can't train nootz from what I understand but that does not mean that non hate and non ToW (top nootz guild) can't trian.... <br />
<br />
I mean ya I was in a raid with Hate and we just kill Behemoth and the second the projection spawned in comes da NOOTZ (that was before the pact I think or something I dont know) with 10 mobs behind them, piss me off to die instanly before hailing projection lol...... <br />
<br />
Sullon Zek, You Log In - You Die; enjoy yur stay......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Just a bit of update.<br />
<br />
Picked Up a EarthShaker (15K I overpaid I know) - once I get rampage I am thinking that this be very valuable in my PBAOE group......<br />
<br />
Sold SoTB (got 15K). Just going to use GSoT if I ever need agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Traded SoLightning and 7000pp for ... Long Sword of Yashka (or whatever) 17delay and 12damage. I am thinking if I can get a 2 damage agument this weapon will be unreal...... Also I conclused that lower delay is always better as the damage bonus is fixed at 13 thus the less its divided by the more damage it does heh....<br />
<br />
Got Posion Wind Chaser for 5000, put it up for sale for 5000, clearly a piece of junk but I figure to up my 2HB skillz with its lower delay but its just to junks (hit myself with the proc lol). Also got a Archtech jewled something I think has a nice partical effect but yet another junks weapon I put up for sale. Also selling my WMBS (someone was giving away one FREE a bit ago showing the value is almost nothing now). <br />
<br />
So now my DPS set:<br />
<br />
LSoY mainhand   17del 12dam<br />
SBoD offhand      19del 14dam<br />
<br />
RoXoR<br />
<br />
<br />
Agro Set:<br />
<br />
GSoT<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone has a SBoD for sale on Sullon for 96,000pp lol....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Architect's Scepter.<br />
<br />
And what'd you expect from a 13/21? It's just as good as a Scepter of Mastery. :P<br />
<br />
&quot;Also I conclused that lower delay is always better as the damage bonus is fixed at 13 thus the less its divided by the more damage it does heh&quot;<br />
<br />
Uh ... things are a tad different these days.<br />
<br />
As ATK approaches such lofty levels, average hits are higher, meaning the damage bonus advantage of faster weapons just isn't as noticable as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Ratio is, as always, very important.<br />
<br />
It's why the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic was such a good mainhander for DPS before it got nerfed.<br />
<br />
Just something to keep in mind. Your weapons are fine. Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />
