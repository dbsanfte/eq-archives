<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess I am in a casual raiding guild. I certantly don't see us killing the Eperor or anything like that anytime soon (possibly ever).  However that leaves me wondering...how the heck do I upgrade my armor?<br />
<br />
Currently (and have been for a year +) I am in full SS.. and while I can see getting some warlords--is that likely to be the last of the armor upgrade for me for a long time? Is there a PoP armor upgrade/s avalible to the more mundain players of EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kizrak's - i.e. Ornate Molds.  Not sure y'alls power but you can attain molds in BoT Towers.  Kiz's isn't Raex but it's a damn sight better than SS for us poor agnostic sons a bitches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe some of us are not agnostic. Kailyn was rolled early enough that we did not know there was a disadvantage to religion. <br />
<br />
Justice shall prevail! <br />
<br />
Guess that means I should look into Tundra Helenic too?<br />
<br />
Whats' good pricing on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes look  into Ornate molds.  Though some of the stats are not &quot;alot better&quot; they have nice effects on them.  BoT minis, Tactic minis, HoH Trials and Undead Wurlons.<br />
<br />
I'd think 2-3 groups (normal HoT raid Id guess) could do most of these.  Would be nice if they added some Ornate to PoS minis/Lords and give a reason to kill them.<br />
<br />
No idea on prices :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guessin yer Tribunal then ;).<br />
<br />
Helanic shouldn't be more than a few k per piece on your server, I'd start with the tuff to upgrade spots, bracer, arms, cloak, shoulders, visor, neck... helm omg!!  all but yer gaunts are prolly better off with cultural.  You might be able to get a bulk rate deal ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is the name of the ornate mold once turned into warrior armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kizrak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How do you get that dwarf guy to talk to you and give you the quest?  Do you have to be flagged inorder for him to talk to you?  Can you be a certain lvl??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually what kinda plats you got laying around to upgrade with, I got a few relatively cheap idears for ya :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Up until the implementation of Helanic Tundra armor, the barbarian cultural stuff more or less blew. Hard.  So there are relatively few barbarian GM smiths. (or if there are more than I think they're a sneaky nondescript bunch)  :)    That said,  HT armor is pretty nice; some pieces are better than FH armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wouldn't spend a single cp on upgrades at least for the next 2 or 3 weeks.<br />
<br />
With the last patch the drop rate for ornate armor has increased significantly. It is dropping like rain in the Karanas in the Tower of Sol Ro and dropping at a very reasonable rate in BoT and Tactics. Even if you are not flagged for Tactics or Sol Ro, the farmers are out in full force. I have not seen less than 30 people in Sol Ro since the patch - last night it was up to 84! This morning before I left for work I checked the baz for ornate drops, there where over 30 pieces for sale just on traders. Before the patch, I would be surprised to see more than 2 or 3 pieces for sale.<br />
<br />
Of course with the amount of new ornate entering the market, the prices are sure to drop. They are already coming down to reasonable levels on my server. This is also going to for cultural prices down quite a bit, so even if you can't afford ornate, cultural will be considerably cheaper in the coming weeks as well.<br />
<br />
If you have a ton of plats to blow, go ahead and start buying up ornate, otherwise give the new market a few weeks to stablize and get armor at a discount price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yup...you're in the same boat is me kailyn....only upgrades i see so far are some thunderous heraldic bracers and than it's sitting to collect coin to buy some molds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just ask your old guildies for some, Shik.<br />
We had like 5 ornate molds (2 plate, 1 leather, 1 silk and one chain) in 2.5 hours in sol ro last sunday.<br />
Sad thing is that most of them are not upgrades if you have ssra or vt gear in those slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you guys help me out enough as it is :D i'm still trying to pay rolsdar back the loan he lent me ( sold me horsey back to the vendor ) and trying to fill in the slots ( wandor saw me in the bazaar yesterday morning, and i finally got them new rings...woot )</div></div><hr />

How do you get that dwarf guy to talk to you and give you the quest?  Do you have to be flagged inorder for him to talk to you?  Can you be a certain lvl??  <br />
<br />
You need to be 55 and have a tier 2 flag, I was able to get armor from him as soon as my tank dinged 55 and the only flag he has is grummus.  Have heard tell that people at 60 with no flags are able to get it as well (this is probably due to the new zone openings to unflagged)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was 61 and tried to get the quest from the dwarf.  No luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How long ago did you try Lorre? My warrior was able to get the quest at 57.<br />
<br />
From the July 10 patch message -<br />
<br />
- Bors Wharhammer - He will be checking level instead of flags as a requirement for his quests to bring him in-line with the flag removals for the lower tier planes.<br />
<br />
Maybe the 1 tier 2 flag is the problem. My warrior has PoJ trial and Behemoth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kailyn, Prices on Povar for HT on bazaar mules run 5-6k for single ring pieces (Visor, collar, bracers, boots) 2 ring pieces (gauntlets, Vambraces, girdle, helm, Pauldrons) I see selling for 8-10k. Have never seen a cloak for sale. Legs have been 13-15k, and BP 20, which doesn't really make sense to me, since Legs, BP and Cloak all take same amount of rings (3)<br />
<br />
I made myself 2 bracers and the boots, but it took me 60 combines to get them because smithing is only 188, just don't have time/willpower for the farming needed to raise it further, so I broke down and bought a a couple of the 2 ring pieces and the greaves to replace my Champion's Greaves. The greaves are head and shoulders better than any Velious quest armor, as are the bracers.Other slots are equivilent to slightly less IMO, though SS gaunts are best for hande for sure, and I'll swap HT Helm for a Champs helm when I get the drop to get a bit of plat back.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you're Planar, all that is moot with molds dropping better<br />
<br />
I wish you well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wait a second, the combine is actual tradeskills?  If thats the case, whats Trivial?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">250+ on final armor combines, so at 188 with +5% Geerlok, 255 wis and str on my Shaman, I succeded approx 5% of the time, which is in line with what is posted on EQ Traders for tradeskills with that big a difference between skill level of maker and and trivial level of combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Darkoan<br />
<br />
For the molds, as far as I know, no. You gather the ingredients (some of which do require skills, but are tradeable) then hand all the stuff to the dwarf and he hands you back the armor.<br />
<br />
For cultural, yeah its hard with 250+ trivial as far as I know. But that you would not be buying in any form but finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Dinged 62 tonight (/cheer) and Bor gave me the quest.<br />
<br />
My understanding of these quests:<br />
<br />
Give him 500plat and he give you a forge and a symbol. You do the combine of the symbol the mold, 1-3 sheets of ethereal metal (or whatever they're called), and a Tanaan smithing hammer to produce the item.<br />
<br />
Metal is a high smithing trivial with a skill-limited combine (you can't try it if under x skill), but as was said, the sheets are tradeable.<br />
<br />
I was gonna buy a gaunts mold but given all I hear about drop rates being increased a goodly bit, I'm gonna secure 62 and bully guildies into giving me BoT groups and hope for molds :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A friend of mine just checked yesterday morning and got the symbol and the forge thing from the guy.  He's level 60, with no flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Can someone please answer the question, do you need SMITHING skill to get Kizrak's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You need a smithed component and a brewed component to get Kizrak's,  but you do not need to do the smithing or brewing yourself.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Darkoan:<br />
<br />
No you do not need smithing skill.  The final combine is no fail and the dorf gives you the container to do the combine in so make sure you have room for a container when you give him 500pp.<br />
<br />
I got gaunts the other night hunting in BOT and did the quest.  You need a tanaan hammer (bought in POK) and varying # of sheets of Etheral ? metal (# depends on piece of armor).  I bought the two sheets I needed in bazaar for 400pp each.  To make these sheets yourself is a smithing skill check.  No idea on the trivial or recipe etc.  For me, I could farm pp to buy em probably quicker than raising my smithing skill.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, no you don't need the smithing skill unless you want to save money and smith the sheets of metal yourself.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Whoops, my bad, you need the brewed component to make the sheets. So if you are just buying the sheets in the bazaar, you don't have to bother with the brewing step at all.</div></div><hr />
