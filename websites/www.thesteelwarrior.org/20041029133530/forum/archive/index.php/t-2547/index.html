<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, my guild just recently tried Emp for our first time.  We wiped but we'll kill him easily next time, about a quarter of our raid was boxed and we had one enchanter and two OTs go LD as well as some others.  I think we had relatively small numbers too, only two tanks.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd like to know what weapons to use for tanking Emp.  I have  a BoC, GBoS, Stormrider Carapace, Corrupted Shissar Warsword and a few others I'm not going to bother mentioning.<br />
<br />
I talked to a few of the top warriors on my server and they said I should use my BoC in primary and Stormrider Carapace in secondary.  Statistically, this is by far the superior choice; however, I'm told it's the best choice as far as aggro as well (on emp at least).<br />
<br />
So does that sound about right?  I've been told BoC/ bane would be good too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try both. I've been told each works well, so it comes down to personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought bash didn't land on the emp.. or kick.. or slam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bash doesn't land on emp, but a furious bash shield still &quot;glows&quot; as it's focus effect is activated.  I have no clue what this means really.<br />
<br />
I've tanked emp with 2h bane no problem and didn't loose aggro.  I've also tanked emp with a cord spiked driver and a SoD. . .he seems very easy to hold aggro on really.  (never lost aggro, unbelievably considering all the stuns and your low damage output.)<br />
<br />
I do believe that each hit (whether bane or not) does generate some aggro, regardless of damage.  So I think this is a great fight for using dual wield in some circumstances.  (If you have a choice of dual wielding non-bane weapons vs. using a 2h non-bane, dual wielding would aggro more I think.)<br />
<br />
If I were you, i might try shissar sword mainhand and BoC offhand (assuming you have ambidex).  You can always &quot;ghetto&quot; bash with the shield too, but I wouldn't bother.  Emp fight is disorienting enough while you spin, levitate/knock around, get stunned, and beg a wizard to spellshield you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've Mainhanded Bloodfrenzy and BoC, offhanded bane and had no problems with aggro. I've mainhanded bane and offhanded Bloodfrenzy or BoC and had no problems (though to be safe I had people engage a little later - maybe 30 secs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the Emp has very high proximity aggro, so that is the most important thing.  Definitely mainhand the BoC, any of those options would work for offhand I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I always have main handed bane and offhanded my bloodfrenzy and almost never lost aggro.  Dual wiled EB works too, different strokes for differnt folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was always BoC and Bloodfrenzy.<br />

To avoid the spin, have all 15 buff slots filled.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tanked Emperor with a willsaper.... aggro is a non issue with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SSharlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We generally used an eb in main (bloodfrenzy prefered) and a wraths edge or lesser bane in secondary.   If offtanking or secondary tank reverse this order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do note you still do whatever your normal hit would of been on Emp with hate, the damage part is just nulled.<br />
<br />
Better to use 2x aggro weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My solution for you, Qris, is to have someone else tank &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned to me recently that the Emperor isn't immune to non-bane weapons, he simply mitigates all non-bane damage 100%.<br />
<br />
If this is true, I'd go with the combo that traditionally generates the most aggro for you. Mitigated damage (think of a stun that they save against) still generates aggro, being the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I always used two bane to tank him, never had a problem with agro, just get as close as you can to him at all times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">kick lands on emp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kick only lands when you have a bane weapon in your hands. And I tanked Emp from 80% till he died the other night using Bane 2h and never had a problem with agro.  Just corner pin him and have the melees push him on top of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Qris :)<br />
<br />
If your BoC and Stormrider Carapace normally give you the most aggro, use that for Emp. The aggro from the bash still counts, because the potential damage still counts as hate. EB proccing on emp = win!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Fattah!!!  Hey Dal, never seen you post here before :p<br />
<br />
Think I'm just going to use BoC/bane or BoC/sheild, from these posts it seems like both will work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ssra mobs have very high AC, as I'm sure you know.  I would be careful about letting a bane weapon in offhand count for too much.  I think you will see alot of &quot;1&quot; for damage, since there is no damage bonus from the offhand.  I haven't tried this myself since I don't have a 1h bane, but you might wanna watch out for it.  That's why I recommended bane in primary hand and BoC in offhand, if you have ambidexterity especially.  Your offhand will still proc, and your mainhand will do damage.  Though, I suppose if the BoC's fully mitigated damage still causes aggro, it doesn't matter much.</div></div><hr />
