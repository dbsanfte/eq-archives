There any truth to that?  Or an I falling victim to an EQ urban legend?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i can see how that would of been turned into urban legend. one of the survival tricks used while traveling across mountains or across miles of flatlands is to put a pebble under your tongue which keeps your mouth from going dry. it works just the same as if you had a cough drop in your mouth...only it'll take far longer for the pebble to disintergrate.</div></div><hr />

Urban Legend.<br />

I believed it for a long time.  My shaman (my first character) still has a plains pebble in her bank that she carried around well into her 50s.  A druid imbued it for me and gave it to me and told me to carry it always so I did.  I still can't throw it out - it makes me smile whenever I see it.  <br />

I wish there was more of that wonder left.  I like figuring out how things work and understanding the game but... the world was so magical back then when I had no clue what was going on. :)</div></div><hr />
