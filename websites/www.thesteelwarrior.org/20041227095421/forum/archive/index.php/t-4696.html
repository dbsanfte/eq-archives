Has anyone on test server parsed (or heard from Sony) how large this mitigation bonus is?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage reduction will depend on whats hitting you. If it always hits for minimum, the reduction is zero.<br />
<br />
If it hits you on the lower half of the damage spectrum, then the reduction is somewhere over 4%. If you are constantly being hit for max, or near max, the reduction is going to be under 4%.<br />
<br />
Just depends.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll explain it since I'm bored. <br />
<br />
The formula for a mobs hits is Damage Bonus + (Damage Interval x N), where N is a number from 1 to 20.<br />
<br />
So if a Mob's damage bonus is 100, and it's damage interval is 50, that means the mobs minimum hit is 150, and it's max hit is 1100.  The damage reduction that is on test currently limits the max hit on a warrior to 1 damage interval less than the max for everyone else.   This mob would hit a warrior for a max of 1050 right now.  I do not know if this affects minimum hit, I would guess it wouldn't.<br />
<br />
The damage reduction is not a straight percentage.  On mobs with a low DB and a high DI, it will be a bigger reduction than on mobs with a high DB and low DI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i.e. warrior gains a 5% (1in 20) decreased damage from any max hit that is reduced to a DI 19( and only if the hit would have been for max). <br />
<br />
Great for raids - indifferent for exp - unless you're taking on a real mofo of an exp mob. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruldar</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a programmer's point of view, I can think of a few possibilities for what they might have done that fit the observations so far.<br />
<br />
The DI range could become [1 - 19, 19] (19 counting twice because 20s are changed after the roll to 19s)<br />
It could become [1 - 19] (20s removed before the roll by just changing the 'dice')<br />
Or it could become [0 - 19] (everything minus 1 after the roll)<br />
<br />
If quick-and-easy parsing reveals the minimun hit has changed to be just the DB, the 3rd option is probably right. But if the minimun hasn't changed, then more detailed parsing would probably be needed to see if theres now twice as many max hits (or not).</div></div><hr />

Have it work across the line instead of only at top end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megadyen</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">k, what exactally is a *damage interval* im sorry for the dumbassness, but any explanation would be appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megadyen</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry im stupid, all i had to do was read the thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs can only hit for 20 different amounts of damage<br />
<br />
The formula for this is <br />
<br />
DB + (DI * RND(1, 20)<br />
<br />
Where DB is Damage Bonus, DI is Damage Interval, and RND(1, 20) is a random number from 1 to 20, modified by mobs atk and level, and your AC, Level, and now, class, with innate warrior mitigation.<br />
<br />
Lets take a thoeritical mob- With a DB of 100 and a DI of 5.<br />
<br />
This mob would hit you for a minium of 105 points of damage- No matter if you had 1 ac or 200,000 ac, you could NOT make this mob hit for less (Barring Runes or Vie or possible Shielding? I have no shielding items)<br />
<br />
This mob would hit you for a maximun of 200 points of damage- No matter what, it cannot hit for more, whether you are a nake level 1 enchanter or a Elemental Geared Warrior.<br />
<br />
Every amount of damage you get hit for will be a multiple of 5 on this mob- IE, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, etc. to 200. The mob cannot hit for any other value, again barring Runes, Vie, and Shielding.<br />
<br />
To figure out the mobs DI and DB, take the Max Hit (Obtained by sitting, for example) and subtract the mobs Min Hit (Obtained by hoping you get hit for min when tanking it), divide by 19. Multiply that by 20, subtract that from max hit, and you get the DB.<br />
<br />
Why is this important? Defensive, for example, reduces DI by 50%. This can help you figure out things such as max hit defensive, and whether defensive or evasive would be the better the disc, etc.</div></div><hr />
