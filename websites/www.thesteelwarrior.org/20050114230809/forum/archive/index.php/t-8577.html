<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is incorrect because you don't actually get hit 100% of the time to start with.<br />
<br />
1% hit avoided is 2% less damage taken if assuming you get hit 50% of the time (and I think it's actually lower than that if you're a monk).<br />
<br />
For example if you assume you get hit 100 times at 100, mob hits 50% of the time, then 1% mitigation, using mitigation to mean taking X% damage less, means you take 9900 damage.<br />
<br />
But if you avoid 1% more, you'd actually only get hit 98 (49%/50% X 100) times for 100, resulting 9800 damage taken overall.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Has it ever occured to you that monks want the better of the 2. Mitigation &gt; avoiddance. It's quite obvious. So you want us to have more of the lesser defensive ability, geez thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh and there's quite a few other  posters saying it and the main posters agreeing, it's lunacy...<br />
<br />
apparently max hits mean you get stunned longer too over there! and misses can still proc!</div></div><hr />

Avoidance, just like mitigation only counts on hits unless I'm mistaken (please show me where the proof is).  If it was a miss anyway, then it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without a doubt this is true and for this and a few other reasons, I believe avoidance &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mitigation.<br />
<br />
I was just trying to show that as far as pure melee damage taking capabilities, the 2 effects are numerically equal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true, unless the mob is weilding a weapon with a proc (not common at all in the game anymore). Mob innate procs will never go off on a miss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious and I'm sure the info is around somewhere, but hell if I can find it.  Since mobs with innate procs cannot proc on a miss, do items that add innate procs to players have the same restriction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The same does not apply because mitigation is commonly viewed as amount avoided versus the total, not what you currently do.  For example if you get hit 50% of the time, we take 'avoid 1% better' to usually mean get hit 49% of the time instead of getting hit 49.5% of the time (1% of 50% avoided).<br />
<br />
In this context avoidance is easily twice as good as damage mitigation.  Now if you measure mitigation not against the current DPS, but some much higher theoractical value (say with 1000 AC), then the results might differ, but we usually understand mitigation being a function of current DPS.  If you take 100 DPS and you mitigate 1% better, we understand that means you now take 99 DPS.<br />
<br />
Here's the numbers worked out show why 'avoid 1%' is twice as good as 'mitigate 1%'<br />
<br />
A mob attacks 200 times, hits for 50%, each hit hits for 100.<br />
<br />
Normally you take 200 X 0.5 X 100 = 10000 damage<br />
<br />
Mitigate 1% more you take 200 X 0.5 X 99 = 9900 damage<br />
<br />
Avoid 1% more you take 200 X (0.5 - 0.01) X 100 = 9800 damage.<br />
<br />
If you translate the savings to HP, avoiding is at least twice as good for 'effective HPs'<br />
<br />
To see why, ask yourself this question, what's the difference between avoiding 50% more or mitigate 50% better?  In the former, you'd never get hit, and that'd bring DPS to 0, whereas mitigate 50% better is just half the DPS.<br />
<br />
And actually the lead by avoidance gets bigger the more you have it.  Going from getting hit 1% to 0% is quite a bit more DPS reduced (i.e. everything) as opposed to getting hit from 50% to 49%.</div></div><hr />

That's why on certain mobs with nasty procs, evasive can be the better disc to use.<br />

And no, PC's can proc on a hit or a miss. I proc all the time on my weapons without actually hitting anything.<br />

<br />
Weapon procs will fire hit or miss.<br />

it's why alot of people don't understand the difference between npc and pc procs.<br />
<br />
95% of all pcs use weapon procs and 99.95% of npcs use innate.<br />

one reason you won't find weapons with rough procs on them in NPC hands is when the NPC dies that weapon is lootable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyborne25</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets get extreme =P<br />
<br />
Mob hits for 2000 damage.<br />
<br />
100 hits.<br />
<br />
Receiver A.) 50% mitigation and 8000 hitpoints<br />
Receiver B.) 50% avoidance and 8000 hitpoints<br />
<br />
Receiver A.) gets hit 100 times<br />
Receiver B.) gets hit 50 times<br />
Looks like receiver B has a huge advantage, but wait.<br />
<br />
Receiver A.) gets hit for 1000 damage, so 8 hits and he's dead.<br />
Receiver B.) gets hit for 2000 damage, so 4 hits and he's dead.<br />
Oh, it only takes 4 hits to kill receiver B....<br />
<br />
You might argue that with a equal distribution of avoidance, receiver A and B would die in the same timespan. However, avoidance can easily not fire the first 20 hits, while mitigation, although perhaps not consistant, is way more relyable then avoidance over short periods of time.<br />
<br />
On average, receiver B will avoid one hit out of two, but when in all those 100 hits is unreliable. The odds are in favor for receiver A.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Perspective from a role's point of view is also important in this debate. The most common assumed role in this debate is being a tank. That's the warrior's perspective. Tanks get healing attention when they tank, that's a fact.<br />
<br />
Now monks usually pull, which means that when they are getting hit, it's rather silly of any healer to heal the monk on a pull. Obviously, the monk would rather not depend on his streaky avoidance, but rather be able to take more hits in a short period of time.<br />
<br />
I think these latter 2 paragraphs might explain a bit more where monks are comming from, so perhaps you will laugh less loud at us ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you're a monk. you dodge. That's just what you do.<br />
<br />
You're not a warrior with big heavy plate who can't dodge worth shit but can take a hit really well, you're a monk with light armour who can't MITIGATE worth shit, the mob just can't hit you woth shit compared to a warrior. You just dodge a lot.<br />
<br />
Asking for better mitigation when that's simply not what a leather class and monks in particular are SUPPOSED to do well, just isn't logical. <br />
<br />
You don't take a hit well, so therefore you AVOID them.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when it comes to avoidance and mitigation, avoidance is always better. <br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Mobs have a minimum hit. If you mitigate a hit, you can never mitigate it past minimum, whereas if you dodge a hit, you take absolutely zero damage.<br />
<br />
a mob hits 1000 times for 100-1000. <br />
<br />
at 50% mitigated, that's at best 100k to 500k damage. So 300k damage average.<br />
<br />
at 50% dodged, that's at best 50k to 500k damage. That's 275k average.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this game, a 50% dodger will ALWAYS take lower damage on average than a 50% mitigator.The advantage grows as the minimum damage on a mob is increased.<br />
<br />
Your argument as well about 4 hits versus 8 hits to kill a person... that's misleading.<br />
<br />
In 8 hits, the 50% mitigator will take every single hit and be dead.<br />
In 8 hits, the 50% dodger will dodge half, take the other 4 hits, and also be dead. There's no advantage present.<br />
<br />
To be fair, avoidance can tend to be more streaky than mitigation in terms of short term damage taken... however on the other hand, avoidance reduces damage taken even on mobs with ultra high atk, when the benefits of mitigation lessen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem with the monks at the moment daemonwynd, they seem to think improving mitigation magically gets rid of max hits, it just reduces them and it's just as streakey as avoidance is.<br />
<br />
You brought up another point I forgot about daemonwynd, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyborne25</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kenny ;)<br />

In 8 hits, the 50% dodger will dodge half, take the other 4 hits, and also be dead. There's no advantage present.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The difference here is, the mitigator has more time to receive heals... The dodger has a high chance of being dead the first 4 hits before he can even dodge the next 4 hits.<br />
<br />
I might've included something about monks, but lets keep this at avoidance versus mitigation ;) I also play a warrior if that helps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyborne25</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For your information, i only partake to this discussion because i have a different opinion. I don't give a crap about monk mitigation and avoidance, i rarely get hit anyways becuase i simply stay out of reach on pulls or FD off aggro... Unless i tank, but i take it for granted that a monk simply is not a tanking class...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference here is, the mitigator has more time to receive heals...<br />
<br />
You're overstating. The mitigator MAY have more time to receive heals. By the same token, the *dodger* may have more time to receive heals.The dodger has just as much of a chance to live LONGER than the mitigator, as he does to not live as long. ON average, the mitigator and dodger will die around the same time.<br />
<br />
The dodger has a high chance of being dead the first 4 hits before he can even dodge the next 4 hits.<br />
<br />
Again, exaggerating. The dodger has *A* chance to be dead the first 4 hits... but if mitigation and dodge percentages are equal, the dodger has an equal chance of living LONGER than the mitigator.<br />
<br />
Yes, dodgers can get unlucky and not dodge as much as they do, due to an unlucky turn on the RNG, but by the same token, they have an equal chance of living longer than the mitigator by virtue of a lucky roll on the RNG. And as I've stated, the avoidance will acoid all damag,e while the mitigator must always take the DB hit.<br />
<br />
To put it in other words, there's just as much of a chance for the dodger to avoid all 8 hits, as he has to not dodge any hits. For each time the dodger doesn't dodge 8 hits, there's another time where he WILL dodge all 8 hits, when the mitigator would be dead. If it didn't work that way, the 50% dodge rate wouldn't work out. To be more precise, in 2 situations, one of which the monk died in 4 hits, the monk would have to dodge the next 8 of 12 hits, hence maintaining a 50% dodge rate (8/16). In that case, the dodger would have died once and lived once, while the mitigator died both times. In one situation, the monk died faster, and in the other he lived longer... which just serves to underscore my previous point that avoidance can be more streaky in terms of damage taken in the short term, while being ultimately superior in the long term.<br />
<br />
I think what you're doing, Greybourne, is immersing yourself in the negatives, and not seeing the positives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyborne25</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deamon, yer a pretty experienced raider, how do averages relate to tigh cheal rotations? It seems to me if you set up a cheal rotation on averages, the max damage peaks will kill your tanks.<br />
<br />
You all seem very keen on averages... On damage taken over time... Does a healer refrain from healing you when your at 20% because your supposed to avoid the next 5 hits? No, he will heal you now because he knows the next 5 hits will probably kill you with your mitigation. How do averages relate to this then?<br />
<br />
When push comes to shove, you rely on mitigation and avoidance is just... neat ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most complete heal rots are set up on what the MAX damage output will be of the mob in question, most assume avoiding zero and mitigating nothing.<br />
<br />
since both are rng based both can be equally desirable, on mobs with high attack however you'll notice less and less benefit from the mitigation aa's compared to the avoidance aa.<br />
<br />
both will net the same benefit as to raw dps avoided from melee, but one will avoid stuns and procs....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyborne25</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deamon, i'm not negative at all =P See my earlier statements ;) I just like a good debate. Since i traverse numerous class forums, i'm kinda used to the &quot;oh your a monk you must think this and that&quot; statements...<br />
<br />
When i look at Brodda Theps Parses (and i do realise these only count for HoH) and especially at the histograms, i see mitigation has the most effect on min and max hits. The middle ground is pretty much equal percentage wise for all classes.<br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
So the number of min and max hits are pretty leading to show the usefullness of mitigation. When a max hit hits is also RNG based and is as streaky as avoidance.<br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
So if your a good mitigator, you get max hit 5 times out of 100, which is a very small chance that you'd need a heal instantly after a heal. While if your a poor mitigator and get max hit 20 times out of 100, this greatly increases that chance.<br />
<br />
Ok now lets put it in percentages and for heavens sake, one warior got just all avoidance AA's and the other warrior got all Mitigation AA's...<br />
<br />
A.) Poor mitigation 20% max hits plus good avoidance 30%<br />
versus <br />
B.) Good mitigation 5% max hits plus poor avoidance 10%<br />
<br />
A.)<br />
100 hits - 30% avoidance = 70 hits<br />
20% max hits * 0.7 = 14 out of 70 hits are max hits.<br />
<br />
B.)<br />
100 hits - 10% avoidance = 90 hits<br />
5% max hits * 0.9 = 4.5 out of 90 hits are max hits.<br />
<br />
The chance for max hits to follow after eachother is much smaller for B then it is for A. The rest, including min hits (according to Brodda Theps histograms) will be nearly equal.<br />
<br />
This is theory, you can test this with Evasive and Defensive discs and compare the histograms of both 3 minute parses. Also keep count on how many heals and at what time intervals you got, to keep you up during those 3 minutes. I think you might be suprised by the outcome ;)<br />
<br />
The number of heals and time intervals of those heals will be the deciding factor on which is more effective. Because that's what counts, healing you and keeping you up, who gives a damn about averages =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A.) Poor mitigation 20% max hits plus good avoidance 30%<br />
versus <br />
B.) Good mitigation 5% max hits plus poor avoidance 10%<br />
<br />
A.)<br />
100 hits - 30% avoidance = 70 hits<br />
20% max hits * 0.7 = 14 out of 70 hits are max hits.<br />
<br />
B.)<br />
100 hits - 10% avoidance = 90 hits<br />
5% max hits * 0.9 = 4.5 out of 90 hits are max hits.<br />
<br />
Don't even be muddying up the waters by brining up certain amounts of avoidance and mitigation that may or may not suit your argument... argunig pure avoidance versus mitigation has enough dimensions to it as it is.<br />
<br />
I could as easily come up with some mitigation and avoidance numbers that support my argument... but I won't it gets WAYYYY too complicated. I feel confident that I've shown enough with just mitigation and avoidance numbers alone.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say that the less mitigation a person has, the less benefit they gain from avoidance. The opposite is true: The more mitigation a person has, the less avoidance does for them.<br />
<br />
As a game example, warriors would benefit far less from a 5% increase in mitigation than a, say, wizard would, in terms of average damage taken per round. Wizards get hit for more average per hit, so avoiding that hit completely means they avoid more total damage than the heavily mitigating warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If this is the case then I expect you to head up a campaign to get all plate wearers avoidance skills nerfed down to caps of 100 tops. After all, you are wearing big heavy plate armor, you shouldnt be able to dodge for crap. I mean, you DO realize that your skills have identical caps as a monks right? Barring block which you dont get. So you dodge, riposte just as well as us and you parry quite well also. Seems a bit unbalanced that the ultimate armored tank can also avoid very nearly as well as a nimble, light on his feet monk.</div></div><hr />

However, i am saying that mitigation is more leading, more important. Avoidance is just a neat trick, an aid, beneficial in the long run. That's it.<br />
<br />
Avoidance beats mitigation over a longer duration, while mitigation beats avoidance in short durations. 1 minute fight versus 5 minute fight and so on, avoidance will eventually curve above mitigation in efficiency.</div></div><hr />

You mean kinda like how warriorsa no longer had a mitigation advantage over us so we got nerfed? WE already are at the current skill caps. Aside from mods, which are only available at the high end, I cant improve my avoidance until I hit the high end and 65. So I avoid almost equal to a warrior. That means there are only two options, either soe increase the defensive skill caps and only allows monks access to them, or warriors avoidance skills get nerfed. Id prefer the increase to caps but we all know how the soe solution to an imbalance is to nerf the class instead of boosting the other.  As for the warrior dps needing to be nerfed, that was Wubao mocking your logic Liper. Obviously we dont want warrior dps to be nerfed, we want ours to be better.</div></div><hr />

um no.<br />
<br />
He was saying because I think the mitigation nerf should not be fully repealed that I supported nerfs to fix a issue, when my full repeal would involve a mix of mitigation AND avoidance which was then said to not be a full repeal and there for I support nerfs and therefor DPS gap can only be fixed by a nerf insteed of a increase.<br />
<br />
Which as I said there is apples and oranges.  one has two ways to fix it, the other only has one...<br />
<br />
With itemization the way it is, you simply can't repeal the mitigation nerf.  Monks have too much avoidance to have thier ac = war AC in terms of effect point per point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monk avoidance isn't = to the warriors... they're better. As they should be, even given the fact that warriors are tanks, and monks are not.<br />
<br />
As for riposte/parry/block etc... that has nothing to do with armour and everything to do with weapons. And since monks and warriors are both very good with their weapons, there's no issue.<br />
<br />
You're not a tank, so you shouldn't take a hit like one. You ARE significantly above all other leather wearing classes (and more than a few of the next step up, the chain classes) in damage taken, and are about equal to the rangers, rogues, and beastlords - the other nontank melee. In fact, some parses show monks to have a significant ADVANTAGE in terms of average damage taken per round! <br />
<br />
The nerf happened to begin with because some monks were tanking BETTER than warriors. Nothing has changed that fully repealing the mitigation nerf (instead of half repealed as it is now) isn't going to break things again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the reality thing only goes so far, and at the same time, it also cuts both ways. That same argument you're trying to use against a warrior in regards to justifying a nerf of avoidance could be turned around and used against a monk to justify a possible nerf against monks mitigation.</div></div><hr />

The Warrior wearing 100 pounds of steel is also wielding weapons that he can use to avoid attacks. Weapons such as swords, clubs, staffs, don't always need to be thought of in an offensive light.<br />
<br />
However, the Monk wearing 15 pounds of leather doesn't have anything that he is either wearing or wielding that can help him to mitigate on a higher level, in the same way as a Warrior can wield something to help him totally miss an attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So let me get this straight .. you want your mitigation increased to where it was and the ac softcap raised to knight level?  How would this not infringe on knight tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
The very idea that a monk should tank as well as a knight is absurd.<br />
<br />
You can do your kungfu ninja reflexes shit all day long as far as i care, i'll have to agree  with cele that in reality, having weapons/shields and armor skillfully used is much better than all the flips in the world as per deflecting and straight up missing.<br />
<br />
If you wanna get realistic, monk mitigation should be next to nil ... if the enemy doesnt miss em your 15lbs of leather might as well be chocolate pudding for all they care ... you're fucking toast.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, since when is eq about reality?  The very idea that any regular 6-8 foot humanoid could withstand 1 hit from a 50 foot God is ridiculous.  Check your reality bags at the door ... eq is straight up fantasy and the dev's can do whatever the fuck they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for coming back but im being severely misunderstood. As for the softcap, I only want that so our ac is formulated like a melee class, we still cant even approach knight ac so we wouldnt be tanking like a knight. No matter how you slice it, 1900 ac is not going to outperform 2500 ac.<br />
<br />
As for the whole two weapon thing, uh, we use two weapons as well, hey now there is an idea. How about we get a 252 capped parry added onto our skills to give us the avoidance advantage again? Makes sense, we have weapons after all and we should be able to parry a monsters attacks with them as well as block them. That gives us the avoidance you warriors seem to think is all we need, our entire new defense is setup with avoidance skills,  AND it doesnt involve soe altering the skill caps to go over their current max. Just code in that monks get parry at level whatever and have it skill up normally, mitigation probably wont need to be adjusted with an extra 5-6% avoidance tacked onto our skills, if it gets made so that our avoidance works even while facing away from a mob, I think that might solve every problem short of any squabbles over comparative dps lol.<br />
<br />
As for leather shouldnt stand up like plate, blah blah blah, it doesnt, thats why each item is WEAKER than its plate comparison in terms of ac. Remember? Thats why we only get 1900 ac while warriors can top 2600.<br />

<br />
Dobbanz, we've had this arguement before, a number of times.  The Monk mitigation nerf was imposed for a reason.  Monks claim it wasn't.  Monks refuse to face reality in that regard.  Expecting it to be rescinded at this late date isn't particularly realistic, given the fact that it's been in place for something like two years now.  It's time for Monks to let it go and move on.  If you feel Monk DPS at the high end isn't sufficiently beyond a high end Warrior's, then by all means generate some credible parses that substantiate that and campaign to have something done about it.  If you feel Monk avoidance at the high end isn't sufficiently beyond a high end Warrior's, then by all means generate some credible parses that substantiate that and campaign to have something done about it.  In fact, if you can generate some credible parses that PROVE that Monks are taking signficantly more damage than say a similarly AAed and geared Ranger over a substantial period of time I can even see you campaigning to have something done about that, as well.<br />
<br />
But that's not what happens.  Monks keep pointing to the plate classes and scream about how they don't mitigate as well.  Well DUH!  You're NOT supposed to.  End of story.  Stop trying to reach for something that you're not supposed to be able to accomplish.   Most of your damage negation comes from avoidance.  You avoid better than any other class in the game.  Having you mitigate as well or almost as well as a plate class tank on top of it would be asinine to the extreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyborne25</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dobbanz is a bit disillusional...<br />
<br />
Let me explain the monk nerf, bare with me.<br />
<br />
Monks where nerfed because we tanked like warriors, yes. This was at a time where the &quot;hardcap&quot; was barely noticable for any class and monks had insane AC items. In fact, i even believe the hardcap was the same for every class and mitigation was regulated by armor. Some designers screwed up with items in Velious causing monks to come pretty damned close to warriors and they only found the problem in luclin.<br />
<br />
So at the start of PoP, SOE nerfed monk mitigation directly, halfway PoP, Hardcaps where changed into softcaps and i think these softcaps where set per class instead of being the same for all at this time.<br />
<br />
So now Monks have lower mitigation (AC does less for monks period) and a lower softcap. Two aspects got regulated and created a huge ammount of problems for monks who didnt have insane AC.<br />
<br />
Now just a restoration of our mitigation, would put us above Druids and Beastlords, nevermind we're all leatherclasses, monks simply have tougher skin, trained muscles etc. It would also put us close to chain classes, speakin in terms of pure mitigation.<br />
<br />
However, the softcaps would prevent monks to ever mitigate better then unless their AC is much higher then a given chain class (diminishing returns after reaching the softcap dictates needing more AC).<br />
<br />
What this mitigation restoration would mean, is that monks who don't reach the softcap mitigate better and monks who have reached the softcap and beyond, won't notice any difference.  <br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
Since Brodda Thep found substantial differences in softcaps between classes in HoH. A large ammount of the monk community have been demanding a raise of the softcap just for monks AS WELL as a mitigation restoration. I believe this to be silly and will bring back the reason why monks where nerfed in the first place.<br />
<br />
Well...<br />
<br />
If just the softcap gets raised for monks, then this will only benefit the high end monks who actually do have more AC. It's logical high end monks want exactly this.<br />
<br />
And...<br />
<br />
If just mitigation gets restored (AC having more effect for monks) then the only those monks who do NOT reach the softcap will benefit from this.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
Monk mitigation can be restored and will help those monks who currently suffer the most under the nerf, but the softcaps must not be touched as those simply prevent monks from mitigating like warriors or knights.<br />
<br />

<br />
BREATHE<br />

<br />
Back to the avoidance vs mitigation discussion.<br />
<br />
Having high mitigation increases the efficiency of avoidance.<br />
Having low mitigation might make avoidance seem meaningless.<br />
<br />
So i'd say, for warriors, avoidance &gt; mitigation and for monks, mitigation &gt; avoidance.<br />
<br />
Why should it be the same for every class if the circumstances and the aspects are not?<br />
<br />
Monks think mitigation &gt; avoidance and they are right.<br />
Warriors think avoidance &gt; mitigation and they are right as well.<br />
<br />
It's simply a matter of &quot;for which class?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the personal attack there. Now how does this,<br />
<br />
Monks where nerfed because we tanked like warriors, yes. This was at a time where the &quot;hardcap&quot; was barely noticable for any class and monks had insane AC items. In fact, i even believe the hardcap was the same for every class and mitigation was regulated by armor. Some designers screwed up with items in Velious causing monks to come pretty damned close to warriors and they only found the problem in luclin.<br />
<br />
<br />
match up with this?<br />
<br />
Since Brodda Thep found substantial differences in softcaps between classes in HoH. A large ammount of the monk community have been demanding a raise of the softcap just for monks AS WELL as a mitigation restoration. I believe this to be silly and will bring back the reason why monks where nerfed in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, as you said, the problem was, monks were reaching warrior ac. That is no longer the case. It has been posted several times with the exact quotes Absor admitting the nerf was a mistake, that it didnt have the desired effect, and they were looking into changing it, (this was after the partial repeal btw I believe) For some reason they did nothing. Now,<br />
<br />
<br />
So now Monks have lower mitigation (AC does less for monks period) and a lower softcap. Two aspects got regulated and created a huge ammount of problems for monks who didnt have insane AC.<br />
<br />
Even insane ac doesnt mean squat past the softcap, an increase of 500 ac according to thepps parse gave us somewhere around a whopping 1% improvement. Besides that, we not only have what you mentioned, we also now have gear that is substantially lower in ac than what the plate classes get, so we now have a triple slam of negatives affecting our ac. Dont you think thats a little excessive? We got nerfed because our gear had way too much ac. Now our gear no longer has way too much ac, hence, the problem was corrected outside the nerf. How is it delusional to think thats a wee bit of overkill? Ok, so, the softcap ensures we cant tank like a plate class, the ac values on our gear makes sure we cant tank like a plate class, the WORTH of the ac on our gear was nerfed so we cant mitigate like a plate class. ANY one of those things would be enough. <br />
<br />
For instance, we could have an identical ac softcap and ratio to warriors at this point and no mitigation nerf and STILL never tank close to as well as a knight because our total ac is way too low. Or you could toss on an extra thousand ac and remove the mitigation nerf and we still wouldnt mitigate as well as a knight or warrior because our softcap is nearly a brick wall its so steep. Or you could remove the softcap, and give us 2600 ac and we STILL wouldnt tank like a knight or warrior because of the mitigation nerf. We have redundant nerfs right now. You could get rid of any two of the three nerfs to our mitigation and still never see us take your spot in groups except in areas of extreme gear disparity. Or dont call them nerfs if you prefer, call them checks to our mitigation, either way, its excessive. The only reason I support a mitigation increase is because it returns what was taken from us needlessly, and no i dont want to get into yet another debate on that. Id be almost as happy with the avoidance boost I suggested before, I think either one could do the job of fixing us quite nicely, at least as long as my FULL suggestion, ie 360 degree avoidance, also comes into effect to make pulling a bit safer.<br />
<br />
Look, feel free to disprove my veiws, I wouldnt have come back to this if it hadnt been for that delusional comment. I gotta stop reading this topic, every time I do I seem to see another person either twisting what I say, misunderstanding it, or attacking me.</div></div><hr />

Having low mitigation might make avoidance seem meaningless.<br />
<br />
You've got it exactly wrong.<br />
<br />
High mitigation LOWERS the usefulness of avoidance.<br />
<br />
Low mitigation INCREASES the usefulness of avoidance.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Mob hits for 1000<br />
<br />
Avoiding a hit that you have 50% mitigation on would only remove the other 500 damage you would have otherwise mitigated<br />
<br />
Avoiding a hit you have no mitigation on removes the full 1000 that you would have taken if you didn't avoid it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree completely. However, I also think that warriors have too large a gap between them and knights at this point in time. I think it's time to go back to the way things were in PoP. Warriors had their niche as /disc monkeys ... cough ... I mean RAID tanks. And knights tanked everything else that mattered, like XP groups.<br />
<br />
That warriors have an edge over knights, to me is absurd.<br />
<br />
Right? You all are such fans of knight tanking, aren't you? Why the Steel Warrior I remembered was always in favor of standing down in defernece of their knight tanking brothers.

<br />
Yes, you make a good point.  When a Monk comes to TSW and reads that Warriors think it's absurd that he expect to mitigate as well or close to as well as a plate class tank, while retaining the full value of his avoidance, he really should have his pride offended and be filled with righteous indignation.  How dare Warriors actually think that Monks shouldn't get the best of both worlds!</div></div><hr />

Warriors used to whine and complain quite a bit. So when a monk stops by to see warriors, a class that got quite a lot of fixes after complaining about them for YEARS, sitting in judgement from atop their mighty tanking perch, it's just disappointing.<br />

The whole issue is simply blown out of proportion by Liper/Pumilo, who's trolling as Haas pointed out is pretty crybaby bullshit all around.<br />

Monks have problems with mitigation during pulls. Monks for the most part don't give two shits about tanking, or duoing, or any of that other crap everyone fears is some hidden agenda by monks. They just want to pull better.<br />

Having played a monk to 65 before playing war, the problem isn't really, avoidance or mitigation, theses are only issues, the fact is that monks have really bad  mitigation, but that shouldn't be a problem if the class had a good DPS instead, my 55 war tank better than my 65 monk, with no AA and less gear, that's not really a problem, because I know warriors are made to tank, but if the monks cannot DPS well, heal, buff, slow or something, they should be able to tank no? Here's the point, monks miss tools or innate ability to focus on DPS or on Tanking, so they are nowhere except pulling, wich is kinda sad, that's why U retired my monk, no intensive raiding guild, then feeling useless ...</div></div><hr />

I agree.  What's refresh on stonestance these days, and how often do you really need to burn a disc on a pull in relation to that time?</div></div><hr />

But like defensive half the time you wait in case you need it more later. Not sure how many times I've pulled buffless (My odds of living don't really change full buffs is only one hit. ) <br />
<br />
I guess I could burn it every 3 minutes it lasts 12 secs. But then again why don't you do that with Stonewall or defensive? <br />
And sometimes you just have to take hits while that caster sits there nuking you you wait a bit and let the melee mob rape you so they split far enough. Then you use disc. When you know your facing a SoW'd Kyv with haste you burn disc and pray. FD's wonderful.. Magically it means I should never *Cough* die.

Actually, you said it yourself...it is up quite a bit more than defensive actually.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if what Wu said is true, then discs ARE your answer.<br />
<br />
They will provide the momentary defensive boost you need without becoming overpowered to the point where we see monks being the best tanks again. <br />
<br />
So, the question becomes...is Wu right, and you really want this mitigation in order to pull, or are you all lying to yourselves, and to us, and just want to tank again?</div></div><hr />

And I don't see how they could be at about the same avoidance as warriors.  Block blows away Parry, so they will always have better avoidance by a significant margin.  <br />
<br />
From what I've seen monks stack up extremely well against all non plate classes when it comes to taking damage.  That's where they should be.  They aren't tanks and are not intended to be tanks.  It seems like they do pretty solid dps too.  I know the weapons my guild is seeing drop for monks are a better ratio than what we're seeing for warriors in addition to their better chance to get more attacks per round.  The free lull ability and the stonewall AA have restored monks pulling abilities relative to bards for many game situations, so they're very strong again in the pulling niche.  <br />
<br />
Prove beyond serious doubt that monk dps should be raised if you want an upgrade.  Don't ask to tank.</div></div><hr />

Callon since you obviously did not comprehend this thread or the one on MB. Pre pop (2 weeks) Monks did in fact out tank Warriors Assuming they both had 1200 AC I won't dispute this it's as far as I'm concerned fact. Now 2 weeks before PoP This changed. We were changed in our ability to mitigate since we were better than warriors. Now With Pop or a little later they fixed the AC Bug that meant that AC didn't work past X number. This helped tanks because they are able to get alot more AC than a monk at a given equipment level. Monks Now have less AC and that AC now does less. Then Warriors got another bone namely .95 DI. The listed mitigation doesn't change that fact.  So that's a double benefit. <br />
<br />
Agree or disagree these are all relative facts. The fact is back when the nerf occured they could have easily kept monks from from mitigating as well by not allowing us 1 set of the mitigation AA's. Course I can think you shouldn't have gotten set of the avoidance AA's either. Course all casters get all of these as well. <br />
<br />
Now as to the parse in question. The Knights were no where near as equipped as the monk and warrior.  If I added 10 sheilding to the knights they once more take less DPS than the monk. This would be required to give a reasonable equipment comparison.</div></div><hr />

So you have to add 10 avoidance to the knights to get them to take less DPS than the monk.  Okay... they should take less damage and in a fair comparison, they probably do, as they should.  So why do monks need a boost?<br />
<br />
My point was quite clear in my post  if you read it instead of having a knee jerk reaction to some phrase you didn't like.  I said monks compare favorably to most other classes in the game.  You responded by being condescending and claiming that if the parse were done right, knights would show as taking less dps.  While probably true, that doesn't invalidate anything I said.  <br />
<br />
The 3 tank classes should beat out monks in dps taken and though we lack the parse proof right now,  I'll accept that they do.  Good.  Now compare a monk to a beastlord, ranger, rogue, etc.   They compare quite favorably to these classes.    So again, what is the problem?  Apparently you want monks to take damage as well as the plate tanks.  Well, if the devs have half a brain, you won't get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a question, maybe I missed this as I dont really look to my warrior for dps, has anybody parsed the best monk in the game vs the best warrior (aggro setup) for dps? How about the top of each expansion? - edit checked library here and parses show monk dps is better<br />
<br />
I know some warriors do awesome DPS (especially relative to mana-constrained casters), but do MT warriors do that kind of damage? In short DBotW (or the new GoD anger wep) and some other aggro applicable off-hand wep, not a dps setup.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is I routine parse my damage and my warrior (you can see the specs, could be better but not too bad) routinely gets spanked by my dps classes (wizard, ranger, monk). Yes my 3 dps classes are truly specced for damage dealing with nice focus/weps etc but any high-end monk can do the same, whereas a warrior has to focus on aggro or at least be able to focus on aggro when needed.<br />
<br />
And btw I am ALL for a EP monk getting beat by a PoT warrior (esp. DPS setup vs aggro setup) in DPS. That is what I would expect. I would expect, however, a PoT monk to spank (well maybe not spank, but beat comfortably) a PoT warrior in dps.<br />
<br />
And for the record I am all for better monk dps  :D <br />

<br />
If i'm not mistaken (and i dont think i am) there was never an AC bug at all .. but rather luclin and velious mobs had such a high attack that the ac btw 1200 and say 1600 didnt make a huge difference, and you only saw moderate changes with huge jumps in ac.  Mobs in pop had a lower attack rating, thus a smaller upgrade in ac yielded stronger results.<br />

I know softcaps do exist as well, and these may have been further raised for tanking classes.</div></div><hr />

What does a warrior out dpsing a elemental monk have anything to do with mitigation?<br />
<br />
If you feel monks are lacking in DPS, then ask for more.  But sure as shit that SK *should* be taking less damage then that PoTime monk, sorry, Monks aren't tanks, I don't know why you can't accept the fact that plate melee should take less damage then you, its their role, not yours.  If monks keep comparing damage mitigation to warriors, and aim to be compareable they are in for a wakeup if they think Knights and Rangers would sit idly by and not freakout if your mitigation was increased, even slightly.<br />
<br />
 Monks should be looking at a reduction/duration increase in the Earthwalker line for a solution for these amazing  pulls that happen all the time they nearly die.  Tell me arlakisd if you were able use Earthwalker every minute, with a doubled duration would you still demand more mitigation, and if so justify it.  Other then that I see no justification to increase your mitigation at all.</div></div><hr />

Monks should have higher DPS then that, but if they push for mitigation improvments they'll never see much higher then a war then they are now.<br />

So choose it.  It's not like you're prevented from getting shielding.  For god's sake, it's all over the place in GoD, on armor, even augs.   If you want shielding, go get shielding.</div></div><hr />

Just based on what SOE has done. <br />

Double the duration of Stonestance? So 24 secs of every minute. You do realize we'd then blow the socks off Warriors then? I don't want to be a God. <br />

<br />
Then you're insane.  10 avoidance prevents way more damage than 1% shielding unless the mob's DB is MASSIVE compared to it's DI.  I've already passed up shielding in favor of avoidance and I have no regrets.  I'm still going for as much shielding as I can get, but I consider avoidance to be just as important.  Right now it's easier for a warrior to get shielding than it is to get avoidance so I take every chance I can to get avoidance and rely on the easy slots for shielding.  For monks it's the opposite.  Avoidance is easy as hell to get for a monk and shielding is harder.  If I was a monk trying to improve my defensive abilities I would take the biggest shielding upgrades I could find and get the easy avoidance mods for the other slots.<br />
<br />
So far I have 30 avoidance and 12% shielding.  I don't see myself finding much if any more avoidance any time soon so from here on out I'll be getting mostly shielding.</div></div><hr />

The results I thought were startling.  <br />
<br />
So let's compare thepps parse with a plates ac mitigation and factor it into the current parse sooo..<br />
<br />
CLS  AC    SHLD AVD  DB   DI    AVG    MIT%  ATKS  HIT%  MISS% BLK% DDG% PRY% RIP% | DMG<br />
SK   1861  0%   10   102  22.1  268.4  65.6  2951  48.9  44.2  NA   3.5  5.3  3.8  | 131.2<br />
MNK  1854  2%   60   100  22.1  311.0  55.0  3476  41.1  47.2  12.0 5.4  NA   4.7  | 127.8<br />
<br />
for simplicity sake, we'll just put in the SK's average hit taken into the monks and factor in that 2% shielding.<br />
so 266.4 insteed of the monks existing 311.0 per hit.<br />
<br />
Now 3476 attacks 41.1% landed.<br />
that's 1429 (rounded up) hits landed.<br />
Now at 266.4 insteed of 311.0 damage per hit we have...<br />
380686 (rounded up) damage out of 3476 attacks.<br />
Now... we have average damage per hit?  109.51<br />
<br />
You know what the warrior was? with superior AC, SHIELDING, AND -1di....<br />
109.2<br />
<br />
Now tell me does it looks like monks SHOULD get a mitigation boost to where your AC = the same as a tank with that AC?<br />
<br />
I mean you can see how far warriors superior ac went!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Of course the average hit is going to be lower for a tank.  We have better mitigation than monks.  Monks have better avoidance.  Even with the mitigation advantage that the SK has, the monk is still taking less overall damage than the SK (132.2 for the SK vs 127.8 for the monk.)  Obviously the monk has better gear than the SK and the SK would take less overall damage if he had comparable gear.  That's as it should be.  A monk will dramatically out damage an SK in equivalent gear.  Same is true for warrior vs monk.  <br />
<br />
Of course the most specialized tank in the game is going to take significantly less damage than a class that isn't even a tank.  By the same token the monk will significantly outdamage the warrior unless the warrior's weapons dramatically outclass the weapons the monk is using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's not room for any more tanks in Everquest.    It's already irritating enough that bards will be getting the ability to aggro, adding yet another on the pile.   <br />
<br />
There needs to be a heirarchy of tanking, and warriors need to be the top dog of that heirarchy.   Knights need to be a solid #2.   Rangers need to be at #3.   Why?  Simple, because all of us were bestowed with this little thing called the &quot;taunt button&quot;, that means that we were designed and intended to attempt to become the focus on our enemies' attacks.   <br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues, Bards, Berserkers, Beastlords, and the rest of you &quot;non tanks who can still tank&quot; arent' tanks.  There's a grand total of 4 intended tanks in Everquest.    It's indicated by the posession of the little &quot;taunt&quot; button.   A rather elegant way of going &quot;yep, I'm supposed to tank&quot;.    <br />
<br />
Mitigation requests are BS.   They have nothing to do with wanting to survive pulls, I mean for god's sake, you're getting a GURARANTEED NEVER FAIL feign death, and you have stonestance used every THREE MINUTES, and Run 5, you will survive pulls.<br />
<br />
The mitigation requests are about tanking, about being able to take sustained damage while being healed at predictable intervals.   <br />
<br />
Sorry, you're not a tank, making it easier for you to fit into that role is stupid.<br />
<br />
Go find something else to do</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that's where I'm coming from at least. Years of that bone cruncher sounds just wears on you after awhile, ya know? The constant max hits. The constant getting ass-raped the moment one random thing goes wrong with the pull (which happens a lot) ... it slows down the raid, it makes you eat a death, or one of your teammates on the pull team eats a death. The margin for error is pretty small on pulls. And the max hits are just annoying.<br />
<br />
And these days, everything runs so damn fast. <br />
<br />
Personally, if there were a way for monks to use earthwalk every pull, it'd be just peachy. But I somehow don't see that happening. I've heard there's two separate mem-wipe AAs coming for monks in the new expansion. Maybe that'll help. Maybe it won't.<br />
<br />
Either way, for me, it's always been about pulling.<br />

You know, that whole survivability thing that you all think I'm NOT talking about.<br />
<br />
What makes it funny, coming from Frodlin, the BIASED, Paladin-lover, is this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Go find something else to do&quot;<br />
<br />
Monks ARE. They're not trying to tank. They're trying to PULL. They're trying to do DPS.<br />
<br />
Monks don't have the gear to keep up with the joneses, or the Frodlins anymore. Monks don't have the AAs. Or the hit points. <br />
<br />
For monks, it's always been about the nerf having the stupid-ass side-effect of ruining their pulling abilities, and PoP completely gimping their pulling.<br />
<br />
There needs to be a lot of work done on making monks pull better. Part of that is REDUCING the max hits (the whole mitigation part). Because a DEAD monk ... which is what you get when monks get hit for max as much as they do ... doesn't succeed at the pull. And a dead monk just slows down a raid.<br />
<br />
Go do something else? THEY ARE, you clod!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Khamuk I realise the tank is better because of thier ac means more then others, it was mainly a response to the tons of monks saying &quot;we want our AC to mean the EXACT same as a tanks AC, because tanks can achieve soo much higher AC it's not a issue&quot;<br />
<br />
Even with a gap of 400ac, if thier ac means the same as a tanks we end up with a monk bieng stronger defensivly then any tank which was the point of the nerf to begin with...<br />

Monks are asking for something that got them gimped to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Numbers are arbitrary, but say 20% innate and 3 levels of 5/10/15 or 10/10/10 stun resists AAs.  Although it won't fly well here,  I'm also in favor of increasing the ratio of their AC softcap. Guild monk says it is roughly 30AC equaling 1 actual AC.  Lowering the ratio to 15:1 (or so) would actually make highend monks have a reason to look at AC, doing so while not affecting monks who havent reached the current softcap.  It would also be feasible to keep the old softcap ratio and just raise when it takes effect, say by 100-150AC.</div></div><hr />

One thing from all the posts is they seem to think max hits = stun or more stuns.  which is based on feelings and thier prelem tests have shown nothing related but kicks/bash and running causing those (see mitigation making less max hits = less stuns to them for some reason also...)<br />

I agree, this whole max hit thing = stunned makes no sense.  This is easily tested on a runed enchanter, who still gets stunned with the rune still  in effect.  The damage is 0 from the kick/bash due to the rune, but the stun still counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the situation ...<br />
<br />
1- When mobs hit you from behind, while you are running, you get stunned more frequently.<br />
<br />
2- Monks take maximum hits more often than any other class.<br />
<br />
3- Monks spend a large portion of their time RUNNING from mobs. It's called pulling.  They have no range damage abilites, so there's never any fear of them KITING. They are simply pulling the mobs to the group.<br />
<br />
4- When a pull goes wrong (and they do go wrong) and a monk gets stunned, there are certain things that happen. They get hit for maximum, most likely. The mobs from the botched pull catch up. The monk is still stunned. The monk has a very small window of opportunity to get off a feign death to save his or her life. Or eat a death and do the whole thing over again.<br />
<br />
5- Feign Death fails. A LOT. Especially in these situations.<br />
<br />
This is why Earthwalk was so helpful. <br />
<br />
ALL OF THIS happened after the mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
Monks want this nerf removed, because at the very least, it will decrease the amount of maximum hits, and save them at least a COUPLE of deaths on botched pulls.<br />
<br />
Which saves them some sanity.<br />
<br />
Which saves the rest of the everquest world some TIME. And helps raids go smoother.<br />
<br />
It's not about tanking. It's about getting rid of needless, time-wasting deaths. There was a time when monks had a much larger margin for error on pulls. When monks had a lot more survivability when things went wrong. EQ has stripped monks of this, and left them on the razor's edge when it comes to pulling big, tough, hard hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
But none of this matters here. REALLY, it doesn't. Haas is right. This is better left on the MONK boards. For monks to gripe and bitch over. Pumilo is trolling. Bringing all of this nonsense over here, simply to stir up another pot with another argument. It's a waste of time.<br />
<br />
The devs will do what they do, and there's nothing warriors, monks or anyone can do about it. None of the gripes, bitches, trolls or whines will matter. The devs have their gameplan for OOW. <br />
<br />
Maybe some of the proposed AAs will help monks. Maybe they won't. Maybe they'll restore some of the mitigation or get rid of the max hits nonsense, or give monks some way to deal with the stun issue (which does exist, anyone can go run from mobs and test that shit out ... freakin Orc Pawns can stun you on the run if you actually let them connect, but I think if you really want to get a feel for it, a great spot to see it in action is Tower of Sol Ro, the Sentries have a very high rate of stunnage) ... and maybe they won't do a damn thing.<br />
<br />
In the end, though, it's not really important to warriors. So why argue about it? Are you all THAT bored? Sheesh.</div></div><hr />

1. AFAIK stuns only come from kick/bash/spells, if this is correct how will mitigation stop a bash stun? (Im actually curious about that one)<br />
<br />
2. Monks also avoid more hits than any class. Its a trade off<br />
<br />
3. You can pull using ranged and with run 5/sow on most mobs you will stay ahead of them. <br />
<br />
4. Something can always go wrong for every class, monks get stunned on pulls, warriors get unlucky RNG and get one rounded, clerics takes a stun at a bad time. Shit happens<br />
<br />
5. FD works a hell of alot more times than it fails. Monks are super hard to kill, out least ours are and i cant see how other monks would be any different in high end content.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with monks getting better mitigation as long as they mitigate less than plate and around the same level or slightly under chain.<br />
<br />
 In the end, though, it's not really important to warriors. So why argue about it? Are you all THAT bored? Sheesh <br />

<br />
Accuse me of bias all you'd like, because I AM biased.    I think tanks should tank and monks should pull and DPS.    You don't need advanced mitigation to pull.   Getting hit for max 9% of the time rather than 2% of the time isn't preventing you from pulling.   Monks can pull just fine.  This is about tanking, a job which isnt' yours.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if it were about surviving pulls, then you're barking up the wrong tree.  If you monks put in 1/10th the effort into a skill that prevented resisted spells from breaking feign that you do on trying to become tanks, you'd increase your survivability 10fold.<br />
<br />
On top of that, EVEN IF I believed you that you wanted it for pulling, which I don't, the fact is you'd be the only monk who does.  This is ALL about tanking, and soloing.  Soloing mushrooms in FG for exp is a thing of the past, accept it as a relic of a bygone era and move on with your lives, the new mobs arent' really melee soloable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, Warriors have the best mitigation in the game, yet they're still far worse pullers than Monks.  It doesn't seem that having great mitigation is the most important component in surviving a pull successfully.  The fact of the matter is that Monks are sent forward to pull because they're far more likely to survive and bring back a manageable number of mobs than most other classes.  Are Clerics going to be more survivable if they do a pacify pull?  Lots of times no way.  Ranger?  Probably not.  Shadow Knight?  Not normally, although there are some very good SK pullers.<br />
<br />
Monks have the single best combination of abilities necessary to make a first rate puller under by far the majority of circumstances.  Unfortunately they don't have, and shouldn't have, the best or near the best mitigation in the game.  Attempting to get additional mitigation &quot;for pulling&quot; seems a bit much.  Particularly when it doesn't seem that Monks are angling for better &quot;pulling tools&quot; or ablities to help with &quot;pulls only&quot; but want a 24/7 under all circumstances mitigation improvement.  This doesn't seem well focused and targetted at &quot;pulling&quot; situations.</div></div><hr />

This is easy to test. Hit up Sol Ro tower. Get some sentries aggro'd on you. RUN. Let them hit you in the back. They're not bashing you. But they are stunning you. Check it out. Test it. You can test this anywhere. You can test this in Paludal Caverns. Stuns, when running, don't come JUST from kick/bash/spells. Monks run when they pull. It's why it's an issue for monks, and not for, say TANKS, who don't exactly engage in this activity.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think tanks should tank and monks should pull and DPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think monks should pull too. And the overabundant amount of maximum hits that they take is a detriment to pulling. The getting stunned while running thing is a detriment to pulling. The monk nerf came about due to itemization issues. I still have the patch notes and subsequent posts by Absor regarding this if you'd like official SOE quotations on it, I'd be happy to provide them. The itemization issues have been fixed for awhile now. So simply asking for the penalty which causes all of the max hits to be taken away isn't that big a deal. And it has NOTHING to do with tanking. Monks CAN'T keep up with tank classes these days. They can't keep up with aggro. They can't keep up with hit points. They can't keep up with armor class. They simply aren't a threat.<br />
<br />
It IS all about getting raped on pulls. Pulling is a monk's job. The ideas floating around on MB are primarily ideas to help monks do their job better. Which is to pull.<br />
<br />
&quot;the fact is you'd be the only monk who does. &quot;<br />
<br />
That's not a fact. It's quite false. There are a lot of monks who simply want to pull better.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you monks put in 1/10th the effort into a skill that prevented resisted spells from breaking feign that you do on trying to become tanks, you'd increase your survivability 10fold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good lord Frodlin. Why do you leave yourself open so often? I mean come on man. What the heck would prompt you to write that statement? I'm going to be nice here. And simply state that monks have put far more than 1/10th of the effort into that VERY topic. And the end result was our GoD AA, which does that very thing. That's been a hot topic for monks for a long time as well. We do talk about more than just MITIGATION. And our issues do cover a lot of things. Including the thing you just accused us of not focusing on.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
Look, I understand you're a warrior, so you might not know these kinds of details about monks. But really, just chill out with it Frodlin. You're frothing is tipping your hand here. Your bias is showing far too much. It's NOT about tanking. SOE has seen to it that monks will never challenge anyone for a tanking role again. <br />
<br />
It's just about pulling. And better discs is something we strive for. Not having feign broken by spells is something we DO complain about. And something we got an AA to help with. Mem-wipes, and Fade, and aggro are all things monks spend a large amount of time griping about.<br />
<br />
And, also, MAX hits, that we still take due to the mitigation nerf. It's just one of many topics monks bitch about. And it's got nothing to do with tanking.<br />

Remember ... Frodlin let his son moderate the warrior serverwide chat channel.<br />

He IS biased. And you warriors should question where his loyalty towards warriors really stands, if he's going to be your correspondent. He may know a LOT about warriors, and a LOT about EQ.

Mitigation will not help this at all.  The severity of a backside hit has nothing to do with whether it stuns.<br />

ANY hit from behind has a chance to stun.  I think you have agreed with this, so I'll not belabor the point.<br />

Monks take more max hits than any other class. This becomes painfully apparent to monks who are getting hit while pulling. Getting rid of some of those max hits, by getting rid of this mitigation penalty, which is all monks are asking for ... getting rid of the penalty that was put on the class to deal with gear that has long been out-dated ... will help. A little bit. It will save monks from a few unneeded deaths. That's all this is about. And all it's ever been about.<br />
<br />
Pumilo took this debate, and trolled it up over at MB. Got it good and spicy and then brought it here, where it attracted the paranoid frothings of Frodlin, who's already on record with how biased he is on this subject.<br />
<br />
The whole thing is pretty typical.<br />
<br />
&quot;and suddenly you turn it around so that Frodlin isn't the right Warrior class correspondent?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not sudden. Pumilo provided the link to the original thread over at MB, where I said the exact same things. And actually my opinion of Frodlin's merits as warrior correspondent have nothing to do with this debate, or topic. So yeah, the logic may seem odd, since it doesn't really apply. <br />
<br />
But since Frodlin decided to drop by to this thread and froth some more, it seemed like a nice time to point out to the warriors here where Frodlin's bias really is.<br />
<br />
It's not his anti-monk bias that clouds his judgement. Who cares that he hates monks? Monks certainly don't. And it doesn't affect warriors one bit, because as you all have done so well at pointing out, monks don't tank, it's not their job, and they won't ever tank.<br />
<br />
No, Frodlin't anti-monk bias, while cute, and somewhat entertaining, is really beside the point, when talking about his ability to correspond warrior interests.<br />
<br />
It's his KNIGHT TANK bias that should concern you all. Kadah hits it on the head perfectly. I merely provide some information to further illustrate where Frodlin's bias comes from. It's always been there. Throughout his posts. <br />
<br />
But you are right, it is odd in the context of this thread. And has nothing to do with the subject.<br />
<br />
So let me just set the record straight for this particular topic ...<br />
<br />
Wubao believes:<br />
<br />
- Monks should not tank anywhere close to warriors.<br />
- Monks should get changes to their class to help them pull.<br />
- Stuns happen all too frequently when people get hit from behind on the run.<br />
- The max hits problem that stems from monk mitigation penalty, leads to quite a few deaths being eaten by monks doing their job as pullers.<br />
- ANY CHANGE TO HELP WITH THIS is welcomed.<br />
- I think removing the penalty, and thus lowering the amount of max hits taken, will be a small help to monks who pull, saving them a couple of deaths over the course of time. It's not a huge change, or a huge help. But I never said it would be.<br />
- There are quite a few other issues monks have with their role as pullers. <br />
- All of this is best left to monks to talk about. Just like monks giving warriors advice on how best to tank, or what improvements warriors need for their class to tank better ... while the effort may be appreciated, the expertise is somewhat lacking. Monks know what's causing them problems on pulls and that's what they gripe about the most. Warriors know what causes them problems as tanks, and that's what they gripe about the most.<br />
<br />
Anyways ... Pumilo will obviously continue to troll this subject, as he gets quite a bit of enjoyment out of it. Which isn't that big a deal, as in the end, I fully expect this thread and the ones on MB to have absolutely NO impact on changes coming for monks in Omens of War.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I challenge you to prove this. Then it will seem a tad more reasonable to consider your demands. I suggest that you probably take hits like a leather class, which seems awfully reasonable considering you definitely avoid better than every other class.<br />
<br />
 Your avoidance is far more vital, because there should only be brief windows during any given pull that you even have a chance to be hit. This isn't always the case, of course, but simply put monks don't need more mitigation specifically to help them pull. If monks are dying too much on pulls, there are other suggestions that work equally as well to assist in that.</div></div><hr />

First off the role of the correspondent it to transmit information not serve as our spokesperson. If he is doing more than that than they need to change the job description and let people vote (or something similar) or he needs to be canned. <br />
<br />
But this ad hominom attack on him because he can see some merit in the pally issues is one of stupidest ways I have ever seen to deflect his comments regarding monk views. Attack the merit not the person. And guess what, I agree with him far more than you and low and behold I routinely run a monk, a warrior, and a paladin. My view is one of overall balance not warrior greater than all balance. I think Frod agrees with this but always in the context of making sure warriors have a distinct and valued role.<br />
<br />
I want my $2 (dps for my monk) and thats about it. But if you are gonna give me some more avoidance or some other disc to help pull then make it an o shit disc or maybe greater innate back stun resistance not mitigation.<br />
<br />
In short, raid pulling is not a reason for more mitigation IMHO (and everywhere else it aint that relevant as people die when they xp/grp, its a fact of life). In fact my chanter bites it quite often (pooka charming for example) as does my cleric when things go wrong and they draw the attention of 1K+ hitter. Give the monk more dps and better pull only tools (the back stun resistance would be useful for more than pulling but not really meaningful outside of pulling).<br />

You need good mitigation in order for avoidance to be usefull in.<br />
<br />
Last time i try to explain it:<br />
<br />
Mitigation = time till death. The better mitigation you have, the more time you have till you die as you can take more hits. More time means a higher chance of getting avoidance (Dodge, Parry, Riposte).<br />
<br />
Ok, lets say you can avoid 10% in one minute of hits. This would translate to 1 dodge/parry or riposte every 6 seconds. Live for 6 seconds and a dodge, parry or riposte might buy you another second for the healer to heal you.<br />
<br />
With good mitigation, you have a higher chance of surviving 6 seconds then if you had low mitigation. Any second below 6, greatly reduces your chance at avoidance.<br />
<br />
The usefullness of avoidance is dictated by the efficiency of your mitigation. Avoidance for all classes (Even monks) is too low and unreliable to turn this statement around.<br />
<br />
So in easy language: Mitigation &gt; Avoidance.<br />

http://www.grumpsrage.com/parses/monk 1854.JPG<br />
<br />
Ah we see the monks have past their softcaps in HoH and see rangers (chain) have a higher softcap in HoH. So? Chain beats leather. Warrior mitigation around 1800 AC is SUPERB, good job ;)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A mitigation repeal... what would this do... I will tell you.<br />
<br />
High end monks, won't see any difference, they need the softcaps removed to actually benefit from the repeal... So high end monks are screaming for this.<br />
<br />
Low end monks (those with 1250 AC or less) will reach the softcap faster as 1 point of AC increases in effectiveness.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brenlo has stated that monks will most likely see a repeal of the mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
Don't cry yet, he didn't say the softcaps will be altered. So basically a monk with 1900 AC won't see any difference after any repeal ;)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The softcaps are doing their job in setting heavy tanks apart from light tanks. Perhaps monks and rangers can both argue that the softcaps doesn't set light tanks apart from wimpy classes. They lose on the other arguement though in any perspective.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the softcap should be set lower for Beastlords and even lower for Druids. Perhaps the softcap for monks and rangers can be set a TEENY bit higher, but still with a significant difference between heavy tanks like warriors and knights.<br />
<br />
Frankly, high end monks are simply asking for the wrong things. <br />
<br />
- Is stun a problem on pulls? Ask for more stun resistance or a Stun Immunity AA.<br />
- Getting your arse raped frequently in GoD? Aks for a 2 minute reuse timer for your 12 second Stonestance disc, so you can use it more frequently.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I'm kinda fed up with class versus class discussions. I see people i respect, blow a fuse and say all the wrong things because they want to be right at any expense. I mean, what are we talking about here???<br />
<br />
Monks becomming tanks?<br />
<br />
Have warriors forgotten how much the aggro issue screwed them in the tanking role against knights? How inefficient they where without good aggro tools and not just procs?<br />
<br />
And you fear monks becomming good tanks? Monks who do not have any aggro tool other then procs?<br />
<br />
If that cleric or nuker gets aggro, there's nothing a monk can do about it and that gentlemen, is a fact. You've simply forgotten how much you sucked compared to knights during PoP. And monks now, suck more in the aggro department then Warriors did then.<br />
<br />
It's kinda funny seeing some warriors froth at the mouths over this, especially when you consider that SOE will never grant Monks a softcap removal. And do bare in mind... A mitigation repeal, does nothing for softcaps.<br />
<br />
Monks who are screaming for a softcap removal... To them i say, ask for other things please... Like more stun resistance or something...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering it wasn't designed to deflect his comments regarding monk views, I fail to see what your point is.<br />
<br />
The attack is designed to do exactly what I state it is designed to do. Give you further information on where your correspondent's loyalty is. He's always leaned towards knight tanks. Since the beginning. You can see it in all of his posts. Even at the height of the warrior stand-down, Frodlin kept trying to tell warriors it wasn't &quot;as bad&quot; as the warriors knew it was.<br />
<br />
That's your correspondent folks. He wants knights to tank as well as warriors.<br />
<br />
Like he said about monks and mitigation, &quot;If there's something he can do about it&quot; ... he will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Attack the merit not the person.&quot;<br />
<br />
His merits got attacked enough over the years. Case in point, when he stuck up for paladins in the early days of Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
But as a correspondent, and a correspondent who says the biased things he says, he leaves himself open for attack. Attacks that a low down dirty monk like me has no qualms taking. Because I'm a monk. And I kick puppies too.</div></div><hr />

You need good mitigation in order for avoidance to be usefull in.<br />
<br />
No. You don't. In fact, the more mitigation you have, the less useful avoidance becomes, as I've already shown.<br />
<br />
Last time i try to explain it:<br />
<br />
Mitigation = time till death. The better mitigation you have, the more time you have till you die as you can take more hits. More time means a higher chance of getting avoidance (Dodge, Parry, Riposte).<br />
<br />
Avoidance does the same thing, except instead of taking more mitigated hits, you avoid more full damage hits. Same thing, just a different way of doing it.<br />
<br />
Ok, lets say you can avoid 10% in one minute of hits. This would translate to 1 dodge/parry or riposte every 6 seconds. Live for 6 seconds and a dodge, parry or riposte might buy you another second for the healer to heal you.<br />
<br />
With good mitigation, you have a higher chance of surviving 6 seconds then if you had low mitigation. Any second below 6, greatly reduces your chance at avoidance.<br />
<br />
The usefullness of avoidance is dictated by the efficiency of your mitigation. Avoidance for all classes (Even monks) is too low and unreliable to turn this statement around.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is... just in the opposite way that you think. It doesn't get MORE efficient the more mitigation you have, it becomes LESS efficient.<br />
<br />
I'll show you one last time. With hard numbers.<br />
<br />
Say you mitigate nothing. 100 hits of 100. With zero avoidance, you take 10,000 damage.<br />
<br />
With 50% avoidance you take 5000 damage.<br />
<br />
Mitigate 50%: you take 5000 damage<br />
<br />
Mitigation 50% PLUS avoidance 50%, you take 2500 damage.<br />
<br />
In other words, avoidance saves you FIVE THOUSAND damage if you have no mitigation, but the same amount of avoidance only saves you HALF that if you have high mitigation.<br />
<br />
The math proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt... the more mitigation you have, the less useful avoidance becomes in absolute terms.  The same is true if avoidance and mitigation is reversed.<br />
<br />
The more you have of EITHER avoidance or mitigation, the less useful the other becomes.<br />
<br />
The only thing that can really be said is that both mitigation and avoidance together mean you take less damage than by either alone. HOWEVER, 25% mitigation and 25% avoidance is never as efficient as 50% of one or the other. 50% of avoidance will reduce 50% damage, while 25% mitigation and 25% avoidance will at best only reduce damage by 43.75%.<br />
<br />
So in easy language: Mitigation &gt; Avoidance.<br />
<br />
Other way around, as I've already shown by proving how avoidance actually means you take LESS damage than equivalent mitigation. alwqays taking DB damage with mitigation and not with avoidance, and all that.<br />
<br />
What you seem to be confused with and arguing about, is the concept that having more mitigation and avoidance makes you a better tank. Of course that's true. But that has nothing to do with the efficiency of either ability. All it means is that yes, of course, if you have good mitigation and avoidance, you are a better tank AS A WHOLE. You're erroneously attributing the fact as being a better tank as a whole, and saying that that means mitigation or avoidance is more efficient... they're not, in fact the two abilities are not complementary, as in work togeher well. They don't... the two abilities are mutually exclusive in terms of what they do, you can't have the beneifit of one or the other on the same hit, for example, it MUST be one or the other. That whole mutually exclusive bit means that the more benefit you gain from one, the less benefit you MUST gain from the other, due to the very nature of how they work. A hit can be avoided, or it can be mitigated, but it cannot BOTH be avoided and mitigated; so if you have say 50% avoidance, mitigation can only work half the time, whereas if you have no avoidance, mitigation goes to work on each and every hit. Of course, you're gaining a hell of a lot more from that mitigation if it's working on every single attack against you, instead of only half of them.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you don't understand that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Superchum<br />
<br />
Let's take these one at a time:<br />
<br />
<br />
Remeber ... Frodlin was the one that tried to stick up for Paladins getting a defensive.<br />
<br />
Something I don't deny, a position which has changed witht he changing of GoD content and something I still defend as inherently logical at the time, yet outdated at this time.   <br />
<br />
Remeber ... Frodlin's son plays/played a paladin.<br />
<br />
So does Battleblade.  Hell I have a 65 Paladin.  <br />
<br />
Remember ... Frodlin let his son moderate the warrior serverwide chat channel.<br />
<br />
Hey, glad you don't know your ass from a hole in the ground.  I never owned TSW channel, nor did I ever make anyone a mod, nor did I ever request that anyone be made a mod.  You got a problem with him modding the channel, take it up with Dima, not me.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, it was his rogue that was the mod (something incidentally, on SW channel, you dont' see happenning, because I dont' allow mod bullshit on that channel, nor do I allow interclass mods, see the charter), not the Paladin.<br />
<br />
<br />
He IS biased. And you warriors should question where his loyalty towards warriors really stands, if he's going to be your correspondent. He may know a LOT about warriors, and a LOT about EQ. But if his interests aren't YOUR interests ... he's not helping your class as much as someone else could.<br />
<br />
Superchum,<br />
<br />
I'm going to be nice here and not lay into you the way that's appropriate, and that you deserve.<br />
<br />
You're infuriated that I dare point out that monk issues are nowhere near as bad as you say they are, and that I have the guts to call you on the BS of &quot;oh we only want it to pull&quot;.   Therefore you want to carry on a little crusade.  I got news for ya, it ain't gonna work.  There's a few reasons for that.<br />
<br />
First, I got a long, long, long, long history of fighting on behalf of warriors.   Can't erase the history there boyo.   Second, go mosey on over to the Paladin Definition section on the Sony boards.  There's 2 warriors there dukin it out.... and I'm one of em.   It's hard to claim that I'm biased toward Paladins, when I'm the one over there trying to knock some sense into their heads, and a number of em dislike me for it.  <br />
<br />
Third, if the best &quot;dirt&quot; you can come up with is that my kid once played a Paladin and that Dima let him mod a channel that I never requested, nor had any power to authorize.... you're grasping for straws.<br />
<br />
Now, back to planet earth.<br />
<br />
If getting hit from behind and being stunned is such an issue (it really isn't, that's just the convenient argument of the week), then why not ask for increased mitigation from the rear speicifically, and rear facing stun resist?   I mean warriors have Stalwart Endurance, which grants us frontal only stun resist.  <br />
<br />
The answer is..... sitting down?  Because it's not about pulling.  If it were about pulling, then a couple hits for 700 wouldn't be a big deal on a 5-7khp monk with mend and earthwalk/stonestance usable every 3 mins.<br />
<br />
Particularly true is the fact that you are exaggerating how often you're hit for max damage.   It's NOT &quot;most likely&quot;, as a matter of fact, it's no more often than one out of every 10 hits that actually land.   Furthermore, mobs in Sol Ro Temple cant' outrun Runspeed 5.  Hell, Kyvs can't really outrun it, and they're WAY faster than &quot;A Guardian of Ro'.<br />
<br />
Nope, again, this is all about tanking.   If it's not, then I want you to point out the clamor for rear facing stun resist and added mitigation from the rear.  Just stop denying it, for the love of god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;First, I got a long, long, long, long history of fighting on behalf of warriors. Can't erase the history there boyo. &quot;<br />
<br />
You always take that tact when this is brought up Frodlin. You always try to shrug off your long, long, LONG history of sticking up for paladins. You fought for warriors? Hardly. You fought against warriors. You tried to point out to them time and time again that it wasn't as bad as they were saying it was. You tried to say it wasn't as big a deal as they made it out to be. And you still do that.<br />
<br />
Your relationships with paladins is just to underscore where your bias comes from. Your own posts, your own words are where it shines through. You do more damage on your own than I could ever do. I just like to keep it all in perspective from time to time. Point out to people who may be confused as to why their correspondent leans so heavily towards knight tanks WHERE this comes from.<br />
<br />
Nothing I've said was incorrect. You did stick up for paladins early on in GoD. Your son does play and post as a paladin. You did stick up for him modding TSW channel quite a few times. And you yourself have modded the channel.<br />
<br />
It's pretty good dirt, when put in the context of how often you tell warriors that &quot;it's not that bad&quot; ... or how often you talk about how knights should be able to tank.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back to your frothings regarding monks ...<br />
<br />
&quot;then why not ask for increased mitigation from the rear speicifically, and rear facing stun resist? I mean warriors have Stalwart Endurance, which grants us frontal only stun resist. &quot;<br />
<br />
You really should just stop now, while you're this far behind. Because your lack of familiarity with monks, monk issues and monk posts is staggeringly obvious to ... MONKS.<br />
<br />
You say &quot;Why not ask for X?&quot;<br />
<br />
I point out we HAVE asked for X, and we got X as an AA in Gates.<br />
<br />
You now say, &quot;Why not ask for Y?&quot;<br />
<br />
If you haven't figure it out this far into my post ... guess what ... WE HAVE ASKED FOR JUST THAT.<br />
<br />
Again, your lack of familiarty with the monk class, its role and its issues just demonstrates that you really shouldn't talk much about monks. Your bias is all that drives you. The bias that prompted you to froth and foam at the mouth months ago, and rant about Luclin era, and totally mis-read Thep's parses. The bias that prompted you to type that you'll continue to fight against monk improvements as long &quot;there's something I can do about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each time you bring up monk issues, you just demonstrate that you're fueled by the bias and have no actual clue about what monks ARE asking for, or bugging SOE for.<br />
<br />
It would be better off for you to just go back to sticking up for Paladin defensive. At least there, you're far better acquainted with the classes involved.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for warriors in general though. Eventually your bias is going to work against them. And the class a whole is going to suffer. Thankfully it's your complete lack of understanding regarding the monk class that makes your anti-monk bias nothing more than pure entertainment.</div></div><hr />

Certainly not chum, only thing he is good for is fishbait :)<br />
<br />
So let me get this straight, you want get out jail AAs, a hell of a lot more DPS, stun resists (both back and front), mitigation, etc., etc.<br />
<br />
WHAT THE FUCK DONT YOU WANT?  How about a cookie while you are at it? Or maybe CH (well how about a 10K instant cast spammable fast heal instead, that way you could heal while pulling), 95% unresistable slow (would help pulling), and a boss mob 10 min stun (that way you could split boss mobs that have adds with them, take care of the adds, and come back to take the boss, after restunning him of course) while you are at it?<br />
<br />
You my friend make all the paladins/sks look stoic (i.e. you whine too much) and incredibly insightful.<br />

395,000 posts on mitigation and a couple here and there about pulling tools is hardly &quot;asking&quot; in even remotely the same ballpark.<br />
<br />
Fact is you don't need to mitigate like warriors or knights.  Fact is you have an avoidance advantage from both the front of mobs and from the rear.   Hell, even you said you think monks should be on &quot;plate mitigation table&quot;.   Sorry pal, you're wrong.   <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and by the way... get your stories straight.  When I opposed continuing with the stand down, I did so because an announcement and a date had been given on the melee changes that happenned.   Had nothing to do with &quot;We're fine&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Through the miracle of archived posts, I found it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously,<br />
<br />
You'll look like a bunch of jackasses if you do the standdown now knowing that the stuff is changing... put it off for now.<br />
<br />
So... BZZZT!  Superchump gets another wrong.... <br />
<br />
Give up block, and I'll be happy to see you get a mitigation change.</div></div><hr />

Nowhere did I mention your position during the stand-down in this thread. Where are you getting all of this stuff about the stand-down? I was stating that  your position regarding every debate between warriors and paladins on these boards always comes back to you siding with the paladins, telling your brother warriors it's not that big a deal.

No ... it should be THIS comment you made:<br />

&quot;Aggro is such a pathetic argument in the world of WA5&quot;<br />
<br />
To say that, on The Steel Warrior ... to say that to your fellow warriors ... well, you should be pretty much ashamed of every enraging blow proc you ever relied on in your career. Every failed taunt you ever had to deal with.<br />

Of course, you won't be. Because you just don't have much warrior left in you.</div></div><hr />

So, either one of two things have to happen to rebalance the situation. Warriors have to be enabled to generate some hatred early in a fight, or knight hate generation needs to be scaled back so that there's a roughly equal difference in mitigation to hate generation.<br />
<br />
Regarding the various positions of people regarding aggro, including mine:<br />
<br />
The general consensus that I've seen is basically this:<br />
<br />
The Warrior vs Knight aggro generation gap is too large in relation to the warrior and knight durability gap.<br />
<br />
Some people, such as Phantron, etc. believe strongly that the &quot;standard&quot; should be a lot closer to current warrior aggro generation than current knight aggro generation. In essence, that knights' aggro generation should be toned way down, or that there be some significant tradeoff in terms of medding time to maintain the level of aggro generation which they enjoy. Their position is that the easier it becomes to maintain aggro on a tank, the more boring and rote this game becomes and the less skilled people have to be to play it.<br />
<br />
Other people on the other hand, desiring not to see another class get nerfed, think that raising the level of aggro generation to closer to that of knights than it currently is is the answer. <br />
<br />
There's a 3rd group who believes that the key to this is to increase the &quot;durability spread&quot; between warrior and knight to a noticeable level making groups choose between the *obvious* (i.e. not theoretical, but noticeably) better &quot;tank&quot; and the one better at aggro control. <br />
<br />
I tend to fall in line in a small way with the #2 group, but with a spin. I think that the problem with aggro generation has been identified as being something that happens early in fights in PoP, where a slow cast or resisted can mean a splatted shaman or enchanter, or a heal can mean a splatted cleric.<br />
<br />
I believe pretty strongly that once that has been identified as the issue, then solutions can be brought up to compensate or deal with it. For instance... I personally have proposed the &quot;hate arrows&quot;.... fletched arrows which add a specific numerical amount of hate, but through a non-stackable &quot;debuff&quot; that leaves an icon similar to Donal's BP (Ranged attack means it's limited to a range, and can't be used during normal combat with any efficiency, and the &quot;icon&quot; meaning that it cannot have an additive effect whereas a warrior kites a mob around with a few arrows ensuring &quot;aggro lock&quot;). Others have proposed &quot;skills&quot; such as hurling insults which do essentially the same thing. <br />
<br />
In either case, most of the objections raised are accounted for. Does it trivialize high end raid encounters? Nope, not unless you have been doing high end encounters without figuring out how to do aggro transfer pulls through the use of weaponshield, which is signficantly superior to any of the proposed methods. Does it make warrior &quot;taunt&quot; too strong? Nope, it simply adds a single tool to assist in generating aggro where it's needed. Not assuming someone else's aggro such as in the taunt skill, but generating some of your own. Finally, if done through reagent itemization (such as hate arrows), it's available to all for a small price, and doesn't rely on AA points spent or anything like that.<br />
<br />
I also tend to agree with many of those who have spoken here that making taunt *too* reliable would certainly make my playtime boring, and I wouldn't want to have it so easy. On the other hand, I also don't think i want to see the spread between knight and Warrior in terms of the aggro gap be as glaring as it is today.<br />
<br />
Again, in terms of Aggro<br />
<br />
Come up with all you want, taunt is 100% broken. The REASON that it's 100% broken is because of the *MINIMAL* difference in tankability between warriors and knights.<br />
<br />
There is *NO* additional downtime with knights tanking... none at all. What's worse, there's many guild who are using Paladins almost EXCLUSIVELY as raid level tanks, because... you guessed it.. aggro. Not on wuss mobs, on elemental bosses, because... you guessed it, the aggro gap is FLAT OUT busted. There is a mere handful of mobs that a warrior tanks better than a Paladin because of aggro control.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you... what's harder to maintain... a 1 second shorter complete heal rotation, or sustained losses of people, or even the fear that it'll happen? <br />
<br />
SoE has destroyed the warrior class by beefing up Knights' ability to tank *without noticeable cost*... because of a number of different factors:<br />
<br />
- Voice of Quellious (Or KEI if you're lower)<br />
- Flowing Thought<br />
- Knight gear with almost identical AC/Hitpoints as Warrior only armor, but with a HUGE increase in mana pools to go along with it.<br />
- The addition of multiple high aggro spells into the game with no corresponding increase in warrior's ability to generate aggro on their own.<br />
<br />
Yes, I used to say &quot;taunt sucks&quot;, but it's FAR worse than that now... it's unworkable. SOE has ignored warriors for FAR too long, they have let us sink into oblivion, and quite frankly, they speak of &quot;giving melee a DPS upgrade&quot;... they can take that DPS upgrade and shove it up their behinds if they're not going to fix what's totally broken.<br />
<br />
The only solution at this point is to have a SERIOUS look at Knights and their ability to take damage or our ability to generate aggro.<br />
<br />
There MUST be a tradeoff, and there currently isn't.<br />
<br />
The initial LDoN report:<br />
<br />
There's a couple more &quot;class balancing&quot; concerns that I currently have. <br />
<br />
The first has to do with mobs low avoidance skills. I spent a bunch of AA's in &quot;Tactical Mastery&quot;, and in LDoN it seems to be going for naught, as mobs have relatively pathetic avoidance skills, reducing a nice advantage I've had in tanking DPS.<br />
<br />
The second has to do with Undead and SU3. I'm sorry but it is simply wrong for 2/3 of an expansion to undo what warriors have had as one of the sole things that separates them from their Paladin cousins, which is a DPS advantage, particularly while tanking. If mobs have low avoidance, mitigating the effectiveness of Tactical Mastery, and at the same time, a preponderance of Undead, playing to the strengths of Slay Undead 3, then I have a problem with it, as there's no &quot;warrior friendly&quot; alternative. <br />
<br />
Just prior to the release of PoP, there was the whole proposed Slay Undead change, and this I fear is the reason they were considering implementing it, it had nothing to do with PoP but with THIS expansion, and had I KNOWN that there would be a situation like this in advance, I probably wouldn't have supported the positions of paladins at the time, where there would be no tanking advantage AND no DPS advantage, while there still being a major aggro advantage.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could keep going, but this forum has provided a very user friendly &quot;search&quot; function.   The reason you're not using it is because you know that you'll find me SOLIDLY in the camp of those who felt aggro was broken.   This goes back to WAY before anyone was talking about it, back to the original thread of &quot;The State of Warriors in EQ&quot; which started the revolution, which..... I started.   It goes back to the &quot;8% success rate&quot; taunt tests that *I* did, and posted on the FoH forums.   It keeps going... and going... and going... and going.<br />
<br />
<br />
I argued quite strongly on behalf on Knights in early GoD.    Great!   No one denies that, least of all me.   I felt that it would be best to equip them with the skills to tank the mobs as they were at the time.    Sony disagreed with me... guess what!  They were right, I was wrong, wonderful!    At this point, you'll find me arguing quite stongly AGAINST the knight position after the content fix in GoD.    As a matter of fact... have a look for yourself... who was it that brought the OOW stun issue to the forefront?   Was it you?   Nope, it was me.   <br />
<br />
But that's neither here nor there, because you are bringing this up because you're pissed off at me for being vociferous against monks' exaggerated claims.    <br />
<br />
In other words, you dont' give a shit about warriors, or who's representing them, you've said so yourself over on MB, when you're howling like an injured dog over our upcoming knockback AA, because we might *gasp* be instrumental in positioning mobs.    You have a vendetta and are grasping at straws and pulling accusations *without any basis in reality* and without any evidence whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you something... if you were so damned wrong about my position during the standdown....which you were.    And the facts are RIGHT THERE at your fingertips, with the search function that you used to find someone else's post... and you're avoiding using it, because you know that your portraying of my position of wariror aggro isues (when I am the person who brought them to the forefront in the first place) is a stinking pile of horse manure, and it's INTENTIONAL to try to get your way.<br />
<br />
How is anyone supposed to believe that you want increased mitigation &quot;just for pulling&quot;?<br />
<br />
because you say so and you're so honest?</div></div><hr />

Try and cover it up as much as you want. But when the heat really got hot back in those days, you always backed down. And told warriors it wasn't as bad as it seemed. And said that things were still ok. You always stuck up for knight tanks. And you still do.<br />
<br />
It compromises your particular position, because, you don't put warrior interests at the forefront. You keep knight tanks invovled in the mix. And when those two things come into conflict, who's to say you won't do to warriors what you do to monks? You know, as long as there's something YOU as correspondent can DO about it ... who's to say you won't present information to Sony in such a biased manner as to make it NOT seem like it's a big deal to warriors.<br />
<br />
You admit you're biased. Your actions and your words show how biased you are. And you're their correspondent. The warrior correspondent. The warrior correspondent who thinks that paladins should get defensive ... who thinks hybrids should be capable tanks ... who thinks warriors didn't have it that bad.<br />
<br />
Someday, the warriors who depend on you to take their interests to sony are going to get burned by putting their trust in you.</div></div><hr />

As an FYI:  I'm the warrior class correspondent, it's not a position I was &quot;elected&quot; to, although there was quite a significant push to have me take it, which is what caused me to decide to take it.   No monk who's mad over my position on monks is going to change that.<br />
<br />
Coming on here and trying to cause dissention among warriors is laughable, when you're only doing it because I want to protect warriors' advantage in tanking over monks.   <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, by the way... I want to protect knights from you monks becoming too good of tanks too... /wink</div></div><hr />

He was solidly for it, I was solidly against it.  However, during PoP I have to concede we were in complete agreement that aggro for Warriors was broken.

<br />
Can you back up anything you say with modern  quotes or facts?  Or do you only rehash old, long dead, and irrelevent discussions?  You dig up almost year old threads, and six month old topics, in order to try to discredit people, and you never put them into context.<br />
<br />
I'm going to say that quite frankly, I agree with whatever notion indicates that monks are as sub-par tanks as it gets anyway.  Number crunching, insults, inane reasonings aside, let's look at the very simple difference between monks and other classes:<br />
<br />
What do you wear as a monk?<br />
<br />
Nothing.  You wear a few straps of leather, to the other melees' chains and plate...they're going to take hits better than you...sorry.  However what makes sense and *does* occur is that you have a very high chance to avoid, and avoidance should be the basis of your defensive arguements.<br />
<br />
Mitigation doesn't help you nearly as much in the short run - where defensive abilities during pulling is a necessity - as it would in the long run.  And if you're in a situation where if you're getting hit you generally speaking need to FD fast, the mitigation's ability to aid you doesn't really show or shine.  Your ability to avoid the 2500s is far more impressive in the short term than your ability to get hit for 2000s.  <br />
<br />
The only thing you could possibly desire out of a mitigation enhancement is the ability to substantially tank, a role that is already in serious question by three other classes, and is very difficult to balance, not to mention one you were never intended to do.  So why do you want it so badly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, time will tell warriors. When you get screwed over by this compromise that is Frodlin, however, it will be quite enjoyable to laugh and say I told you so. It's your interests  he's supposed to take to sony. It's your interests that he filters through his biased point of view.<br />
<br />
Reap what you sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's pretty profound actually... since it's pretty well known that Glatius and I have had a fairly major falling out over a couple of issues.  It's pretty classy of someone who doesnt' like me to stick up for me nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
Thanks Glatius<br />
<br />
And Superchum....<br />
<br />
I filter nothing.  I disagree with about 4 of the warrior &quot;top ten&quot; issues as they stand, yet I pass them along anyhow.  As a matter of fact, I STRONGLY disagree with a lot of the &quot;casual warrior list&quot; that I put through.   <br />
<br />
Go have a look at the warrior definition board and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
I'm lilly white when it comes to keeping biases out of my passing along of information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you want to know where all of my recent hate stems from, Frodlin, it's having to have to read this, MONTHS after you posted it ...<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll never forget that shit. I'll never allow it to return, ever as long as there's something I can do about it. &quot;<br />
<br />
That's not really very becoming a class correspondent. No matter how you feel about monks or warriors or knights or anything, you shouldn't be threatening to use whatever power you have or don't have in such a biased manner.<br />
<br />
I quit EQ back in March. I don't play a monk. I don't play a warrior. I don't even play the game anymore.<br />
<br />
But you still do. And you shouldn't post things like that. I'll eventually get around to digging through tons of old threads. I'll find the post I'm thinking about when I remember you saying it wasn't all that bad. But that's only because I'll eventually find the time to dig through old threads. It won't really matter. It won't really prove anything.<br />
<br />
In the end though, you should choose your words a lot more carefully. The hate that came through in that particular thread should have been kept hidden a lot better. You do represent the warrior class in some fashion. Like it or not, you are a bit of a diplomat. You shouldn't be trying to cause any class, monk or whoever, to get that pissed off at you.<br />
<br />
It pissed me off, because I alwasy expected you to be better than that.<br />
<br />
Which is where the attacks are coming from. I admit, I'm not better than that. I never was. I'm petty. I AM a monk. I do kick puppies. Everyone knows I'm evil.<br />
<br />
You used to be the good guy though Frodlin.<br />
<br />
Till I read stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Now I'm left thinking ... if Frodlin says that about monks ... what happens when the next big conflict comes up?<br />
<br />
And I shouldn't have to think that about a class correspondent. (And more to the point, I shouldn't have to think that about YOU, the last person I ever expected to come off like that).<br />
<br />
Anyways ... like I said, time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Superchum,<br />
<br />
Look at the date on that post that you refer to.  I wasn't a correspondent when I wrote that post.  I was &quot;regular joe schmoe&quot;.    As &quot;regular Joe Schmoe&quot; I am able to and allowed to say anything I want.    Heck, I don't even think that the correspondent position existed at the time of the post.  Wait one sec... checking....<br />
<br />
I was given the position on July 16th of this year.<br />
<br />
Kilanu was given it roughly the First of July this year.<br />
<br />
The post you cite was written on May 5th of this year, two months before the class correspondent program even began.<br />
<br />
You cannot possibly be seriously holding me to statements I made BEFORE becoming a correspondent to being &quot;unbecoming a corespondent&quot; can you?  I mean that's fairly illogical isn't it?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the thing that I was pissed about, if you read the context in which it was written was that monstrosity that began every single warrior issue to this day, the Cazic Thule Revamp when it went live.    That was the darkest day in the history of the warrior class.  It took TWO FULL MONTHS to get the taunt skill, as pathetic as it was turned on in that zone.   The lizards were completely immune to our epic proc which was the only realistic hate proc in EQ available to most warriors at the time.  That's what I was taking about, it wasn't about monks tanking it, but that WAS a problem too.   I grouped with and had to sit there and let monks tank every single day, day in and day out for two months whenever not raiding, because I had *zero* aggro options in that zone.  Melee aggro was all there was.   It's where the Paladin/SK aggro issue began.  Everything that was wrong with warriors at the end of PoP and beginning of LDoN started in those dark days of the initial revamp of Cazic Thule.</div></div><hr />

I've no fucking clue how Frodlin's posts on Warrior/Knight issues have anything at all to deal with Monks wanting more mitigation. However, if you just wanted to prove that you're an attention whore, you've succeeded.</div></div><hr />

Wu's not really an attention whore, but he's kinda stubborn, and lately he's picked a couple of really bad points to argue, which result in him looking really bad a few pages later as he genuinely tries to come up with different ways to phrase his argument to people who don't follow the same logic he is.  <br />
<br />
A couple of times tho, his logic is flawed, and then bad stuff happens from there on out.  Monks shouldn't be mitigating shit.  When they get hit, fuckin bones should break because there's nothing standing between them and fist.  Monks just spent a lot of time on the top, riding the coattails of the fungi tunic and an easy epic, so a lot of them  have a hard time believing that they weren't designed to be gods from the outset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks aren't asking to tank.  Liper/Pumilo is just blatently full-of-shit when he comes back here saying he's reading that on the MB boards.  He's equally as full-of-shit when he comes back here quoting that monk are 'wanting to tank like a warrior of equal AC'.  Nobody at MB has said this.<br />
<br />
I, myself, have said on MB that I believe that a monk with 1800 ac should take a hit like a 1800 ac warrior (minus the innate bonus you warriors get), or an 1800 ac paladin, or an 1800 ac rogue, or even an 1800 ac wizard if that were possible.<br />
<br />
It's been said time-and-time again that with today's itemization there's NO WAY that a monk can come close ANY of the plate tanks ac-wise given access to the same content.  For example, look at eqrankings.com.   Take the example of 1800 ac.  For a monk, you begin hitting AC's in the 1800's on the VERY FIRST page.  That's server wide.... .only 44 monks registered have AC better than 1899.  Look at warriors now.  You have to go back 13 pages.... over 1300 entries before you get a warrior below 1900 AC.<br />
<br />
So us asking for our AC to mean the same as a warriors, or anyone elses for that matter, is just what it says.  If I upgrade my BP and it's 30 AC more.... it should give me the same benefit as if a warrior upgrades his BP to be 30 AC more.  Unfortunately, an upgrade of this benefit is near impossible for monks in the first place.  Which results in me, participating in the same content as you, getting a BP that's 1/4 of the AC that you get, and getting less benefit from that AC point-for-point than you do.  It's an itemization penalty (which I completely agree with, leather &lt; chain &lt; plate), stacked on top of a mitigation nerf (which as I've just stated, is no longer needed).  <br />
<br />
The other point I'd like to bring up is the whole leather / chain / plate realism idea.<br />
Many of the responses here state something to the effect of &quot;You shouldn't mitigate shit, you're wearing leather straps&quot;.  While I understand the sentiment of this, it's based on a misguided conception that ANY of this is supposed to be grounded in reality.  This is a fantasy game where magic is a reality.  My Abysmal armor, while looking like straps, is certainly more durable than say..... a Fine Steel Breastplate.  So for that matter, is a caster's Abysmal armor.   Taken to extremes, if 5 expansions from now a wizard manages to get 1800AC while decked out in all the top-of-the-line gear from that expansion, he should be able to take a hit like a bazaar-geared warrior from 6 expansions ago.<br />
<br />
The thing that frustrates me, is that I can put on an item like a PSC, and get less benefit from it than say a Paladin does.  Now how is it, that me with my body trained to the pinnacle of perfection, can put on the EXACT SAME magical bug-back as said Paladin, and get hit for more while wearing it.<br />
<br />
Very few monks were ever the &quot;GODS&quot; that a lot of you make them out to be.  I certainly never was.  I never tanked ANYTHING when there was any sort of plate tank around.  I went to bed one night being able to fight a dark blue cat in SD and needing a couple Sup Heals to finish it off if I was lucky or maybe a CH if I wasn't.  I woke the next morning and needed two CH's to do the same thing, guaranteed every time.  All the bitching and complaining about monks being 'overpowered'?  Never made a bit of sense to me, and makes even less sense to me now.<br />
<br />
I'm at 1200 or so AC, at level 64.  And sometimes I can't manage to get back to the group I'm pulling for without dying.  And that's with ONE mob on my tail in a hard LDON. God forbid I get more than one.  And these are even-cons or yellows.<br />
<br />
I'd love more mitigation, and more avoidance.  Anything to make me less of a paper tiger.  Will this maybe make me able to 'tank'?  I doubt it.  I can't hold aggro for shit.  I've tried GETTING aggro from a warrior since I started debating this over at MB.  Last night I popped Inner Flame, parsed at 180DPS, and the mob popped onto me for ONE HIT, before immediately turning back onto the warrior.  Of course that one hit was for 544.  LOL.<br />
<br />
Given content of the same level, nobody in their right mind would ever choose me over a plate tank, or even a ranger.  <br />
<br />
 - less hp<br />
 - less ac<br />
 - no taunt button<br />
 - no snap-aggro capability<br />
<br />
This is why I fail to understand how Liper is so convinced that the fix of monk mitigation will put him and all the other plate tanks out of a job.</div></div><hr />

Now, imagine Player A that has 58.9% avoidance and is hit for 45% of max on average. Player B has 51.5% avoidance and is hit for 28.9% of max. These values for avoidance and mitigation are taken directly from Broda Thep's now famous parsing thread and represent the Time geared Monk and the Time geared Warrior, respectively. Now lets compare the damage per swing for both Player A and Player B in the above areas. <br />
<br />
The Deep:<br />
Player A = 38.95 damage per swing<br />
Player B = 37.64 damage per swing<br />
<br />
Crematory Sewers:<br />
Player A = 150.06 damage per swing<br />
Player B = 139.33 damage per swing<br />
<br />
Purifying Plant Sewers:<br />
Player A = 245.49 damage per swing<br />
Player B = 220.12 damage per swing</div></div><hr />

If you can explain to me why any melee should mitigate more damage than THE tank class, then I'll start in on your &quot;discrepency.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although realistically 5 of that won't ever be done (Hi sheild) so obviously Warriors can out avoid (some) Monks. However at NO time can a monk out mitigate you. Please defend this discrepency. <br />
<br />
Psst, I'll let you in on a secret.  With enough of a gear advantage a Ranger can out mitigate a Warrior.  Hell, so can a Cleric with enough of a gear advantage.  Top end Knights often have more HP than average Warriors.  And you expect us to be concerned about the fact that there might be a few Warriors who have gotten enough avoidance gear that they might, possibly, completely assuming for the sake of arguement because it's not been proven, out avoid an average Monk?  Please, cry me a river.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The premise is flawed anyhow, because even with + avoidance, it doesnt' compensate for the difference between block and parry.    So a warrior with +57 avoidance.... wont' out avoid a monk with none.    There has never in the history of Everquest been a single parse ever showing a warrior out avoiding a monk unless using evasive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'wanting to tank like a warrior of equal AC' <br />
<br />
I was going to post something from the board that said monks just need mitigation to improve thier ability to tank but you did this one for me with...<br />
<br />
...I believe that a monk with 1800 ac should take a hit like a 1800 ac warrior...  <br />
<br />
Here's the biggest flaw with every monk argument.  Your asking for something that might work in DnD but has NO BASIS in EQs combat system.<br />
<br />
It's been said time-and-time again that with today's itemization there's NO WAY that a monk can come close ANY of the plate tanks ac-wise given access to the same content<br />
<br />
true, but having your AC mean the same thing as a tanks AC is too much in the current system.  I've proven how giving a monk ac in thepps parse the same effect as a SKs AC in thepps parse is disastreous.  That the monk per swing takes .5 more... despite the warriors &quot;ac gap&quot;  This is same content, both the monk and the warrior in that parse were at similiar stages in time.  <br />
<br />
The monk reply to that?  oh factor out the avoidance and everything and there still is a reasonable gap, the thing is you can't and still keep a reasonable argument to bring to the devs.<br />
<br />
It's an itemization penalty  <br />
<br />
Or is it a balancing factor?  you do realise you have more utility then a warrior does right? and more dps... or are those things you want to forget about when talking about balance....<br />
<br />
it's based on a misguided conception that ANY of this is supposed to be grounded in reality <br />
<br />
Okay so you'll avoid arguments based in real life logic such as this?<br />
<br />
is that I can put on an item like a PSC, and get less benefit from it than say a Paladin does. <br />
<br />
0h n0s things don't follow what you'd expect them to be, like real world would!  Sorry if a paladin uses his armour more effectively then a monk does who avoids damage....  actually hell applying logic like you want to, the monk would be worse in a PSC just because it restricts his movments which is key for him to avoid damage and do more dps.<br />
<br />
This is why I fail to understand how Liper is so convinced that the fix of monk mitigation will put him and all the other plate tanks out of a job <br />
<br />
it's not going to put me out of a job, what will it do for SKs and Paladins? ...<br />
oh yeah that's right you'd be doing 70% more DPS then them have the same healing ratios in a normal exp group... which in EXP groups the biggest factor is how fast can you kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arlakisd</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass because you who's &quot;Role&quot; to tank can (With gear) replace another class in their &quot;Role&quot; namely monks in DPS. Now Since We KNOW SOE is unlikely to &quot;Increase&quot; Monk DPS it's only fair that a PoTime Warrior Do the DPS of At most a Velious Monk. Since a Monk in Time gear can not take a hit like a Velious warrior No matter what the gear. <br />
This is fair Yes No?<br />
<br />
If it's not then you accept that a Highly geared person should be able to Cross his Role lines. If you don't agree then well warriors DPS needs to be dropped in ways that would make pallies cringe. Or You believe warriors should be the best of all worlds. &lt;Grin&gt; <br />
Personally I think monk mitigation being returned isn't going to do shit for the class. But it might help some with the perception problem that does plague monks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second of all, I don't give 2 fucking shits about my DPS.  Don't fucking come here and talk about DPS when I see 17/20 monk weapons linked in the bazaar channel for 10k, while most warriors are walking around with 13/20 and 12/19.  If you've got issues with the plane of time weapons, address those weapons, don't broadly generalize that all warriors can even come close to your DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jat5</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I've seen several misrepresentations and distortions.<br />
<br />
The phrase equal ac.. A druid with the same displayed ac will out mitigate a monk because the 200+ ac bonus given to monks means druids must have more worn ac to match displayed ac totals.. So the first thing anyone must do is account for equal ac.<br />
<br />
200 ac, last I read, was equivalent to about 10% mitigation ac? Dunno exactly but it might be worth checking on. Thats also around enough to shift modal hits to +2*DI from a knights mitigation.<br />
<br />
Block vs. parry. As noted before, defensive skill checks are made before hit / miss checks. Now, say all other skills are equal, block is 6% more effective than parry, so 100 swings at a plate tank equals 94 swings on a monk to be checked for hit / miss. <br />
<br />
Now, mitigation is fairly straight forward and has been parsed into the ground, avoidance, however, hasn't been fully solved that I've found. As in how much avoidance does ac give you / how would the game calculate a hit / miss?<br />
<br />
On a side note, hit / miss ratios have seemed to remain fairly comparable between classes until high end avoidance mods become available. Again, I understand the need for 'top down balancing' but damn, (over)correcting one imbalance while sewing the seeds of yet another imbalance stupifies me.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is as streaky as avoidance.. Umm, yeah well that depends on what class you are (which is fine) but more importantly, what mob you are fighting compared to what class you are comparing against... After all, if class A gets hit for max damage twice as much as class B which one is most likely to see a damage spike?<br />
<br />
Stuns from behind. Yeah, they do happen alot when you are running. I remember reading a dev post about that, any mob over level 5 has a chance to stun on any regular hit while you are running away, not just bash, kick or slam attacks. Normal hits. That thread was here somewhere...<br />
<br />
<br />
/shrug, this sort of debate will continue to crop up until some basic questions are answered by SoE, and I won't be holding my breath for that one.<br />
<br />
*edit* Bah, speling &gt; me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an fyi, I never needed a fungi or a buff bot to solo. I also didnt need to be heavily twinked. Yeah, I had gear above my level till I hit the 50s but nothing like say a warrior would need to solo. By the time I reached 52 I was wearing gear I could have looted myself in an exp group in every slot and I could still solo, albeit less efficiently. You are thinking of warrior/rogue soloers, you know, the guys that needed a bot, a fungi and an anklesmasher from chardok at least just to solo even sorta efficiently. *EDIT* So take your own advice about generalizations, not every monk is a fungi tstaff using oasis,loio,ot,dl leveler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gargen</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is why mitigation is better than avoidance for monks:<br />
<br />
avoidance = helps a lot on a small number of swings<br />
mitigation = helps a small amount on a lot of swings<br />
<br />
That makes mitigation more reliable in short term situations (such as pulling).  Avoidance is also mostly non-exeistant when being attacked from behind (such as when pulling) although with the trend of giving monks more of their avoidance from behind the second part may not be the case for the expansion after OoW.  Monks are also much further down the diminishing returns curve in mitigation than avoidance...<br />
<br />
<br />
... but as I've said many times before in other places I, as a monk, would rather have my &quot;Sony Class Balance Points&quot; spent on DPS or utility.</div></div><hr />

     If you're going to quote me quote the whole sentence.  Not just part of it so it supports your side of the debate.  It's a lame tactic and doesn't fool anyone.<br />
<br />
     I said &quot;I believe that a monk with 1800 ac should take a hit like a 1800 ac warrior (minus the innate bonus you warriors get), or an 1800 ac paladin, or an 1800 ac rogue, or even an 1800 ac wizard if that were possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
     This has 'no basis' in the EQ combat system, eh?  I hadn't heard you were added to the Dev Team.  You're just pulling statement like this out of thin air, and not backing them up with anything but hot air.<br />
<br />
     You've proven exactly nothing using Thepp's parses, because you keep fucking up the math and skewing the numbers to support your own arguement.  At least 5 people have shown you your error, but you choose to ignore them.<br />
<br />
     &quot;It's an itemization penalty&quot;.... once again, quote the whole sentence.  <br />
<br />
     I said &quot;It's an itemization penalty (which I completely agree with, leather &lt; chain &lt; plate), stacked on top of a mitigation nerf (which as I've just stated, is no longer needed).  Even you should be able to understand that given access to the same content, a monk won't have anywhere near the AC or HP of any plate tank.<br />
<br />
     A balancing factor?  Balancing me against what utility exactly?  My uber pulling abilities?  Bards pull better.  SK's pull better.  Hell, even Paladins / Clerics / Rangers can paci-pull.  My lull discipline allows me to strip exactly ONE mob off a group that I pull.  Which leave one if I'm lucky, more if I'm not.... and then it's the old &quot;Can I make it back to the group without dying&quot; crapshoot.  Or did you maybe mean my class-defining Feign Death skill that fails about 2/5 and gets me killed at least 3 times a night.<br />
Right, so me getting less benefit per point of AC than ANY other class in the game is balancing me against what utility again?<br />
<br />
     Oh, you meant my uber DPS that's barely above yours, and behind rogues, rangers, wizards, necromancers, mages, beastlords, and chanters / druids with DC pets.<br />
<br />
     And I was the one saying that none of this is based in reality.  Warriors have this MAGIC ability to automatically mitigate more damage than anyone else in the game.  Fine.  All the more power to 'em.  If you and I are wearing the same Phase Spider Carapace, you still get your innate mitigation bonus.  So why do you get more AC benefit than I do.  Put that PSC on a cleric.  He gets more benefit than I do.  Put it on a Beastlord.  They get more benefit than I do.  And don't try to chalk it up to armor training, it's a magical chunk of bug.   I don't want to be able to wear 100 AC Breastplates made of solid metal like any plate tank can.  I want to be able to wear my gimpy 20 and 30 ac leather-looking tunics that I share with druids, and get the same AC benefit anyone else would wearing it.<br />
<br />
     I fully realize that I will never put you out of a job.  Same as I will never put ANY plate tank out of a job.  Hell, I wouldn't even put a ranger out of a job.<br />
<br />
    No group in their right mind will ever choose a monk for a tank, as has been explained to you ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
MONKS HAVE LOW AC<br />
MONKS HAVE LOW HP<br />
MONKS HAVE NO TAUNT BUTTON<br />
MONKS HAVE NO SNAP AGGRO CAPABILITY<br />
<br />
     You want to get a group together that's willing to pay close attention to aggro, burn the healers outta mana, likely have casters die because their 'tank' can't get mobs off them, and get SLOWER experience due to the aforementioned reasons..... good luck.  I know if I'm on my alts... Necro, BL, Cleric, Warrior, Bard, Ranger.... I'm sure not gonna look for a monk to tank.<br />
<br />
    Oh, and lastly..... you accusing me of trolling here is pot / kettle, bud.  You've been stirring up this exact shitstorm over at MB for weeks.  I just popped over here to see where you're coming from.  And surprise, surprise....you're misrepresenting us.<br />
<br />
     And to Haass.... whatever floats your boat, honey.   I've never owned a Fungi.  Never had a T-Staff.   I started my monk in April of '99, and grouped for weeks getting mesh armor, and wore that until I was in Kunark where I grouped for MONTHS to get Crescent armor.   You know, that shitty no-drop stuff that was supposed to be the monk equivalent of all the class-only gear that EVERY OTHER class got but monks.<br />
<br />
     Generalize all ya want.   I came here to try to give you guys some insight into how gimped my monk truly is.  I don't want to tank.  Neither do any of the monks I know.  Neither do any of the monks on MB that I talk to regularly.  We want a mitigation nerf repeal / softcap increase so that we don't get absolutely trashed doing our &quot;defined role&quot;, which we are now about 3rd or 4th best at.  We want a DPS increase so that we're closer to rogues.  <br />
<br />
     I've seen the hostility from both sides.  I've read many years of things like Furor saying &quot;I don't fucking like monks&quot;.  And Frodlin's stuff from before he was appointed to his new position.  I don't buy into it at all.  I want my chosen class to get a bit better.  What I want isn't going to infringe on ANYONE's job.  And at the end of the day, isn't this supposed to be about us against the baddies that SoE throws at us?<br />

<br />
The problem is this.   Once you acheive a reasonable level of survivability, where your survival isnt' in question, then you're an acceptable tank.   <br />
<br />
Warriors are living proof that aggro on command isnt' a requirement to play.   Remember, we have relied on procs without anything else for some time, and I'd say that your aggro including melee DPS and procs if you want to tank, with WA5 and a set of double Ykesha auged stun proc weapons, your aggro is superior to warrior aggro up to just GoD.  You'd be amazed at what groups are willing to put up with as far as aggro is concerned.<br />
<br />
Again, you claim to know what groups would do....<br />
<br />
All of those things were true during Luclin for the most part.    Monks had low AC (average ones), they had lower HP than warriors, they didnt' have taunt, and they had no snap aggro ability....<br />
<br />
Yet they were tanking for groups, and they were soloing up a storm.   <br />
<br />
The only thing that's changed, and that has made monks undesirable as tanks for groups is what?  It's mitigation.   The fact that mitigation changed, and when it did you were no longer acceptable group tanks.... shows that the change was appropriate.</div></div><hr />

really? no one showed me where I screwed up, you know what they did do though? they said, oh factor out all the time mods the monk has and THEN compare it with the time modded warrior...  So exactly when is there parity then, wait there's not and it makes the whole comparison flawed.  Those &quot;5 people&quot; were wrong and still are.<br />
<br />
Oh, you meant my uber DPS that's barely above yours<br />
<br />
Again a issue I've stated needs to be addressed, monk dps isn't higher then a warriors, now the other thing though.  If you continue to press mitigation to the point where you can come closer and closer to bieng a reliable tank again, you'll never get a dps improvment worth anything because of how EQ balances things, which is dps vs utility vs tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, we do want a reasonable level of survivability.  REASONABLE is a good word for it.  Now we get torn up like a wet paper bag.<br />
<br />
And &quot;acceptable&quot; is also a good word.... if you use words like OUTSTANDING for warriors, and FANTASTIC for Paladins / Shadowknights.  <br />
<br />
What exactly is the problem with a monk being able to fill a spot in a group if none of the plate tanks are available.  Why is it that you all seem hell-bent that without a plate tank the group falls apart and then the bards / necros / druids / chanters / beastlords / mages all go off to solo instead.  And the monks and rogues sit LFG.<br />
<br />
This isn't absolutes.... right now all the plate tanks are by FAR the most wanted for 'tank' jobs.  Nobody else can do it at all, let alone do it well enough to threaten your positions.<br />
<br />
The only thing that's changed, and that has made monks undesirable as tanks for groups is what? It's mitigation. The fact that mitigation changed, and when it did you were no longer acceptable group tanks.... shows that the change was appropriate.<br />
<br />
Actually, two things have changed.  Mitigation as you mentioned, and itemization.<br />
Like I said earlier, you have 90 AC breastplates and 60 ac wrist pieces now.  I have NOTHING even remotely close to that.  THIS is why there is no reason for my mitigation to be penalized.  It ALREADY IS.<br />
<br />
And Pumilo...... I'm starting to feel like I'm arguing with a two-year old here.<br />
<br />
yes and your dps.<br />
<br />
Did you even read what I wrote?  Monk don't HAVE any utility to be balanced against anymore.  We're NOT the best pullers anymore.  We're at best second or third, and situationally down around 5th.   And our DPS.... you seem to understand we're lacking there as well.<br />
<br />
because of how EQ balances things, which is dps vs utility vs tanking.<br />
<br />
Sorry, gotta call bullshit on this one too.  Take a look at a Beastlord.  DPS is as high as mine.  Utility..... hmmm.  Good DOTS, good buffs, great slows, SOW, a castable mana-regen, AND a pet that tanks better than I do.  Sound 'balanced'?<br />
<br />
So, the reason I take a hit like a wet paper-bag is because..... I'm 3rd best puller if I'm lucky, barely 2nd or 3rd best in melee, and have NO other utility whatsoever.<br />
<br />
If I'm destined to be the one that 'takes a hit' worse than any other class in the game while wearing the same gear, by your reasoning I should be the BEST at something too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty simple.  If a group can use a Monk to tank instead of a Warrior, then the Monk could pull, dish excellent DPS, and tank as well.  Once they can successfully replace a Warrior, then in many cases they will.  And why exactly should we be for that?  So we can go practice our leet soloing skills?<br />
<br />
If I'm destined to be the one that 'takes a hit' worse than any other class in the game while wearing the same gear, by your reasoning I should be the BEST at something too.<br />
<br />
Hmm, what are Rangers best at?  What are Druids best at?  What are Beastlords best at?  It seems like there are lots of classes that don't have a specific area that they're &quot;best&quot; in.  Yet they seem to do quite well with having several different areas they excell in, but aren't the &quot;best&quot; at.  So your arguement that you have to have an area where you're BEST doesn't seem to hold up.  And even if it did, many people would still agree that Monks are the BEST pullers under difficult circumstances.  Maybe not always the fastest, but certainly the class that is most likely to be able to successfully pull no matter what situation or mob type you drop them in.<br />
<br />
You think Monks need some changes?  Okay, I don't think anyone argues that they could use some.  You think the very first change needed is a return to the old Monk mitigation?  Sorry, most Warriors aren't going to agree.  I'd suggest if you want Warrior support you come up with something else.  Because right now it seems like whenever Monks are asked what they want, they respond, &quot;give us back our old mitigation.&quot;  And when they're told, &quot;that isn't on the table, come up with something else,&quot; they reply, &quot;hmm, well how about you give us back our old mitigation?&quot;  Then when told, &quot;look we told you that isn't on the table, you need to come up with another idea,&quot;  they come back with, &quot;well if you're going to be that way about it, how about you give us back our old mitigation?!&quot;  See a pattern here?</div></div><hr />

Agreed NERF BARDS. But you are not 3rd best puller unless you personally suck. The only one close is the bard. Define melee? DPS? then maybe, but tank, nope you are basically 5th best behind the 3 plate classe and rangers.<br />
<br />
As far as BLs go, this is propaganda. BLs do great dps if they pet tanking, personally tanking, and casting all at the same time. Outside of xp grps that is rarely true. How many raids let pets exist????????? Thats right just about NONE. How good is their spell damage against anything with decent resists? Not very. And oh yeah I see raid strategies focused on BLs all the time (other than the MGB thing that goes for all classes with nice short-term regens), they must be uber!<br />
<br />
In short quit worrying about everyone and propose how to improve monks in a way that wont step on everyone else (thereby just shifting the nerf/rebalance calls to another class). In short major DPS upgrade (along with rangers, and a tweak to rogues) and some resists/AAs focused SOLELY on pulling. Take back the pulling job from bards rather than trying to take tanking away from the plate classes, who already have their own internal issues (warrior vs knight).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malachai</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty simple.  If a group can use a Monk to tank instead of a Warrior, then the Monk could pull, dish excellent DPS, and tank as well.  Once they can successfully replace a Warrior, then in many cases they will.  And why exactly should we be for that?  So we can go practice our leet soloing skills?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, what are Rangers best at?  What are Druids best at?  What are Beastlords best at?  It seems like there are lots of classes that don't have a specific area that they're &quot;best&quot; in.  Yet they seem to do quite well with having several different areas they excell in, but aren't the &quot;best&quot; at.  So your arguement that you have to have an area where you're BEST doesn't seem to hold up.  And even if it did, many people would still agree that Monks are the BEST pullers under difficult circumstances.  Maybe not always the fastest, but certainly the class that is most likely to be able to successfully pull no matter what situation or mob type you drop them in.<br />
<br />
You think Monks need some changes?  Okay, I don't think anyone argues that they could use some.  You think the very first change needed is a return to the old Monk mitigation?  Sorry, most Warriors aren't going to agree.  I'd suggest if you want Warrior support you come up with something else.  Because right now it seems like whenever Monks are asked what they want, they respond, &quot;give us back our old mitigation.&quot;  And when they're told, &quot;that isn't on the table, come up with something else,&quot; they reply, &quot;hmm, well how about you give us back our old mitigation?&quot;  Then when told, &quot;look we told you that isn't on the table, you need to come up with another idea,&quot;  they come back with, &quot;well if you're going to be that way about it, how about you give us back our old mitigation?!&quot;  See a pattern here?<br />
<br />
<br />
If a group can replace a warrior, then in many cases they will?  These cases being..... wanting to get slower xp, get their casters killed, and burn out their healers mana, just so a monk can tank?  Sorry, not buying this at all.  I never tanked before the nerf, I sure as hell can't tank now, and I don't believe I'll be able to after the mitigation nerf is repealed and the softcaps are fixed to be appropriate for the gear available in today's EQ.  We've said OVER AND OVER, that we don't want to tank.  Your argument is &quot;But you could, if you used aggro weapons and aggro augs&quot;.  No monk uses aggro augs.  I quit using a CHoS I had because... guess what?  I generated aggro that I didn't want.  Monks try NOT to get aggro.<br />
<br />
I never said I wanted an area where I was best at.  I said that, according to the logic being presented here, that if I'm WORST at taking a hit, then some other ability of mine should be near the BEST.  I also said that doesn't make sense.  You want to debate the 'sliding scale' idea, talk to Pumilo.  That was his baby.<br />
<br />
Monks are the best pullers under difficult circumstances? What circumstances would these be?  <br />
<br />
Whole lotta red-con mobs packed closely together?  Nope.  Monk lull only lasts long enough to lull ONE mob.  Result:  More than one red con incoming, which will most likely end up in a dead monk.  Bard does it better, so does any class with pacify.<br />
<br />
This is what you guys aren't grasping.  People actually refuse to join LDON's if a monk is pulling.  I've seen it.  I've pulled NORMAL LDON's, failed a FD, and died trying to pull a 3-mob room.  Lull one, pull other two out a bit, FD to split and call a tag, fail the FD, and die before it pops again.  And I like to think I'm pretty good at this after 5 years of practice pulling Kael, Hate, Fear, Chardok, etc....<br />
<br />
I've freely given the 'puller' role to bards, SK's, even rangers.  ALL of 'em do it better, safer, and faster than a monk nowadays.<br />
<br />
Which leaves me what.... fairly decent dps, no group utility, and no role as puller anymore.  And for this 'best of everything uberness', I'm being 'balanced' by making it so I get TORN APART by anything even remotely close to my level.  Monks are a melee class.  And in melee we get shredded.  The ONLY thing I can do now is huddle around the mobs ass, and hope it doesn't turn and I get riposted.<br />
<br />
I DO think something needs to get changed with monks.  I DO think that the mitigation nerf needs repealed.  At the time it happened, maybe, and I say MAYBE it was warranted at the end-game level.  I wasn't an end-game monk at the time.  From what I've seen here and on MB, there was a definate issue to be addressed.  It wasn't done correctly.  SoE has admitted exactly that.  But the point is that THEN a monk could approach a warrior's AC, and therefore possibly tank as well.  Like I said, I never saw this.  I've never tanked for a group in the whole 5+ years I've been playing. <br />
<br />
NOW, in TODAY's EQ, I can not come ANYWHERE NEAR the AC of a warrior, pally, SK.  So my 1200 AC mitigating like about 800 AC doesn't make any sense when a warrior with equivalent gear to mine is sitting 3-500 AC higher.  Plate tanks are ALREADY way ahead of monks. (AS THEY SHOULD BE)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't absolutes.... right now all the plate tanks are by FAR the most wanted for 'tank' jobs. Nobody else can do it at all, let alone do it well enough to threaten your positions.<br />
<br />
Analyze this statement for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now all the plate tanks are by FAR wanted for 'tank' jobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pre-nerf, this wasn't the case.  We were merely marginally &quot;wanted&quot; .  Post nerf, we gained a whole bunch of ground on tanking desirability.   You're not making the connection man... this is a GOOD thing.  Adding additional viable tanks is NOT a solution.<br />
<br />
Also, it's a tacit admission that you want the mitigation so that you can tank in groups and that with a mitigation return, you'll have that, which would partially solve your LFG problem.   Sorry if you are under the delusion that you're going to be getting a whole lot of support from warriors on being able to take our jobs, particularly after trying to BS us about how mitigation is &quot;just to survive pulls&quot;, when as I said a few posts earlier, some monks seem to ALWAYS survive, and some seem to ALWAYS die.  Seems to me that what you want is for there to be something which doesn't highlight the skill differences as much between those playing monks.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, you can ALREADY tank in various experience acquiring areas in the game... up to and including hard LDoN, but yeah, if I leave a group and they can't find another warrior, Paladin, or SK, I think a group doing cutting edge content should split up or move to something that is less risky.  You shouldn't be tanking current content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The problem is groups want as much DPS as they can get while still having all of the roles they need filled.  If they need a real tank and a real healer and a real slower and snare then they'll make sure they have someone in the group who can do each of those things and fill the rest with DPS.  If they don't need slow or snare or CC and anyone can tank then they'll just get a healer and 5 DPS.<br />
<br />
Monks are a DPS class with an exceptional ability to pull difficult areas.  That's what groups take monks for.  Warriors are an exceptional tank.  That's what groups take warriors for.  You don't like the fact that groups don't take you as a tank, well tough.  Groups don't take me for DPS either.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't absolutes.... right now all the plate tanks are by FAR the most wanted for 'tank' jobs.  Nobody else can do it at all, let alone do it well enough to threaten your positions.<br />
<br />
<br />
In all but the very hardest zones this is totally false.  Rangers can and do tank in LDON, PoE, etc.  Anything less than that a wizard can tank so you don't even need a tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you even read what I wrote?  Monk don't HAVE any utility to be balanced against anymore.  We're NOT the best pullers anymore.  We're at best second or third, and situationally down around 5th.   And our DPS.... you seem to understand we're lacking there as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
This I agree with.  Monks used to be the best puller bar none and should be boosted to where that's true again.  Monks should also be closer to rogue DPS than warrior DPS.  They should NOT be even remotely close to any of the plate classes as tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, gotta call bullshit on this one too.  Take a look at a Beastlord.  DPS is as high as mine.  Utility..... hmmm.  Good DOTS, good buffs, great slows, SOW, a castable mana-regen, AND a pet that tanks better than I do.  Sound 'balanced'?<br />
<br />
<br />
So because beastlords and bards are overpowered you want to take the tank spot away from warriors...  How the hell does that make any sense?<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the reason I take a hit like a wet paper-bag is because..... I'm 3rd best puller if I'm lucky, barely 2nd or 3rd best in melee, and have NO other utility whatsoever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we're getting somewhere.  Those are things you're supposed to be good at.  Lobby to get those fixed.  You're NOT a tank.  Lobbying to become a tank is going to prove fruitless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good lord, guys.  How many more ways can I say it.  <br />
<br />
The bit about Beastlords was in response to Pumilo's babbling about how classes are 'balanced' as either dps / utility / tanking.  And I called bullshit and cited Beastlords as a class that is pretty damn high in all of them.  This IN NO WAY equates to me saying I think I should be able to tank.<br />
<br />
If you want, I can repeat this in couple other languages.....<br />
<br />
PS:  The things I'm SUPPOSED to be good at?  Someone show me where it's written anywhere?  ANYWHERE?  That I'm supposed to be good at pulling.  Pulling was never intended as a role for anyone.  Monks fell into it because of the Feign Death skill, and as such have been taking crap over it ever since.  <br />
<br />
Wanna rewrite the class decription for a monk?  I'd be really interested in what you'd have to say.....<br />
<br />
My guess?<br />
<br />
Good (but not too good) at melee, but only from behind the mob, because the front of the mob is PLATE TANK territory.<br />
<br />
Sole job is to run out and get stuff for the group to kill but not allowed to survive doing it very well, because.... well surviving is PLATE TANK territory.<br />
<br />
Dies a lot. (Ok, you monks can have this)<br />

<br />
Yes, we quite clearly get that you and a number of other Monks think this.  And have thought this from the day the nerf went into effect.  In fact I doubt a day has gone by since the nerf that some Monk somewhere hasn't brought up the fact that they believe the nerf was wrong, unfair, badly targetted, and unnecessary.  Yet other than Monks, most other classes/people don't seem to agree.  And continuing to say it over and over again, like some kind of mantra, doesn't gain you further agreement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If, as you claim, the issue is you want better tools to pull, then why do you keep advocating repealing a decision that was made two years ago as the only way to accomplish that?  If SoE has turned a deaf ear to your requests/demands for two years, what makes you think that they'll suddenly change their minds?  For me, I'd try asking for something completely different if I'd been denied what I really wanted as many times as Monks have been.  Face facts, your mitigation isn't coming back.  Now, what other tools can Monks get that might help them survive a difficult pull?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Claiming that you dont' want to tank, and then asking for the skills which *only* help you in the role that you claim you don't want makes no sense.<br />
<br />
YOU DONT WANT TO TANK?<br />
<br />
Then stop asking for a mitigation change.   Seriously.... just stop asking for it, and we'll start believing that you dont' want to tank.    <br />
<br />
MITIGATION INCREASES DONT HELP IN PULLING, THEY ARE ONLY BENEFICIAL OVER TIME<br />
<br />
In other words, if you DON'T WANT TO TANK, and you want an upgrade to something.... then the SMALLEST possible upgrade would be.... your mitigation, because you dont' want to have to use it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but you look more like miss 1300 miss 1200 1200 miss whereas the tank looks like 1200 1100 1100 1200 miss, etc. *just using your point. End result is same, the RNG rules. Why not go for something that really solves the problem...<br />
<br />
In the end you guys just dont get it. Warriors got upgrades because they convinced people other than themselves that aggro, etc. was a problem. If monks came in here and said we need more dps just because our relative position has eroded and we need better back stun resist and some more enhanced pull tools (esp. when in context of what has become overpowered bards) then warriors would be on your side and you would have a better chance of getitng some of this. But you guys want to infringe on the domain (even if unintentional) of at least 3 other classes who already have their own fights over tanking. Do you see pallys with defensive, nope. You saw an adjustment that benefitted the knights without radically altering the warrior. But you want your cake and eat it too. <br />
<br />
Cant help but laugh at the thread on monkly where basically you guys say you want improvements where you are weak. Well guess what, you cant heal for shit, why not ask for that. Or you lack burst DPS, why not ask for a super duper ninja kick that crits for 10K or why not ask for a rez, everyone else does ;) <br />
<br />
Funny thing is this /rant is coming from someone who plays at least 6 classes EVERY DAY to include one (pally) that is arguably being screwed by another (warrior) as well as another (shammy) that has had much of its key abilities stolen by another (enchanter). Oh yeah and my monk's dps is better than my wizards over time and my ranger wants his freaking bow improved. My cleric is happy cause those damn freaking priest classes havent kicked her ass yet :)<br />

    Okies, my mistake.  I am trying to be as truthful as possible.  Change the example to a room full of closely packed blue con mobs.  Same difference where I'm concerned.  They'll still kick the shit outta me if I try to single one.  My lull will take say... one mob of the 3 out of the equation.  Then I hit the 2nd with a shuriken and bolt.... try to FD so I can get one back to it's spawn and run back to group with the third.  Fail a FD and two blue con mobs beat me to death in the few seconds it takes for FD to repop.<br />
<br />

<br />
     I've said over-and-over that I don't want to tank.  Believe me, or don't.  At this point I'm not wasting any more time trying to convince you.  <br />
<br />
     Everyone here seems to think the only reason ANY monk would want better mitigation is so we can &quot;Steal the tanks jobs&quot;.  Like it's some hate-driven agenda on the part of all monks.  Not true at all.  My monk is my main, but I also play a warrior.  I'm happy as hell that he tanks better than I do.  I was also happy as hell when the incite line went live.  <br />
<br />
     I started a monk because I'm a martial artist in real life.   I've been involved in it for 25+ years.  I love martial arts movies.   <br />
<br />
     The idea that my main character, which I started in April of 99 (for the guy that was wondering how long I'd been playing), went from reasonable..... overnight....to friggin' pansy is pretty hard to swallow.<br />
<br />
    And all I get here is basically a big &quot;Fuck you, you deserved it&quot; and &quot;You shouldn't be able to tank anyways&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and for Haas... my example above was about the &quot;mitigation is only of benefit over time and doesn't help in pulling&quot;.  Monks actually DO get hit for a period of TIME while pulling.  So a bit more mitigation in that example would have allowed me to survive those hits.  Hence.... mitigation would have helped me pulling that mob.</div></div><hr />

What you claim to want or not want is pretty irrelevant.  With enough mitigation there will be Monks who tank.  Period.  End of story.  We've seen it before.  Just because you may not feel that's your job doesn't mean if they can that other Monks won't happily step into it.<br />
<br />
And you still seem completetly focused on mitigation, mitigation, and mitigation.  You mean to say that there is absolutely nothing that anyone can come up with that will help Monks pull without restoring their old mitigation?  Is that what you would truly have us believe?  Because that's just an amazing assertation.</div></div><hr />

In a situation like that, the only puller that might surpass you is a Bard, and that stems from the need to nerf Bard pulling tactics.

Monks devote their energies to the pursuit of physical perfection, shaping their very bodies into deadly machines.  <br />
<br />
and...<br />
<br />
Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else. <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't see &quot;puller&quot; there anywhere.<br />
<br />
DO see &quot;physical perfection&quot;, &quot;deadly machines&quot;, &quot;physical combat to the exclusion of all else&quot;.<br />
<br />
Somehow these didn't make the list though...<br />
<br />
Getting torn apart like a wet paper bag if the mob actually tries to hit me.<br />
<br />
Crumpling to the ground in fear at the first sign of trouble.<br />
<br />
Gun-taping myself to the mobs ass so I don't get riposted for a quarter my hp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malachai</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you still seem completetly focused on mitigation, mitigation, and mitigation. You mean to say that there is absolutely nothing that anyone can come up with that will help Monks pull without restoring their old mitigation? Is that what you would truly have us believe? Because that's just an amazing assertation. <br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm open to suggestions.... Pumilo seems hell bent on us lobbying for improved avoidance.  Avoidance at the level we'd need to survive a bad pull or FD failure WOULD result in us taking less damage-over-time than any other class. And I'm reasonably sure that's not what you guys want.<br />
<br />
I, personally, don't like the idea of being the &quot;puller&quot;.  In my head I always pictured it sorta like this.<br />
<br />
Warrior standing square in front of the dragon.  Bellowing taunts, and smashing it with a shield to keep it's attention.  Meanwhile the deadly monk standing beside the warrior uses deadly strikes to destroy the evil beast.<br />
<br />
Somehow, over the years, monks ended up being put in the &quot;Puller&quot; role.  Something that was never intended as a tactic for anyone, let alone a class defining role.  SoE threw the monk class a bone with the lull discs because without it we'd be nothing but rogue-lite.  Stapled to the mobs ass like a rogue because we can't take a hit, and not pulling for shit because bardsongs and other classes lulls / paci spells made it easier to single pull.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a lot more focus on the 'martial-arts' part of the monk class.  <br />
<br />
Differing combat styles as disciplines maybe.....<br />
<br />
Maybe a 'leg-break' atk that snares.<br />
<br />
Maybe an 'eye-gouge' atk that blinds.<br />
<br />
Maybe a 'pressure-point' atk that slows.<br />
<br />
Forgot one... maybe a 'grapple' atk that stuns the mob and the monk together for a short period.  <br />
<br />
Just my personal feelings on what I'd like to see.<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day, all of it still doesn't help the bottom line which is &quot;I take a hit worse than a druid&quot;.  I get absolutely CREAMED anytime the mob turns it's attention on me.  That doesn't sound much like the &quot;Body is a deadly machine&quot; and the &quot;Focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else&quot; kinda monk I read about when I created the character.<br />
<br />
If you guys have any ideas, I'd love to hear 'em.<br />

You do NOT get &quot;creamed&quot; any time the mob turns it's attention on you.    You take a few more hits for max, then you feign.    Jesus Christ, will you stop it with the exaggerations already?  <br />
<br />
The &quot;Take a hit worse than a druid&quot; is LAUGHABLE, not because it's true or false, but because it's a dishonest portrayal of the reality which is that a druid will die faster than you will if a mob turns his attention toward him.    <br />
<br />
It's not whether it's &quot;technically true&quot; that when a mob lands a hit which is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH more likely to happen on the druid than on you, then yes, you'll take it a SMALL amount harder.    The reality is that with a mob swinging at you, and a mob swinging at the druid, he'll die, you won't.  The mob will miss you almost SIXTY percent the time, and the druid.... he'll get hit over sixty percent of the time.</div></div><hr />

K, Frodlin...<br />
<br />
You have 1200 more AC than I do, and almost 5000 more hitpoints.  A few more hits for max, while insignificant to you, equals death to me.<br />
<br />
As far as the druid thing.... it's on your own board in black and white.  <br />
<br />
DRU  1565  0%   40   102  22.1  306.1  56.6  2619  61.1  37.7  NA   1.9  NA   NA   | 187.0<br />

<br />
A druid with 1565 AC is mitigating for more than a monk with 1854 AC and 2% shielding.<br />
<br />
I never said the druid would last longer than I would.<br />
<br />
The druid  gets missed 37%, and the monk gets missed 47% of the time.  The 12% block and 4% riposte don't work when hit from behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm at a completely different level of the game than you are.   My guild monks don't have 5k less HP than me, or 1200 less AC than I do.   <br />
<br />
Again, while the &quot;druid&quot; thing has some nice rhetorical value, it's completely dishonest, and intended to deceive.   You survive WAY WAY WAY better than a druid, who cares that of the multitudes of hits he takes more than you, some happen to be a little softer?</div></div><hr />

The point is that the combination of monk mitigation (or lack thereof) + monk avoidance = less damage taken per unit of time than any class other than war/SK/paladin.  Yes, you'll take a higher average hit than some classes but your significantly higher avoidance makes up for that.  If  you're arguing that you like mitigation better because of damage spikes then you need your avoidance nerfed at the same time they raise your mitigation so that the average remains about the same.  The only other alternative would be to boost war/pal/sk avoidance to monklike levels.</div></div><hr />

Edit:  They are DPS numbers.  Mitigating worse than a druid means exactly that.  That a monk with higher AC, takes a higher damage hit, than a caster with a lower AC.  If you guys think this is necessary to preserve you on your &quot;I'm the tank and you aren't&quot; pedestle, then so be it.  I came here to try to have a discussion on the topic.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gargen</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since people seem to have forgotten...<br />
<br />
This is why mitigation is better than avoidance for monks:<br />
<br />
avoidance = helps a lot on a small number of swings<br />
mitigation = helps a small amount on a lot of swings<br />
<br />
That makes mitigation more reliable in short term situations (such as pulling).  Avoidance is also mostly non-exeistant when being attacked from behind (such as when pulling) although with the trend of giving monks more of their avoidance from behind the second part may not be the case for the expansion after OoW.  Monks are also much further down the diminishing returns curve in mitigation than avoidance...<br />
<br />
<br />
... but as I've said many times before in other places I, as a monk, would rather have my &quot;Sony Class Balance Points&quot; spent on DPS or utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd also agree that good monk pulling is generally a toss up with a good bard pulling as the best in tricky situations (situation specifics making the difference).  There are two reason why this doesn't help us as much as it should though:<br />
<br />
1. *Good* monk pulling has an ultra steep learning curve so many of them can't do it very well... which leads most people passing over monks as pullers.<br />
<br />
2. Pulling just isn't needed that much any more except on raids or some harder encounters (Hard LDoN and Trials 5/6) *if* you don't have some uber geared folks that can handle an add or two.  I'm sure the warriors around here can appreciate what it's like to be in a stuation where raids and the hardest single group content are the only time you're useful for more than the 6th man exp.</div></div><hr />

Truth = Your fucking semantics don't mean shit.  A shadowknight with a very small amount of shielding outmitigates a warrior with none.  That doesn't make either class broken and neither do snippets of information intended to mislead.</div></div><hr />

The arguement over semantics comes from a lack of reading comprehension. The oposition took that statement to mean that &quot;monks tank worse than druids&quot; which is, of course, untrue. Those are too different statements and are not mutually exclusive.<br />
<br />
Monks do MITIGATE worse than druids, however they do not TANK worse than druids due to their increased avoidance.<br />

<br />
Jat5 is exactly right.  Mitigation is what's taken off of the max a mob hits for.<br />
<br />
The numbers at the far right are DPS.<br />
<br />
So yer right, I do take 2/3 the damage of a druid over the same period of time. <br />
<br />
And wearing far superior armor, and having 300 more AC, I take a max hit that's higher than that druid.  Which makes no sense.<br />
<br />
This is somehow intending to mislead?  Nope.  The parse is on your own board.  <br />
<br />
The point was that a melee class taking a higher max hit than a caster class with 300 less ac is 'fuckin' retarded' as you so eloquently put it.<br />
<br />
If yer so against any mitigation for monks, maybe you should make sure you know what the word means first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Against my better judgement, I'll try to explain this to you again.<br />
<br />
You think your class is broken.  It's really not, so you start scrounging around for information to prove that it is.  Aha...we found a piece right here...we mitigate worse than druids, therefore we need better mitigation.  You're not asking for better mitigation, you're asking TO TANK BETTER, because that is the end fucking result of what mitigation will do for you.<br />
<br />
Lets take this example.  Lets assume there's a mythical class who avoids 99% of all hits.  However, when he does get hit, he takes 150% of the maximum hit of the mob, every fucking time.  This class mitigates like absolute fucking crap, but he tanks like a god.  Is he broken?  Does he need more mitigation?  Hell, a fucking wizard mitigates better than this class, so it must be broken, correct?<br />
<br />
You're fucking wrong.  Mitigation doesn't mean shit.  Mitigation is EXACTLY HALF OF THE REASON YOU TAKE THE DAMAGE YOU DO AND YOU ARE COMPLETELY IGNORING THE OTHER HALF.<br />
<br />
You want to see broken?  This is what broken would be.<br />
<br />
Druid - 120 DPS<br />
Monk - 180 DPS<br />
<br />
The other way around is not fucking broken, it does not mean you need to mitigate more, and it does not mean that that you deserve jack fucking crap.  Your avoidance is higher than all other classes, your defense skills are superior  to all other classes, so to avoid you becoming the best possible tank in ALL scenarios, (which actually happened in Luclin, no matter how much you want to claim it didn't), you were fucking nerfed and your class fucking deserved it.  Arguing to the contrary with half truths does not make your case more valid, nor does it change the fact that you conveniently ignore the stats that balance out your &quot;Broken&quot; mitigation and make you completely acceptable and place you exactly where you should be --- Right behind the fucking plate tanks.<br />
<br />
Now sit your asses down and shut the hell up.</div></div><hr />

Why is it that monks DPS is so low compared to how frail they are.

  Um, actually it does. Block works twice as well as parry, for example. And then it's backed up by, you know, actual parses. Do we need to reiterate that you take 2/3 of the damage that a druid takes? The proof is already there. Druid damage taken: 187.0 Monk damage taken: 127.8. Your avoidance obviously far outweighs their mitigation.</div></div><hr />

What way, other than 'not getting my ass kicked', can I be fixed so I don't get my ass kicked.  I'm supposed to be a melee class, and I drop like a stone when I try to melee. <br />
I don't want to increase my pulling ability. Personally, I think giving monks lull was stupid.  I was against it.  I'm supposed to be a martial artist, not some kinda friggin' hypnotist.  I was fine with 'pulling', as my role seems to have become, the way I always did it.  The time-tested FD split.<br />
<br />
The difference now, now that I have very little defensive skill advantage at all (see above), have shitty AC on the equipment I CAN get, get less benefit from that AC point-for-point than ANY other class, is that I don't survive pulling.  I get a couple mobs on me in a LDON and pull 'em out of a room so I can flop to split 'em, and FD fails.... I don't live to get a second shot.  I'd LOVE to hear your ideas about how to rectify this situation without me taking less damage.  More avoidance has been tried, but crunch the numbers.... the amount of avoidance I'd need to survive will make me take far less damage / time than any other class in the game.  And that NOT what I want.<br />
<br />
If you want to see the numbers on that, I'll find the example on MB for ya.<br />
<br />
Once again, I'd really like some input / ideas here.   And not the macho posturing, profanity, and hostility that some of the posters here seem to think is necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malachai</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, actually it does. Block works twice as well as parry, for example. And then it's backed up by, you know, actual parses. Do we need to reiterate that you take 2/3 of the damage that a druid takes? The proof is already there. Druid damage taken: 187.0 Monk damage taken: 127.8. Your avoidance obviously far outweighs their mitigation.<br />
<br />
Nope, no need to reiterate.  I said earlier... I realize I take less damage / time than that druid.  You don't think that's realistic when in that example the melee class has 300 more AC, 2% shielding, and is being compared to a leather wearing priest class? <br />
<br />
As a similar example, say the monk was a Paladin and the Druid was a Cleric.  This would be like a 1850ac Paladin taking more damage per hit than a 1550ac Cleric.  Not very realistic is it?<br />
<br />
What I don't agree with is that I can take that EXACT druid's chestpiece off him, put it on myself, and get less benefit from it than he does.  Hit him with a hammer, hit me with EXACTLY the same force, with EXACTLY the same hammer, and somehow he takes less damage from the blow than I do?<br />
<br />
Monk AC never comes close to any plate tank's ac given the same content level.  Plate wearers have 100 AC BPs, and 60 AC bracers.  I have nothing even close to that available to me.  Which is as it should be.  I share my leather gear with druids and beastlords, which is as it should be.  So there is no reason left for me to have the additional penalty of getting less benefit per point of AC than anyone else, including the druid and beastlord I share the gear with.  <br />
<br />
A warrior with 1800 ac is barely considered high-end.  A monk with 1800 AC is in the absolute TOP percentile.  Have a look on EQrankings.com for proof of this.  And even given the fact that said monk is in the top percentile to reach that level of displayed AC, he mitigates like its closer to 1300 than 1800.   <br />
<br />
So if by some miracle monk do get put on the same mitigation / ac table as everyone else... a warrior with 1800 AC, is worried about a monk with 2-3000 less hp, 3-400 less ac (due to itemization), no taunt button, and no snap-aggro ability, getting chosen to tank over him?  Sorry, don't believe it one bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, what's amusing is you AGAIN downplaying things called &quot;facts&quot; that don't support your argument.<br />
<br />
55 points in dodge, and a block skill that fires twice as often as my parry.<br />
<br />
I'd call that superior.  You apparantly call it &quot;In need of improvement.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me reiterate why the &quot;monks mitigate worse than druids&quot; is dishonest.<br />
<br />
It's a true statement... you DO &quot;mitigate&quot; worse than druids.<br />
<br />
The PROBLEM is, that you IMPLY with that statement that you're somehow less capable of taking damage than a druid, which as we all know is NOT true.   You INTENTIONALLY leave it at the &quot;mitigate worse than a druid&quot;, in ORDER to confuse people.  I have never once seen a monk say &quot;Man, I tank circles around druids&quot;, because.... that is ALSO true, yet it doesn't appeal to sympathy.   <br />
<br />
You can make a truthful statement that's misleading, and that's what you're doing.   You've been called on it because it's downright dishonest.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to take on the point that you mitigate worse than druids, that's fine... you SHOULD mitigate worse than druids, because you avoid MILES better.  There's nothing &quot;special&quot; about being a melee class that entitles you to just mitigate.   As long as you take less damage, there's no reason why you should be superior in EVERY defensive aspect.    Why you should have a HUGE avoidance advantage over every other melee class, and staggering levels of avoidance advnatage over those casters, and then demand that on the occasion that you DO get hit that it be for less damage too is beyond me.  <br />
<br />
Your class is an avoidance class, and any mitigation upgrade should come with an avoidance nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Want and idea? Take the basis of Healing Will. Create an avoidance disc with a 35% burst increase to monk avoidance, with a built in stun mitigation from behind attacks, and it turns off the second any offensive action is taken by the monk. Reuse of 3 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Totally prevents you from having any increased tanking abilities, in a reasonable way true to your class.</div></div><hr />

So as I understand it, what you're saying is that even though SoE has flatly refused to put return your mitigation.  Other classes aren't clamoring for your mitigation to be returned to you.  And you've been harping on the fact that you want your old mitigation returned to you for years and have seemingly gotten no where with it, that the fact that you've mentioned some other options once or twice and haven't gotten a positive response means that asking for your mitigation back is the most likely option?<br />

I agree with that 100%.  Any caster who's casting a spell and someone dies, or they think it does, should immediately STOP casting the spell.   That change would do more for monks surviving pulls than ANY mitigation nonsense would.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy FD was not intended for pulling at all. SOE admitted this, the fact we became the best pullers was not in the &quot;Vision&quot;tm. Hence no automatic memwhipe change, spells hit cancels change, mobs walk back to spawn at same time change. We became the best pullers based on this and we accepted it because it was skill oriented and if you were good at it you were desirable. We are no longer the GODS of pullilng, we are good, but not the GODS.<br />
<br />
How about this? 1. Make Monks Mitigate better than any other class, ANY. But... give us negative agro, (i.e. We no matter what we do if any one even touches the mob or throws us a heal they get agro) or 2. We become the GODS of pulling in the way that clerics are GODS of healing.<br />
<br />
Pick one, i'll take either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;1. Make Monks Mitigate better than any other class, ANY. But... give us negative agro,&quot;<br />
<br />
I passed over this when you posted this on MB, but it sounds great but there's no longer any need for a monk to worry about aggro, which doesn't really bother me too much, could screw over monks in situations they want aggro.<br />
<br />
Giving you all the abilities in the world for pulling wouldn't bother ANYONE at all.  it's the monk role along with DPS now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, I really want to help you guys survive pulls better, but well.... I want to separate the people who are BSing about wanting to tank from those who really DO want to help survive pulls better.   That seems the perfect balance.  Nope, you'll NEVER get aggro while having good mitigation, yet you'll be far more durable while pulling.  <br />
<br />
A negative hate modifier is bad because it completely removes the &quot;risk&quot; factor from doing damage to mobs, you need to have to watch yourselves or suffer the consequences.   On the other hand, a nice little mitigation boost while attack is off would be pretty good.</div></div><hr />

Guys, we really are getting hammered. And if you gave our pulling skills to Druids, (just the fd and the lull and the utilities) they would be better pullers than us, not because of their spells or buffs, but because they would survive (sp) more. We are noticing something that is really hampering us and want it fixed. We gave what we thought would help, Warriors thought we wanted to take their spot, we don't.<br />

Or what would make more sense, maybe an avoidance boost while it's off.<br />
Sort of a 'devoting all attention to block / dodge&quot; and not attempting to hit the mob at all.  <br />
<br />
That would definately prevent me from getting creamed while pulling, without turning me into a &quot;tank&quot;.<br />

Some of the disciplines already work that way, so it likely wouldn't be hard to code.</div></div><hr />

Swift Journey: (5/10)<br />

Stonewall: (3/6/9/12/15)<br />
Requirements: Level 65<br />
Each rank in this ability gives monks an increasing chance for their feigned deaths to not be revealed by spells cast upon them. At the highest rank, monks become immune to feign breaking on a resisted spell and have a good chance of feigning through a spell that successfully hits them.<br />

Heightened Awareness: (3/3/3/3/3)<br />

This ability gives you the chance to block attacks that originate behind you. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness...<br />

Discord AA list from MB (http://p201.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=1276.topic) <br />
<br />
Not really sure if Swift Journey is monk specific or not but resisted spells breaking FD and all angle defense skills had been kicked around as possible counters to the original mitigation changes. Heightened Awareness seems to give a chance of a chance to block an attack from behind cutting it's effectiveness down quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I honestly think if the original mitigation change had been offset a bit by an innate avoidance adjustment instead of avoidance mods on upscale gear again tied to buying an expansion, the noise level of monks would not be nearly as bad.</div></div><hr />

  I'm glad you're interested in a pulling fix that doesn't include increased tanking ability, but you are still pressing a WRONG point. You take 2/3 the damage druids do. You survive better than druids do vs mobs hitting you. Period. There are parses proving this. Please stop spreading the misinformation.

  I like the idea of no auto attack = large survivability bonus. I still find it incredibly easier to imagine that as an avoidance increase rather than a mitigation increase, but the end result is similar; increased monk survivability when they need it. I can find some minor problems with this approach being exploitable, but overall it seems just peachy. <br />
<br />
  Possible exploits: Clicky aggro items and rootable mobs. Depending on how significant this bonus is, rooted mobs might be best tanked by a monk standing right on top of the mob. Also, clicky stun or snare items could allow the monk to tank some targets that they really shouldn't be able to. These aren't huge concerns, really, but something to think about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A melee class taking 2/3 the damage of a caster class (with 300 less) ac sounds pretty reasonable.<br />
<br />
A melee class getting hit HARDER (when it gets hit), than that caster class, is NOT reasonable.<br />
<br />

You wear plate, so do clerics.<br />
<br />
You taking 2/3 the damage of a cleric (with 300 AC less than you) sounds pretty reasonable.<br />

This is why I like the idea of a disc that disengages once any offensive action is taken, a`la Healing Will. It could have a fast refresh, low endrance use, and give a high bonus to avoidance, plus that near-complete immunity from behind stuns, but disengage the moment somebody casts a spell, ripostes/blocks/parries an attack, or for that matter, turns on an attack.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: The misinformation is that you want people to believe you take more damage than druids by posting parses suggesting that because you mitigate less, you take more damage. The distinction you make is not clear enough, and people believe you are hiding things in order to prove your point.<br />
<br />
If you hadn't even shown a parse, more people would have been willing to believe you if you simply said &quot;We do take less damage than druids over time, however, when we get hit, we get hit for more damage than your average druid will take, and since we are a melee class, this does not make sense. Druids shouldn't get hit for less per hit than we do, they wear the same kind of armor&quot; etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Personally, I say the fact that druids mitigate better than a Monk is a flaw that needs to do be addressed not by increasing the power of Monks, but decreasing the power of Druids, as well as Int casters. For the love of god, put a silk sheet on your hand and then smash it with a rock. There's no fucking way a caster of any sort (except Clerics) should take less damage than a melee class on the premises of gear alone.</div></div><hr />

  NO THEY WOULDN'T. They take a full 30% more damage than you do. They avoid MUCH less. They would die much, much more than you. You act like mitigation somehow has a benefit beyond the damage you take. It doesn't. Avoidance and mitigation do the same thing: DECREASE incoming damage. They do it in different ways, sure, but it's the same end result. Neither work 100% of the time. If you were refering to, say, shielding vs avoidance then it'd be a different ball game. But we're not. Monks take less damage than druids, therefore survive longer in battles. Period. This is the misinformation you're spreading; that your avoidance doesn't help you do anything. It's a lie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason a druid takes 30% less damage than a monk does is BECAUSE of the superior avoidance of the monk.<br />
<br />
So if both were standing toe-to-toe with the mob, the monk would last WAY longer than the druid.  <br />
<br />
While running away, subtract the avoidance gained from block, riposte, and dodge, and you get what he means.<br />
<br />
While running away (pulling), the monk DOESN'T avoid any better than the druid, and gets hit HARDER due to poorer mitigation.  <br />
<br />
So yes, a druid would be a better puller than a monk.  They could lull more than one mob, effectively singly pulling more often than a monk.  They would survive running that single pull back to the group more often than a monk because they get hit at exactly the same rate, but for less damage.<br />
<br />
The tables would turn as soon as the druid turned around and hit attack.  Then the monks avoidance advantage would again come into play, and the druid would get pasted.<br />

When was the last time you rooted a boss type mob? And i don't see how clickys could work? Maybe when tanking a moss snake. Next time your tanking try holding agro with just your clickys.<br />
<br />
Let me ask this question, If Monks could mitigate as well as warriors (mitigate means take damage not tank) BUT.. big but here, Monks could  not tank as well because they could not sustain agro worth crap and their low hp made them non viable for the CHeal. Example more mana effeciant to Cheal a 10k hp tank over a 7k hp monk. Would that be a problem? As i see it we won't be stepping on your toes, I under stand the suggestions about no attack defense improvements and discs and all but would the fix i just mentioned work?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid is missed 37.7% with 1565 AC<br />
Monk is missed 47.2% with 1854 AC<br />
<br />
Percentages DO NOT include avoidance skills.  <br />
<br />
So yes, with 300 more AC I get missed just under 10% more than the druid and still get hit harder.  So yeah, it might even out that we'd survive about the same, if I had that 300 more AC.</div></div><hr />

I just said i don't want to be a tank, the onlyl agro i need is to initialy get the mobs attention to pull, after that you can have my agro. Give me no agro, you can have it, just let me take some freaking damage. <br />
<br />
the game is not to be without risks, pulling is one of the more dangerous things and needs tools, giving monks negative aggro is not a good thing it removes any common sense required from monks in raid content, warrior on the bad mammy jammy, rampage established, we're just waiting a sec for warrior to build aggro, but wait! go ahead and put the team of monks on it, they'll do way more dps then the warrior and never get aggro even if the warrior has bad rng and gets no proc.  But again, it's only a issue that takes any thought out of monk actions relative to the tank.<br />
<br />
in lower content where anyone should be able to tank a monk would not be able to because of this aggro mod on them.<br />
<br />
Now as to one little point I have to address..<br />
For the love of god, put a silk sheet on your hand and then smash it with a rock. <br />
<br />
Even silk can be very strong if woven right, read bullet proof vests.<br />
<br />
There's no fucking way a caster of any sort (except Clerics) should take less damage than a melee class on the premises of gear alone. <br />
<br />
a druid in time gear should mitigate better then a warrior in crusty=p</div></div><hr />

DPS is a ratio of damage taken / second.  <br />
<br />
It takes into account avoidance AND mitigation.  <br />
<br />
The parse we're looking at takes into account avoidance AND mitigation.<br />
<br />
What we're talking about is pulling, where my back is to the mob.<br />
<br />
For the comprehesion impaired (Haass) this means:<br />
<br />
NO BLOCK<br />
<br />
NO RIPOSTE<br />
<br />
NO DODGE<br />

So you trying to bluster and swear and point to the DPS numbers AGAIN, is proving that you, once again, aren't looking at the big picture.</div></div><hr />

yeah it's the whole difference between kinetic energy of fast projectiles and slow objects hehe.  I'm not saying int casters should mitigate better, but saying they shouldn't because it's silk when we're talking about a game with magic is a bit dense.  The real reasons should be int casters should have higher utility or DPS then melee and as such should take hits way worse.</div></div><hr />

Or do you perhaps take a round of two of damage and then get out of melee range as you bring them back?  Because it sounds to me that you're attempting to justify an increase in monk mitigation based primarily on brief contact with a mob while pulling.  And you're trying to claim that in a pull situation a Druid would take less damage than a Monk, yet even your numbers don't support that.  You've assumed that the difference in AC is what is causing the differences in percentage of hits landed.  I don't see that as necessarily a given.</div></div><hr />

We could just as easily say that magic imbued silk is stronger than the mightest plate the universe has ever seen and that a Monk wearing it is impervious to all attacks, physical and magical.  But that sure wouldn't create a well balanced game environment for plate tanks, now would it?<br />
<br />
Bottom line is this, from a game balance perspective Monks are granted certain abilities.  They are also denied certain abilities.  One of the abilities they are denied is the ability to mitigate like a plate tank.  So what if you can come up with some fantasy rational about why they could?  It doesn't matter, because it has nothing to do with the game.<br />
<br />
Could Monks be a tank class?  Sure they could, if that's what SoE decided to do.  But then so could the Enchanter class, if that's what SoE decided to do.  Most people don't see an Enchanter as a &quot;tank&quot;.  It's not part of their vision of an Enchanter.  Just as most people don't see a Monk as a &quot;tank&quot;.   SoE could certainly shove Monk tanks down the player base's throats, but so far they don't seem inclinded to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A melee class getting hit HARDER (when it gets hit), than that caster class, is NOT reasonable.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're fine with the current average DPS that monks take relative to other classes and are only complaining about average hit being too high then lobby to get your avoidance nerfed by the same amount that you want your mitigation increased by and I doubt anyone will oppose it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Put it in terms close to home....<br />
<br />
You wear plate, so do clerics.<br />
<br />
You taking 2/3 the damage of a cleric (with 300 AC less than you) sounds pretty reasonable.<br />
<br />
But if YOU were getting hit HARDER than the cleric (IE: for higher max damage), you wouldn't raise an eyebrow, eh?<br />
<br />
The current DPS I take vs a cleric in similar gear is about right IMO.  If they boosted my avoidance and nerfed my mitigation to where clerics take less damage per hit but the average DPS I take relative to a cleric remained the same I really wouldn't care much.<br />
<br />
Mitigation and avoidance are the 2 components involved in how much DPS you take over time.  DPS taken over time is the important stat.  They could make it so I take max damage every hit and I wouldn't care as long as my avoidance was high enough to compensate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on the magic that's empowering either item.<br />
<br />
What's funny is in the very next post, Glatius, while trying to agree with you, makes that very point ... <br />
<br />
&quot;We could just as easily say that magic imbued silk is stronger than the mightest plate the universe has ever seen and that a Monk wearing it is impervious to all attacks, physical and magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only way to really figure out which magic item is stronger is to go by the stats on those very magic items.<br />
<br />
So an AC 60 breastplate, regardless of the material it's made out, should protect like an AC 60 breastplate. Just because one is silk and one is plate, doesn't make a difference. Because it's magical silk, empowered by some very powerful enchantments, making it protect as well as it does.<br />
<br />
The items themselves work out their own powerlevels.<br />
<br />
But make no mistake ... magic is empowering them. And that's why &quot;but it's silk, and I'm wearing plates!&quot; doesn't hold up. And never has. It's magic silk. Magic plate.<br />
<br />
That's why, in your magic plate, you can run around as free as a bird and jump in the water and not sink.<br />
<br />
It's magic.</div></div><hr />
