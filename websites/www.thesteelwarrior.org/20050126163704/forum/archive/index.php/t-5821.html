<br />
did a search but couldnt find what I'm looking for, so here goes...<br />
Started a warrior and got him to 25, I play him with my wife Cleric and need some advice on weapons, theres so many about that gets quite confusing :)<br />
I'm using a Centi short sword and a barnacle axe for dual wield, also have a jade mace but 1hb only at 40 atm. Since i mainly duo, I'm looking for a setup that gives me max DPS. The general consensus here seems to be CHoS and Bloodsworn but they both have rec level of 56...<br />
<br />
Please help<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

Ignore the rec level, it is mass broken.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah go for that combo.  The recommended lvl doesnt do shit for the dmg output.  It still hits like its a 13 or 12 dmg weapon even if it says its only 4 or so.  So you will be hitting well and hopefully procing well too.  I use on my war at lvl 58 and I love them.  Have the Chos in main and Sotbs in offhand.</div></div><hr />

I got one on a level 6 gecko on quellious.  The thing procs at level 1 and is the bomb for those levels w/ temp.  He was killing in the pit at 4 taking on 1-2 red dons at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Save up for a War marshalls bladed staff, awesome dps and only around 4 or 5k on most servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CHoS/SotBS if you can, as everyone else has said. If you don't have enough, I wouldn't go with 2 lammy's though. There are plenty of weapons with better ratios, that are as fast or faster nowadays, and are around the same price. And anyone who off-hands a lammy should reroll as a caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Random thought:  sheesh, I remember when lammies were uber...when I was level 43 with one and thought I was the big dawg =P<br />
<br />
For lower levels, go with speed.  when you hit 20-25, wurmy is a great main hand weapon.  Big damage is best til your mid 40's, then you damage bonus is good enough to really change your DPS, and speed will out damage the venerable old wurmy.</div></div><hr />
