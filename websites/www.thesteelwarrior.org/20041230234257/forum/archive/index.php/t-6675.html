<br />
Uhh, it's a lot less.  I think it's somewhere near 2% for warriors.</div></div><hr />

With cleave I bracer on top of that it might have been 8% or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pulled up a log of an old raid where I would have been tanking mobs in HoT.  (On work computer)  Around .3 percent of my hits were crits.  <br />
<br />
That seems awfully low.  Wonder if my log is screwed up somehow.  <br />

Defensive turns off your ability to crit, so if you were defensive the majority of fights, you won't be critting.<br />
<br />
My response was to Haass <br />
<br />
The question was about BASE.  I answered about BASE.  Did I need a response?</div></div><hr />

If you don't have the answer don't post.  IE if someone asks about base crit rate, no reason to post your crits + cleave + aa.  it's unconstructive just like some of the other dribble.<br />
<br />
Steelwarriors however is a fountain of knowledge and that's why I come here.  I did not know base crit rate and was trying to enlighten some folks over at the goberserker  board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">quick note, if you have your aa's maxed, and can't untrain, you can just compare logs with non wars with crits maxed, they should be in theory show the base rate by say paladin crit rate - war crit rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to the internet where threads get hijacked.  Some of the best threads are the ones that evolve from the original question onto another similar topic.<br />
<br />
Other pure melee classes get ~ 5.1 to 5.5% crit rate with CF3/Fota3 so just take a warrior w/o any discs used and get their crit rate (with 305 dex) and subtract the data other classes crit at and you will get the base crit rate, approximately.</div></div><hr />

Fuckin pisses me off to no end when everyone bitches about &quot;Their threads&quot; and how their off topic.</div></div><hr />

is max crit aa's = 10% or whatever it was, is a total retard waisting everyones time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how you &quot;berserkers&quot; conduct yourselves over at goberserker, but welcome to Steel Warrior.  Here we generally provide whatever information we have, and gather information about a topic.  Perhaps surprisingly, we warriors generally don't throw such thinly veiled insults at each other as &quot;rock heads&quot;, &quot;dribble&quot;, or &quot;retard&quot; when the information doesn't exactly match what we asked for.  But maybe that's because the &quot;rock heads&quot; all left to play the new melee class du jour.</div></div><hr />

No it isn't a waste of time - what you've got there is a baseline to start making determinations from.  Max crit AA's = 10% tells yer that the base rate is somewhere under 10%.  You could read up on the AA's and see which ones give a specified modifier, subrtact that and work from there.  If you can think a little,  you'll often be rewarded by finding the answers you sought within the answers you received.</div></div><hr />

Whups!  The morning coffee hasn't kicked in yet, I'm not paying enough attention to myself.</div></div><hr />
