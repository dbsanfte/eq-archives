<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you were in thesteelwarrior channel about a week or so ago we were talking about getting the most AC out of augs and stuff.  I decided to see if it was possible to break 3k AC unbuffed.  Well after moving augs and adjusting gear, I made a high end warrior with over 3k unbuffed and I did NOT use a shield.  I felt that using a shield would be too easy.  Here you go. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=696340</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Improvements... epic 1.5 instead of Dem's, change Lodestar, lots of highend time range with &lt; AC, Earhoop kinda low.<br />
<br />
Altogether good, if you could get the augs =P not very likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually this warrior would have a little less than 3k AC with how magelo currently calculates AC, you entered the data for the charm wrong, instead of just putting the charm at 200%, you need to put the charm and 100% and emblem at 100%, the charm has 15 more raw AC than it should.  Still, Magelo doesn't seem to be calculating 65+ AC correctly yet, so this charachter would still have over 3k in-game.</div></div><hr />
