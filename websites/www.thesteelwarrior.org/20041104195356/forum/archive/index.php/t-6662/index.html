<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lanabin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend is taking a break so I am playing his L65 warrior now. I've never really played a plate tank class and I would like to ask some questions.<br />
<br />
Here is the magelo link http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=184358<br />
<br />
The BoC and AoW helm have been returned to guild bank. My choice of weapons are either <br />
<br />
1. dual wield <br />
<br />
Acrylia Handled Broadsword<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />

Slot 1, type 4: emptyDone<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Or 2 . use<br />
<br />
Stone Etched War Sword<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  <br />
Skill: 2H Slashing  Atk Delay: 30<br />
DMG: 45  AC: 35<br />
STR: +15  DEX: +25  STA: +20  WIS: +18  <br />
INT: +18  HP: +185  MANA: +185  SV DISEASE: +18  <br />
SV POISON: +18<br />
Required level of 65.<br />
Effect: Rune III (Combat)<br />
<br />
with an Anger III aug from LDON<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel that the Stone Etched War Sword is a better choice for tank but I am not sure how good this weapon is, especially compared to the old BoC/Vyzh combo. <br />
And which one should I use DPS wise? <br />
<br />
Also I am looking for cheap replacements for helm (using a senseless now), wrist , arm and shoulder. Obviously I am not going to get raid quality gears since he is not in active list anymore. But with my own small group ( war + beastlord + cleric) and a few friends I wonder if I could camp or bazaar-shopping some better +hp gears ? LDON gears are out of the question because eventually I am expecting my friend to be back and LDON armos are inferior to the elemental ones he is going to get.<br />
<br />
Also it seems my friend has focused on offensive aa (he is not the MT in our guild and he loves to see big hit numbers). Now I am working on CA, CS, LR, ID etc. Any suggestions on aa route will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Muurlat McKrom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SEWS is the absolute win. i never every have a problem holding my aggro or gaining it when need be.also, ive never taking aggro when i shouldnt be so that weapon isnt really hard to control. <br />
<br />
i also am a firm believer that damage done to the tank that is missed, dodged, parried, reposted is damage that is fully mitigated. so i recommend that you go ca, lr, cs, id. but if you havent knocked out your hp aa's. get those done before all, with the exception of sturdiness 4 and 5, wait till you have everything else defensive and avoidance knocked out before it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally, I would use the SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Weapons-Use the SEWS for any and all grouping situations I can think of. It is THAT much better than your Dual Wield combo. It has the most DPS, and the most aggro, to not use it would be like tieing an arm behind your back.<br />
<br />
AA's-In my opinion, go with CA-LR, then CS-ID, after than, you can mix and match proc/hp/offensive/fun AA's to your hearts content. He already has enough offensive AA's, combined with an *excellent* weapon, to be an aggro magnet.<br />
<br />
Gear-I'd suggest trying to farm Sol Ro for ornate armor, if your having terrible luck there, hit up the Bazaar and search warrior-hp-helm or whatever slot your looking to upgrade.</div></div><hr />
