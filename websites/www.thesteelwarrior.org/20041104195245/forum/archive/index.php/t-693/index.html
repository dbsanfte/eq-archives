<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Freknik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please give me some options on some boss mobs a 56 average level guild can handle, 35 players deep?  I am the MT of the guild (no magelo) level 59, full set of Cultural Armor, nothing special, with Wavecrasher and Frostbringer.  We have about 10 58+level PC's in our little family.  Little history, Radir/Tarwo were cake, Lodi np, Chardok Royals conquered (except for queen that figured out a way to wipe us while she was 5% left!), Kael arena and Plate cycle easy, thats all I can think of atm....   We raid every saturday and need some ideas, any replies will be great!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would get lvl 60 and then give Derakor the Vindicator a couple of tries. He has a very low respawn(for a boss mob) so should be up most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">maybe Rumblecrush is a good idea. all matters about tanking and cleric skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Learn to break fear.<br />
<br />
The Va'Dyn.<br />
<br />
Velketor and his buddy Lord Bob.<br />
<br />
Then comes Vindicator.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No one mentioned this, but if you aren't, hit the Kunark dragons.<br />
<br />
I don't think Velk is out of the question, either.<br />
<br />
Hitting HoT yet? Sounds like you are about ready to.<br />
<br />
<br />
To work towards?<br />
<br />
If you have good attendance normally, maybe find another guild your level, get that average level up 2-3 levels and NToV isn't impossible, 60 people for a first time not-uber guild isn't unreasonable for Roy. (Yes, I know someone is gonna say they kill roy with 1 group or something... You're not in cultaral an average level of 58 or 59 and have never done it before). If not roy, at least EoS/Iki.<br />
<br />
If you can take Roy, you can take most of NToV.<br />
<br />
Look for Rhags 1+ 2 if not contested... Someone mentioned RC, DS, Va'Dyn, I think. Maybe... damn... what's the mobs name... Servitor of Luclin would be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Servitor of Luclin is a good start, fairly easy fight, drops a really nice caster mask, an FT staff, decent 2 hander, and a dagger that rogues seem to like, good source of guild building loot.<br />
<br />
Lord Bob is a good mob to learn CHC on, get you ready for Velk, and your monks will love his tunic.<br />
<br />
Velketor the Sorcerer is a classic roadblock mob, down him and you know you can do more, hes where most guilds start at for &quot;ubermob&quot; encounters, also a favorite caster loot mob, some click robes for your wizards, boots for your mages, rings for your necros, and a good source of lvl 60 velious spells.<br />
<br />
Once you down Velk, start looking at Vindi, statue, ect.<br />
<br />
Could also try Va Dyn, fairly easy mob, with some decent clerics, a high 50s guilds in mostly Thurg/Cultural can prolly swing him with a 18+ sized raid force, once hes slowed hes rather weak, hes just got an assload of HP, so its an attrition fight, good source of 100hp neck peices for your melee, and on rare occasion, skybreaker.<br />
<br />
Also, look at kunark dragons, they are a good source of lvl 60 spells like Torpor, Malo, Mala, Sunstrike, all things that will help your guild grow.<br />
<br />
Trakanon may be possible as well, its a good fight to learn bum-rush pure damage tactics on, as he needs to die fast, really fast, or his DoT will eat your raid alive, and his BPs arnt half bad even now, also a stepping stone to VP.<br />
<br />
Rhag1 and Rhag2 should be possible as well, they drop some nice stuff, GRC for your priests (only mob that drops it), and a hoard of other 60 luclin spells.  Though these are hard to find up sometimes, as the local Ssra farming guild usually kills these to spawn Arch Lich (just have to keep a lookout).<br />
<br />
Get to farming HoT, great source of gear for those in your guild not in cultural, and it will get you used to long farms which will be the focus of your raiding tactics from this point forward, farms are long and boring, but required to advance.  And the armor drop rates put Kael to shame.<br />
<br />
that should give you a good start on things.  <br />
<br />
Good luck, its a big step to start raiding harder things</div></div><hr />
