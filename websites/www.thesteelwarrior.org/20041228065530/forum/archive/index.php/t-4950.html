<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got my rampage AA a few nights ago and my earthshaker has been waiting in the bank for a few months until I finished enough defensive AA to justify getting it.  Its a lot of fun and I am glad I did it.<br />
<br />
However, I have been thinking about this for a few weeks and I was wondering what you guys think of the following idea:<br />
<br />
I was wondering if it would be possible to completely decimate every mob in HoH using a group of warriors with earthshakers and rampage.  My idea is that multiple people pull all the mobs they can to gather everything in the zone.  Then, there will be a huge group of warriors equiped with earthshakers standing invisible at the zone out.  The pullers will time it so that they all run to the zone out simutaneously or close to it.  The pullers would zone and in the few seconds the mobs stand at the zone out, someone would shout &quot;NOW!&quot; and the warriors all rampage at the same time.  If it worked just right, the mobs would all die.<br />
<br />
Now I am wondering three things really:<br />
1.  Are there enough mobs in HoH to make this work?  The mobs have quite a few hit points (I am not sure how many each mob has) so it will take a lot of damage, possibly an astronomical amount.  The more mobs the more damage exponentially I would assume.<br />
2.  Is it possible to time it close enough to make it work?<br />
3.  How many warriors would it possibly take?<br />
<br />
I know this is a really wacky idea but it might be fun to try.  I know it has been tried in plane of fire, I saw that post and that was my inspiration but this would be a little different since it would ideally be a complete zone purge with perhaps hundreds of millions of hit points of damage dealt.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would appreciate any comments you guys might come up with on this.<br />
<br />
And yes, I was really bored when I came up with this...</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any rate, the damage Earthshaker does is exactly O(n^2) where n is the number of mobs, not anywhere close to exponential.  The proc damage depends on the # of mobs, and the proc hits all the mobs hence you get n^2 at the end.</div></div><hr />

(if memory serves)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you could get them all to the zone in and had enough warriors (6 or 7) then im guessing yes. however Earthshaker has a KB so you could have to get them all smooshed into a corner or wall or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think the code actually causes MOBs to start gating to bind if too many are agro.<br />
<br />
Tho, with other fixes applied, maybe this is gone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks.  Looks like I need to find a different zone to do this with this anti-kiting code and all.  Back to drawing board...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, max of 10 there in HoH. Quite weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maiwin</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a group 3 War's on a server that did this very thing,<br />
They pulled the zone (about 60 mobs)  and all got 3AA each in 6 sec.<br />
It was on a thread here or in the safe house can not remember which one.</div></div><hr />
