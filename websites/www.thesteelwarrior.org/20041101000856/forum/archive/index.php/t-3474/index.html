Augmentation changes for Update - PLEASE READ<br />
As of our update on October 9th, the Solid Coal of Prowess, Blook Ruby of Understanding, and Ooze-Covered Pebble of Perfection will no longer be valid augmentations.  If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor.  You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE:  You MUST have some open inventory space to hold these items!  Also, if you zone with those items on your cursor, they will disappear.  So when you log in before the update, make sure you have some free space in your inventory.  And when you log in after the update, make certain to get those items off your cursor and into your inventory.<br />
<br />
This change is happening due to an issue with some of the new LDoN items.  These three augmentations will be replaced with three similar augmentations that fit into slot 7 or 8.  Along with that, pre-LDoN items that were given slot type 1 will now have slot type 7.<br />
<br />
Essentially, this will mean no change for those with these augmentations in their pre-LDoN items.  It will, however, restrict the use of multiples of these augmentations on LDoN items.  We apologize for the changes, but these items needed to be more restricted to help maintain game balance.<br />

Lol. how about those spent their points and bought items like nro 1492 BP in hope to make a hp 210 BP.<br />
After the patch, if found out only can add 1 x hp 40 aug ? And the worse is that their old BP is Orante BP, 115 hp :P<br />
<br />
Stupid SoE, must dont know how to programming well and restore all the LDoN items spend if changed that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KaoraEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Still, 140hp BP, with a certain mod ie: Regen 5, Dodge 8%, AoB, or whatever you want to put on it and 69 ac, is pretty decent for many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">BP can still be 170 hp with the 40 hp augment from nro(type 2) and the 30 hp one from sro(type 2).<br />
What you cannot do anymore is putting 40 hp(any augment type) augments in Raex armor.<br />
I put a 40 hp augment into my raex arms after discovering that i had to put hp augments on the bp in a certain order or i'd be screwed (and i missed a bunch of sro missions).<br />
If they find 40 hp augments unbalancing on every slot guess how unbalancing mana = hp conversion as a possible fix would be (was posted as a rumor either hear or on monkly business).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pre-LDoN items that were given slot type 1 will now have slot type 7.<br />
<br />
????????????<br />
<br />
does tha mean all my old stuff will be type 7?<br />
<br />
what will type 7 augs be??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From how I understand it type 1 augs can fit into most any slot.  If you have an existing type one +6 Magic Resist aug, for example, it can fit into a type 7 slot.<br />
<br />
So basically as I understand it the changes are as follows<br />
<br />
1) All regular (non-time non-LDoN) gear gets type 7 slot instead of type 1<br />
<br />
2) The current 40 hp any slot and slot 1 augs are going to be removed and be replaced by 40 hp slot 7 augs<br />
<br />
3) The only real change this has is that now you can't fit three 40 hp augs into LDoN items for 220 hp BPs<br />
<br />
4) You can still augment your standard gear that now has type 7 slots with the new type 7 40 hp augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">p.s. you can get your adventure points back so spend them on something else :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can get back the points for the 3 augments they changed.<br />
But after loosing 40 hp on the bp it isnt that much more attractive thana ornate bp as i have yet to see a comparable augment to the effect on ornate.<br />
What i would have liked instead would be a complete reimbursement of points, so people can do other choices.<br />
I am about 99 percent certain that most elemental+ people who bought the bp wouldnt buy it after the change, i know i wouldnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Genwadox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sucks about the 210 bp, however, i do believe the point from the get go was to provide some good gear to those without access to the higher end armor, so at least in that regard it's a good thing. Still good armor, but not better than what those who have done all the flagging have access to.</div></div><hr />
