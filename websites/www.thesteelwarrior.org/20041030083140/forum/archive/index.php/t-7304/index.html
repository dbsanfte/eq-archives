<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slinki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this is thrown at everyone many times. But my question is about the Windworn Handblade.  I tried to do a search on it, to see what people think about the weapon and nothing came up.  I have Windworn, shortblade of lighting, War marshall, and CHoS.  I am looking for the best DPS combo.  I have a GSoT for agro when I get to 55.  I am not yet 55 to use the windworn or the GSoT.  But getting there soon i hope and wanted to know which would be the right path.  I 2 box with my Shaman most of the time and rarely group with others.  But when I do I don't have a problem holding agro with the SBoL and CHoS, as of yet.  My plans are when I get to 55 to use Windworn in Pri and SBoL in my Sec.  Was wondering would that get me the best DPS combo and beable to hold agro.   Should I just sell the Windworn and go with the bloodsworn and CHoS like everyone else.  TIA<br />

Here is my Magelo if anyone has any idea for up grades or sugestion.<br />

warmarshall's bladed staff for dps<br />
<br />
keep the chos around, and if you get a good one hander then use the one handers. there are a few decent things in bot towers or veksar etc that you might end up with.<br />
<br />
I used the gsot for along time. it is a very useful weapon. I tanked raid mobs with and I was happy with it. I was duo char for most of my 55-63 period. I grabbed fero3 and pb3 early on because of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slinki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info.. But the WMbs will out DPS a Windworn and SBoL ?  I am looking for to using the GSoT.  I figure I be using that one a good bit.  Again thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WMBS is better dps than sbol and wind-worn. Hell, i bet the gsot will out damage them aswell.<br />
<br />
I used all of the weapons you are debating at the level area you are at.<br />
<br />
Sell the wind worn and sbol as soon as possible. They just won't help you much. The wmbs is just quite good dps compared most dropable combination. Now I don;t know how the prices are on your server, but if you can sell the windworn/sbol/chos and get enough to pick up a velium gemmed greatsword, that would be a great 2hander to pick up. But for the most part keep the gsot, try to get the guk ykesha aug on their and you will doing great for quite awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my brain just crapped out, what's a SBoL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slinki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shortblade of Lighting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Took me forever to remember what it was as well. I kept thinking, did he mean sbod or cbol. Then I figured I would look at his magelo and see what weapons are there. One weapon matched the acronym.</div></div><hr />
