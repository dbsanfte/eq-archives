From all the logs i've had from aow his dps has been spikey ranging from 550 dps - 1000ish dps was the highest over a 10 min fights give or take. No way you could get away with 8 sec rot on a 10.5 tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In PoP, GoD, etc... the main threat is from &quot;spike&quot; damage, whereas in Velious it was just a matter of if you had enough to survive the sustained damage output.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it was 8 seconds + nonstop elixir, but I admit that I don't have exact knowledge.  If AOW's output is 1000 dps or less then I don't see how a 10.5k tank would get into trouble with that rotation.  But my guild is probably considered a little bit odd, as we have never done CH rotations faster than 3.5 seconds on any mob anywhere, due to lack of clerics.  We rely on spot heals, HOT, and DI to take up the slack on Reparm-like mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats his avg output though sass, AoWs avg output was never his problems. he can have some downright NASTY spikes when he flurries though</div></div><hr />

Last time I did him was with like 20 people and 4 clerics rotating on about a 4 or 5 second rotation.  The MT at the time was around 10.5k and zerkered a few times.  So I'd say wait 8 seconds would be pushing it a bit much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely impossible forget it.<br />
<br />
An Uqua+ Tank fully buffed with Vie &amp; Avoidance &amp; Shielding &amp; Elixir could maybe<br />
survive with a 8 second rotation, still i find it very very very improbable.<br />
<br />
Drop that to 5 6 then surely it is possible with a big tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
two of the kills were with 3 clerics (1 main, 2 bots) and the bots were nearly oom with 2 groups.<br />
<br />
on one of the kills a bot cleric died on pull and did a 2 cleric rotation for half the fight.  still worked out pretty well tho.</div></div><hr />

I suppose you could trio him if your clerics have a big mana pool and you get a really good DS on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A group of 6 mages have killed Avatar of War several times on mithaniel marr.  it required a monk to pull ... but the fight was covered entirely by them.<br />
<br />
mage pets enrage, so with luck your pet will last a guaranteed 12-15 seconds against AoW ...  each mage would simply refresh his pet when it died and sick it on AoW.  i imagine it took lots of reagents .. but would have been very neat to watch.</div></div><hr />

You can only Suspend one pet at a time, but a mage might have the epic and have a second buffless pet outside of their suspended and current pet available.  Rathe's Son (65 earth pet) would be a better tank than the epic pet, though (at least I would think so).<br />
<br />
I don't think three pets wouldn't be able to survive AoW.  They'd have to chain pet it, and it'd be difficult to do.  Now, a whole raid of pet classes doing him, that I could see.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explain this please. A 1-2 sec CHeal rotation using 2 clerics and a druid? In order to keep a tight 2 second chain you need 6 clerics/druids.<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to see a mage group do this fight, anyone have more info on the Mith Marr mage group that reportedly did it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
6 mages send in 6 pets ... first one that gets aggro is enraged after 1 round and tanks AoW for 10-12 seconds while the other mage pets do dmg as well ... as soon as the first one dies, the second pet goes enraged .... while the first mages summons another pet ...<br />
<br />
<br />
they work like this in a rotation for 20 mins or so until avatar of war goes down.  i'm pretty sure they used the monk who pulled AoW to disc and take enrage, or else there would have been a wipe at 9% health.<br />
<br />
with decent to ok manaregen, and a bag full of reagents, this is very doable.  hopefully it will get nerfed, though, as it seems that any straight melee mob is now zergable with enraging pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first one that gets aggro is enraged after 1 round and tanks AoW for 10-12 seconds while the other mage pets do dmg as well <br />
<br />
well except that if the pet is 1 rounded he wont enrage (cause if youre alredy dead, you dont enrage!) &amp; i'm pretty sure aow will 1 round pets the majority of the time.  In addition, summoning pets costs mana - aow has a fair number of hps...pets are prolly doing about 60 dps on him max (since no burnout or weapons), i'm guessing that the mages will run oom before aow dies &amp; thats even provided he doesnt 1 round all the pets &amp; utterly destroy the mages prior to that.<br />
<br />
The smallest group i've done aow with is 11 people, we could done with 2-3 fewer i'm sure, but it was a long ass fight.<br />
<br />
There is exactly a 0% chance of keeping a warrior up with an 8 second rotation outta defensive for any length of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hongo</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Six mages could kill AoW np.  Rathe's Son has five second cast time + the usual 2.25 second recast.  There's no way AoW can kill six pets in 7.25 seconds.<br />
<br />
It would definetly take more then 20 minutes though.  It takes like 25 minutes to kill Dain with six mages.<br />
<br />
 hopefully it will get nerfed, though, as it seems that any straight melee mob is now zergable with enraging pets. <br />
<br />
Wrong, any straight melee mob without adds.  How many mobs are there like that?   I can think of very few.  Also, NPCs don't enrage if they go from 10% through 100% to dead in the same round...and flurry hits through enrage.<br />
<br />
So an army of mages can kill any mob if it doesn't have an AE, and doesn't have adds, and doesn't rampage. Wow!</div></div><hr />
