<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, not even worth our time.  There's very little we can do strategically against anyone else who has a mana bar.  Not worth the effort or time, since we pretty much have 0 chance of winning no matter how good we may be in most cases.<br />
<br />
I went into the arena with an SK friend of mine the other day.  Thought for sure I'd whoop up on him.  I've got a good 1000hps on him, plus a number of toys that usually make for good PvP gear (slows, snares, dispells, damage shields).<br />
<br />
Not even a contest.  He didn't even have to try.  He didn't even swing his weapon once.  All he did was stand there, with auto-attack off, rotating to always face me, and chain casted lifetap.  He easily had me to a bubble of health in under a minute.  He stayed at 100% health, &quot;my health&quot; that he kept unresistably stealing (175 unbuffed MR did nothing to stop them), erasing any damage I did to him.  Bash wouldn't interupt him (ogre), his spell was unresistable, snare wouldn't have mattered in this case, slow wouldn't have mattered in this case, damage shields wouldn't have mattered in this case.  Absolutely no way to win in a duel against that single spell as a warrior if you can't stop it from being cast.  And he didn't even use his harm touch.  Didn't have to.  Not when he can uninterruptably chain cast a single, unresistable spell that not only damages the victum, but puts him in god mode compaired to that victums damage output.<br />
<br />
No matter how good you are, no matter how skilled you are at the warrior class or PvP in general, there are just too many spells/skills out there that completely trivialize killing us.  PvP isn't very much fun at all if you have absolutely no chance at winning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually use your biggest damage 2hander (i.e. your fabled exe axe).  Make a Joust key that /attack on /attack off /kick /disarm.  The stunning part of kick (or bash) is very important.<br />
<br />
Get lots of pumice stones and use them.  Pumice runes off casters.  Pumice roots off self.<br />
<br />
Chase them around and joust.  Get ready to use your Mightystrike when you go berserker.   Use /fortitude if you need to pumice while getting hit.  Use /furious if rooted with lots of pets or monks on you.  Use Warlord's tenacity if getting mezzed a lot.<br />
<br />
You wont beat Sk's or bards.  But in mass pvp we are usually a low priorty target so we get to run around swinging a lot.  Even in small pvp, they really have to kill your healer first or they are just wasting their time hurting you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors do not suck in PvP.  I spent four years on a PvP server, I know.<br />
<br />
It used to be that casters ruled, root could often stick, most spells would stick.  Then came the damage nerf, spell damage was reduced 33%, or 1/3rd.  Casters still were superior in PvP.  Then came blue diamond resist gear and suddenly the playing field was level, with melees even having a slight advantage.  Then came insane resist gear and very high hp gear.  <br />
<br />
Now, at least at the highest levels of the game, casters spells just get resisted.  Nearly all the time.  A shaman doesn't have a prayer of sticking a dot.  A wizard can only stick a lure, and not always even that.  A necro can rarely stick anything.  A mage, hehe, good luck.  An enchanter, well they can always rapture, but good luck killing a melee with an enchanter.  Casters suck in PvP.  Melees own them.  Melees resist everything, have tons of hps, and hit very very hard, especially with discs.  Warriors are no exception, a high damage 2H weapon, especially the 60+ dmg weapons, coupled with mighty strike, or mighty strike while berserk just rocks.<br />
<br />
Comparing warriors to sk's also is unreasonable.  Comparing warriors to bards is also unreasonable.  Bards and SK's own in PvP.  The next broken class is enchanters only really due to rapture.  The rest of the classes take backseats to them, and I'd have to say a warrior is better than a lot of the other classes, better than a rogue, better than a monk, better than a shaman or wizard or mage or zerker.  Sure, not at the top, but nowhere near the bottom.<br />
<br />
I'm also not talking about abilities like manaburn or lifeburn or strong root.  A wizard with a good enough mana pool with strong root and manaburn owns, as long as they are only facing one combatant.  Also, let's compare PvP indoors vs outdoors.  In a tight indoor zone a caster doesn't have a prayer.  Outdoors it's closer to a level playing field, but the melee still has the advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I got him down to about 35-40% HP when he disced me.  The one where every hit stuns you.  ... took me about 2-3 seconds for him to kill me when he got that off. <br />
<br />
I dont ever want to hear a war complain about fighting any caster.  you CANT resist the stuns and EVERY hit stuns you.  i dont see how i can beat that.<br />
<br />
I would have helped a lot if when i was stuned he didnt hit me for 500-700 hundred a hit but even if he was hitting me for 200-300 a hit i would have died. I have to kill him without getting hit and thats hard to do.&quot;</div></div><hr />

News flash.... You can MOVE OUT OF RANGE OF SAID DISC.. WOW...<br />
<br />
Ever heard of a spell called Malo or Mala BTW? I don't have problems dueling ANY MORE, with time gear, but there are 65 Wars out there with average gear with about 100 MR... They cannot TOUCH shamen... Malo Slow DoT Quiesce self sit there yawning while the warrior tries to touch you, until the warrior dies of DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also just a FYI, but resist debuffs are pretty silly in PvP these days.  All other spells in pvp are nerfed from what they do vs mobs, but resist debuffs actually have their power increased for PvP.  After malos and tash your cool looking resists just got destroyed.<br />
<br />
That said warriors can hold their own vs many classes in PvP, but what pisses me is that ANY class can run away from a warrior at any time in PvP, and there is nothing we can do about it.  Chasing someone off doesn't really make me all warm and fuzzy inside, it would be nice to get a kill on someone in PvP more than once every few months.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I'm not here to convince you that you can PvP.  I know Warriors aren't the best PKs.  I just know there are a few PvP Warriors out there (Damiax, Higelac, etc) and I wanted to have another board to chat about PvP on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP on a blue server and PvP on a red server are two completely different things.  Blue server PvP usually amounts to one-on-one duels, which warriors aren't so great at (although using Renasu's tactics will help).  <br />
<br />
PvP on a Zek is usually guild vs. guild or group vs. group.  In that situation warriors do pretty well.  Get that furious or mighty strike disc off on some caster when then have their attention focused on your cleric and they go down pretty fast.<br />

Being a Gnome in those mass PvP siturations is nice too since it's easy shake people in a big crowd.</div></div><hr />

If you are low  enough on hp's they do, and tell me if I am wrong, but low hp's is not the way to walk around for a PvPer.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second reason that people don't talk about PvP on these boards ( after not having a clue) is because if you share your leet strats someone will figure out a way to counter it.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
True.  An enchanter should be easy for a warrior.  They can probably mezz you, but then what are they gonna do after that?  They nuke you the mez is broken, that is if the nuke even lands.  Their nukes are all MR based, and we have an MR bonus.<br />
<br />
I remember a raid in the old Plane of Sky a while back, where we were dueling and coffining bodies up the next island.  Our enchanter unloaded his entire mana bar on me, not a one landed.  I resisted every single nuke fully.  And this was a long time ago before I had anywhere near 190 unbuffed MR.  Probably had in the 70s MR if I was lucky back then.  Course that was also before levels 61-65, so that could change the outcome now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konjunktion</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets dispel some myths.. lot of crazy out-dated assumptions running around.<br />
<br />
While other spells like snares and roots and unresistable malises may never stick on you with high resists, the newer generation of upper end nukes have a very odd resist code. Sometimes it doesn't seem to matter what your resists are. This applies for clerics, enchanters and mage firebolts in my experience.<br />
<br />
I've heard testimony from a good team bard, that at 500 Fr even, mage bolts land far more then wizard lures. My experience with this kind of phenomenon has been similar. <br />
<br />
Some previous posters hit the nail on the head... in most duels yes, you lack the utility and lockdown power to bring someone down and win. PvP in EQ is FAR more fun in group type settings however.. because individual class balance issues break down and the experience begins to resemble more along the lines of what the game was designed for... groups. Picture a warrior solo on a raid.<br />
<br />
Sure, some lame things like manaburn and harm touch are still around and hopefully will be addressed as there is an entire PvP forum now brain storming on the SoE boards... but there's a lot a warrior has to offer.<br />
<br />
With a Plankton sword you are a monster. If you aren't in a position for that, then get a Fabled Exe Axe. Between every pass through or attack click your pumice. Just do it. Dispelling is unresistable, available to all classes and puts someone on the defensive. Caster on a drogmor already casting a spell? Too bad.. can't renew those instaclickies. <br />
<br />
With AA's that increase your chance for those two handed swings/flurries, you can potentially level many classes with a lucky round from a Plankton sword while disc'd, or not.<br />
<br />
If you have access to Vex Thal, pick up a Bow of Shadows. It's proc is a -1000 resist 1000 point mana sap. I've seen warriors and rogues kite paladins around with these things.<br />
<br />
Always carry with you the proper potions to cure tash and other poisons and diseases. Have a alternate set of hotkeys and macros just designed for PvP... Crimson Potions, cheaply purchased anywhere, will shut down all but the most brutal enchanters. <br />
<br />
It is very frustrating to see people give their upset 2 cents on PvP while not exploring any options as to how to better their experience of it. <br />
<br />
There is a PK Warrior named Hdaorfx on Rallos Zek who is time geared and brutal. I've seen 10 people chasing him and hitting him not be able to bring him down for over a minute, and he nearly killed a bard who got too cocky while taking the onslaught. It was hilarious when he put his back to a walk and flipped on his riposte discipline when reaching berserker range. People just backed away and waited. <br />
<br />
You do have something to bring to the table... or you can just be content to whine about what you don't have *points you to the monk board*.<br />

PvP in EQ has never been remotely balanced and never will be.  Pick a  class that's good at PvP or get use to sucking.  Better yet, pick a different game that's actually designed with PvP in mind.  That's not my style of play, but if that's what I wanted I sure wouldn't pick EQ for it.</div></div><hr />

Sad too; EQ wasn't designed for PvP style play. PvP style of MMOG in DAoC is at least semi-relevant and can be seemingly balanced ... especially from a melee's position<br />
<br />
but on PvP here at TSW....not really too much commotion. Most of us here are Bluebies. you might be better on a zek board or something.</div></div><hr />

Are you shure your a high lvl warrior???? Becuase that post just made you look like a fool. The day you get Mighty strike you find out about its ability to stunn when you disc it while zerk. But since I am shure your not on a PvP server we can let your post slide. You wouldnt know that you have the ability to stunn while zerk.<br />

If you can have fun in PvP and the people you PvP with are having fun too then theres no reasons to get a rod up your arse and talk it down.<br />
<br />
I barely spent any time PvP till I was lvl 65, the occasional duel with a guildy or a friend but wasnt really interested.  Then one day I was bored in the bazaar with LFG on and wandered into the arena part, started duelling and it was fun - it opened up another way I could have fun playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse I sucked to start with, had read posts about how to joust and what tactics to use in PvP, but its all pretty irrelevant until you get in there and try it.  Now Im getting better and anyone who thinks warriors suck in PvP just isnt trying hard enough.<br />
<br />
Dress wearers - easy.  Get a big 2 hander and whack them whenever they stop running and try to cast.  Only caster who ever gave me trouble was a necro with a SoW'd pet (thx pre-nerf fabled jboots - shouldnt happen again)<br />
<br />
Monks and Rogues - easy.  At the same level of equipment with a decent 2 hander you have a HP advantage, an AC advantage and you arent giving up alot in DPS.<br />
<br />
Rangers - haven't lost to one yet.  They dont have the HPs to compete, they dont have the AC to compete and they cant land spells on you.  Sure if its a big outdoors zone and they can get away and bow kite or whatever they might be stronger, but in the bazaar arena a duel should be in a warriors favor.<br />
<br />
Shamans - Spent 15mins duking it out with a time geared shaman, he couldnt get slow to land, but he kept Q up and I couldnt kill him, we called it a draw.<br />
<br />
Druids - A good well geared druid who knows his shit can be pretty nasty, the ones who try to snare and dot you are easy pickings.<br />
<br />
Clerics, Bards and Paladins I havent had a chance to duel yet, SKs own me and Beastlords are like a monk / mage combo in PvP - lost to one with the full time gear package, havent lost to any others.<br />
<br />
PvP is fun, PvP as a warrior is even more fun because people will tell you how much your class sucks and then you get to own them (SK's not included).  Don't knock it till you have tried it.<br />
<br />
FWIW in the Tribunal Melee royal rumble recently 1st and 2nd were warriors, 3rd was an SK.  Sure tactics and team work are very significant in those events, but with warriors placing 1st and 2nd we obviously don't suck in PvP.</div></div><hr />

There is just no way for you to finish off a runner.  Also, fellstrike + berserk + shurikens = no way of escaping (I'd imagine the shurikens will stun too), and even with without berserk, fellstrike + shurikens is as good a way as you can to finish off a running enemy.<br />
<br />
My limited dueling experiences:<br />
<br />
Monk - can't win because of Mend.  I mean I've seen monk vs monk fights that go for 30 minutes and both characters are still at full health.<br />
<br />
Paladin/Cleric - Neither of these are defeatable by a warrior in any realistic way (assuming comparable gear) due to their super fast heals.<br />
<br />
Druid - You might be able to beat them if they wasted too much mana trying to nuke you instead of just healing themselves and let their DS kill you.  But even then, you still need a way to finish them.<br />
<br />
Bard - I don't really think there's any possible way to duel someone that fast without Shurikens of Eternity.  Oh yeah a bard can also mez you every 3 seconds too with Ancient mez which is incredibly lame.<br />
<br />
SK - Get about 400 MR+ and you can probably beat them, again use Shurikens of Eternity when they start running/shadowstep.  Oh yeah they have to not HT you too to win.<br />
<br />
All int casters - Get good resists, and some way to finish them off, and you could win.  Enchanters are lame because they can still Rapture you no matter what resists you have, but at least it's not as bad as Bards.  Enchanters can't kill you but you can't kill one either unless you use Warlord's Tenacity or some other self-dot in a clever way.<br />
<br />
Rogues - You can win but it usually turns into a running game as they spin around and try to backstab you.</div></div><hr />

After looking at your gear, there is no way you should ever lose to a monk or rogue, they can't compete against your hps and ac, even with their slightly higher dps.  I play on RZ, and every night we generally PvP before raids start, in whatever zone we're raiding.  I am not the best PvP'er, but I've never lost to a monk, rogue, wis or int caster 1 vs 1.  Clerics take a long time to die, but they do.  SKs and Pallys are extremely difficult, but occasionally beatable.  Nevertheless, you should rarely lose to an SK or pally that doesn't have your equivalent gear.  Even with GM, chanters don't have the mana to kill you.  Like clerics, bards take forever to kill, but they dont have your massive hps and ac, and can't touch you in DPS.  If you let bards and rangers kite you, you need to rethink your PvP strategy.  <br />
<br />
There's no class a warrior can't beat in PvP, some are just more difficult than others and you have to adjust your strategy accordingly.  Warriors may not be at the top of the PvP food chain, but a warrior geared such as yourself is a formidable foe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo.  Warriors are not as bad during 1v1 PvP as some make it out to be.  I'm on a blue server so my views will be different than on red servers, plus I'm a rogue so I know how weak war/rog classes can be for blue PvP.<br />
<br />
We spend most of our time chasing down other classes but if you're up against a caster, they will have to stop and cast eventually.  It's just keeping up with them and waiting for them to cast.  Of all the pure casters, clerics are the ones I hate going up against the most.  It's not so much that they can kill me, since their nukes rarely land on me and their stun/roots are useless with 350+ svm, but it's the inability to consistently interrupt their spell casting as a rogue.  With a war class, you'll be able to bash or slam to interrupt their heals.  Dueling a time equipped cleric, it can take me 8-12 minutes to get them down to 25-30% mana, which is the only real strat to beating a cleric, which is to last long enough to use up their mana.  Every time they'd stop to cast, I'd be able to knock them down to 30-50% before they channel through a sup light, holy elixir, or any other heal.</div></div><hr />

Not strictly true...<br />
<br />
<br />
Never really been into PVP cos ive always heard warriors were piss poor at it so not done much, however..<br />
<br />
Whilst waitimg for peeps to log on for a time raid, 30 of us were sat twiddling our thumbs in Time A and a monk offers me a Duel...<br />
<br />
<br />
We were both raid buffed but neither of us had haste cos we were waiting on chanters, less than 1 min later the guild cheered cos the monk died horribly to a 2k+ crit curtosy of my Vanzier.  Ill admit that he prolly got a shock that i had a self 40 ds and didnt expect a recruit to have so many hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shorlty after that the Guild monk class leader who is 10K plus raid buffed dueled me, i got him to 9% when i died and then he was jousting, he then admitted if id had fellstrike up id have prolly have won....<br />
<br />
<br />
We not that bad tbh at the high end, with a good spinkling of time gear we can resist pretty much most spells casters can throw at us, only bards and sk's could own us relaiably.<br />
<br />
PvP is kinda fecked but ive enjoyed my limited experinace at it, only thing that puts you off is that any bugger that asks for a duel in the bazaar is usually 3 boxing and has not only a wizzy in reserve but usually a cleric as well !! ;p</div></div><hr />

Not sure why you picked my post out of a string of 3 to object to. Note that I didn't call folks who enjoy PvP &quot;tards&quot;, which I believe is what you've just called me. My point is that I hope these boards didn't get over-run with discussions of a subject that has little to do with our class' ability to tank mobs.<br />

So jump off a tower, Jackass.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaknaafein</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on VZ. We're faced with PvP every night, every raid, every exp group and every zone just getting to an exp group. Hence I think it is very relevent to our class.<br />
<br />
We are the least important class in mass pvp, when zoning into a zone to take control for a raid there is often advanced warning of the situation, and a guild will be waiting at the zone-in point to engage and try and take you out. Best move here is to send in a group of warriors and monks first - they take the major brunt of the initial attack and if the guild isn't properly hot-key prepared these melees will end up on most of your enemies target as the real damage dealers start to zone in and take them out. <br />
<br />
Secondly, hot-keys are extremely important, have the raid leader pick the most important targets first i.e. clerics, chanters, announce the target and all engage the key pvp classes one at a time. I've seen raids with half the force of our enemy take out better equipped forces simply because we were better organized.<br />
<br />
Never use 1h weapons in pvp becuase DS's will eat you. Stick and move err.. joust - keep moving all the time. If you've zoned in first and have 6 or 7 people all focussed on you keep them running around in chaos while your casters all assist eachother and take them out.<br />
<br />
In a group situation where you might end up losing your exp spot, the best thing you can possibly hope for is that the group attacking your group will be dumb enough to focus on you first. Second best would be for them to all be on different targets. Always assist eachother in your group -- just have the puller use his inc. message and assist. As previously stated, well organized pvp'rs can beat better geared poorly organized ones.<br />
