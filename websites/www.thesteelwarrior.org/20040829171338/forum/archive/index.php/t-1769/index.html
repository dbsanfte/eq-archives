<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum<br />
<br />
is now the primary way of accessing this forum.<br />
<br />
We also have thesteelwarrior.net - which is currently forwarding to the .org address as well as steelwarrior.xwarzone.com .<br />
<br />
This means a few things - first off, we are going to start providing static content once again. Second, we can start providing email accounts for anyone interested. I will post a reply to this thread with all the info regarding that just to keep it seperated.<br />
<br />
Also want to remind everyone to take notice to the donations header on the mainpage, as this has now been updated with the funds required to purchase these domains.<br />
<br />
Thanks Guys!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This post is modified from another board of mine, I went through and edited out all of the weird things I think, so if it doesn't make sense somewhere, let me know =)<br />
<br />

<br />
Our email server includes a ton of great features: virus checking, spam filters, imap support, groupware support, etc..<br />
<br />
I require everyone to either use IMAP or WebMail. If you have an email client which doesn't support IMAP, upgrade.. you're in the stoneage.<br />
<br />
IMAP Server: mail.thesteelwarrior.org<br />
SMTP Server: mail.thesteelwarrior.org<br />
<br />
WebMail is accessable at: http://mail.thesteelwarrior.org:82<br />
Web Configuration is available at: http://mail.thesteelwarrior.org:81<br />
<br />
The WebMail is EXTREMELY functionable and customizable to your liking, there are multiple themes as well as a downloadable client which also doubles as an instant messenger. You can grab this client by going into the Option-&gt;ComAgent option - I highly recommend it, and to be honest, I have ditched outlook and now use the WebMail exclusively.. I get over 300 emails a day, so this says a lot.<br />
<br />
As to why I have ditched POP3: IMAP is a protocol which uses a serverside storage method which means that no matter where you are, and how you access your email, it will be the same. Your filters and folders will be maintained anywhere. When you first sign on, there will be a few premade folders awaiting you. The Spam folder contains mail which has been determined to be spam - you may want to check this occasionally as some mail may inadvertantly end up there.<br />
<br />
Through the Web Configuration page you can setup your IMAP folders/sorting rules which are all done serverside.<br />
<br />
So, what I will need from each of you in order to get an email account setup is the following:<br />
<br />
Account Type: Forwarder or IMAP - forwarder would be if you have a current email address and you don't want to have to worry about checking two accounts, everything will be forwarded from your @thesteelwarrior.org address to the address which you provide me.<br />
<br />
Account Name: xxxx@thesteelwarrior.org where xxxx is what you would like for a username. Maximum of 35 characters please. All accounts will be thesteelwarrior.org and thesteelwarrior.net - you can use whichever you would like.<br />
<br />
Password: Six digits MINIMUM please.<br />
<br />
For IMAP Accounts Only:<br />
<br />
Real Name: This will be what people see in the &quot;From&quot; field when you send them an EMail.<br />
<br />
PLEASE SEND THIS INFORMATION IN A PM OR EMAIL TO ME, DO NOT POST IT ON THE BOARDS.<br />
<br />
I will help everyone out as much as I can with questions, please don't be shy to ask anything.<br />
<br />
Thanks Everyone,<br />
<br />
