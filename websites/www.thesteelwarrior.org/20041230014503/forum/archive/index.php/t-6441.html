<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HiPPo</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright gang, just hit it and im all excited for whats next to come! I havent done any aa's besides the 2 i just got and spent in reg and run.<br />
So anyway i was wondering what aa's to do first, great places for good aa exp, and<br />
if i should use alot of time getting that exp in ldon... I currently have about 1070 adv points but the majority of them are in nro(approx 480) and ef(approx 350). I am also asking for your guys opinion on what equipment stuff like that i should be looking out for. I have mostly fh armor ,wind worn chestplate, helm of rz, cof, stonewood compound bow, 2  valorium rings of gallantry, bloodmetal earings, and im sporting a CHoS and SotBS and have 230 2hb via GoT.<br />
Any info you guys got or suggestions/opinions on anything would be most helpful.<br />
Oh and please keep the abreviations to a minimum... I just got back about three months ago from a break that started long before PoP still not completly cought up. :}<br />
k thx alot bye :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think i wont be the only one to say stay in everfrost a bit and get anger III augs for the sotbs and the chos. unless that is your guild tells you that they are about to take you to uberspawn_01 and get you something better in the near future. there is a nice post here on the SPoD (split blade) that discusses at length why you want the augs and why the 2 weapons you already have are your best bets among tradeable agro weapons at anywhere near their price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magumas</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as AA's I would do last one in run3, then ND3, AT, CA3, CS3, PE, and that will keep you busy for awhile.  I would suggest that you get Anger II( 510 points in EF) or III ( 1150 Points) for your CHoS.  But keep in mind if/when you upgrade your weapons later your augs will go poof, so choose them wisely.  <br />
<br />
Ldon exp vs. PoP really depends on what group you get into. I'ts really hit and miss... Figure a level 65 normal Ldon adv is approximately 1 percent AA exp per mob, and BoT, PoV, HoH is about 2 percent per mob.  So a good Dps PoP group with consistant pulls will be best exp.  If you plan on grouping in PoP I would say the ones I just mentioned are your best choices for exp, unless you are flagged for Tacticts.<br />
<br />
ooops...<br />
<br />
ND3= Natural Durabilty 3<br />
AT= Area Taunt<br />
CA3= Combat Agility 3<br />
CS3= Combat Stability 3<br />
PE= Physical Enhancement<br />
BoT= Bastion of Thunder<br />
PoV= Plane of Valor<br />
HoH= Halls of Honor<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />
