<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just went through the other &quot;casual&quot; thread that asked folks for their present HP/AC.  I noticed in going through that thread that (1) Lots of people have HP below mine and (2) Most those people kick my ass on AC.  My AC is awful and I had noted this long ago but rather figured that as a nonraider there wasn't much room for improvement outside LDoNs.  Looking at the magelos attached to those other casuals, however, I saw wide variance, yet I couldn't account for, like, a 200AC leap.  What should I be focusing on differently? Yipes.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370909&amp;resize=true  I present have 1437 AC. <br />
<br />
I know and understand that I need to upgrade my bracer, my boots, my greaves, and my earring above all else.  If you look at my &quot;Doable&quot; profile, you'll see that EVEN WITH all those things upgraded (and most everything auged, which has about a snowball's chance in hell of happening until LDoN is fixed) I still only have 1554. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I had a pretty good path chosen, but with the need for additional AC, I'd be willing to take on some reasonable differing suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure someone else will come up with good suggestions, but my biggest observation of your two profiles is that you have hardly any AC augments.  I would put Blood Ruby of Prowess in every slot that it can fit for starters - it is the single best return on investment that LDON points can offer.  You've got maybe a dozen Faceted Gems of Might listed in your &quot;doable&quot; profile, but those things don't grow on trees.  From my experience, AC augments in Ferubi are far more common than the Natimbi augment.  More realistically you should shoot for the Ferubi AC augments, they are excellent, and not that rare, and a couple of them will have a huge impact on your AC.<br />
<br />
Finally, and I know this will suck as a suggestion, but if you care about AC then you really have to retire the Spirit Wracked Cord.  That thing is a nice quest reward, but it does not befit a warrior who cares about AC.  To replace them there's the arms that drop in sewers, or you can accept a 40hp loss and go for ornate, or that is one of the best slots to buy Royal Attendant or Farwater.<br />
<br />
Also remember you can buy a lot of AC through tribute (70 or more, I forget the exact amount).<br />
<br />
Edit - something I forgot about is that you can now get weapons in OOW that are equivalent to the Great Blade of Storms, but which have a fair chunk of AC on them.  Most of the weapon links that I've seen in the past week have had 10-25 AC on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your Magelo reminds me a little of the old school HP &gt; all thinking. You have some nice items that sacrifice a ton of AC to get some HP. Here are a few suggestions:<br />
<br />
5x Blood Ruby of Prowess - neck, face, shoulders, back, waist = 50 ac gain<br />
Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates - lose 35hp to gain 16 ac<br />
Kizrak's Bracer of Battle - lose 55hp to gain 16ac<br />
or Fierce Heraldic Bracer - lose 45hp to gain 13ac<br />
Royal Attendant Breastplate of Sand - gain 14ac plus 3 HP aug slots<br />
Velium Encrusted Gauntlets - lose 15hp to gain 8ac<br />
Pick up the 2 Ferubi 15ac augs - 30ac<br />
Pick up a 20ac from Kod'Taz<br />
<br />
If you choose to go with the Kizrak's, with these changes, you would gain a whopping 154 RAW ac (well over 200 worn) for the cost of 105hp, 100 of which you could get back by getting the right augments for your new BP.</div></div><hr />

Tanks that were built in the Velious/Luclin era (pre-Vex Thal) have terrible AC hehe.  I mean 3 ac earring, 5 ac ring, 0 AC range, 22 AC legs...I wouldn't think of equipping that crap now, and he was one of the top 10-15 warriors on the server when I abandoned him in early PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play Vigdis with a small group of friends from an extremely casual family guild.  She does not have access to anything elemental (or most raid events in Luclin/PoP/GoD)<br />
<br />
Sass and Wandor, thanks for the suggestions.  I have updated my &quot;Doable&quot; profile accordingly (only thing I didn't upgrade is the shoulders, at a loss of 3AC but a gain of a lot of HP).  Even then, however, I reach 1700 and cannot exceed it without ditching all of the HP augs for 10AC augs.  I have to pass on all but one of the Kod'Taz/Ikkinz augs as I onlyhave one Type 8 item (I've filled it with the 20AC Kod'Taz aug).  <br />
<br />
Is 1700 as far as a nonraider can go?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know.  It's that sort of thing that has me deeply unsettled.  Aside from the Spirit Wracked Cords, I feel like I pretty much have equal or better gear in practically every slot overall (I mean, you have a couple better in, say, the belt but the clickie on my belt gives me 25 more AC, or in the mask or shoulders) - yet my AC is lower than almost everyone else's.  Heh.  My profile shouldn't remind people of the &quot;HP&gt; All&quot; mentality because that is in fact not what my current profile was intended to do.  It was intended to yield me the best gear currently available to a noncasual.  The only thing I think I got wrong was the &quot;Doable&quot; augments.  Yet without the augments, my AC basically sucks balls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know. It's that sort of thing that has me deeply unsettled.<br />
<br />
LOL I think I have just been dissed :-p. <br />
<br />
To offer some small comfort, for a while I have worked under the premise that AC  &gt; HP, and for my HP I seem to have a very respecatable AC. Mostly that is expressed with my augs, though the haste setup has something to do with it too (which was a complicated, multi-step upgrade as the old haste itme was an RBB).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I didn't mean to be insulting!  I think that at 5.5kish HP you still have a long term plan for upgrades.  I'd say I'm about halfway done with my long term plan for upgrades and I'm sitting around 1.7kish HP higher but my AC is far lower.  This was just a sad state of affairs for someone who thought they were nearing goal.  Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, but I think that stuff will open up for both of us though OoW and then popping back to GoD. And making long term goals before we even know what the drops from OoW are may be a wee premature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 67 cleric/ranger buffs will give you 143 AC.<br />
Tribute gives you something like 68 AC.<br />
Your new defense skillups L66-70 will raise you by about 60 AC.<br />
If you forego Focus for Shield of the Arcane (I think it was Frodlin who advocated this), you get 36 more AC.<br />
Your new epic should give you lots of AC, the SK epic for example would give you about 90 AC!<br />
A new offhand weapon from OOW may give you 10-25 AC.<br />
Bards seem to give me 40 AC or so generally.<br />
<br />
So you can probably expect to gain 400-450 AC over your current unbuffed AC in the near future.  How does 2100 AC sound? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kae, I believe that cloak is obtainable with a single group (in the case of my group, typically the ranger WS's named and toward the end of his turn I AET and hit furious, then defensive so we have some free time with my chanter's pet).  I'm not sure if the clickie will stack with the clickie from my belt, which adds 25AC (so the back would be a 2AC upgrade if the two don't stack). <br />
<br />
2100AC sounds grand, haha.  Now I just have to get from 1450 to 1700....which doesn't look like a grand thing to do, especially with the LDoNs &quot;working as intended.&quot;  Anyway, we'll see.  <br />

If anyone else has a reasonable gear suggestion that is an upgrade to the &quot;Doable&quot; profile, I'd hug you and love you and call you George forever.</div></div><hr />

Basically, your cloak, shoulders, and off-hand weapon add the AC to your profile.  Even then, though, I have a couple things with much higher AC (ring mostly and one earring).  Maybe Horn Spiked is preferable to the GoD Ferubi shoulders?  But I cannot imagine dropping the cloak, even for the much higher loyalist shield - and I'm not sure I'd be willing to lose additional aggro procs for the AC weapon.  Hmm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strongly debates telling Vig that IRL name translates to George and curious if I get the rest of the benefits.<br />
<br />
Vig, I would suggest Ornate bracers in teh short term. I camped both of mine--it was quite dead in MS on Sunday mornins (when I now have class) with Idril on Povar. I think they would be a nice short term upgrade and let you beat my AC ;).<br />
<br />
I suspect that the camp will be far less busy now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spikecoat (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=518&amp;source=Live) - Girdle of Living Thorn:<br />

10: 	Increase AC by 27<br />
<br />
Belt click is slot 2 AC, shoulder click is slot 10 AC.<br />
<br />
The only things the AC on that belt click won't stack with is the Shielding line for casters (which is on that Dain hammer in your inventory, or on the Kizrak BP).<br />
<br />
So yes, they stack.  It's worth going after, IMO.  27 stackable AC click (there's a better version on the Rallos Zek ring in Time, has about 54 AC)  Just remember the druid AC debuff line will overwrite it, if you're fighting any druid mobs.  Someone mentioned this shoulder piece dropped in WoS (Wandor, I believe), but can't recall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, you put in the RA gloves for your doable list.  I'd recommend getting the Warlord's Steel Gauntlets first (you can sell it later, but this will get you an upgrade sooner and you can work on the other gear).  You won't be able to get a 40hp aug unless you go to OoW...I think Brutul got one that dropped there.</div></div><hr />

While the BP isn't much of an upgrade, the legs have 52ac on them, with 130hp.  Beat the Burnished Greaves...although I can't imagine you'd find them often or for cheap.  Also, the Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance has 5ac on it, if that's one-groupable.<br />
<br />
I was able to hit 1680 unbuffed in Magelo using those Greaves (+12ac over Burnished) and the Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance (5ac on it), but without any VP loot that you have.  This is at 65, since they haven't updated the Defense skill so it can go over 252.  You should be able to get over 1707 with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spy a PoTime ring on vigdis?<br />
<br />
As for 1700 being as far as you can go, i doubt it.  I'm working on a few VP quests atm, and as soon as i finish my silver bracelet of speed i'll be questing the loyalist shield for my back.  I'm at 1650 atm but should hit 1750-1800 before making use of KT-Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
I'll eventually add in 15ac augs from ferubi that i dont have yet ... 15ac augs from WoS and 20ac augs from MPG ... as well as 20ac augs from KT and beyond.<br />
<br />
My guess is that total it's possible to hit 1800-1900 ... maybe even more ... without ever setting foot on a major raid.  It might not be easy, but it is definitely doable.  OoW with its shiney augs and VP with its damn fine quests make for some nice non-raider stats.</div></div><hr />

Oh, Apolyon, what's your AC without that 50ac charm and 30ac range? :D<br />
<br />
My hps have always shown to be over 200 less than they really are.  Not sure why as my magelo is accurate and this isnt counting tribute.  To get my hps at the appropriate level i buffd up my charm ... the extra 20 defense skill from level 70 which magelo has not accounted for atm makes up for the extra ac boost it gives me.<br />
<br />
My charm is way uberfied .. therefore it shows a couple extra to stats/saves but nothing else really.  My unbuffed hps/ac are wihin 1-2 of whats on my magelo.<br />
<br />
Without the charm i'd be using an EP bow with 18 less ac.  I'll be upgrading this to a reflective orb of energy + 20ac aug soon though (39ac + 100+hps), so a non-raider's range slot would be potentially higher hp/ac than what i have now.</div></div><hr />

Anyone know if these are possible with a group?  I know the Primal mobs most likely aren't.<br />
<br />
Incantator Mask of Death (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68769) - Random drop inside Ikkinz single group trials. Rare as hell though. I farmed these trials like crazy and equipped 12 people with every drop from the minis. In this time we saw 1 of these masks drop (and we saw 2 Dark Belts of Wrath).<br />
Dauntless Muramite Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68694) - Drops off random named in KT. Single groupable for sure, can drop off the first Mastruq in the zone.<br />
Earring of Destructive Essence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68696) - Can drop off random named in KT or Ikkinz. Can drop off named roamer in that first temple (the 2 roaming Aneuks).<br />
Resonating Earring of Battle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68764) - Drops off Pixxt Annihilator which is first named in first Ikkinz trial, so by nature has to be single groupable.<br />
Glyphed Prayer Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68796) - Drops off every mini and boss in Ikkinz, including the mob that drops the earring above.<br />
Glowing Bone Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68635) - Single groupable random named in Yxtta. Hardest part is getting to Yxtta and actually campin it.<br />
Seal of the Kyv (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68631) - Same as above.<br />
<br />
I would say all the drops you named above are &quot;easier&quot; to get than the shoulders, although that mask would probably take longer to get simply by how rare it is.</div></div><hr />

Is the warrior level 69+?   Riftseekers has 25AC augments that are NOT lore and go into four (or 3, I dont' really remember) different slots, and Muramite Proving Grounds has 1 that's 20AC.  This is all doable by a single group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone please tell me who drops the aug and, if you're willing, where he spawns?</div></div><hr />

I will be in PG for a long time in order to (hopefully) get the charged magnetic tradeskill items so the AC aug is a great idea. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the ideas.  I'll drop the gloves from teh magelo - thought they were from the triggered event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like Fynepisa, I too have spent some serious time in the ikkinz trials, and from my own experience, I would tell you just to scratch the Incantor mask right off your list.   It's 10 steps beyond rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know the name of those augs in RSS, Frod?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Camped Blind Hunter last night in search of this aug. We killed him 7 times, and my friends got him 3 times the night before and he dropped the earring every single time. Does anyone have any info on how rare the aug is? Did we just have horrible luck, or is this thing horribly rare?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone know if a 10ac aug or the 8% dodge mod would go better in that slot?  (I'm betting the 10ac one, but never know)<br />
<br />
Okay, I've found the dev post saying you can't put two identicle augs into an augment.  However, there's other ac augs you can stick in there.</div></div><hr />
