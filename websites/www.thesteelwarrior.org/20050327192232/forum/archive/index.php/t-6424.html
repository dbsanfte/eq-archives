<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,  my friends and I have been exping at the Inner camp in PoV trying to get everyone to 65.<br />
<br />
The stupid Sleep Walker has spawned numerious times for us which just screws with our kill rate since we can't seem to take him out.<br />
<br />
Last night we had:<br />
<br />
65 Warrior (me)<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
64 Druid<br />
64 Paladin<br />
63 Rogue<br />
63 Rogue<br />
<br />
We tried him twice. The first time we screwed up on the Rampage thing and the Druid went splat.<br />
<br />
The second time seemed to go much better.  I pulled, Incite, Furious while the Enchanter got him slowed.  I could tell that even then the Druid was not gonna be able to keep up with the insane DMG i was takin so I used Stonewall.  It seemed good but its still wasnt enough, i continued to take big dmg and went down :(  Think he was down to 35% or so.<br />
<br />
So my question is, should I have done/used something different or did we just not have the correct group to do this?  Is my AC that gimp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. snare the sleep walker (if snareable), when you are low hp and druid heal is still inc, run circle and kite it. That will buy you extra time for the heal to land on you.<br />
<br />
2. Chanter charms a pet to add dps. This will shorten the time of the fight and hence reduce the risk.<br />
<br />
3. Pally shoots arrow to pull and hence set ramp. You tag. Pally should be able to heal himself against the rampage hit.<br />
<br />
4. just add a second healer or replace the druid by a cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More options: Have the pally pull to set rampage. Have a rogue engage and use his riposte disc. Have the second rogue backstabbing and take over while the first rogue evades. Have the second rogue riposte disc. You move in, AE taunt and riposte disc, then immediately use stonewall when it ends. The mob should be mostly dead by the time you're done with your riposte disc, frankly, and if the druid spam heals you while the pally, when he can, spams and HoTs you it should go down fairly easily. The pet idea is definitely a winner as well, if the enchanter can SAFELY keep a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">clerics make all the difference in the world.  and yeah .. have your ench charm something if he has TD3 and beefy charisma (and some balls as well)<br />
<br />
we once took him down with <br />
1 warrior<br />
1 enchanter<br />
1 druid (me playing the druid)<br />
<br />
we had 2 charmed pets (1 for each caster) hasted each doing around 600 or more dps and warrior defensive tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
fight goes really really fast with enough dps.   the echanters pet was on rampage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">iirc he doesnt have a big rampage range, so if youre the only one close to him he wont be rampaging on anyone else. when i killed him i did it with slower, 2 healers, and a couple rangers and i dont remember anyone getting rampage if hes kept far enough away.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogues have a Dodge all disc (Nimble) and a Riposte all disc (Counterattack).  Both are on the same timer.<br />
<br />
Rogues tend to use the Dodge one more just as we are usually trying to shed aggro when we pop it but Counterattack has a few situational uses.  It does not hold aggro nearly as well as some versions of the disc though, as we are riposting with faster low damage weapons typically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hit for 496 max with stonewall on.<br />
<br />
/agree with the above. Chanter pet helps.</div></div><hr />
