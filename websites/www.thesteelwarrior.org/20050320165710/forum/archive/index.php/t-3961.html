<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night after a TZ kill on CT I was ask by a friend to help with Sev in EJ for this War epic.  So while everyone else went on to HoH I made a run to EJ and got to the stairs just as the last few of the raid are getting set for a dirt nap.  I atk hoping that at least one healer is left but was not the case and died with Sev at 24 health.<br />
<br />
   So I run back to EJ and zone in, start running the wall to the stairs but about half way along the wall I see Sev down by the cliff so I stop to watch a sec he appears to be killing someone but I cant see who.  After about 3 sec he turns and looks at me then bang I am summoned to him, this is after a death and &quot;please wait loading&quot; to NRO.<br />
<br />
<br />
   So I run to EJ but dont zone in and let the raid know what happened.  I get a rez popup but click no.  I dont really want another death.<br />
<br />
   Now I can see how this might happen from the rampage list but when I was summoned there was someone from the first attemp on Sev that was within 10 feet of me so they should of been higher on the RP list then I was.   We have never killed Sev with a rp tank and I was not even sure he RP'd.<br />
<br />
   So why was I summoned when everyone on the raid was dead at least 10 sec before I was and at least 5 of them where in zone when I was summoned?<br />
<br />
  If this was RP then if you fail on a RP mob, how long is your name on the RP list and if you enter the zone when another raid is killing the mob are you still top on the RP even after your death and 40 other peeps beating on him?</div></div><hr />

And if he still had damage on him and was still aggroed he might have just summoned you to save himself the trip of running to you.</div></div><hr />
