<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">having searched the board and checking the library i couldn't find the answer to this question.<br />
<br />
in OoW there are several rune types that can be turned in by casters in exchange for a spell based on the rune type. it is my understanding that warriors get an incite/bellow-line upgrade and at least two new discs for turning in these same runes.<br />
<br />
if this is the case, could someone please list the skills/discs we get and the rune required for them? i'm moving into OoW for the 66-70 grind, and i want to know what i'm getting before i end up rolling against a friend on something they could make better use of.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance  :D<br />

New Incite looks pretty sweet. Not sure what the discs do, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lucy is able to show me the names and effects. however, i am unable to find information on which rune is for which disc/ability on lucy. this is primarily what i'm trying to find out so i can better weigh the value of each rune should they drop for any given group i am in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LOL!  Well darn your right.  There's our answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">edit: nevermind, asked in the Aura of Runes thread in Battlefields.<br />
<br />
anyone have info on the Aura of Runes discipline? I checked Lucy's and other than learning it's a rune effect and recast is 900, I don't know anymore.  How many points is it?  Does it take effect instantly?<br />
<br />
I 2 box a cleric quite a bit.  I won a minor rune last night, but I'm trying to figure out if this disc is worth getting for my main warrior or if I should just have my cleric turn it in.  Any info on your experience with the disc would be great.  thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nonosassy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It sucks...<br />
<br />
It knocks off Pestilence Shock (or call of ---- proc buffs) and lasts 1 minute... In that time I proc 4 times on average.<br />
<br />
The rune is 400 dmg and goes into bard song window.  I have no idea how long it lasts because it wears off as soon as it goes up.<br />
<br />
All in all, not useful at all as it is completly unreliable as any proc is.  not worth the endurance drain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Checking at lucy it seems to be 400 dmg absorb duration 5 ticks, not a lot is it?<br />
unless of course it is refreshes.</div></div><hr />

No refreshes, completely proc based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Correct me if i'm wrong here, but if i read it right you use this and have a chance to proc a 400 point rune ? 400dmg would be ubah at 39 but at 66  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Duskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Worth mentioning that there are 1 groupable mobs that drop the lvl 69 runes.  (easy 1 grouapable in ele gear)  so a non retarded bazaar group should be able to get them as well.<br />
<br />
Now to win a roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Use the rune disc after defensive wears off or something.  400 hp is better then 0 hp  runes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zasrner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">LOL not much better though...<br />

that takes care of one hit while the slower get the mob slowed  /shrug</div></div><hr />

I for one, wouldn't bother, they all look like crap to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have to agree with Haass on this one.<br />
Although nice, none of them seem like &quot;Must have&quot; discs compared to what we already got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aiely</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have the Aura of Runes Discipline and I must say I like it so far.<br />
<br />
Of course it doesnt have an as huge impact on our tankability as def or furious etc. Its just something more we are not used too, something we can use anytime without any restriction but end lost (no dps cost like def, no snare like stonewall, no huge timer like furious) and without really care at timer.<br />
<br />
So, it stays a minute, proc like mad 400hp runes that at least cut down dps of mobs or even allowed me in poearth to tank a mob without any hp lost at all.<br />
<br />
So, I was xping in proving grounds yesterday. The &quot;pulls&quot; were somewhat slows and it was taking some time to kills mobs I was full end all the time (not much incite usage).<br />
<br />
On each yellow mobs (I am 69) I used it and it made a difference. (I was 10khp, 2.2k ac, only virtue/haste available).<br />
<br />
I didnt parse it yet, but proc rate is huge, sometimes every rounds.<br />

a DS of 2s/70 stun would be the most overpowering tool ever put into EQ (after the perma invis crown maybe) ... so I suppose it works differently.<br />
lets see what it will be after the nerfing patrol check it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">to Bulbog, yes I was thinking alike, but a DS is firing every hit, if it procs normaly (2ppm) then it isn't a DS anymore up to me.<br />
<br />
to Fremen50, it was a crown for SK and NEC only that had a worn effect of invisibility. of course it has been change asap to a clicky (Circlet of Shadow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14730) 0.1s cast time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Circlet was never a worn effect to my knowledge. It was, back in the days, a 0.1s cast time clicky. This item was eventually nerfed, as people slowly learned how to really use it, and no longer drops, though, like the manastone, it was not completely removed from the game. The item obtainable now is a 5.0s cast time invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Circlet was never a worn effect to my knowledge. <br />

It wasn't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">For Shocking Defense to have any effect you need to be fighting stunnable mobs level 70 or lower with a delay of under 2 sec because when the mob hits you and it procs thats when the stun starts, so any melee over 20 delay would just have its swing timer up by the time the stun wore off anyways.</div></div><hr />
