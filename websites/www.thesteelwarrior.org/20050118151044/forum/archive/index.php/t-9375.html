<br />
Just read this thread over at eqtrader and apparently if you aug a haste item with a haste aug, the haste stacks or at least displays as if it were stacking.  It is unknown whether the haste actually stack or not or is just a display bug. <br />
<br />
Knowing what good parsers some of you guys are, if you have access to a haste aug and can stick it in a haste item and do some parses, it would be greatly appreciated!!!!<br />

Would be interesting otherwise though.<br />
<br />
I mean, if you could stack haste items + augments it would make you even less dependant on haste buffs.</div></div><hr />

Well yeah, thats why I came here for hard data.  I trust that the person actually saw the item say 51% haste, but I wouldn't trust any parses ran by a traderskiller by any means :)</div></div><hr />

A few tradeskillers from there are highend players who run a decent number of parses (Iustus posts  infrequently, I post once a year or so, I know of a few others), but for the most part, that is correct.</div></div><hr />

While this would be a departure from the usual SoE view of haste stacking, but I honestly dont see how this would be overpowering.  The hast cap is 100%, and it easily attainable with a chanter these days, so having a 81% haste item would still onyl net 100% haste with spell haste added.  The only real advantage would be soloing, groups w/o a haster, or when dispelled.</div></div><hr />

If this is true, I wouldn't mind putting a 40% haste aug on my 46% haste bracer.  Clicky haste lasts a heck of a lot longer then shaman or BST haste that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

When they changed the effect descripition on all the items, the aug on my shoulder slot (used to be Timespin) caused my haste belt at that time to have 'Haste 40%' 'Haste 36%'.  It was listed twice and I bugged reported it after a short parse proving it wasn't doing anything, and it was fixed a week or so later.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this is the same thing, just the new augs slot different so they overlooked it.</div></div><hr />

Still skeptical until I see a prase either way, because how your described it, it showed two haste figures instead of one, and in the past two different haste items meant the highest took precident, however in this case they are being combined into a single number.  Sure, what you say may be true, just a front end display bug, but still waiting to see if anyone who has a haste aug can plug it into a haste item and run a parse so we know definitively one way or another.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we know that worn haste = max ( haste from all geared items )<br />
the display shows total haste = haste item + haste aug<br />
so the questions is 'does any aug appears as a single item in the first formula  or does the aug &quot;fuse&quot; with the item so that there is only one item (and not two) on the item list of the first formula?' because the 51% haste isn't a display bug, it means we have 51% of haste on this slot/combined item, so if the formula gets the max above slots it will grant a 51% haste, but if it gets the haste separatly above items and augs then the displayed haste won't be the actual haste.<br />
I mean, does the item list has a fixed number of item (22) or does it has a bigger capacity (counting the 22 items plus their multiple aug each).<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, if these two haste stack, it isn't meant to and thus it will surely be nerfed sortly after.</div></div><hr />

EQ Traders is not an especially good site for information on game mechanics as they relate to melee issues, partly because when a game-mechanics statement is made, it's rarely challenged and discussed as virgorously it is here.

<br />
Of course it is.  It may make sense that the percentages wouldn't stack, but until it's proved one way or the other it's only people throwing around their opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roanne Lefaye</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recall from some time in the past:<br />
<br />
The overall haste cap is 100% determined by adding best item haste, spell haste, and certain bard songs. There are lower caps for characters below level 60 on a sliding scale as I recall as well.<br />
<br />
I also seem to recall something about an item haste cap of 50% as reported by lucy data I believe; even though the highest base haste known items in the game are 46%.<br />
<br />
Im not inclined to go back and research original sources at the moment since Ive been out of the game for about a year, but Im hoping someone in this thread recalls the sources; otherwise it remains just a theory.<br />
<br />
To my point, if I recalled correctly, even if the augment haste does increase the base item haste, its still capped at 50%.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if this is a true reflection of game mechanic, I have no doubt it will be changed in the next patch. :P</div></div><hr />

Because augs aren't worn items, they are exactly what their name implies, augments.  They augment or add to a piece of equiptment, that is the difference.</div></div><hr />

The thign with the tradeskill Mod% is, if I am thinking of the right situation, is that it is capped.  You can have a 15% blacksmith mod, but if your already at 252, it wont do squat, same with haste, if your alread at 100% haste and throw on 40% haste item, it wont do squat.  Thats why if a test is done, it should be w/o buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
theyre worn haste, whether you call them items or augments makes no difference. This is no different than a mana preservation item augged with more mana preservation stacking, it wont.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well again it adds to an item, its different,  that is why the numbers are showing as combinging when you insert an aug into an item.  Comparing Mana pres to haste is wrong, they are different animals.  One is a focus effect, one isn't, you dont have a stat displayed like: Mana Cost Reduction 10% or some such, where that if you added a mana pres aug to an item with mana pres, that it would double.  If that were the case, it very well might cause the same thing to happen as is happening with haste.  <br />
<br />
Also this is all semantics anyway and until we get some parses all this pissing in the wind isn't doign much except getting everyone wet.</div></div><hr />

I think if it did parse as stacking, you'd have to re-parse after every patch to see if it still stacked, because I can hardly believe it's meant to.<br />
Concerning the tradeskill displays of mods that weren't actually there, i was more thinking in terms of the fishing bait mods. they displayed mod %, but they fit in the ammo slot, which never gave stat mods. The SOE tradeskill guys actually seemed surprised by this in a thread not long ago and said they'd look into it. Memory's a little hazy (because fishing bait mods are, to put it mildly, pretty darn unimportant), but i think they said at some later point that the bait mods were made to work. <br />
Anyway, my only point was that there have been cases were mods displayed but were not actually in effect.</div></div><hr />

You don't use LDoN points to buy the new tradeskill augs, the LDoN haste augs  are type 3  and they will not fit into a type 7 slot, so this has never been possible until the type 7 player crafted augs came out.  <br />
<br />
I will see if I can get a shammy in my guild to make me a cheap one tonight and give this thing a test since no one is taking me up on the offer.  Had hoped that someone here already had a haste aug and could buy a SCHW or something cheap and give it a test.  <br />
<br />
I will post the results after I run some parses.</div></div><hr />
