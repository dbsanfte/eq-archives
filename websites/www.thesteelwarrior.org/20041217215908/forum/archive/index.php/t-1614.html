<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey all, my friend led a chardok raid yesterday and i was lvl 57 and i was Main Tank. the higest level at the raid was a 63 cleric then a 59 shammy and then me and a chanter both 57.<br />
<br />
Anywho, we had 3 groups, avg level 56 and lowest level was 50. We were going after the herbalist and MAYBE the royals. The only problem ws that we didn't know the way. <br />
<br />
We just followed down the tunnels killing everything to avoid having to kill em later and we found our way to the bridge. We killed the Ancient Guardian there(white to me) and moved accros brigde to the right. we ended up at a ledge with the bridge behind us and some mobs in a room ahead. well 2 peeps LD'd there and we had to wait. so we decided to start pulling the other room when the stupid raid party knocked off a mob into water and triggered a 20 minute nonstop all out battle for survival in that one tiny place. The LD's came back in the middle of the fight and when the fight was over I had to go so we all ported out.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is is there any quicker way to go about getting to the queen? Noone in the raid had everbeen to chardok sadly so we didn't know. And the toher thing i want to know is what could this raid force have accomplished?</div></div><hr />

I think you were at Krokust room and should have taken a left at Bridge Keeper through the undead to the Royal's Castle.<br />
<br />
What could you have acomplished with that raid?  Maybe King.  (need a rogue for the doors.   Not sure yall's technique.  If you single kill each mob all the way to King then its going to take a couple hours to crawl through there.... the re spawn is intense.  We normally AOE our way down (love them druids).<br />
<br />
There's a back way to the bridge but doesn't save that much time if you AOE your way down... but its near zone out and need lev.. take that path and the first right to bridge then right again to undead/castle area.<br />
<br />
We just drop into the King trap and AOE more )</div></div><hr />

3 groups should be able to do royals but since this is your first time doing them you would probably whipe as a learning process. Hapens alot on new mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are three ways to do the Royals. Keep in mind each royal has 8 or so guards in a small area guarding them.<br />
<br />
1) Method one is the easiest. All you need is one lvl 62 chanter or 65 cleric to pacify all the guards. Pacify every mob except the royal. Then just single pull the Royal out of the room and kill. <br />
<br />
2) Method two is the traditional way to kill them and the pre-pop way. Get two or three 55 plus chanters and zerg the royal with the chanters AE mezzing the room. <br />
<br />
3) Method three needs several good AE nukers. Rush the royal like in method two and just AE the hell out of the adds.<br />
<br />
With the force you described I doubt you could have taken the Queen but you may have been ok with the King and Prince. But doing chardok without a single person who knows the place is tough. There is a pit trap above the King room and you can get adds with mobs warping easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way to do dok is AE like Fae said, let me explain.   You need two or more chanters and ae nukers.  Dont AE MEZ, have the chanters AE STUN then the nukers kill.   On the royals you MUST have the mt get control of the Royal or he,she will kill your chanters fast. <br />
<br />
  The Queen is not that hard, kill the king and wait one spawn in the kings room to get in sync with the spawn, buff up and a wiz with EYE target the Queen and then have the MT assist the Wiz to get the Queen on target.   Then have the MT rush the Queen's room and engage the queen on the platform with his back to the wall then have the raid enter and AE stun and nuke.  The MT will be the only one in front of the Queen and keeps her busy while her guards are killed then everyone jumps the queen from the back, the MT has argo lock by now.<br />
<br />
  We have only failed one time on the Queen because I did not have her Targeted and she took out the chanters in 10 sec.  I could not get a target on her with &gt;20 peeps and 8 mobs in one small room.<br />
<br />
   There are many ways to do this but what I have found is the more steps the WORSE the plan, remember KISS.<br />

<br />
Going in the tube near the fort is faster if you're going into the mines (herbalist), but I don't know if it's really faster to get to royals (just different).  You switch a couple of spawns for others.  Still have to fight the ancient guardian.  Could be better if you had people falling off the bridges and ledges.<br />
<br />
What you take out kinda depends on your players.  Zerg rush could work, but you might lose important people and be left winning but unable to rez everyone back.  Not the way you want to do things and have people coming back next time:).<br />
<br />
What we do is keep the camp clear, and spend 10-15 min pulling the room, then make a decision to:<br />
a) rush the room<br />
b) try to pull the royal to camp<br />
c) wait for repops and try again</div></div><hr />
