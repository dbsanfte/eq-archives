I heard that hybrids saw the glow message whenever they taunted, casted, proced, bashed, etc. while we only saw it when we bashed. Then I hear they fixed that by making it work for hybrids like it works for us. So, does it do what it's supposed to now or is it a failed attempt at making sheilds a useful alternative for warriors?<br />
<br />
Absor, it wouldn't hurt to hear an official answer if you can ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it adds 10 percent more bash hate aggro depending on the level of the shield<br />
<br />
So if you have a furious bash 1 shield and bash for 10<br />
you now have the aggro that a bash of 11 would generate,<br />
yeah I know, you can stop laughing now.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at my post about Aegis of Earth.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3420<br />
<br />
Hopefully that might give you an insight of how I feel about Furious Bash.<br />
<br />
And Tierleaf, I would like you to prove how in the world you got that idea of bas of 1 = 1 hate.<br />
It never worked for me that way. Mobs so so soooooo rarely turn when I crit for 124+ on a bash. It makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

Read more carefully, Tierleaf didn't say that.<br />
<br />

<br />
Pretty sure she was making the point that if FB truly only adds to bash agro, than it's pretty lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Noone could figure out how much agro FB added (other than Luct pct)<br />
- Noone could figure out if the FB enhanced bash agro, overall agro or some other &quot;mystery&quot; agro by the Lucy pct.<br />
- That folks couldnt really hold agro with FB shield and weapon alone (at least that seemed to be the consensus)<br />
- That people found it added agro if you used the &quot;Ruatha&quot; shield swap method...kinda a cheesy use</div></div><hr />

You can use a shield for rampage tanking if it helps your stats.  If you can hold aggro with a 1h weapon in your primary hand (read blood frenzy) and nothing in your off hand, then you should be able to hold aggro ok with a FB shield.</div></div><hr />

Bloodfrenzy and Aegis of the Earth. If I am lucky enough to build up aggro enough to hold it while MTing, I usually lose it shortly after I equip shield.<br />
<br />
I use my shield for Rampage Tank duties only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FB is only useful if you're willing to go through the trouble of swapping in your shield just long enough to bash and then immediately swap your secondary weapon back in for damage and aggro.  Way too much trouble IMO and I'd be willing to bet any extra aggro  you get from bash is compensated for by the aggro you lost by interrupting your offhand attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I said the aggro from a bash of 10 is increased by 10 percent, per level of furious bash on the shield, not 1dmg=1hate. Furious bash increases the aggro normally generated by bash by 10 percent per level of the shield.<br />
<br />
 I think we can all agree that normal bash aggro, isn't very large, so even 40 or 50 percent more of a small number, isn't very signifigant.<br />
<br />
 I ghetto bash with a stormrider carapace, and aside from higher damage than kick and the &quot;glow&quot; message, it doesn't seem to generate that much more hate, not enough to be noticable.</div></div><hr />
