<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">An interesting thing has arisen with the new AA leadership skill &quot;Health of Target's Target&quot; and I'm tryin to figure it out.   <br />
<br />
I watch as I get a successful taunt, and the mob doesn't &quot;instantly switch to me&quot; as I thought earlier.  This seems particularly true in KodTaz for some reason.   I'm trying to figure out what that reason is.   In some instances, it's clearly a matter of a mob finishing up his current task before making the switch such as casting a spell, but in many others it's completely inexplicable.   A mob will continue for some time beating on someone else even after a successful taunt or the like.<br />
<br />
Now the reason this perplexes me is that it only seems to be the case if the mob is close to the person they're beating on.    For instance, a successful taunt in the grand summonner ring will *always* turn the mob from the clerics without doing anything else, but on mobs that are not fixed in place and that are actually engaged in combat, there seems to be either a lag of time before the target change is made OR sometimes even a complete refusal to follow the &quot;rules&quot; of taunt.    <br />
<br />
Anyone else noticing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually, the only time I've noticed this is when a mob either had:<br />
<br />
a) perma root status (and thus aggro is largely affected by how close you are)<br />
b) LHA-frenzy -- in other words, somebody else is below the lha number set for that mob (it seems that LHA is not a general percentage, but an absolute value -- because I've had aggro pulled from me at 20% while I would be unable to pull aggro from somebody at 35%)<br />
c) the mob was in the middle of casting a spell or doing his debuff script.<br />
<br />
Is it possible what you're experiencing is (b) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, I've completely ruled that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's the broken part of taunt that has never been fixed. were you make the skill check but it fails to do anything.<br />
<br />
while the message just tells you if the check was good or bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe you have to wait until the next clock tick before the mob changes targets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen this happen before on numerous occasions, but not having the health of target's target AA, was never sure if it was because I gained aggro then someone else gained it back before the mob had time to turn.  I would like to see some more testing done on this one if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I attributed it to the lag between my taunt getting to the server and the results coming back to my screen.  But perhaps there is more to it than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Were you having lag with any other responses?  You can see this the most with pressing the archery key and waiting for the &quot;You have hit %t for X damage&quot; to pop up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mob does not change target while stunned.  If you've some monk/bst running around with SoTs you can get a surprisingly long streak of stuns.  It is even possible if the mob is 65 or below that you get a streak of kick stuns going by various people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think you nailed it Phant... I notice this the most when I'm in KT with a Paladin, who likes to stun mobs a lot.   Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can confirm that the HoTT window will not update target while a mob is stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Same for mezed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are so many times on a raid I saw a mezzed mob have a monk on HoTT and figure it was safe to break.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Does not update until target is unstunned, and mez is a stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I know the window doesn't update the target if it's stunned (or mez'd), but I've seen a number of cases where I had a successful taunt, nobody else did anything, I broke mez, and the mob made a beeline for the chanter.  We were discussing the details about this over lunch yesterday and none of us could figure it out.  In the situations I'm talking about, between the time I taunted and I broke mez, there was nobody casting or sitting, I was the closest PC and the only one attacking...<br />
<br />
I've come to the conclusion that a successful taunt on a stunned mob doesn't necessarily means you get agro - usually it does, but not 100% of the time.  Unfortunately I can't figure out what the variable is that's causing me to not get agro  :confused: .   (or if it's just a bug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">arf arf<br />
<br />
Ditto that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is quite possible some Enchanter just mezzed it again after you taunt it, if you're looking at a raid.  I've never seen this happen in a single group setting if Taunt works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It is quite possible some Enchanter just mezzed it again after you taunt it, if you're looking at a raid.  I've never seen this happen in a single group setting if Taunt works.<br />
<br />
For my case I'm talking about a single group situation in LDoN and all of us verified nobody was casting before or immediately after I taunted and broke mez.  <br />
<br />
I don't ever recall this happening on a raid I was on - but if it did I'd just assume someone cast when they shouldn't have (or the chanters would say I broke mez when I shouldn't have  :p .)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One thing not mentioned is some kind of lag or delay.<br />
<br />
I've had myself targeted and turned on HoTT and seen a very noticable delay in showing up in the Target's Target window.<br />
<br />
One of the most surprising things that HoTT has shown me is much less aggro &quot;inertia&quot; than I thought could exist. I've seen mobs that after being tanked for 30 seconds or greater, after Bellow and hate procs, snap aggro on an Enchanter, Paladin, Shaman, Druid, or anyone else with low HP's to return interest to the tank a second later (perhaps a sucessful taunt or a proc?).<br />
<br />
The affect of the Provoke line, Anger augs, and WA5 in allowing Warriors to &quot;lock&quot; aggro has been overstated. Players must still excersize fairly rigid aggro control.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">One thing not mentioned is some kind of lag or delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
This may explain what I've seen.  Last night I always waited a second or two to break mez after a successful taunt and the mobs always turned to me first.  Thanks for the reply BB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've seen mobs that after being tanked for 30 seconds or greater, after Bellow and hate procs, snap aggro on an Enchanter, Paladin, Shaman, Druid, or anyone else with low HP's to return interest to the tank a second later (perhaps a sucessful taunt or a proc?).<br />
<br />
Low HP aggro is a temporary thing.  Its not &quot;aggro&quot; in the numerical sense, more in the boolean On/Off switch.  If you're low hp, you are on the mobs target and the mob ignores aggro.  If they get healed, they lose aggro immediately, unless they have somehow built aggro up over the course of their low hp aggro (healing themselves can do this sometimes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">arf arf<br />
<br />
I've had the same thing happen ... no HoTT ... mez, taunt (fail message, mebbe plural) ... wait till I get a taunt w no fail message, and then engage and Incite.  Once in a while, the mob would bee-line for the chanter, altho no-one had cast, or was sitting ...<br />
<br />
I finally concluded that once in a while, you just fail to taunt and also fail to get the message that you failed ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Weird.For me with a successful taunt I always have had aggro without chanter sitting/casting etc on break.I've always attributed HOTT not showing me targeted after a successful taunt as the mob being stunned or lag.When clearing trash I often see the slower targeted when i'm sure I have aggro.In these cases the mob often doesn't get any attacks off,but, remains stunned until dead and doesn't change target in the HOTT window.<br />
<br />
Yeh, low hp and sit aggro only really have effect while current.Low hp spread throughout a group  can have a mob ponging all over has people get heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have seen it a few times. Most the time I have been giving it 1 more round after I notice it, then if it doesn't spin use incite. That has usually taken care of it but semi annoying. Seems to happen with me a lot more when starting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">had that problem today with a pally the untauntable stunned mob, and i suddenly knew why i couldnt get agro from a pally.<br />
<br />
why i had never noticed it before i will never know. guess just never looked assumed the pally taunted to or taunt was just broke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There is a little lag with HoT'sT (well, that or it is a real aggro lag) as far as I can determine.  Using a Warrior on the other side, I can often grab aggro, Evade successfully and still be on the aggro window for another round of attacks.  It seems to be real lag (and I never saw it in the past oddly, a success in evade always produced no more immediate attacks on me unless low-health) but I'm still evaluating a bit.  It's almost behaving like a per-round system, which would be different than it has in the past.<br />
<br />
**********************<br />
Ok, I lie it seems.  After walking through most of my last logfile, I simply don't see any evidence.  I guess I'm getting a perception where it doesn't exist... every example I could find *did* switch aggro, despite the window not always doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>rriibbt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">May be completely wrong, but I was under the impression there was only so much aggro you could &quot;gain&quot; from taunt.  Yes, I know that a successful taunt should put you +1 above the first on the aggro list.  But, if someone has built up a lot of aggro on a mob (say 3k or more), my experience has shown it takes more than one successful taunt to cover that spread.  Once you have aggro, of course, taunt does nothing, but maybe there is an aggro cap while taking it...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There is no aggro cap.  I've had warriors successfully taunt off me even after I have been offtanking for 2 minutes or longer, having accumulated obscene levels of hate via both spells and melee.<br />
<br />
I also think that the explanation about stuns delaying the update of the HoTT window is only a partial explenation of what is going on.  It probably does explain it in many cases.<br />
<br />
Likewise, in some situations, the person you're trying to taunt off of might have landed another aggro-inducing spell (chanters, for example) right as you taunted it, thereby regaining aggro as quickly as you might have gained it.  One would think, however, that the HoTT window would simply switch to you and then back again quickly in this scenario, even when factoring in lag.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I still think there is a broken element to taunt still.  I see this too, Frod, and in much the same scenarios.  It seems that sometimes Taunt simply fails, even in spite of the successful message you get.  I have no explanation, but it is very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think there are many things that are probably causing this, each in different situations:<br />
<br />
1.  Stuns<br />
2.  LHA<br />
3.  Unlucky timing of aggro-spells by other players<br />
4.  A bug</div></div><hr />
