<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldaur</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan on starting a new warrior on the server that will be coming up soon, and I will have a shaman friend who will be joining me. The question is, where are the best places to go per level either solo/lfg/with shaman? I plan on leveling as fast as possible to try and be part of the endgame on the new server, so best exp is preferred. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Once you hit 35 or so, try DL Yeti's. At 40+ hit up City of Mist.<br />
<br />
After that, the flavor becomes too much to really dictate - you'll have worked out your style by then, and you'll have a good idea of where to go.<br />
<br />
That list is based off of using fast pulling, quantity vs quality, and ZEM's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, since it will be a new server, are these places good for cash? The economy will just be starting out, and I want to be on top of that as well. Thanks for replying.</div></div><hr />

13-28 or so in Pal Caves.<br />
28-34 in Dawn Shrowd Peaks<br />
34-40 in Dulak in LoY... decent XP, low HP mobs, that don't hit hard at all<br />
40-50 in Echo if you can get the right camp.<br />
50-54 or so in The Hole... decent coin to be had there too.<br />
55-60 in Velks, or Teir one planes... prefferably PoD CY.<br />
60-65 in PoP teir 2 if you can get there... PoV is best.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The warrens is a nice zone, and if you can get a steady group I think it might be better than paludal.  It's harder to solo there because you have to get past the lower level stuff that will still aggro to get to the dark blues.  Level ranges from around 5 or so grouped, up to maybe around 20.<br />
<br />
Kobolds drop armor and weapons for most classes, and alcohol.  Collecting kobold molars gives extra exp and more armor to use/sell.  The stuff there is heavy though.<br />
<br />
There is the hassle of keys for selling stuff in Paineel.  The Paineel newbie zone is nice too, if you're non-kos.  You never run out of mobs to kill and it's nice and compact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first 20 levels you will have to seek zones that are uncommon as XP-zones for most players, because the common ones will be filled.<br />
That means all standard newbie zones near cities will be swarmed and all spawns will be contested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonnas Povar</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since it'll be new and conjested with new people, this is what i'd suggest- make whichever race you want, do the langseax quest 1-2 times depending on if you'll be expecting to find a better weapon by the time you hit 13, then go to FoB.  It's the best newbie zone IMO, and has a wide area of low level mobs so crowding shouldn't be too much of an issue.  After about lvl 10, enter kurns (if it isn't too crowded) lvl there till about 14-15, then hit Paludal (again, if it isn't jam packed with peeps) till 22-4ish.  Alternate places for lvl 10-24ish=LoIO (has newb mobs up to stuff you can lvl off of till 30s) Nektulos killing guards (lvl 15ish unless they changed them, and not bad for the ole bank fund) Lavastorm, Steamfront (for 10-14ish) etc etc.  After 24 or so, I'd move to netherbian lair. Lots of low-20s lvl mobs, and not too hard.  After this, hit up dawnshroud till 40ish, then move to DL. After 45-50 (depending on how patient you are and how you are equipped by now) you can move to KC/velks/seb/chardok/hole/the plethora of low-mid 50s exp zones.  After 54-55, start hitting up tier 1 planes (PoN and PoD are the best for exp, PoI is the best for money IMO) After that, it's really all about personal preference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After that you can head on over to mseru ( NOT THE CITY! ) and duo till like 30 something then head over to the dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Easy but there can be spots with higher EXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">17-25 PC <br />
25-33 mseru<br />
33-39 ot<br />
39-50 solb<br />
50-55 velks or PoJ<br />
55-60 PoD, PoN or PoI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maultar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sheesh, so I guess having my 55 tank and 56 clr parked outside charasis to try it out and try to get exp is silly?  PoD is faster Duo exp?  Or in PoD do you need a group at those levels?<br />
<br />
I'm looking for the fastest exp possible.... if that means I need a group rather than duo so be it.  But I always thought duo's were faster that groups.</div></div><hr />
