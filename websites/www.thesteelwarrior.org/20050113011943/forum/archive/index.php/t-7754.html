<br />
Thanks for your help, searched for &quot;Horror Shard Blade&quot; and didn't find any topics on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
general agreement is dd only proc = squat for agro.<br />
<br />
looks like a great 1hs dps weapon though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, it has normal proc rate mod. Delay really has nothing to do with it. It is the base 2 proc per minute at 305 dex.<br />
<br />
The proc is no extra agro, it is just 119 damage nuke.<br />
<br />
For any grouping situation where you have an intense agro class, like a necro, a good shaman, a druid. Any class that is trying to dump out good dps with a combination of snares/debuffs/slows you will lose agro.<br />
<br />
The dps from 13/17 is actually quite good in your main hand. So in the average exp group. Incite + this and good off hander. I bet if you used incite had boc offhand and this mainhand you would probably not have agro problems most of the time in groups. <br />
<br />
If you are a grouping tank, or low in your tank rot. This weapon and say a stun proc aug would go along way because it high dps for a warrior. But a serious raid tank, or even a god trial/hard ldon tank will likely pass this weapon by because of ripostes and the need for every proc to carry a nice agro punch.</div></div><hr />

Delay does not affect proc rate.  If the blade does a great job for you then it's for some other reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like the 2 posts above. This is incorrect. Delay has nothing to do with procs. Procs are set at a 2ppm(primary) and 1ppm(offhand) unless otherwise stated.</div></div><hr />
