<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The latest Harry Potter book is coming out in just a few days.  Anyone here going to rush to the store first thing in the morning to get their copy?<br />
<br />
The books have been getting progressively &quot;darker&quot; as they go along.  It will be interesting to see what happens in this one.<br />
<br />
My prediction?  This will be a #1 NY Times bestseller.<br />
<br />
How's that for going out on a limb?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My WIFE will be rushing to get it I am sure...<br />
<br />
Mebbe I can keep her away long enough so that we can spend our ANNIVERSARY together...<br />
<br />
Prolly not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually had not read any of the Harry Potter books until last year.  My wife then convinced me to read the first one.  I thought they were quite excellent, and I am now really looking forward to this latest installment.<br />
<br />
I have a friend that is such a Harry Potter fan that he actually flew to London a few years ago so he could pick up the book several weeks before its US debut.  More power to him I guess ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some friends and I are going to the Books-A-Million for the Harry Potter release party friday night. Gonna be food, trivia, probably lots of screaming kids, and at midnight, the book will go onsale.<br />
<br />
Im hopin to smash some twelve year olds in the trivia contest and win a free copy of the book :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why do the trivia? Just smash a couple twelve year olds and take their book.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In The Metro (London) today, there was an article about a truck that was stolen carrying 7000+ copies of the new book. They later found the truck empty! Hows that for anticipation? lol<br />
<br />
Personally, I am really looking forward to the latest book. They really are a great read and, as always, the movies are complete shit compared to the books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">heh that was 76,000 copies of the book I believe. Pretty amazing. I will be picking it up but probably not on Friday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My wife has Dyslexia, so reading ANYTHING is a great deal for her. Between Harry Potter and EQ, she is starting to really get into the fantasy genre more and more. <br />

Next stop - D&amp;D hehe<br />

Damn, I should start my own psychic network.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just finished the book yesterday.  It was very good and I rank it up there with book 4 as the best books in the series so far</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dall18or</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For year have read every fantasy novel I could get, but I refuse to read the Harry Potter books, seems to me more of a mockery that these books get somuch media and a claim in comparision to truly excellent amazing authors that nobody hears about. I will rush to get the next Robert Jordan book, you can be sure of that. Wheel of Time, baby!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Since you haven't read them, how do you know they aren't equal to, or better than, Robert Jordan's books?<br />
<br />
Or are you simply being anti-Potter because it's &quot;cool&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have read both series with the exclusion of the Newest Harry Potter book and I would say that Jordans book is more serious and heady writing. I guess I view Harry Potter as an enjoyable and fresh take on fantasy writing. I really like both of those series a lot but I tend to take Rowling less seriously than Jordan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">IMO the harry potter books are to fantasy novels what the Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy books are to sci-fi.  Sure Harry Potter is in the same basic genre as Lord of the Rings and The Wheel of Time, but the Harry Potter books have a completely different style and are far more amusing and light hearted than most standard fantasy books.  I enjoy the Wheel of Time books and the Harry Potter books, but for completely different reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Got the book on Monday and I'm about halfway through.  Really good so far, but I like the Redwall series alot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I was going to go to the Friday night party but to no avail.  the people I was going with went out to eat beforehand and got sick.  I just slummed around the house.  Oh well, maybe I should read book 4 before book 5 anyways :P  I just gotta get up and go pick it up at the local Barnes and Noble sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">first was good<br />
2nd was not bad<br />
3rd was exactly same as first 2........<br />
She had enough juice only for 1 book. Rest of them are just boring repetion of the same thing over and over. Disapointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i was talking about on SUPER NINTENDO. we got the book at costco. since i have a life i'm letting my sister read it first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Got book 5 Saturday morning, finished it Tuesday night.  GOOD BOOK!!!<br />
<br />
The reason I like the Harry Potter series is that it is easy reading. The storyline is simple and the writing style is aimed at the 13-18 year olds. But that is what makes it enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I have tried to read LoTR trilogy 3 times and just can't get into Tolkins writing style.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for book 6 and 7 to come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Fitzwillow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I thought it was about like Goblet of Fire, maybe a little better.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it's a commentary on the state of fantasy that the second-best fantasy series out there is written for children...<br />
<br />
(Incidentally, the best is A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin.  As different from Harry Potter as night and day, I'd say.  Robert Jordan = the new Piers Anthony.)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I mean to say that these two are the best out of the current crop.  I'm not such a philistine that I'd try to rank anything written in the last 30 years over Lord of the Rings, it's the original and best.  Further edit:  just because it's &quot;light&quot; doesn't mean that it's not good -- I would rank any given Discworld book over the leaden prose of a Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">*Gasp* A diss to R. Jordan and Terry Brooks in the same sentence?!? Blasphemy!<br />
<br />
Back on topic though, I had pre-ordered book 5 online, got it delivered saturday, but didn't get home until 8:30 that night. First thing i did when i got home, of course, was... Log on my bazaar mule ;)  Then, I did read the book. start time: 9pm. Finish time: 6am. You can say a lot about the reading level of the book if someone can read 880 or whatever pages in 9 hours. <br />
<br />
I'd also say the book was roughly the same quality as gob of fire, but the only reason I liked these two more is their length. Honestly, any fantasy book under 350 or so pages isn't really a &quot;book&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kinda saddening though, the fact that my favorite 5 or 6 authors currently writing have all published a book recently = No new stuff for me for 6 months or so =(<br />
<br />
At least the rest of Stephen King's &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series is coming out soonish.<br />
<br />
PS- Phat L3wtz and plat to anyone who tells me what fantasy author wrote the quote in my sig :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Belwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i haven't gotten the 5th book yet but intend to. i've enjoyed the other 4 and am looking forward to reading it. i can't seem to get the next wheel of time book from the library now since it's popular and terry pratchett isn't coming out with another yet, blah.<br />
 can anyone suggest a ood book? i need some humorous books about now otherwise i'll kill everyone around me, don't ya love family:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fitzwillow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Pick up &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; if you haven't already, George R. R. Martin.  It's head and shoulders above any other fantasy series currently going.  (EDIT: maybe inappropriate if you're looking for lighthearted... this is serious as a heart attack.)<br />
<br />
For a great high fantasy story with sci-fi undertones, try &quot;Lord Valentine's Castle&quot; by Robert Silverberg.<br />
<br />
For an absolutely beautifully written series (which these days would be one long novel), try &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, published separately as &quot;Shadow of the Torturer&quot;, &quot;Claw of the Conciliator&quot;, &quot;Sword of the Lictor&quot;, and &quot;Citadel of the Autarch&quot; by Gene Wolfe.<br />
<br />
And for sheer fun, which sounds like what you're looking for, pick up &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; by Matt Ruff -- it's an epic fantasy (of sorts) set on the campus of Cornell University.</div></div><hr />
