Went through the search engine and read over the posts but some were a little dated. How many people are needed? I read around 6 clerics and druids for the Ch rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda depends on your tank, dps, and cleric mana pool. Pretty sure he's been 1-grouped though if that says anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He can be 1 grouped, but 2-3 groups are best.<br />
<br />
Pull him and corner him by the arena and goto town. He can't be slowed so have a couple clerics chaining CH. Flurries for 1200ish, lots of hp.</div></div><hr />

My regular farming group does AoW with<br />
<br />
Warrior(14k)<br />
Warrior(13.5)<br />
Cleric(11.5)<br />
Cleric(10.5)<br />
Shadowknight(14k)<br />
Chanter(10k)<br />
~~~~~<br />
Bot druid every now and then.<br />
<br />
We own him. Good for pp.<br />
<br />
A warrior with less than 10k probably needs atleast 4 clerics, and 2 druids+ some penomonal DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigdung</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So nothing has really been changed on him then? I myself wont be tanking him just wanted some info for our first run at him. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's the same AoW that there was when Velious launched. A good test run is to tank the Idol of Rallos Zek unslowed since he hits for the same amount as AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So a warrior with 10k hps takes 3x the healing you need AND &quot;penomonal&quot; DPS?  :P<br />
<br />
He is a straight up melee mob.  Quads for 1100, unslowable, and has a lot of hps.  Not too scary by today's standards, but still pretty tough to 1-group.  First time I tanked the AoW I had about 6500 hps and 1200 AC fully buffed  :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably true, since that number is buffed. The 14k warrior would more than likely have a ton of mods, better ac, and groupmates with much more dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read of a possible way to slow Vindi and was wondering if it would work on AoW as well or if anyone has even ever seen it tried.<br />
<br />
Basically have a chanter and shaman duel each other right before pull. Chanter charms Shaman and puts him on mob. NPC's have the ability to cast on otherwise Immune tagged mobs. Wonder if this would allow the shaman to act as an NPC since he is charmed and essentially a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cant charm in duels anymore.<br />
<br />
Can wake the dead on any dead PC tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea will just straight up tank him was just curious about a fun way to go about it. Can never quit looking for new ways to do stuff =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard that there's some mob that is a shaman in kael, and that charming him allows you to slow the raid mobs. Most likely nerfed or outdate info :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Idol unslowed is almost exactly the same DPS as the AoW.  Some servers consider it polite to do the Idol unslowed so you don't blow the AoW spawn.  Doubt that many care that much any more.  But if you are trying it out for the first time, I recommend having a go at the Idol unslowed.  That way if you screw up something silly and wipe you can get back up and go again.  Once the Idol drops, you have 20 mins (I think?) to aggro the AoW before he desawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigdung</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info everyone</div></div><hr />

Yarr~<br />
I also have 10shielding,avoidance,2200+ac and Have Clerics with 10kmana pools ^ ~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't fought the AoW for a long time, but I don't think a warrior with 10k hps needs 6  healers to stay alive on him.  He barely hits harder than an unslowed exp mob these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hell I tanked AoW when I was only 9k buffed and like 1500AC.  It was a 2 group job.  We had 2 clerics (one being my bot 63 cleric with a shit mana pool) and 2 shamans on spots/dps.  Was pretty cake to be truthful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throag</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also have to remember that when AoW was first being killed, tanks were level 60 and not 70, it does make a lot of difference.<br />
<br />
I can remember my first time tanking aow, I didn't even have 6khp at the time iirc, and with the lack of UI all I could see was that red spam all over my srceen.... pretty scary :)</div></div><hr />

Yarr!<br />
My BoW+Shield combo&gt;all.<br />
Actually, I dunno how it got like that, I should prolly fix it =/. :eek:</div></div><hr />
