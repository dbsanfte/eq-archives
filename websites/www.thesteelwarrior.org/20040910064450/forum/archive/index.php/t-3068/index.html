<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>potranus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HiI I am very new to the game, got it 2 days ago, and I am wondering if anyone that plays on the 7th Hammer Server wouldnt mind helping me in game if I have questions. I have been given lots of advice and one was to find someone that wouldn't mind helping during game play. From my playing exp, which isnt much, I have a feeling I will have alot of questions to ask in game. So if you play on the 7th Hammer server and wouldn't mind me asking you questions during game play, please post here.<br />
<br />
Thanks.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can send tells to other servers.<br />
<br />
;tell servername.playername<br />
<br />
Sometimes it uses a short version of the servername. Like Solusek Ro is just ;tell Solusek.playername. If you have a question you can see if I'm on. <br />
<br />
;tell Stormhammer.Retnaburn<br />
<br />
Also, there is a serverwide warrior channel you can join. <br />
<br />
/join serverwide.thesteelwarrior<br />
<br />
You can use /autojoin instead of /join if you want to automaticly join it when logging in. To speak in that channel type /1 or /2 etc. whatever number that channel is. Type /list to see what number that channel is set to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>potranus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't know you could chat between servers. Ok, cool i'll talk to you if I have any questions. My name is potranus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>potranus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can type /reply to reply back so I dont have to keep typing ;stormhammer retnaburn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yea i think so never actually tried it though. Speaking of serverwide tells is there a way to see if someone is on or to add them to your friends list? like /who all servername.playername?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can type /reply to reply back so I dont have to keep typing ;stormhammer retnaburn? <br />
Not sure if there is a chat command for that. I just press my r button to reply to the last tell and it works for serverwide tells.Speaking of serverwide tells is there a way to see if someone is on or to add them to your friends list?<br />
I don't think thats possable, it would be nice tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Traydan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am on the 7th hammer. I am a lvl 51 barb war, you can send me a tell in game and I will help you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Teabrat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am also on the 7th hammer, Have played 2 warriors, played a human warrior to level 51 then quit the game and deleted her, When I restarted playing, I created a Barb warrior that is now level 61. Would be glad to answer any questions, Just shot me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm on 7th... but OMFG don't ask me anything!!!  I'm clueless!<br />
 <br />
Send all yer tells to Frodlin /nod<br />
<br />
In all honesty the serverwide channel for TSW is yer best bet to catch a quick answer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm on 7th, you can send me tells any time.   Sometimes I'll have plenty of opportunities to help, other times I'll be a little busy, but will get back to ya.    Send me a tell any time.</div></div><hr />
