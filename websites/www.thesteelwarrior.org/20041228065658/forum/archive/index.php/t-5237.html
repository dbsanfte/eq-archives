<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I wasn't able to find any data on any boards about how much ferocity actually increased DPS, and naturally, I'm curious about such things, so I parsed it on ye olde katta banker.  If you don't like me doing it on a green mob, I don't care, do it yourself.  The parses are about an hour to an hour and a half long.  If you think they're irrelevant because they're not 3 and a half months in duration, I don't care, do it yourself.  I'm posting this for your and everyone elses benefit, don't bitch at me about my results or the way I chose to go about doing it because quite frankly, I don't give a damn.  The results are valid for me, and that's all I care about.  I just figured some people might like to know.<br />
<br />
I have 2 weapon setups, Sceptre of Destruction/Copper Hammer of Striking and my Windblade for 2h.  I took parses of each before I started on the Ferocity road.  At that time I had Tactical mastery, Amibidex, Fury 3 and Flurry 2.  All parses are done on the same mob from behind.  All tests are done unbuffed, 36% haste.<br />
<br />
First set, melee DPS only, Dual Wield setup.  58.77 DPS according to Yalp.<br />
<br />
Dual wield Setup after Ferocity 3 -- 61.45 DPS.  Net increase of approximately 4% DPS.  Obviously sample set is only an hour long.  Still, 4% DPS for 9 points seems to be the norm based upon accepted values of 4% DPS increase for Ambidex.<br />
<br />
Second Set -- Windblade before Fero  59.03 DPS<br />
<br />
Windblade post Fero 3 -- 60.95.  Difference is approximately 3%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusions -- The only thing I can conclude from these parses is that Ferocity 3 is basically shit.  Keeping my DPS within an acceptable margin of error is not what I'd call a very good AA skill.  By the end of level 3 there should be a very clear difference between having it and not having it, and in my opinion, there's really not.  I wasn't really expecting a whole lot, but this was less than even I expected.  Perhaps some views will change on how important people view this AA, as all I see everywhere is &quot;Man, you gotta get Ferocity and PB, those AA's are SWEET.&quot;  This one definitely doesn't appear sweet.</div></div><hr />

Fero, PB, Combat fury, Flurry, TM, DR, and all the other off aa's, it all adds up. This is just another drop !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch, I would have hoped for a bit more though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know it's just a drop, but it's still a small drop.  At least with the defensive AA's the effect was noticable...I noticed ND3, I noticed CA3, I noticed CS3.  This, I wouldn't really notice if I hadn't trained the skills myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how much did the # for dubble attacks increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other interesting thing to consider (other than the increased amounts of DA firings) would be if you had Flurry, the higher amount of Flurry firings with Ferocity 0-3.  <br />
<br />
I dunno...3-4% DPS increase for only 9aa's total sounds about right to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously the point of ferocity is to increase couble attack,As you pointed out you did this unbuffed and with only 36% haste.<br />
<br />
I think it is safe to assume that if the same test was applied to a fully hasted (Item+chanter+bard) war without the AA and then with; that with the increased amount of swings in the same one hour time period that the DPS increase would be substantially higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste shouldn't change this.  If you gain 4% DPS with no haste, you'll gain 4% dps with max haste, you'll just gain 4% of whatever that number is.  For me, it's 80 or so tanking.  An extra 3-4 dps for 9 AA's?  It's sub par for my expectations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3-4% sounds about right, I would certainly have been surprised if it was higher because I have never been able to &quot;feel&quot; a difference after maxing the skill. <br />
<br />
It has never been one of my favorite AAs.. I remember doing a 30min fero 0 vs fero 1 parse and actually getting worse dps with fero1. Of course that was most likely because the parse was too short, but still.. dissappointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since it is a PoP skill, you should be comparing it to LD5/ID5, which are about ~5% increases each for 15 points. Ferocity is ~3% for 9 points. Sounds about right to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the most I expected maybe a 5% jump. Which is about where it should be maxed. 3-4 is  bit disappointing to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">those numbers give a differance of 2 and 3 percent not 3 &amp; 4.</div></div><hr />
