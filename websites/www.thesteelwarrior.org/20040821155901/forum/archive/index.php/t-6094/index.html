Combines work again!<br />
Melee Part II!<br />
A new story has been added to your storybook!<br />
<br />
<br />
The grammar police have invaded EQ and they have made many minor spell, item and quest text fixes that are too numerous to list here.  <br />
<br />
We'd like to thank all of the players that took time to provide feedback regarding the melee changes.  We'd also like to send a special thanks to all of the players that helped us test the additions on the Test and Beta servers. All of the input we received helped to shape the improvements you've seen in the melee classes.<br />
 <br />
Please continue to give your feedback on the melee system or anything else that you feel requires attention. It does make a difference.<br />
<br />
Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes.<br />
<br />
- Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use.<br />
- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines.<br />
- Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage.<br />
- Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for aggro management. <br />
- Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool for pulling.<br />
- Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes.<br />
<br />
The endurance system and the separation of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add interesting and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes.  You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the game progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities to effectively balance class power.  We will continue to evaluate the melee system for both balance and enjoyment.<br />
<br />
We will also continue to review and make changes to each individual class as needed.  Class balance is an important part of any multiplayer game and requires constant attention.<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping make EverQuest a great game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
------------------------<br />
We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics.  The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future.<br />
Several Gates smithed weapons have had their damage and delay adjusted to be more in line with the difficulty in crafting them.<br />
The Copper Hammer of Striking will no longer proc for wielders below level 50.<br />
The Wailing Coral Staff is now two handed blunt.<br />
Bolas are now one-handed projectile rather than ammo.<br />
Bola ranges have been adjusted slightly.<br />
All bolas that can proc will now do so.<br />
All items that had the &quot;Cleave&quot; series of effects removed, have had them returned.<br />
<br />
The drop rate for the following Epic Quest items has been increased slightly:<br />
<br />
- Essence of a Vampire<br />
- Decrepit Hide<br />
- Staff of Elemental Mastery (earth)<br />
<br />
<br />
Expedition zones<br />
-------------------------<br />
You will now have to wait 5 minutes before you are able to accept another expedition zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskills<br />
-------------------------<br />
In order to correct many of the issues with the new tradeskill interface it was necessary to remove all learned and favorite recipes.  However the system should now work better overall.<br />
The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well as the price for any item made from them, have been reduced.<br />
Rainbow Trout should now be tradeable.<br />
If you are not a gnome, you should no longer be able to tinker with a deluxe toolkit kit.  If you are a gnome, please tinker away.<br />
You should now be able to properly search for recipes.<br />
The trivial level for brewing Fish Wine has been adjusted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Berserkers<br />
-------------------------<br />
Some berserker abilities have had their endurance cost changed.<br />
The duration of Confusing Strike has been reduced.<br />
Berserkers should no longer be told that they can bash at level 6.  <br />
The berserker guildmaster in the Plane of Knowledge has been taught throwing and parry and is ready to train berserkers in their use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
-------------------------<br />
Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often.<br />
Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly.<br />
The shadow knight Ancient Spell: Bite of Chaos should now work as intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
NPC's<br />
-------------------------<br />
Hierophant Granix should now give the correct text in Cabilis.<br />
Trimdet Trueheart in Abysmal Sea is less of a snob and should now speak with you correctly.  <br />
If you tell Brevik Kalaner in Abysmal what items you [need back], he will return to you any items you've just given him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tribute<br />
-------------------------<br />
A few items have had their tribute value adjusted.<br />
Gift of the Enchanters should now work correctly.<br />
You should no longer be able to donate containers with items inside for favor.<br />
Persistent Boon should now give the proper effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternate Advancement<br />
-------------------------<br />
Dire Charm will no longer reset after being resisted as the ability was successfully initiated.<br />
Dire Charm should now reset when used on an NPC that is too high in level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
-------------------------<br />
Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic.<br />
The monk &quot;Phantom&quot; line of abilities should no longer be resisted in the level 65 &quot;hard&quot; LDoN Adventures.<br />
The rogue's &quot;Assassin's Strike&quot; skill line ability will be re-introduced with the next update.<br />
The Shining Bloodstone will now be restricted to 2-handed weapons. Any who have placed this augmentation in a 1-handed weapon will find the augmentation on their cursor when they log in. If you find that you have no practical use for the 2-handed augmentation, please petition and a suitable 1-handed replacement will be made available to you.<br />

<br />
now read it again<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I personaly would have written: &quot;....increasing the desirability and relative power of pure mele classes:&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Umm... maybe you need to read it again.. did you miss the part at the VERY top under headlines:<br />
<br />
Melee Part II! <br />
<br />
And NO reference below as to what this was about BUT a recap of what has already happened, a nerf to zerkers and a fix to a GoD ability for monks......<br />
<br />
I will withhold final judgement until I can log in but this looks to me like marketing decided +END = MeleeII which woudl be pretty much completely useless to 90% of us (at least to 100% of wars in my guild... we have no prob with running out of END).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes.<br />
<br />
The Melee Part II fix has been cancelled. They're just being misleading that Part 2 was all the stuff that's already in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We're fine. Quit your fucking whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was +END added to items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Originally posted by Dintorr <br />
Was +END added to items?  <br />
To at least some stuff, yes.  Almost all of my potime items have endurance in equal proportion to mana, as does that shield from fire.  Not sure about  lower/mid-level items, or warrior-specific gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We're fine. Quit your fucking whining. <br />
<br />
Considering they promised more, I think there is a reason to be unhappy that they haven't delivered.  And while we are pretty well balanced now, a little utility to make the class a bit funner and give us more to do than hit attack would be nice.  Not near hybrid utility of course, just some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We're fine. Quit your fucking whining.<br />
<br />
Show me where I was whining.<br />
<br />
No, I was simply stating facts. If I was ACTUALLY whining, I would have made a personal comment about how bad it was or how much it sucks, or even that I disliked it.<br />
<br />
Kindly get your head out of your ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">how about the weapon effects that trail the weapons rytan said something about, that'd be cool atleast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We're fine.  <br />
<br />
Agree.  Our class finally works.<br />
<br />
Quit your fucking whining. <br />
<br />
Completely unneeded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ornate plate pieces (Kizrak's) also have END now, roughly equivalent to about half the HP's they each give.<br />
<br />
I was more taken aback by the changing of effects like Haste, Aura of Battle, Vengeance, Flowing Thought, etc., into stats.  I had to explain many times last evening that &quot;no, the effects were not removed, just changed to display differently&quot;. On the one hand, it's a lot easier to see what it does now. On the other, my Stonewood Compound Bow sounded more badass when it had Aura of Battle on it rather than 'attack: +10, regeneration: +2'. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Show me where they nerfed zerkers.  I mean they nerfed lowbies ability to use a rec weapon and still hit for full but other than that I dont see how zerkers were nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.  <br />

Aggro is so trivial now that I can 2-box in hard LDoNs and spend most of my time watching TV because all I have to do is /assist the puller, taunt and incite, turn on attack, and then look back 30 seconds later and hit my CH button.  If anything they went too far adding WA.</div></div><hr />

Giving us vastly better agro did make it boring but the alternative was being almost always passed up for groups to paladins so I guess it is better this way.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think that they really first screwed up when they made those stupid books in PoK and then made it totally dumbed down when they gave all newbies a sense heading skill of 200 to start.  It made getting around way too easy for idiots and allowed them to get to levels they were once too stupid to achieve.  Now the morons are overrunning the game and it has lost a lot of the coolness it once had.  As it is now, EQ is extremely boring compared to when I first started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so your saying 200 free sense heading is the bane of where all the idiots come from? ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">200 sense heading, starting out with a container and more food and water and standing in front of the guild trainer you're supposed to give your starting note too, no CR until level 11, faster xp in the lower levels (paludal caverns anyone?), PoK books, outdoor level treadmills, graveyards.......Did I leave anything out?<br />
<br />
All of these things together were the primary source of all the idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There have always been idiots.  There will always be idiots.  No matter what changes happen.  But seriously, all this stuff didn't make the idiots, they've always been around, it's just now there are a ton more people, and people are more concentrated.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but the primary sorce for the idiots is the idiots themselfs. I to started back in the day of o crap I dont want to die, I hate CRs and frankly I dont miss them at all. I love the port books. I truley hated have to pay a dam druid for a port. Or how about taking the dam boat I bet you really miss that. Its funny but I miss none of those things and the fact that GoD brought it back sucks.</div></div><hr />

The outdoor treadmill has always been there, but we used to just point to all the dr00ds, and not raid with them.</div></div><hr />
