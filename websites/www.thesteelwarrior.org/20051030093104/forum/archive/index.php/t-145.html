<br />
1694 AC (Unbuffed) = 329.4 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1815 AC (Unbuffed) = 311.7 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1917 AC (Unbuffed) = 295.0 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
2112 AC (   Buffed ) = 288.6 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Just for reference:<br />
1694 AC = 666 hits, 219374 total damage from hits<br />
1815 AC = 813 hits, 253380 total damage from hits<br />
1917 AC = 507 hits, 149544 total damage from hits<br />
2112 AC = 752 hits, 217004 total damage from hits<br />
<br />
Would have liked to have run the 1917 AC test a little longer, but I ran oom due to lack of clarity.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also an interesting note. I still dont think its enough data points heh.  It would appear that AC starts tailing off in effectiveness, when a 200AC jump nets you 2% more mitigation.  But if I take my log of 2112 AC and split it into 2 halves, I get 275 average hit for the first half, and 301 average hit for the 2nd half.  That tells me that one of those 2 halfs was likely either unlucky large hits, or lucky small hits.<br />
<br />
If I only used the first half of the log which was a 275 average hit, then the graph makes basically a perfectly straight line. continuing through 2100 AC.<br />
<br />
It could be that AC effectiveness tails off. It could be that AC effectiveness stays the same and my tests are off. The disparity in the 2 halves of my log of 752 data points says alot to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would make a better representation if you subtracted the base damage from each of the data points to represent true mitigation since you can't mitigate BD, ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There must be a 'soft cap' at ~1900 since that is obviously the point of diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
Seriously, thanks for the hard work.  Nobody else is doing any meaningful AC  tests, this really helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not a &quot;Soft Cap&quot; per se.. I  mean you cant say.. ok.. I got 1900 AC and I am done forever.. since the ac softcap seems to be tied directly to the mob you are fighting.. Pre POP (and perhaps new CT) this &quot;Softcap&quot; was right around 1300. For the mobs Solinar is fighting for his tests.. it does seem to be right around 1900... Although I bet you will continue to see ac improvements with say 2200 AC fighting Sol Ro.... <br />
<br />
So alot of it just depends on the mobs you are tanking at the given moment and their abilities...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys also please read my last statment on my post.<br />
<br />
My numbers are not statistically adequate to test AC.  I dont have enough data points.<br />
<br />
Splitting my 2100 AC log in half the first half is 275 average hit, and the 2nd half 301, thats a huge disparity.<br />
<br />
That tells me that I dont have nearly enough data points to make any conclusive statement about a soft cap or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
If you just take the first 140k damage of my 2112 AC log, the line in the graph continues on perfectly straight through 2100 ATK and there is no reduction in mitigation per AC whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Do I believe there is no soft cap? I dont really know. What I do know is that my numbers did not include enough data points to definatively say yes or no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol, <br />
<br />
Can you please apply your superior analytical power and show what, if any, correlation there is between your various AC points and Damage spikes?<br />
<br />
In the previous discussion, it was shown that the likelihood of a damage spike went down exponentially as you increased AC even though damage mitigation went down linearly.  <br />
<br />
(fyi, damage spikes refers to a mob getting a series of max or high hits in a row, like getting 8 max/high hits out of 10 as opposed to getting 2 max/high hits out of 10).<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your work,<br />
Wyndaria, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The chance of a spike is just (% of max hit)^(number of consecutive hits).  Usually this number is 4 so the chance goes down like n^4, which is really fast but not quite exponential.  But it's kind of misleading to just calculate the max hit.  Would 4 max hits minus 1 DI kill you?  2 DI?  How about 3 max hits and one max minus 4 DI?  If you just look at consecutive max hits, the only conclusion is that damage spikes are impossible.  I can't even remember the last time I've been hit for max 3 times in a row.  But obviously damage spikes happen, because you don't need 4 consecutive max hits to instant kill a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way too many factors involved.<br />
<br />
If you ask a specific instance, the probability could be solved Im sure.<br />
<br />
For instance, right now at 2k AC, most PoP mobs hit me for min about 40-45% of the time.  The remaining 55-60% of hits are pretty evenly spread over the remaining 19 Damage Intervals.<br />
<br />
The odds of any single hit on me being for max damage is 60/19 or 3% of all hits are for max damage.  Considering that there is also a 50% hit rate (50% of swings are misses/dodges/ripos/parrys) that means the actual chance per swing of a max hit landing is around 1.5%<br />
<br />
Chance of being 1 rounded is 1.5%^4 or 0.015^4 X chance at the mob making dual weild and double attack checks.<br />
<br />
Lets guess and say most quadding bosses, quad 50% of rounds.  That means the chances of a round of 4 max hits is 0.0000025% or 1 in 39 million rounds.<br />
<br />
Thats good stuff, but unfortunately not the whole picture, because often a quad of DI = 18-20 will kill you just the same as a quad of DI = 20.  Hitting for near max is enough to kill you.  Also there is the chance of getting a riposte at the same time, and also the chance of Flurry, chance of catching 2 rounds of melee between CHs.<br />
<br />
Its all a game of chance, and lowering the size of hits via AC, or lowering the rate of landed hits via evasive, both are very effective at reducing the chance at bad rounds to a level where they will likely never occur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let us not forget, basing the entire AC softcap on one SolRo yard trash mob is not game defining. Even if you were to find a &quot;soft cap&quot;of 2000ac on that trash mob, I am betting you wont find that the same as someone like Fennin Ro or whats to come out of Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
Kazzuk hit the nail on the head. Its all dependant on the mob you are fighting, its abilities, debuffs in, etc. I would not buy into an AC softcap again, especially based on a mid-Teir trash mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to throw in a thanks though Solinar. Your parses are always well done and much appreciated. Dont take my post as negative, just my opinions and observations. Thanks again for the hard work and I hope to see more good stuff like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually.. I think that was the point Sol made in his first ac parse, data set ;) but thanks all the same :D I just wanted to reiterate it here for thjose that may have missed his first post...</div></div><hr />
