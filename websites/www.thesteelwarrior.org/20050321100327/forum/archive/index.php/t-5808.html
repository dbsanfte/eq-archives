<br />
I've recently begun to office web hosting with the same quality service that has been provided to TSW en masse. At this point I offer three standard plans as well as custom plans for those that don't quite fit into the standard plans.<br />
<br />
All plans come with:<br />
--Control Panel software for complete control of your webpage - features auto installation of common scripts such as Gallery, phpBB, as well as over 40 more, webmail interface, bandwidth statistics, full control over sql/ftp/mail accounts as well as numerous other features. Check out a demo at www.cpanel.net.<br />
--BASH Shell access<br />
--Spamassassin Spam blocking<br />
--Support from yours truly<br />
<br />
The plans are:<br />
Silver ($4.95/mo) which includes<br />
200MB Storage<br />
10 email accounts<br />
2 SQL DB's<br />
5GB Bandwidth<br />
<br />
Gold ($8.95/mo)<br />
400MB Storage<br />
25 email accounts<br />
4 SQL DB's<br />
10GB Bandwidth<br />
<br />
Platinum ($14.95/mo)<br />
800MB Storage<br />
60 email accounts<br />
6 SQL DB's<br />
20GB Bandwidth<br />
<br />
I am willing to work with anyone looking for managed hosting, a reseller account, or an account with needs beyond the above accounts.<br />
<br />
All accounts will have a setup fee of $10 unless you already have a domain, in which case it will be waived. The $10 includes domain registration fees for 1 year.<br />
<br />
For those of you with guilds who may be on ezboard or something along those lines, talk to your guild and see if they would be interested in a move - the $4.95/mo plan is more than enough for most clan sites, and provides so much more flexibility than EZB.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any questions/comments, please let me know and I'll try to address them to the best of my ability.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Shorty any sig hosting options? I would rather spend my money here than somewhere else. Anyhow just curious let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sHORTY</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really have anything setup for specifically doing that.. I suppose I could make a smaller package for a couple $$ a month, but there are a shitload of free places out there...<br />
<br />
http://www.sighost.us/<br />
<br />
If you really want something from here, let me know how much transfer we're looking at each month, and I'll try and figure something out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahh ok I just used the company you linked then. With the amount of linking from forum pages I burned through the free plan myimgs.com  in less than 2 days. That was the only reason I asked. at sighost I paid for a full year to see if that works. I have no clue how much bandwidth I chew up having my sig linked on three message board but apparently it is a lot.</div></div><hr />
