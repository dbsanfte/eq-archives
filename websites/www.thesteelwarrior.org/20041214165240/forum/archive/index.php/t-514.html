<br />
currently I am hunting with a 56 druid and a 55 ranger. Are they killing my xp because of the level diffrence?<br />
<br />
also Is it possible to do poi zone in mobs with this trio or will we need a cleric? The reason i ask is we can own dogtower in karnors all night with no down time and little worry of death.<br />
if we time it right we can pull non stop and they are still dark blue to me for the most part while if we go to the hole we end up evacing 2-3 times a night and have horrendus down time waiting for mana, even with kei.<br />
<br />
Ive heard that the xp in poi is great and I want to start hunting there for forages for my group.<br />
<br />
I want 60 but It eludes me :mad:</div></div><hr />

You can pull mobs right by the zone in and zone out if things get to bad.  Also CR is easy in PoI.  Just make sure your Druid keeps an evac up and ready at all times.</div></div><hr />

(swarmcaller?) and that has been helping alot.  we do have guildies that can come group with us, but not on a regualr basis. they are mostly &quot;raid level&quot; i.e. 60+ and we are having to play catch-up after a long break.</div></div><hr />

I cannot stress enough the need for a slower ... once you have a slower... you are set... my epic was helping yes.. but it was never reliable enough.. get chanter/bst/shammy any of those will do and you're set..</div></div><hr />

Might wanna check out exit cells in Plane of Justice.<br />
<br />
I have spend most my time either duoing with a very close Druid friend(/hug Chadoe) of mine or grouping with  59 Ranger and/or 59 Pally friends(/hug Auroria &amp; Jecti).   Between the Ranger and my Trucheon, slowing is not much of a problem in the zones/camps we hunt it ATM.<br />
<br />
If you wanna continue with your friends I would suggest getting the Druid to 58 ASAP.  Thats what we did.  It opens up a whole new world of things you can kill and places you can go.</div></div><hr />

If you can get some crowd control and a slower, then PoI is pretty good exp, certainly better than any prePoP zone. PoN and PoD are also great zones. These would be better for your trio since getting singles and setting up camp where you won't get adds is pretty trivial.<br />
<br />
If you can get an enchanter to join your group any of the tier 1 zones will be great exp. Having crowd control, KEI, haste, and slow all in one is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />

Hello? MONK? McFLY? ANYONE? MONK!<br />
<br />
Good god, the robot PAIRS in Innovation are the easiest mobs in the WORLD for a monk to split.<br />
<br />
Just using the AGE old tactic of spawn point reset, a monk could split them naked.<br />
<br />
I know I could do it with my eyes closed, pre-60 when they became single pullable just off of aggro most of the time.<br />
<br />
I'm almost POSITIVE you can find a monk LFG these days, as well.<br />
<br />
So what I'm saying is support your local monk community. They need XP too. And really, these types of mob splits are a monk's strength.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinguran</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer your first question &quot;are they killing my xp&quot; ... no they are not.  If you group with 54 or less then yes they would be hurting your xp on mobs that are blue to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree's with Wubao.  Find a monk to help with your pulling.  My main is a 51 monk and I can fd split pretty much anything I've run into there.   Once in a great while I would need someone to come tag a mob, but not very often.  I have more trouble with people training through when they blaze away with a bow or a nuke and have 3 chasing them back to the zone in.<br />
If you would prefer to keep just your trio as the group, have you tried letting the druid or ranger use their lull/calm/wthever the spell line is?  As long as the mobs don't path practicaly on top of each other, lull will keep them from agroing everything within half a zone.<br />
But I would recommend finding a slower.  We've tried it with a full group of low to mid 50s and just couldn't do it.  If the cleric kept up with CHs, he would get agro and that would be pretty much a wipe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OgreOverlord</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as far as pullin Singles in PoI the left path from the zone is a no brainer to pull single ... you can pull that whole side single if you are carefull i did it from 55 to 60 or so with ease.altho a FD puller is nice to have, but at 59 you should be able to single pull the left side without a problem with a bow<br />
Only place you need a FD puller is on the right side and thats only at two spots, the first set and the set at the first corner at the end of the first long path. <br />
<br />
Once you get thie spawn times down its even easier <br />
I would definatly get a slower to go along, if not you will spend most of your time waiting on healer mana and a pre 58 druid will not be able to keep you healed sry but thats a fact and stay away from Archaic Models there are unslowable. unless your group is on there toes. and keep the mobs back  in the hole by the ZL and the Erratic models that path by wont ADD on you.<br />
<br />
One more thing you need is more DPS with a Pre 3k healing Druid and no slower and only you and a Ranger the druid will prolly be outa Mana b4 you get the mob killed. PoJ would be nice but the exp in some of the easier camps will blow for you at 59. PoN you will need a slower, and I would have a cleric there if not you will most likely spend alot of your play time shouting for a rez at the GY. PoD is real good exp the CYards are nice exp before 61. but then again these Zones are made in the idea of having a full groups with Slowers Clerics and DPS. <br />
<br />
I'm mot trying to rain to hard on you just want you to know these mobs are harder than the ones youve been fighting  they hit 200to300 and even a few 400+ and relying on a proc slow with a 600,700 or 800hp healer will get you killed so be prepaired, with a well put together group the exp will be awsome and you will have fun. if not you will only get frustrated and not have a good time hunting in the planes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doobi Doobidoo</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In PoI, Druid will have a hard time keepin up on heals slow or no slow. Biggest factor in this equasion.... gear! 59 warr with 3Khps unbuffed is going to get hammered vs a warrior with 4Khps. All in all, unless you can add some dps/heals to the group, head down to PoJ cells or maybe bacement. As a side note, if your server's anything like Mith Marr, PoI zin's gonna be camped unless you're playing during off hours.<br />

<br />
<br />
Ok find a pack of the mobs. The first one to the right RIGHT out of the zone out I think may be too close together, but I'm not positive. once you do that, get closer and closer, the closer you get go a bit slower. Once you get close enough you will agro one of them and you can run your arse back to your group.<br />
<br />
And get a slower, shouldn't be too hard, shamans are good friends to have :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pull with prox aggro, just inch towards mobs till one of them aggros you.  Most of the time, you can prolly get me solo.  Thats what i did.  Used prox aggro, works like a charm (this was back when i was 59-61, as i stopped hitting teir 1 when i got 62)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with POI is that any spawn loc can spawn anything, and some of the mobs are too high to harmony, unless you have one of the 61+ spells.  Once you get a pair spawned where you can't harmony either one, you can't get singles any more.  Also, these higher level mobs are immune to run speed changes, so you can't root park them either.  Without a slower and an off tank, you're done dancing when this happens.<br />
<br />
I haven't run into this problem killing goos in pod yet.  Just head left along the zone wall from zone in.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like to xp in velks.  Sure, single mobs are worth a lot less xp, but they are far easier to kill, I kill piles of spiders every hour. If I solo with a slave cleric to heal I can do an AA in a bit over 2 hours.  The large blocks ov velium sell well in bazaar at 75p each, the silks for 5p each, gems for 100-300 depending on demand, and stuff from the named in the ledge camp make for a nice payday too.  It's not unusual for me to clear 1k per hour of camping.</div></div><hr />
