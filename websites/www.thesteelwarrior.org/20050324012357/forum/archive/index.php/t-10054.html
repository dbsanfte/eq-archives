<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">12-19-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night my guild raided and clear Qvic in hopes of perma flag pieces. We managed to get 4 people in from the 85% rule, they have to use the old way to Qvic and not Madrona but it's a minor thing.<br />
<br />
So we kill Iqthinxa and get 1 Riftseeker Binding, and kill Cynosure and get another 1, was hoping 2 per with the minimum 85% being 4 people @ 28 flagged but meh, take what your given.<br />
<br />
Apart from that we saw 2 new named up, Hexxt Ilk Klokk a kyv mini named, easy as the rest of the 1 group named, dropped a Golem control rod only. After we had done Name din zone trackers informed me of another named in zone, Averixx Quimeri , so we cleared to Inktu'ta and shes pretty deep in theres an FD golem and her behind in a small cubby. Hailing her she chats about Txevu and asks for the golem control rod.<br />
<br />
[Sun Dec 19 03:21:57 2004] Averixx Quimeri says 'I saw Hexxt Ilk Klokk using one to enter Txevu.  I would start with him if I were you.  Be careful though, the Muramites with the ability to enter Txevu, the Lair of the Elite will not give over their possessions easily.'<br />
<br />
We tried giving in the rod, but got asked for the rest of the peices, so guessing something from named in Txevu/Tacvi is needed here.<br />
<br />
On the basis that the NPC for Txevu/Tacvi is in Qvic I guessed the NPC for Qvic is in KT or Yxtta, but as of yet have been unable to find a new NPC (Cept one which doesn't respond to hails at all , just past the nearest Ikkinz trial(Group) and was wondering if anyone else has any leads on where the NPC is for the group part of the flag conversion quest?<br />
<br />
Also found 2 new drops in Qvic, pieces of eye or something along those lines, 2nd piece and 5th piece dropped about 4 times each off trash mobs, guessing they too are for the quest (both Lore No Drop)<br />
<br />
Anyone else found anything new? Can move this post if it should be in the quest section but I thought it may pertain to the higher part of the backflag quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some further progress.<br />
<br />
Found a new NPC in Koad Taz, Pixxt Nemis, Blue Con indifferent Ixt NPC, in one of the two houses in front of temple where you zone in for trial 9 (Kyv Hunters trial).<br />
<br />
A guildmate who is not flagged for Qvic hailed her, and she 'knocked him out' and gave him this text:<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she send you?  Hmmmph, you obviously don't know what I am talking about.  Get out of my face!&quot; and knocked him out.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure its for Qvic flag, experimenting now, will post more as we find out.<br />
<br />
Guildmate tried hailing her while wearing the BP that Cynosure dropped, Riftbreakers binding - and he got same result.<br />
<br />
We didn't have time to test trade as it was very late and people had to log.<br />
<br />
We have to find out who 'she' is I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pixxt nemisis, bah I thought she was another 1 grouped named, will head down thier and see if she responds to text, nice spot though.<br />
<br />
Seems the wizzys at Graffe's have found the Txevu quest, here it is copied, credit to Floydian.<br />
<br />
<br />
Averixx Quimeri is a ghost/slaved at the back of the caves, -1676, -236, -411 <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Averixx Quimeri' <br />
<br />
Averixx Quimeri says 'Greetings, traveler. What do you think about this golem? He is truly a wondrous creation. As far as anyone has been able to determine, he strayed from Inktu`ta, the Unmasked Chapel. He fell into the hands of the Muramites first, and they discovered that he is absolutely indestructible. The Muramites did give it their [best shot], though.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'best shot'<br />
<br />
Averixx Quimeri chuckles, 'I admit to being quite entertained by the tales of their failures. Proof that despite their knowledge and power they do have weaknesses! It started out with their researchers poking and prodding him, but that didn't last long. Soon they resorted to their favored weapons and magic. The fools used every implement of destruction at their disposal in their attempts dismantle him. They slung their mightiest spells and threw their strongest warriors at him for days. Their testing ground was aglow with blinding flashes of light and sparks from enchanted metal clanging against impervious stone. In the end, when the dust settled, they did a pitiful amount of [damage] to the golem.<br />
<br />
You say, 'damage'<br />
<br />
Averixx Quimeri says 'The onyx protector survived the ordeal mostly unscathed. However, the Muramites did discover the fragile nature of the jeweled eyes of the golem. Their efforts shattered his poor eyes. Gemmed pieces scattered everywhere. With his sight destroyed, and no way of dismantling the golem, the Muramites deemed him worthless and dumped him as refuse. Shortly after that, we recovered him and brought him here for [study].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'study'<br />
<br />
Averixx Quimeri says 'After studying him thoroughly, I believe he may be of some value to us. If we were able to get him working again he would be a great boon to my people. We would have an indestructible defense against the Muramites and their incursion. However, I'm afraid in his current state without eyes he is powerless. The many fragments have been carried off as prizes or scattered across the temple areas. In order to rebuild the eyes you would need restore them in a jewelers kit, using at least six different shards from each eye. If you could gather the various pieces and repair his eyes for me, that would be a start. I would also need a [method] to control the onyx protector.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'method'<br />
<br />
Averixx Quimeri says 'No doubt you've noticed that the legion is able to access the Lair of the Elite without the need of a Cipher of Txevu. They have been using some sort of a wand that enables them to control the gatekeeper golem at the entrance, commanding it to let them through unhindered. If you can restore the eyes for me as I asked and bring me a [controller's wand], I will teach you to use one of these wands so that you may pass into Txevu as well without the need to delve into the depths of that cursed lost chapel of Inktu`ta. Keep in mind that you will need an escort into Txevu to obtain a permanent power source for the wand. This may affect your decision.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'controller's wand'<br />
<br />
Averixx Quimeri says 'I saw Hexxt Ilk Klokk using one to enter Txevu. I would start with him if I were you. Be careful though, the Muramites with the ability to enter Txevu, the Lair of the Elite will not give over their possessions easily.'<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rampagious</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the piece off zun a couple days back. &quot;Zun'Muram's Signet of Command&quot; is the key item. Simply have it in your inventory and talk to the guy at txevu zone in. Hell recognize the items on you and give you trigger phrase. Say trigger phrase and tacvi is right near txevu zone in~.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the exact item(s) needed for Qvic access?<br />
<br />
Redleaf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rydeon</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pieces Im assuming are for Qvic access.<br />
<br />
Yxxta:<br />
Crag Beetle Spittle -Insects in Primal Caves<br />
Globule of Cragbeast Bile -Cragbeasts in Primal Caves<br />
Another piece of the Spiders in the caves but I cant remember what its called as its in my bank atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think the pieces have to be wearable, the Riftbreaker Identifies as &quot;Wearing all 4 will allow access to Qvic&quot;, on lucy the Yxtta pieces are combinable not equippable, though correct me if i'm wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rydeon</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what they are for then,  having hunted there forever and killing countless of each of them  these after the patch started dropping, and commonly at that, so Im just assuming they are for at least one of the access quests.</div></div><hr />
