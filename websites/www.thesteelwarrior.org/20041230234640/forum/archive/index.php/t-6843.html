<br />
1) What is the real role of main tank/ whatever in a group? I was doing an LDoN last night (only my fourth). We had a bard pulling, couple of times he overpulled and everyone (it seemed) waited for me to choose what to fight. <br />
IS this how it normally is? In the other groups I was with it seemed the puller called what to fight . (as I said though-grand total of 4 LDoN's under my belt I'm not an expert, I'll do another one bfore I decide I know everything  :)  )<br />
-Anything and everthing you can tell me about what I'm supposed to worry about in a group will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
2) Dinged 36 last night and should hit 40 by the end of the weekend, looking at grabbing some of the Fierce Heraldic gear. I noitced that while it has hit points (lots and lots of hit points). It doesn't have any endurance on it. Is this going to be a problem? Most of my gear now has mana/endurance on it , other than swinging/provoke/ resisntant do I use up alot of endurance for anything?<br />
<br />
3)Before I go broke grabbing cheap Fierce Heraldic pieces-will it work until 55-60 or am I going to need to upgrade again before I can tank at those levels?<br />
<br />
4)LDoN question -what's the difference between talismans/amulets/charms etc.<br />
I notice they say &quot;adds xxx when adventuring in a LDoN&quot; this mean they don't add anything whem you're somewhere else? Also (and a very sq) What am I supposed to do with the adventures stone? What do I mount it in?<br />
<br />
5) Is it true that there is a bonus to have stats at 100/200 etc? Right now my Dex is at 99, str 179. Was talking to people last night who said if I wanted to be more effective Id get the dex at 100 (for now) and str at 200. -Im just wondering because it looks like Im going to take a big STR hit when I upgrade to Fierce Heraldic. (loisng 10 from Gauntlets, 9 from bracer ,7 from boots) etc.<br />

Anyways thanks in advance for any and all answers/advice and flames you can provide. <br />
And thanks again for all the answers you've provided for my other questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
In big open zones at low levels, its actually a challenge to pull more than one mob, so usually everyone just assists the puller. However, in higher level zones (generally 46+), its more difficult to pull and generally requires some form of crowd control, so the main assist switches to the main tank. This stops people from unncessarily breaking mez and gets mobs down faster.<br />
<br />
2) Dinged 36 last night and should hit 40 by the end of the weekend, looking at grabbing some of the Fierce Heraldic gear. I noitced that while it has hit points (lots and lots of hit points). It doesn't have any endurance on it. Is this going to be a problem? Most of my gear now has mana/endurance on it , other than swinging/provoke/ resisntant do I use up alot of endurance for anything?<br />
<br />
I just hit 63 myself, and most of my equipment has endurance on it. Infact, I've nearly doubled my endurance (judged from being naked, then equipping my gear and seeing how much i have left to regen, within 5~%), and I still have problems inciting every mob on INC. I can keep it up for 1-2 hours, but then I need a med break, and if a named/boss is going to be pulled I simply wont have the endurance to use a discipline. I imagine this problem will all but dissapear once I hit 65 though. Fierce Heraldic Gear is comparible to ornate and MUCH, MUCH cheaper allowing you to splurge on weapons and jewelry. If you can afford it, get it.<br />
<br />
3)Before I go broke grabbing cheap Fierce Heraldic pieces-will it work until 55-60 or am I going to need to upgrade again before I can tank at those levels?<br />
<br />
As it was said above, it can last until 65, and beyond. Hard to upgrade those pieces without spending lots of plat on ornate/looting it yourself, or...joining a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
4)LDoN question -what's the difference between talismans/amulets/charms etc.<br />
I notice they say &quot;adds xxx when adventuring in a LDoN&quot; this mean they don't add anything whem you're somewhere else? Also (and a very sq) What am I supposed to do with the adventures stone? What do I mount it in?<br />
<br />
Charms are self explanatory, if it says &quot;gives xx when raining&quot; or &quot;gives xx when adventuring in a lost dungeon&quot; then you will only recieve the stats in those situations. I suggest you put the Adventurers stone in a charm you plan to keep, such as the Intricate Wooden Figurine. You can combine the charm + the augment (adventures stone) in any LDoN camp, just go to the fountain, click on it, and combine it like any other tradeskill recipe.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Is it true that there is a bonus to have stats at 100/200 etc? Right now my Dex is at 99, str 179. Was talking to people last night who said if I wanted to be more effective Id get the dex at 100 (for now) and str at 200. -Im just wondering because it looks like Im going to take a big STR hit when I upgrade to Fierce Heraldic. (loisng 10 from Gauntlets, 9 from bracer ,7 from boots) etc.<br />
<br />
I don't think theres any benefits past these two stats being higher than...<br />
<br />
75, for AGI. If its below 75, you suffer a noticable AC penalty, but if its anything higher than that your good to go. There isn't a noticable bonus from having your AGI higher than anything but 75.<br />
<br />
If your STA is lower than 100, swinging weapons without any stamina would cause you to suffer reduced stats. However, I think with the melee patch that replaced stamina with endurance, this is no longer an issue. However, as a tank you should ALWAYS have your STA as high as possible, as when your level 65 it equates to roughly 6~7 HP per point of stamina.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but thats all I know of.</div></div><hr />

If you want it on a different charm remove it with the solvent in the pool then go hail the guy you got the stone from in the first place and he/she will give you another one.<br />

I've done this on accident a few times when i've died and i hailed the dwarf in BB.  Ended up having to delete the new adventurers stone before looting my intricite wooden figurine.</div></div><hr />

But it will happen still at 65 since people will cast earlier etc to keep aggro you will try to use incite on everypull.

<br />
Errm, please explain &quot;capped endurance pool&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you meant capped endurance through stats (ie. Str, Sta, Dex, Agi), because there is a lot more Endurance to be added through Itemisation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This can sometimes be a very bad idea with bards. In my experience when a bard pulls 2 mobs they have the mob they are mezzing targeted. When I see 2 mobs inc I target the first mob to enter camp. This will also help when a caster adds and takes forever getting to camp because it is casting spells.</div></div><hr />

It depends on your group, the people you group with.  When I have a puller, if the puller says *INC &gt;&gt;that&lt;&lt;*, I assist, target it and I am locked to it until told otherwise, or a mez wakes and wails on the healer (till it's locked down) ... me, the chanter I usually group with, she will ignore the INC mob no matter when it arrives and mez or at least set up all others that come to the camp.  We lose no time if the INC is a caster and the last to arrive, cuz once it's in and dead, everything else is snared and slowed, and we set em up and knock em down.  But that's us - we've established that rythm.  And, when we're grouped with peeps who jump on the first mob that comes into camp, we adapt.<br />

We tank... mostly sometimes we do dmg, sometimes we are crowd controll. You talk to ppl you play with to agree on who does what. If you dont then there is a problem. Get some friends to play with on regular basis and you won't need to ask this ever again.<br />
<br />
In regards to gear/stats I wouldnt worry about it untill you are in high 50s. Just enjoy yourself you'll figure out the ropes yourself before you get there and will pick up items you need as you go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my take on bards in ldon.<br />
<br />
im assuming pickup group here.<br />
<br />
depends hugely on the bard for one. if the bard actually CALLS what he wants you to tank then by all means quickly hit your assist button and fling an arrow at it (or whatever). but in my experience USUALLY when a bard comes back with 4 he is way too busy trying to even survive to figure out how to tag a mob for assist. in that case i would say time is of the essence. the sooner you get agro off him the better so just make a quick decision and if you dont like the outcome maybe learn something better for next time.<br />
<br />
if you tag the wrong one. most of the time stick with it anyway. because if you switch back next thing you know you have the rest of group split evenly between the 2 mobs and thats usually worse than merely getting the wrong one off the pull.<br />
<br />
i have 3 hotkeys i use for assists in exp groups. they are my &quot;im assisting so and so on a such and such&quot; key. my &quot;inc&quot; key and my &quot;breaking mez on a ...&quot; key. for nameds or other hard ones a &quot;ok other melees time to start hitting&quot; key and a &quot;nukers start your nuking&quot; key can help.<br />
<br />
pullers should have a &quot;inc&quot; key at the minimum.<br />
<br />
if i take the wrong mob off the pull by accident or by executive decision or if i switch mobs i always try to hit my INC key again to alert the others to the fact i am not on the mob they may think im on.<br />
<br />
and of course it all gets screwed up sometimes. so cut me some slack. ive botched it a few times pretty good. but anyway its the way i try to go about it all.<br />
<br />
<br />
and to all you pullers out there whether warrior or other class:<br />
<br />
pleeeease call your mob. i hit /assist about half a second after its called so you can switch targets to your heart's delight after that. but if you dont call it i dont know when to assist. example: bard will lull 2 and prox pull one. he calls first one and i hit assist key and then he lulls 2. then he pulls and im all ready with my assist. i dont  fling the arrow till i see him heading back to group. i spam my range attack key and hit it as soon as it comes in range. now had he not called the mob i would have not known when to assist and may have been forced to go for F8 key (and hope its the one he wanted). thats a delay. a delay is lost agro opportunity.<br />
<br />
try to impress it on pet classes not to send their pet in as soon as you call your tanking target. you call it as soon as you know to give people maximum time to be ready. but pets sent in mindlessly while target is at a distance can (especially with casters that stop a distance away) end up pinning down a mob so far from the group that it can lead to all manner of adds from broken lulls to wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
this is one reason why on important encounters you set up a whole bank of macros for tag for inc for assist and so on.<br />
<br />
there is a curious side benefit of a breaking mez hotkey. if you use it you will subtly encourage your groupies not to break mezzes before you are ready for them to be broken.<br />
<br />
yeah yeah call me the rambler. im good at rambling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Straythe</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a lot more simple than all of what's above. Simply ask your bard, or whoever you have pulling for the group, which mob they'd like you on (ie. ask them if they want you to assist them each time for a target, or do something special on a multi-pull).<br />
<br />
If you have a chanter &amp;/OR necro in group, try to leave casters till the end so they can mana-tap them during the fight.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a mez class in the group at all, take out healers first then nukers and let others root adds out of the way.<br />
<br />
Generally, I set up an assist key for the puller in each group I'm in and I take whatever they have targeted.  If they don't have one targeted, I pick the closest and let them figure out the other ones.<br />
<br />
Just be decisive, pick one and use the same method of picking each time a pull is made so that you're consistent.  Your group will appreciate a quick decision and sticking with your decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you have a bard puller, you should certainly ask their preference in targeting multiple pulls. Very often, the bards target will be getting mezzed as the bard gets in to camp, leaving the mob at a relatively safe distance in case mezz breaks. This means that the mob coming in to camp will have to be mouse targeted or F8 targeted. Ask before you start, it will make life a lot easier for you.<br />
<br />
It is a good idea to consult with any mezzers before pulls start just to make sure everyone is on the same page. It is not unusual for a mezzer to assist the puller for a target and mezz on inc, if they are doing this, you will want to know so you don't break any mezzes unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
With typical FD or pacify pulling, the pullers target will most often be the mob that is being brought to camp. Pullers should certainly have some sort of hotkey set up so you have some idea of what is incoming. Very often, on multiple pulls, the puller will mash the hotkey once per mob so you will also have an idea of how many mobs are coming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
.<br />
<br />
<br />
I find this to be annoying as hell.   1 out of 20 mezzers will do this.    I always assist the puller unless the puller states before the pull:  &quot;Mez my target&quot;     Then I back off and try to pick off whatever elses comes.      As an MT you don't stand around waiting for a mezzer to mez something before you decide what target you want to kill.   <br />
<br />
Bards though on the other hand are tricky people.  :)    I always try to consult my bard on what he plans on doing before we start.    A lot of times the target he/she has will be mezzed.    In any case, if you break a mez keep tanking it.  Don't keep switching tarets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the easiest way to communicate with mezzers is that what I target you don't mez (delegate MA helps this a lot).  This is easier than trying to figure out all the different preferences whatever mezzer you run into.  Usually the mistakes on mezzing happens when the tank and the mezzer try to second-guess each other what to do.  I find that if I just always do the same thing then the mezzer does not have to second-guess me and will eventually get it right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rogok</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm tanking, I assist the puller the instant he calls his target. If it's going to be multiples, or the cleric is lulling, it may be a little while longer before they actually return to camp. Usually the puller knows what the different kinds of targets are, and they've selected which mob they want to die first.<br />
<br />
If you're locked on a caster, and multiples come into camp, don't panic. But whatever you do, don't switch targets. It definitely throws everyone into confusion and can lead to a loss of aggro control... and then people die. Wipes happen when I listen to that stupid voice in my head that tells me that I'm on the wrong target and switch to try and be a hero (it never works).<br />
<br />
You want this whole process to be smooth and fluid with a minimum of extra communication. There will be times when you need to switch targets, like when there's a cleric in the group, but I usually let the mezzer decide if that needs to happen. He'll say, &quot;switch to such and such&quot;, and I'll switch targets, and everyone else will know to follow suit. Our group can often go an hour without speaking about anything regarding the coordination of the fights - that leaves more time to yack about everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer your central question: your main function in groups as a warrior is to absorb/mitigate damage. If you are the main tank, you hold the mob in one place and give the group time to kill it. Even if you are not the main tank, basically what you do better than any other class is absorb/mitigate damage, and your job in large part will be to take damage if the MT dies or there's a failure on the crowd control side of things. the nastier the mob, the handier you are.<br />
Because you mitigate damage better than other classes, you save group healers' mana. Because OOM healers mean a group has to stop for a med break, conservation of healing mana can and does increase the experience rate and efficiency of the group. Additionally, you have a large hp pool, and this also helps healers use more mana-efficient heals and it buys them time. The nastier the mob, the handier you are.<br />
Secondarily, you have a variety of other functions. As main tank, you (inconjunction with the puller and crowd control folks, as noted by posters above) chose the order that the mobs will be fought on multiple-mob pulls. And indeed, ultimately, if you are the tank, you make the decision, because whatever mob you're hitting *is* the mob the group has to kill first.<br />
As main tank, you also position the mob, and doing so correctly can greatly increase the damage output of your group. There are some good posts on this site that discuss the various factors in mob placement.<br />
A big ol' badass warrior tank joining a group often just makes people feel better, especially since we got the provoke/incite line and our /discs were unlinked. You are sort of an insurance policy against untimely caster death, and, if you properly use the tools you have available for aggro generation, you can allow other melee and the nuking classes to do a great deal more damage than they used to be able to safely do with a warrior tank. This is a great time to be a 40-something warrior.<br />
Under certain conditions, you make an excellent puller. You are not good at splitting mobs, you cannot feign death and you cannot track. But where you can get a single pull, and that single pull is apt to hit the puller a couple times before the puller can get back to the group, you are very handy to have around. The nastier the mob, the handier you are.<br />
You can do some damage, too, heh.<br />
<br />
The reason people like cultural armor such Fierce H. and the tundra armor is that it has good AC and hps for the cost of the armor and for the level that you can use it. AC and Hitpoints tie directly into your main specialization: mitigating/aborbing damage. The nastier the mob, the handier these stats. You don't have to buy an entire suit of the stuff at once, either: check out the stats on the stuff you have, and the appropriate FH replacement, and upgrade following the &quot;best bang for the buck&quot; strategy. <br />
<br />
You probably won't have to worry too much about running out of endurance for some time; apparently merely bellowing something profane at mobs when you are level 52, say, doesn't actually tire you out all that much. Don't let it stop you from getting cultural armor for AC/hp upgrades.<br />
<br />
I'm not seeing any stat food in your gear; possibly you're not listing it. But if you aren't using any, get some. Halas 10-pound meat pies, for example, will push your DEX over 100, if that concerns you, and you won't have to &quot;trade off&quot; anything else to get it.</div></div><hr />
