<br />
I didn't even call anyone a fucktard and got my posts edited!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slyson Dycson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You had your post edited?  Consider yourself lucky then.  When I made a post over there, they just deleted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*shrug*  I'd been posting over there for a couple of years.  I finally got banned for calling one guy a &quot;Jackass&quot; early this year, for telling another guy &quot;up yours&quot; in March, and for a third unspecified insult that occured sometime in August of last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wasn't the comment that got edited something to the effect of &quot;If you don't like it, then screw you and the horse you rode in on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, evidently the standards there are real high, eh? Act like a jackass, get edited. Post like a civlized human being, and you don't. Evidently that's too difficult for you? I think some of you guys have gotten a little too accustomed to the permissive admin standards here.  Looks like it's given rise to a few to many wanna be Furors. Try the same stuff on EQClerics or EQTraders and tell me how it flies. Clue: You aren't Furor. You aren't funny, and you aren't even makeing a coherent point, and making lame and vaguely profane one liners doesn't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry Gimmel, you might have a point if the admin over there didn't already have a reputation of being among, if not THE, worst admin on any class board.<br />
<br />
I had a couple of questionable warnings, and then got banned for saying the word &quot;knightemization&quot;. Apparently, that was trolling. /rolls eyes... and I'm just one of many examples.<br />
<br />
If you don't toe the line and complain about paladins needing upgrades, it seems they'll find excuses to ban you and get rid of you.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, it's counterproductive. Instead of having a comunity that's unified in it's call for upgrades, I'm pretty sure the dev team realizes that the admins have a history of banning people with dissenting viewpoints, so they realize that that board is pretty suspect in it's ability to show the situation as it really is.<br />
<br />
The admins are just shooting themselves in the foot over there. I don't even think they realize it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Right, and all through PoP while Frodlin and Glatuis and I were arguing with them that warriors needed better aggro, we were just towing the line eh? Heck, even BB isn't banned there yet, proving that you can still be an ass, as long as you are a civil ass and not get banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't say EVERYONE got banned now, did I? The fact that quite a few have speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
Hell, BB at one point got banned, if he's still there it's probably because he fought it and won.<br />
<br />
None of what you've said addresses my original point. What about all the other ones, eh? Now what about all the other boards class balance forums? I don't see a single one of them bouncing out people with oppposing viewpoints with near the frequency PoN does, or for as little reason. OR, keeping around people with viewpoints that match the PoN &quot;party line&quot;, so to speak, who do and say much worse things that deserve warnings or bannings, yet they get away scot free.<br />
<br />
Banning me for saying &quot;knightemization? Please. Even YOU have gotta agree that was lame and extremely questionable.<br />
<br />
Sorry, you're not gonna win this one. Their own actions speak for themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Banning me for saying &quot;knightemization? Please. Even YOU have gotta agree that was lame and extremely questionable.<br />
It would be, if that was the only thing you had ever done. But it wasn't, you were on the verge of getting banned and you hit a hot button issue. It was the straw that broke the camel's back. You knew you were already flirting with getting banned before you maed that post.<br />
<br />
TSW is a different environment. The posters here make sure that the class balancing forum is every bit as censored as what you accuse PoN of. They just do it through belittling and mocking anyone that doesn't tow the Warrior party line. Interesting how it works, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what the hell you don't even know what I posted, and no I'm not some wannabe furor. <br />
<br />
I have read some of furor stuff but I'm afraid that was largely before I came to read steelwarriors let alone his stuff since. <br />
<br />
and it's one thing to see screw you and the horse you rode in on edited, but to see mild comments like If all you can see is the words you don't need war defensive and can't read anything beyond that get edited that's another thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who learned you how to spoke?  :confused: <br />
<br />
But yes, I've had posts deleted for reasons I can't imagine, as they were uninflamatory in nature.  I actually find myself reading this board more as I can't stand some of the whining going on right now, especially on the Class Balancing board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, Gimmel. That wasn't even worth a WARNING, let alone a banning.<br />
<br />
Also in regards to you not getting banned... you're more often than not arguing and defending the paladin point of view. So it's not the same thing at all.<br />
<br />
I note you still have yet to address or dispute anything of substance that I've said, like the fact that people who do hapepn to agree with the &quot;party line&quot;, so to speak, can say much worse and get no warnings. <br />
<br />
Maybe you can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also in regards to you not getting banned... you're more often than not arguing and defending the paladin point of view. So it's not the same thing at all.<br />
Yeah, I am NOW, because I think they have a legitimate beef. In PoP, I firmly supported the warriors in getting better aggro. Frodlin, Glatius, and I were 3 of the main agitators on PoN speaking up for the resolution of warrior aggro problems. I am capable of examining issues separately and not just looking at the class involved. I try to look beyond &quot;class loyalty&quot; (I also play a 64 warrior currently, though I wasn't during PoP), and try to see what is good for the game, not just for self interest. Something that seems to escape several warriors and paladins. I think warriors needed to be able to generate the aggro needed to do their jobs. And I think that knights need to have something that sets their tanking ability apart from other classes as much as warrior tanking is set apart from knights. Call me crazy.<br />
<br />
I find it hilarious that most of the paladins in PoN think I'm a paladin hater, and the warriors think I am a warrior hater. Makes me think I must be doing something right :)</div></div><hr />

&quot;You seem to be level-headed and do not disrupt our boards and like many other classes are allowed and encouraged to post on our boards in civilized discussion. While I personally do not believe in your positions on class balancing and believe you to be biased against paladins to a degree I have no problems with your posts.&quot;<br />
<br />
There ya have it. If you aren't an ass, you won't get banned, even if they don't like what you say. Be an ass, and you will. I've certainly found it to be true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had no idea that was what you meant, which was the entire point of the first line of my post, the incomprehensibility(whoa!) of it.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually Gimmel,<br />
<br />
I AM banned over on PoN. The reasoning as near as I can tell is that one or more admins received more complaints about me than anyone else ever or some such.<br />
<br />
They do have a point. It's a Paladin board and they are entitled to work out Paladin needs without getting their elbows jostled.<br />
<br />
At the same time many of the complainers are either:<br />
<br />
1. Not ready for advanced GoD content having for expample killed Quarm for the first time only recently or having 0 PoTime equipment.<br />
<br />
2. Consistant agitators to nerf Warriors by either obtaining Defesive themselves or removing it from the game.<br />
<br />
3. Excessively rude themselves.<br />
<br />
4. Having been flagged and completed at least one Ikkinz trial conceal that fact and aggitate for Defensive (and no other solution).<br />
<br />
5. Demonstrably ignorant as they argue their spellbook is useless therefore they must recieve melee improvements. Excuse me, if your spellbook is useless, then it must be upgraded. Then your base level tanking should be examined. Then any disciplines should be addressed.<br />
<br />
Even the most &quot;technical&quot; argument posted recently was on EQLive where purported Paladin survival rates vs. mobs was provided. No description of the groups. No Magelo for the Paladin. No DB or DI values for the mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you think otherwise, but the Class Balance Board has been the &quot;WHAAAA We Want Defensive Board&quot; fom the Phase 1 Melee Update and rising to a cresendo one week after the release of Discord and a constant wail ever since.<br />
<br />
Read the Lord Protector's Citidel if you want to see what high-level Paladins think. There's quite a difference.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry if you think otherwise, but the Class Balance Board has been the &quot;WHAAAA We Want Defensive Board&quot; fom the Phase 1 Melee Update and rising to a cresendo one week after the release of Discord and a constant wail ever since.<br />
As opposed to the TSW class balancing forum which has been &quot;WHAAAA if knights get half defensive I want half their spell book/I am quitting&quot; since GoD, mixed with a health dose of &quot;Haha, screw you, if you wanted to be a real tank you should have rolled a warrior.&quot; and steadily rising. Much more enlightened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">well one mispelled word doesn't make the whole thing incomprehensible.  it's normally easy to see where it goes.<br />

<br />
I somewhat agree and somewhat disagree with you Gimmel.  I feel that my banning wasn't just because of my &quot;conduct&quot;.  I believe that it was tied into the fact that I was arguing against Paladin defensive quite strongly.  I believe my &quot;jackass&quot; comment was something along the lines of &quot;don't be a jackass&quot; or &quot;stop being a jackass&quot;.  And my &quot;up yours&quot; comment was in direct response to someone being very snide.  There are other posters who are far more offensive who don't manage to get banned, Soledragondead for example, who has almost as much as admitted that he's Seventhsword, who was banned at one time.<br />
<br />
Yes, PoN will ban you if you behave like an ass.  And PoN seems to sometimes find excuses for banning people who might be fine otherwise if they weren't arguing against what the mods consider correct.  This is of course my personal opinion.  You're free to disagree.  But you can't prove me wrong either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sorry, seems to me that during the whole PoP thing, you managed to be pretty vocal with out resorting to namecalling or insults. For some reason, when the GoD thing rolled around, your posting style got a lot more harsh and strident. It's no surprise to me you got banned. If you'd kept the same tone that you had during the aggro talks, you would never have been banned.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is though, that if you get in and mix it up for long enough, you've got a good shot at getting banned, since it takes 3 warnings = ban. Get in a heated debate and it's pretty easy to step over the line and get a warning. Stay in the hot debates long enough and you'll get banned if you don't keep your tongue under control. I know I have at least one warning from dealing with Goodwind. That's life.<br />
<br />
Soledragondead never admitted to being seventhsword. In fact, he evidently is giving the story that seventhsword is his &quot;brother&quot;. That said, personally I would have banned his sorry butt months ago. But, it's not my board, and they do what they want. I just think it's hilarious that the warriors come over here and whine about PoN moderation. Grow some stones guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, none of them can post at PoN for SOME reason. *cough, cough*<br />
<br />
 And what Gimmel conveniently forgets is that the post that got Daemonwynd banned was a response to a post with a personal insult on it from another poster, who then tried to come over here and convince us that they had got a warning, although there was NO public warning for his like there is for every single Warrior warning. When this was brought up here, that whole post mysteriously vanished.<br />
<br />
 Sorry, Gimmel, you're defending people who don't deserve your defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sorry, you haven't been hanging around PoN NEARLY long enough to know what their record is like. Is it perfect? Nah. Is it the gestapo that the whiny bitches here would have you believe? Nah. I'm not defending Taragor. He's an idiot. I'm saying that in general the moderation at PoN is far more even handed than it's being given credit for, and in general the class balancing discussion is far more productive and civil than it is here, since here dissenting voices simply get shouted down.<br />
<br />
In general it's obvious that many of you are looking for any excuse to hate paladins as a group, and I think that's assinine. The description of this forum was originally intended as a joke, but it apparently went over many of your heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">BTw the word of the day is assinine.<br />

h8ing is fun.<br />
<br />
I had a few posts that one deserved editing by thier standards the others were edited after that because admin felt they could.  thier right, however childish.<br />
<br />
They do keep things pretty clean around thier, but they do have a habit from what I've seen in past of dealing a little faster/harder with anything not with the party line.  or scrutinizing it very carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Sorry, you haven't been hanging around PoN NEARLY long enough to know what their record is like.

<br />
So 2+ years isn't long enough? Interesting. No, it's NOT more even handed than it's being credit for. The fact that they'll ban dissenting people at the drop of a hat, I can remember being subject to ridicule for almost as long as I've visited the boards.<br />
<br />
The reason WHY it's more productive and civil than it is here? Which is up for question, by the way... it's because so many of the people who DO dissent are and have been getting banned. More civil, yes. Because of all the bannings. More productive? No. Most importantly, do those dicussions have as much credibility? Of course not.<br />
<br />
Here at TSW, we have discussions where EVERYONE joins in. People don't get banned with dissenting opinions, even that idiot Taragor. That gives us much more credibility. Devs come here, they know they're going to be hearing from anyone who has something to say about the topic... at PoN, they go read that forum, they know that the moderators have a history of banning people with dissenting opinions, which makes for a truly biased forum.<br />
<br />
PoN is turning into a whinefest of &quot;we're not good enough&quot;, &quot;we need upgrades&quot;, &quot;we need defensive&quot;. That's all it is. That's NOT class balance at all. All they want is upgrades, and class balance is not a concern.<br />
<br />
You say dissenters get shouted down over here? That's just plain funny. It's FAR FAR worse over there, except it's not just getting shouted down, it's bannings as well.<br />
<br />
And ya know what, these observations are being made by multiple people. Who do you think is right... multiple people... or the one arguing the opposite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">PoN is turning into a whinefest of &quot;we're not good enough&quot;, &quot;we need upgrades&quot;, &quot;we need defensive&quot;.

Replace &quot;defensive&quot; with &quot;snap aggro&quot; and it all has a very familiar ring to it....<br />
I'll say now exactly what I said to the paladins during PoP: Class balance is cyclical. Enjoy your time on top, because it's going to end eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The difference between aggro and defensive, Gimmel, was huge. It was the fact that the issue was ackowledged YEARS prior, and to which EB weapons were put in the game as a temporary fix until they could find a solution. It was also a huge issue that affected gamewide play... not a FEW encounters in a SINGLE expansion.<br />
<br />
Knight Defensive and snap aggro aren't even in the same league as an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">No, it was a class weakness that was well known before, but never was never crippling in the way it was in PoP because of the way the expansion was designed. Just like the inability of knights to tank hard hitting mobs. It's a well known class weakness that was never before the major issue it has become in GoD. The parallel is almost perfect. But I woudn't expect you to see that.<br />
<br />
I think it's a no brainer that knight's ought to be as far ahead of non-warriors in tanking as warriors are ahead of them. I think that's just good game design. Just like I think all tank classes should be able to generate enough aggro to get their job done. That's just good game design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If my posting style got a lot more harsh and strident, and I happen to think it didn't, but if it did, there was a reason for that.  Some of the Paladins over on PoN seem to have the attitude that because they eventually came around to believing that Warriors had a problem, after months and months of arguing with Frodlin, you, myself, and others, that now that Paladins seemed to having a problem that all Warriors should jump up and endorse the Paladin fix that they believed was the correct one.  Because I didn't agree that their approach was the correct one, although I agreed something needed to be done, I was implied to be a betrayer, called a hypocrit directly and worse.  I was routinely attacked as though I was the devil incarnate, even though I agreed that there was a problem.  You know, sometimes a guy will get testy about things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Seriously, at this point in time, we all know what it's like over there. <br />
<br />
So WHY would anyone bother posting to that forum?<br />
<br />
The solution is to just remove it from  your favorites and never visit it again. If WHAT you have to say is going to be completely REMOVED like it didn't exist, then you have no reason whatsoever to bother with such a message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Because it makes them feel important to complain about it, Wub.<br />
&quot;WAAAAH! I got censored at PoN! Aren't I cool! I pissed off the paladins!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, you are cool. Pallys suck. They are whiney little whiney bitches, and they wear girls underwear under their armor. And they swing their sword funny.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Ahh, Gimmel, but tanking = aggro control + survivability, so knights ARE just as ahead of nontanks as warriors are ahead of knights. <br />
<br />
Why? knights have just as much better aggro control over any non knight that can take a hit, as warriors have over knight survivability with defensive.<br />
<br />
Take a step back from the &quot;OH NOS monks can tank&quot; for a minute and take a look at everything else. Monks don't have the HP hybrids do, nor do they have nearly the aggro control.<br />
<br />
Such balance does exist, but I wouldn't expect you to see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Why? knights have just as much better aggro control over any non knight that can take a hit, as warriors have over knight survivability with defensive.<br />
Evidently your list only includes monks. What about rangers, BSTS, Berzerkers? But of course this is a silly and pedantic point. But since that it the kind of argument you want, I will be clearer:<br />
&quot;I think it's a no brainer that knights ought to be as far ahead of non-warriors in taking melee damage as warriors are ahead of them. I think that's just good game design. Just like I think all tank classes should be able to generate enough aggro to get their job done. That's just good game design.&quot;<br />
<br />
To put it even more simply, there should be a clear difference between tanks, and non-tanks, warriors should CLEARLY take punishment better than anyone, and knights should CLEARLY take damage better than everyone else. In my ideal world, warriors would have DI-2, and knights DI-1, and knights would get a half defensive (maybe a bit less) with perhaps a 40min reuse timer and some spell casting penalties (either slows cast time or ups fizzle percentage), and in addition it would require LoH or HT to be currently active and would deactivate them for the full useage period. For most single group content, the change would be irrelevant, since warriors aren't using defensive regularly anyways. For most raid content, you will still want your beefiest tank up there anyways, which will still be a warrior. It would have very limited effects of very tough single group content, and for raids where there are no warriors left standing, or where there is a major gear discrepancy with the warrior being very unerequipped.<br />
<br />
So eh, that's my little dreamworld. I think it would work, be far more elegant than whatever it is that they are going to trot out, satisfy most knights, and not threaten the position of warriors. But I guess that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Evidently your list only includes monks. What about rangers, BSTS, Berzerkers? But of course this is a silly and pedantic point. But since that it the kind of argument you want, I will be clearer.<br />
<br />
No, it doesn't include only monks. Monks are the closest in taking melee damage. The other classes are worse in taking melee damage compared to knights, ON TOP OF their greater aggro issues.<br />
<br />
Don't think that just because I bring up one class, that's the only one I've considered. I've jsut brought up the class that would most strongly favor your argument and shown that there really isn't the issue you think there is, with even that class that favors your argument the strongest.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why you almost never hear of any tank but the war/sk/pal except of the most trivial of content, you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">No Gimmel,<br />
Aggro was just as much as an issue in LDoN. Verrant/SoE consistantly said it was the group's responsiblity to manage aggro. When they no longer had to with a Knight tanking, they stopped.<br />

In my Ideal World Warriors would have the unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles. Knight would have an add tank role in raids. And spellbooks, the major distinguishing difference between Warriors and Knights (after Defensive), would never be &quot;disabled&quot;, have casting penalties, or be useless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">No, it doesn't include only monks. Monks are the closest in taking melee damage. The other classes are worse in taking melee damage compared to knights, ON TOP OF their greater aggro issues.<br />
<br />
Actually monks and rogues are the worst for holding aggro as tanks with beastlord and ranger being the best.  On my server it is not uncommon for beastlords to tank in LDoN normal.  They tank about as good as a monk, have better dps, can buff their own hp's as if a shaman was present, and slow...what more can you ask for?<br />
<br />
But I'm not going to defend Gimmel.  I've never posted at PoN and probably never will.  However I see the problem alot different than most here.  The problem IS hybrids.  Talk with any old skool role-player (pen &amp; paper) and they'll tell you the 2 biggest flaws with role-playing games.  1) Hybrids at high levels being either EXTREMELY overpowered.  Or if the rules gimped them, unable to perform any primary role in an adventure setting.  2)  Characters becoming wholey overpowered and unable to find avenues of progression beyond a certain point.<br />
<br />
It's amazing to me how similar EQ is in these regards.  Hybrids traditionally had the tradeoff of being more powerful at lower and mid levels but then becoming surpassed at the highest levels by parent classes.  THIS WAS THE DESIGN INTENTION.  The same thing with casters.  Wizards needed a large amount of luck to survive at the lower levels but then became THE MOST POWERFUL CLASS at the very high levels.<br />
<br />
Now we get to EQ.  At very high levels what do we see?  The same situtations as a burnt out pen &amp; paper theme.  Hybrids, vieing for identity step on their parents toes.  To do a job as good as a parent class means always being overpowered.  Even the smallest amount of added gain from the second parent's nature will tip the scales.  Secondly you see classes unable to advance.  With EQ we insert AA, loot objectives, flagging all of which gives avenues of progression to essentially burnt out players.  But even with all this it's funny how often you see silk wearers, and dps classes talking about their HP's.  It's because that is the one last real avenue of progression for them.<br />
<br />
So what can you do in the end for hybrid's?  The answer to me is &quot;not much&quot;.  Maybe put a big warning label on hybrid classes letting new players know &quot;If you pick this class, you'll be able to do many things well, but no one thing greatly.&quot;  You could perhaps design the game to require hybrid type roles in the basic mechanics.  How this would be done I have NO idea.  Basically you'd have to give something to hybrids that is special (from neither parent class) that lets them perform a necessary role.  Something like BSS but it would have to be a much larger function to keep the player interested and make him stand out.  It should also be something that the hybrid 'grows into' at the end levels as this is where the real problems arise.</div></div><hr />

That's a given that rangers and beastlords have better aggro control. They also have inferior survivability, which is the tradeoff.<br />

have shown that rangers and beastlords do not, in fact, tank as well as monks.<br />

Now, as for their casting abilities... you're telling me they can MT, spend mana for aggro control, AND do all the slowing, AND do all their buffs, all at once? That's a... stretch.<br />

Where the hell are they getting this idea?  It's absolutely not the case.  Are they just making it up to try to get upgrades?  Do they honestly have no idea?  Do they only group with monks and beastlords (and rangers!) who have far superior gear to them?  I don't get it.  Rangers have never tanked anyways near as well as any plate tank.  Monks haven't done so since the monk mitigation change years ago.  Beastlords are along the same lines as monks.<br />
<br />
And given that knights have already successfully tanked all of the ikkinz trials, though admittedly with a much higher failure rate than warriors, I don't think they've got a damn thing to complain about.  It's the cutting edge content right now.  Get some more upgrades from mid GoD where guilds are at now and higher end GoD later and more and more knights will be tanking it with more and more success.  These doomsayers claiming their class will never be able to tank it are full of it.  Hopefully Sony knows enough not to listen to this &quot;we want defensive&quot; BS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd read more, but between that thread and another one on that board, the level of ignorance turned me off pretty quick. <br />
<br />
It didn't take long for me to find this gem:<br />
Well with other classes such as BL's monks Rangers and others tanking almost as well as knights, and some even better at times, we feel the same way warriors did prior to the fix. <br />
<br />
Seems to be a pretty widely held perception over there that I've yet to see a smidgen of proof on.  In fact the only proof via parses we seem to have shows the exact opposite of that conclusion.  But they want Sony to base balancing decisions on it.  Nice.  And who gives a crap if you &quot;feel the same way warriors did&quot; if you don't have the proof to justify it?<br />
<br />
They also made it very obvious that they want upgrades because they're mad that warriors got upgrades.  That shouldn't surprise me though.  The moment the warrior upgrades went in, some of the knights were yelling, &quot;Woe is us!  This will return us to the dark days of Kunark!  Woe and misery!&quot;  That of course isn't true, but it doesn't stop people from resenting another class getting some upgrades and wanting more for themselves.  <br />
<br />
Obviously if many of the players of EQ had their way, class balancing would just be an endless stream of class upgrades.  I love how you can find people at class boards everywhere spouting stuff like, &quot;You cannot possibly understand the needs of our class!&quot;  There's really an inflated idea of how complex EQ classes are.  :p<br />
<br />
Oh, and previous warnings issued or not, banning someone for using the word &quot;knightemization&quot; is pathetic.  It shows that the mods obviously let personal opinions on an issue effect their moderating.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that would happen. Knights are a hybrid class they took certain penalties and gained others. Based on thier class design and them having a spellbook defensive isnot the way to go around fixing thier tanking gap.<br />
 <br />
Since soo many people say that thier spellbook is out of date maybe the more logical path would be on the lines of being able to cast spells more efficiently while being beat on or a line of self only high mana quick heals that could be cast. This not only would give them some of a boost in tanking but in longer battles or high DPS battles warriors would still probably remain on top as they should be for taking dmg.<br />
 <br />
Bottom line warriors should take dmg better than anyone else but pallies should be able to mitigate that dmg in other ways but not as efficiently as warriors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Just a few examples get off my back<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Yeah, I am NOW, because I think they have a legitimate beef. In PoP, I firmly supported the warriors in getting better aggro. Frodlin, Glatius, and I were 3 of the main agitators on PoN speaking up for the resolution of warrior aggro problems. I am capable of examining issues separately and not just looking at the class involved. I try to look beyond &quot;class loyalty&quot; (I also play a 64 warrior currently, though I wasn't during PoP), and try to see what is good for the game, not just for self interest. Something that seems to escape several warriors and paladins. I think warriors needed to be able to generate the aggro needed to do their jobs. And I think that knights need to have something that sets their tanking ability apart from other classes as much as warrior tanking is set apart from knights. Call me crazy.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The difference between aggro and defensive, Gimmel, was huge. It was the fact that the issue was ackowledged YEARS prior, and to which EB weapons were put in the game as a temporary fix until they could find a solution. It was also a huge issue that affected gamewide play... not a FEW encounters in a SINGLE expansion.<br />
<br />
Knight Defensive and snap aggro aren't even in the same league as an issue.<br />
  <br />
To put it even more simply, there should be a clear difference between tanks, and non-tanks, warriors should CLEARLY take punishment better than anyone, and knights should CLEARLY take damage better than everyone else. In my ideal world, warriors would have DI-2, and knights DI-1, and knights would get a half defensive (maybe a bit less) with perhaps a 40min reuse timer and some spell casting penalties (either slows cast time or ups fizzle percentage), and in addition it would require LoH or HT to be currently active and would deactivate them for the full useage period. For most single group content, the change would be irrelevant, since warriors aren't using defensive regularly anyways. For most raid content, you will still want your beefiest tank up there anyways, which will still be a warrior. It would have very limited effects of very tough single group content, and for raids where there are no warriors left standing, or where there is a major gear discrepancy with the warrior being very unerequipped.</div></div><hr />

 Each class has strength's and weakness's, people need to learn them and live with them.<br />
<br />
 In my very unimportant opinion i feel they are very well balanced now. After the recent melee changes, warriors now can produce enough aggro to tank. Knights have their spell books and the ability to tank 99% of what a warrior can tank. <br />

Let's go back in that time machine. In the high end game, Warriors have DBoW/EoE, Raex BP, and Symbol of the Planesmaster. WA5 becomes available to each of the tank classes in GoD. Let's assume Bellow of the Mastrug is replaced with Spirit of the Warrior - a pseudo buff that copies the self buff all other Warrior derived classes have. Sturdyness becomes hmmmm an advanced Lightning Reflexes. And instead of Anger augs Warriors have to use Ykesha augs. I'll pull out my Crystalline Silk nets for ranged aggro. Why for all practical purposes, at the high end there's no difference! Imagine that!<br />
<br />
SoE has said in effect that they are going to do some content tuning. I'm expecting that content prior to the Ikkinz raids are going to be a more reasonable step beyond PoTime and even less where approprite. Ooooooh, all fixed - and it doesn't take eroding the Warrior tanking advantages.<br />
<br />
So the whole Warriors got a needed Update so we should have one based on badly tuned content argument is baloney. Fix the content, and Knights are pretty much in the same shape as when guilds first entered the EP's. Warriors tanked harder mobs with inadequate equipment thanks to Defensive and Knights became capable of tanking those same mobs as they gained end expansion equipment. So should it be in GoD.<br />
<br />
Many Knights reject the &quot;fix&quot; solely because they don't get to become closer to the tanking capability Warriors have under Defensive - a difference that has existed for 4 years. A difference due to a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />
<br />
Heck, read PoN and EQLive. They are filled with posts proposing Warrior-like burst mitigation by another route. The lust for Defensive is so great they are in complete denial that SoE has said the content will be adjusted.<br />

This thread on the outhouse appears to be a complaint about the heavy handedness of PoN admin in moderating alternating points of view.  I don't go there... so I cant tell you the relative merit of this argument..<br />
<br />
I do know that very few people have been banned or have had their posts edited on TSW.... EVER.  Anyone asserting otherwise doesn't spend much time here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">thats basically what your proposing for paladins, and every other class who has a legitimate beef with class balance right now. classes were FAR FAR FAR closER to being balanced during pop than they are now, and i am not just referring to paladin/warrior debacle.<br />
<br />
hell, even after the warrior changes, before GoD classes were very close to being balanced.<br />
<br />
Well that certainly an opinion.  It would be nice if you explained why you held that opinion rather than merely stating it and expecting everyone to say, &quot;you know, he's right.&quot;  Why are classes so out of balance?  What classes are we talking about?<br />
<br />
As far as the Warrior changes, I'll agree that in many ways prior to PoP Knights and Warriors were very close to being in balance.  With the one difference being that Knights could hold aggro and routinely got groups while Warriors couldn't hold aggro and routinely didn't get groups.  Now that's been leveled.  In PoP and LDoN there is no compelling reason to take a Knight over a Warrior unless the group is missing something the Knights can make up for with their spells.  And there is no compelling reason to take the Warrior over the Knights in as much as the Knights can tank the content adequately.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm sure you'll say, the problem isn't in PoP or LDoN, the problem is in GoD.  Exactly, the problem is in GoD.  A new expansion less than four months old and in need of some tuning.  The mobs that are the problem hit too hard, because it's a new expansion in need of some tuning.  Fix the mobs, and all Knight bitches are moot.  They'll be just as interchangable with Warriors in GoD as they are in PoP and LDoN.  And the -1DI change doesn't just show up in GoD, does it?  Defensive isn't just used in GoD, is it?  If there is relative parity everywhere in the game except GoD, why exactly should Knights be given a huge boost in GoD?  Doesn't that throw the rest of the game out of balance?  It seems to make a lot more sense to adjust the content to be in line with established advantages/disadvantages of the three tank classes then to upgrade Knights when we've just finished working on upgrades for Warriors to establish &quot;parity&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Because they're mad that we got upgrades and want their upgrades, too.  :P</div></div><hr />

I'll look you in the eye and tell you that some of the mod decisions on PoN are arbitrary and unwarranted, and arise from abuse of mod powers for political purposes rather than the mod-ee crossing any lines.  I'd link examples if ezboard wasn't down.<br />

now wasn't that a bit dramatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">now wasn't that a bit dramatic.<br />
 No, it wasn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Shadowfrost is just still burnt about the hammer! <br />

hahah</div></div><hr />

<br />
And with good reason.  If it wasn't for PoN, the clerics would still be doing upwards of TWENTY DPS with their l33t Hammers, and then NO PALADINS WOULD EVER GET GROUPZ AT ALL!<br />
<br />
You insensitve bastards, how dare you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">So tell me. Does anyone else find it ironic that anyone who is posting here freely and without repression defending the knights position, and more importantly, the PoN boards would be banned for posting in the very same manner on their boards defending the warrior's position and the TSW boards. Irony indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Hehe i just tried going onto the PoN boards, ive been banned, i made 5 posts, not 1 was inflammatory, recieved no warnings.....<br />
<br />
Which means they are banning warriors in general or are reading this board and then banning people on the pon boards for whats being said here.<br />
<br />
I was a supporter of pallies getting upgraded but paladins have now lost any support from me in anyway. Thank you admins of PoN, and fuck knights, you dont deserve shit and i hope you all fucking quit.  <br />
<br />
Fickle, i know, but paladins can suck my left nut</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Oh lol,<br />
I, of course, know Korinn in-game. A nicer guy you've never met.<br />
<br />
S'ok bro. While I'm pretty sympathethic to high level Paladins who only want to MT flag trials and have a raid role in GoD, I'm pretty unsympathic to:<br />
<br />
1. Those who posted prior to GoD's release saying Paladins should get Defensive since Warriors got the Provoke line.<br />
<br />
2. Those who one week after the release of GoD posted Knights couldn't get through the sewers, Vxed, and Tipt - therefore Warriors should lose Defensive or Knights should get it.<br />
<br />
3. Those who's Magelos reveal they would benefit from clearing PoTime a couple dozen times before complaining about the Ikkinz trials.<br />
<br />
4. Those who write detailed authoritative complaints yet fail to mention they have completed sewers, Vxed, Tipt, at least one Ikkinz trial, Ikkinz raids, and are showing raid loot even beyond that point. It's amazing to see someone that claims they can't add tank Kod'Taz yardtrash and to know better.<br />
<br />
5. Those who read an SoE dev's comment that Defensive is a defining Warrior ability and will not be shared yet pressed on with suggestions that were Defensive in Sheep's Cothing and then banned Warriors for disturbing their Wa and being too provocative.<br />
<br />
6. Those who complain about any SoE proposed fix that doesn't include Defensive.<br />
<br />
7. Those that have the gall to suggest Paladins should get CH.<br />
<br />
Oh, I've got plenty of sympathy and support for those Top 100 or so Knights that have legitimate complaints. But much of the crew that posts on the PoN so-called Class Balance Board - well you've read their posts eheh and we still do have Arbosch, Taragor, and ocassionally Aeka. 'Nuff said 8).<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Btw the easiest Tipt run i ever did was with myself, 2 paladins, a boxed wiz, cleric and rogue. Did it in record time without even a hint of trouble. Paladins underestimate their own power. The pallies didnt tank? So fucking what? your spellbook is useless? Bullshit, stfu and learn to play.</div></div><hr />

Korinn Winterhaven i think, now you can go check my posts on PoN, as was your intention in asking?</div></div><hr />

hahah<br />
<br />
Look, this isn't a flame board and direct insults don't seem appropriate here.<br />
<br />
But under the circumstances and considering your post, I reckon I'm within my rights to call you a smug, self-satisfied lil punk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Actually, this is the outhouse, so yeah, it basically is a flame board.<br />
<br />
And secondly, I'd wager that was a joke.</div></div><hr />
