<br />
This warrior always, as he pulled the mob to the group, flipped the mob around so that the mob's back faced the group. Here's a comparison of the typical battle between group 1(SK) and group 2(War)<br />
<br />
Group1]&gt;&gt; [Shadowknight]&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;[Monster]<br />
[Group2]&gt;&gt; [Monster]&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;[Warrior]<br />
<br />
The second method is FAR more desireable. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Stating an obvious insight discovered 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
This is especially helpful to me, as a mage, <br />
<br />
Obviously an expert on melee combat.<br />
<br />
I'd rate the value of his analysis somewhere around the level of buffalo chips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think what he was trying to say in the first example was that the SK, to whom everyone insists is a better tank than the traditional warrior, didnt know to turn the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what the &quot;better tank&quot; has to do with this.   What doers better tank mean?<br />
<br />
There is one final thing I feel I must mention, however. The Shadowknight in the first mission was a good SK. Held aggro well, when it was lost was quick to regain it, and otherwise used spells appropriately. The warrior, though, was an excellent tank. He always seemed to know exactly where every mob was, and he took the responsibility of positioning the mob in the most convenient place for killing. Tanks, I can not tell you how much of a difference this makes. It turns a disorganized mess of a group into an effecient killing machine. <br />
<br />
This is the elaboration of the same lame point.  Rather than stick to the complex argument he is telling people a &quot;tanking 101&quot; principle.  This just tells me he is a caster &quot;discovering&quot; new insights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izudin</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would wonder how many tanks do not care about mob positioning, so that other melees or pets can attack from the rear. I would estimate that maybe 5% of all tanks actively do this on their own, 15% will do it when told, 60% try to do it when told but forget about it again soon, and the rest just cant or doesnt want to do it (these numbers are just estimated, but you get my point).<br />
<br />
It is pretty annoying for pet users (yes, I am a mage too :) having to reposition a water pet every few moments...this goes to the point that many of us elemental commanding people prefer to use other pets since they're just less trouble to have around...at a good loss of damage. A good tank can help his group a lot here.<br />
<br />
But back to the thread, I think the point of Goladus was to show that groups are not crippled by taking a warrior as a tank, as many people claim. The parse he did was probably flawed by too different levels of equipment/aa, and also I would think that the difference between warriors and knights in LDoN is less visible than other places like PoP. Still I would agree with him on his point...warriors are great tanks, and I like to have one in my group.<br />
<br />
This does not mean that warriors have no problems...aggro should certainly being looked at, as well as the damage output of all the pure melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goladus</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
147 was definitely incorrect, I would have adjusted the results except the forum does not allow editing.  My parser was catching finishing blows.  <br />
<br />
As for the &quot;uncontrolled&quot; nature of the parse, that was intentional.  The &quot;control&quot; was the premise:  Pickup LDoN groups.  I have seen many controlled parses here on your boards, all very useful in determining the relative value of various equipment and aa choices for warriors..  But all over the place people are complaining about being able to get groups and their generic performance in said groups, without ever REALLY looking at the end results:  That is, how well did your damn group do?<br />
<br />
I encourage you all to read as much of the thread as you can, and comment either here or there.  Spare me any of the &quot;This parse didn't do this, therefore is worthless,&quot; or &quot;he plays a mage he must not know anything about melees&quot; ad hominem garbage.  I never pretended for the parse to be definitive of anything other than a single snapshot of a night of EQ playing.<br />
<br />
This is the elaboration of the same lame point. Rather than stick to the complex argument he is telling people a &quot;tanking 101&quot; principle. This just tells me he is a caster &quot;discovering&quot; new insights.And the section about mob positioning was posted because it was a thread at The Newbie Zone.  &quot;Tanking 101&quot; style posts are the norm there.  Many of the people reading were not playing four years ago, and/or do not read The Steel Warrior.  (Although people are referred to this forum from TNZ all the time).  If I had posted in these forums, I would not have included the basic information about mob positioning, which I am sure is very basic stuff for you guys.</div></div><hr />

If you are the kind of person who prefers to invite hybrids over melees, you've likely shot yourself in the foot on more than one occaision. Be smart. Give preference to players with good reputations, not good classes. Seek only to get a good general balance to your group, do not look for a theoretical optimum class configuration. Get a good mix of abilities, and make them work.<br />
<br />
Posting that group with a competent sk that has less levels, aa, gear, and &quot;skill&quot;, outdid a group with a warrior who has more in each area does not bolster peoples confidence when considering to pick a warrior for their group.</div></div><hr />

And, Gladiolus, we're noting that yes, the warrior group was &quot;better&quot;, but we're also noting that apples are better than tomatoes.  Because of the level of gear/AA/personal skill differences, the comparison is null and void. A more valid comparison would have been an SK from the same guild as the original warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using similar levelled/geared tanks would not really make the parse much more &quot;valid.&quot;  It might be a bit more useful for people, but as a whole it really doesn't matter much.<br />
<br />
There is definitely a big weakness, but in three days no one has identified it, despite the fact that I've nearly come out and said it several times.  They are all too worried about declaring the thing &quot;null and void.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem with this parse is not that it lacks controls.  It has controls where I want them:  mainly zone and circumstances surrounding group creation.  What this parse lacks is enough data to show a trend.  I have basically one example, when I really should have 50 examples all with the same premise (random pickup groups in LDoN Mistmoore).<br />
<br />
Comparing apples to tomatoes is not the problem.  They're both food, which is good enough.  The problem is that I've only got one apple and one tomato.</div></div><hr />

My point, now that you have come here to continue your essays:<br />
<br />
1. Don't trivialize your argument (the warrior with/sans argument is complex and has far reaching implications...in particular as it id on an &quot;official&quot; board). Mixing &quot;101&quot; points and complex arguments trivializes it.   Your 101 point was the truth but it should be a topic of its own.<br />
<br />
2. Listen (don't type a gajillion responses).  Follow-up with a set of concrete variables (see Overlord section of this board for some examples) and test conditions.<br />
<br />
3. If you want melees to take you seriously limit your responses to objective, procedures, expected outcome, actual outcome and observations.  Avoid blanket subjective observations unless warranted by the actual outcomes.  Avoid essays defending your words.<br />
<br />
4. I actually think your work may have some merit.  Displayed as it is currently though it still looks like Buffalo Chips.<br />
<br />
he plays a mage he must not know anything about melees&quot; ad hominem garbage. <br />
<br />
You've done nothing to undo this image in your responses here so far.  <br />
Example:<br />
<br />
See... this is the wrong objection to make. It's frustrating to see this attitude taken so often, people seem overly eager to call a post crap or &quot;null and void&quot; when they don't like the results.<br />
<br />
Turn off the PR machine and act objectively.  <br />
<br />
Remember you posted this on a SONY  board.  You made some sweeping conclusions/statements.  Its only natural that you would see some contrary view points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point, now that you have come here to continue your essays:<br />
<br />
He didn't, really.  He posted an anecdotal observation on a Sony board targetted to newbies that, contrary to ugly myth, a warrior does not &quot;cripple&quot; a group by replacing a knight.  He DIDN'T post it to the Overlord forum, and shouldn't be blamed for feeling to meet the standards of that board.<br />
<br />
As Goladus pointed out on the Sony thread:If we'd waited around for a shadowknight instead of taking the warrior, we would have for sure lost out. Suppose we waited 10 minutes for another Shadowknight, and then only saved 5 minutes on the actual mission? Oh yeah, we're really smart.<br />
<br />
He's being faulted for comparing apples and tomatoes, and oranges and bananas are being used as evidence of this.  He's being faulted for not doing things he never stated he was doing (here and on the Sony thread).  Arguments against him seem out of context with his contributions.<br />
<br />
Yar, it would have been meaningless on TSW, where the context is longer parses and much more thorough analyses.  But most people are like me, and don't give a damn if they take a plane, a boat or a bicycle - as long as they GET THERE ON TIME.  Which is how this episode was originally presented in the first place.  That much is crystal clear.<br />
<br />
Definitely not the final say on the melee/knight issue, and I don't see where Goladus tried to make it one.  It's just an observation, and a casually useful one.  All of us here already know we can do the gig with the tools we have, just as we know that other classes have access to better tools, for a lower cost.<br />
<br />
From which I have observed that a lot of EQ players are really, really cranky :p.<br />
<br />
FWIW, repetition of the &quot;Tank 101&quot; principle is to be commended - I am often explaining to other classes that this is what I do - beastlords tend to do the same thing, to put their pet in the &quot;rogue position&quot;, and many knights I group with as MT or ST just don't know.  (Perhaps because they have never needed to keep one eye on the group, or be ready to chase a MOB down.)  If more people got this, I wouldn't have to  do the group &quot;layout&quot; so often.</div></div><hr />

Hold on there dude....I think what set me off on this was his sweeping statement:<br />
<br />
The Bottom Line is that while melee may have some issues, discriminating against warriors will not give you better results. <br />
<br />
Seems an awfully definitive statement for the informality of the analysis.<br />
<br />
Heh the hysterical part is I agree that at the end of the day pick the best personalities and don't power game your LDoN groups.   <br />

<br />
I quoted as an indicator, not to specifically target your response.  I was having a &quot;could we all just please get along moment&quot; :D, and that quote just came from the last post I read.  I just thought that someone encouraging people to group with warriors instead of jonesing for a knight deserved a little slack ;).<br />
<br />
At any rate,  I think I got a different &quot;feel&quot; off that line, but I can see now how you read it.  The written word is annoyingly subjective.  I read it as a sweeping generality rather than a definitive conclusion, borrowing interpretation from the context.<br />
<br />
Heh the hysterical part is I agree that at the end of the day pick the best personalities and don't power game your LDoN groups. <br />
<br />
And I agree too ... some of my best groups to date have been &quot;wrong&quot;, and the worst have had all the &quot;right classes&quot;.  I hate the &quot;right group&quot; concept (recognizing that some areas/events have certain requirements such as slowing), as it's only hurt other classes in the past and is hurting classes now.<br />
<br />
EDIT::Gaah, that's a lot of &quot;quotes&quot; :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Doggabone basically nailed it, I wasn't aiming this at high level melees, in fact it was barely aimed at melees at all.  It was aimed mostly at non-melees who insist on propogating the rumor that warriors are bad for xp groups.  I haven't yet met a warrior in-game who really complained about balance...  actually as a whole I've found warriors to be the least whiny of any class ever, especially given the huge number of people who play warriors.<br />
<br />
No, the problem I'm seeing on that forum is people read articles like that one from the Paladin on Mobhunter, and seeing the &quot;Classes are not that out of balance&quot; - AbsorEQ sigs, and spreading rumors.  It's popular and fun to complain about class balance.<br />
<br />
The hard parsing you guys do here is fascinating, some of the best studies ever have come out of this forum.  But your average newbie zoner doesn't have the time or patience to sort it out, and then try to make the connection between what they learned here and how it really affects their own play.<br />
<br />
And I've responded with essays more than more tests for two reasons really, I've been away from EQ-enabled computers and can't do more tests, and the little time I've spent playing games has been spent playing Final Fantasy XI.  I did, however, do more detailed analyses of the first parse later on in the thread, mostly to demonstrate that whatever aggro-holding difference there might have been between the warrior and the SK, I as a magician was similarly effective for both.<br />
<br />
edit:  and as I think I said later in the thread, I'm not really just saying look for &quot;personality&quot; over effectiveness, more that &quot;effectiveness&quot; is based on many more variables than just your class and it doesn't really hurt as much as people might think to take personality over optimization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goladus, one of the most repeated topics on this class balance parts of this board has been the lot of the average day in day out exp warrior and their role when NOT tankng in an exp group.  Basically it has been brought up that if a warrior is not tanking (a role that Paladins *argueably* do better because of snap agro) then they really have no role other than sub-standard DPS.  This is one of the crux points of warriors asking for an adjustment of class balance; either improve agro generating capability or give warriors an additional role (others make this argument much more elegantly than I).<br />
<br />
You of course walked smack dab into the middle of this (take a peak at the Outhouse and/or other posts in this forum for context...if you have the time  heh).  Its such a *loaded* topic that its too darn easy to dismiss subjective comments (which you were doin for a darn good reason now that I understand your context).  I apologize for judging you based on my mis-perception of what context you working from.  Blast it now I'm writing essays...time to refrain from posting for awhile :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Care to explain the contradiction? Are you implying warriors have not done their best over 2 years on this forum (which you admit you read and admire) to point out exactly what they felt the issues were?

I was being a bit rhetorical, and explicitly referring to people responding in that thread when I said &quot;But I don't think anyone else [knows about warrior issues] either, and I'm beginning to think no one else is really interested in understanding...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a challenge to get people to bring more facts on to the table.  For instance, in an effort to prove me wrong someone might come here and do some work organizing some of the parses, presenting them there and with some personal insight, in order to counter my point.  Unfortunately no one did that.<br />
<br />
edit:  Because the truth is, even reading these forums (which though I have read in the past and posted on the old ezboards, I did take about an 8 month break from EQ during which time I rarely read them, note I joined these new boards in October) I don't know what warrior issues are.  I know what many warriors say their issues are, and sometimes they might be right and sometimes they might be wrong.</div></div><hr />
