<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cereberial</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading through some threads on this boards one thing I don't understand is why on a raid based mob (excluding trying to decrease mobs proc rate) anyone would ever use evasive over defensive regardless of the mobs DM and DI.<br />
<br />
While I understand that there is a mathematical calc that determines what ratio between DM/DI will lead to the least amount of damage being taken by either I disagree that decreased damage is the goal as a cheal will land every x seconds.  With evasive the only thing you are doing is decreasing the impact of the cheal (Assuming cheal is the method of healing).<br />
<br />
Assuming cheal is being used the goal of defensive/evasive is twofold:<br />
<br />
A) Allow the healers to increase their cheal cycle<br />
B) Decrease the probability that between 2 cheals the damage output of the mob will be &gt; HP of the war.<br />
<br />
At what point does evasive act such that you can alter either of these variables in a meaningful way?  .13 ratio seems to be wrong for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On most of these mobs a lucky round or two can take you down anyway.  The heal cycle on PoP mobs is always the same - 2 seconds between cheals.  It doesn't slow down or speed up with any warrior disc.  The value of using evasive is it lowers the chances for these lucky rounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To add to Ainmer's explaination, there are mobs that can 1 round you even with defensive. In such a case, there is nothing you can do to save your tank. Evasive takes the chances of that happening down to almost nil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cereberial</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I agree but this is the exact opposite of the .13 ratio that dictates evasive/defensive.   If you look at the list on this site almost all POP mobs are supposed to be done using defensive due to their high DI's.<br />
<br />
In the cases in POP you are admitting the clerics can't keep up with standard mob DPS, your kicking off evasive so you have an additional chance to go an extra round. Potentially I guess there is a ratio of mob DPS/HP that says use evasive to get the additonal chance to last another round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well a few things not covered in the SoL Defensive vs Evasive comparison are things like AC mattering again, and mob attack being very low.  Also, highly damaging mob procs factor in as well.<br />
<br />
Most PoP mobs that have a very high DI also hit for max seldom, and miss often.  Add to that they often have a high DB (Like Fennin's 1024), and evasive becomes more useful.<br />
<br />
We are admitting that often in PoP clerics cannot keep up with mob burst dps.  Evasive seems to mitigate the burst dps a bit more than defensive does on some mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically if you're not in the elemental planes wearing mostly full raex's gear, go with what the DI/DB tells you.  If you are in the elementals, see Ainmer and Wandor's posts above.<br />
<br />
Someone should write an addendum to the &quot;ubermob tanking&quot; post to cover this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defensive will always be better than Evasive dealing with a burst round because while there is a chance the mob still won't miss for all 4 hits with evasive, there is no chance that a mob will hit his normal max under defensive.<br />
<br />
Defensive is better at dealing an absolute burst round.  But Evasive mitigates more damage over all so if you're not getting one round killed very often, it's a better deal.  The faster refresh is a nice plus too.  Defensive would be preferable if there's a situation where you have to tank for 3 (and only 3 minutes) and you absolutely cannot die, but I can't think of any such examples off hand.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah defensive beats evasive on AC debuff mobs too.</div></div><hr />
