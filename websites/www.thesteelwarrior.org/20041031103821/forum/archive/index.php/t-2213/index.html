<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dispatch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys how are you I currently am dual wielding wakizahis of the frozen sky. My only good skill i have ever trained is 1hs everything else is realll low. I was wondering if theres a better weapon to quest for or buy.   Also  any kind of armor info would be appreciated I  am using mostly looted stuff like bronze brigadier stuff. <br />
<br />
You guys will be helping me out tremendously with your advice. I am currenty found In DSP hunting tribals  and farming Acrylia. Thanks for your help and advice in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm...you're on Stromm, so that makes things a bit more complex....<br />
<br />
1hb- If you feel like a camp, you could go camp the Iksar Beserker Club in Kurn's Tower....7-18, procs Fleeting Fury...<br />
2hb- Shovel should do just fine<br />
2hs- Try to get a Weighty Polearm, or something with a low delay just to work on skill.<br />
<br />
Those Wakazashis are fine for now, but try to get some Yaks and get a troll smith to make 2 HBoYs....12-22 procs a 75dd stun...not bad I think.<br />
<br />
Quest for Crafted/Soldier armor if you feel inclined also.<br />
<br />
Crafted starts in South Karana at the centaurs, and the Soldier armor requires drops from around the Twilight Sea.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot piercing....<br />
Just get a cheap piercer to work on...I would tell you to do the pike quests....but non-iksar only buddy ^_____^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was looking for the caretakers shovel from katta 14/27 +5 dmg skeleton, nice for 2hb practice but might be hard to get mob is lvl 35 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you can round up some friends go rumble through Runnyeye for some Black Alloy stuff...even can get ya some nice slashers ( Black Alloy Longsword and a Black alloy Bastard Sword )....<br />
should be decent experience at 33 too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For a decent 1hb you could just go sit down in Maiden's Eye and wait for someone to leave a Goranga Club rotting, 12/23 i think are the stats, and people let them rot all the time, just ask someone who's hunting Goranga's to let you pick it up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">doubtful that Stromm has progressed to the &quot;were letting stuff rot, come loot it&quot; stage yet Khazzuz.<br />
<br />
Its a very new server, and non transfer as well, which means everyone there had to make a new toon to play there.<br />
<br />
They are about 2 years behind other servers, as far as content slain.  Theres what, one guild on the server Vindi capable ?? maybe 2.<br />
<br />
The runnyeye suggestion is a good one.  And you should definatly quest some Crafted, or some of the Luclin low end warrior stuff, Soldiers armor.  Decent stuff, specially till you can get Hate gear, or Thurg gear.<br />
<br />
as far as weapons go, your pretty set for now, those Waks will hold you for a while.  Things like Frostbringer, Veno Axe, ect that most people start picking up in the mid 30s, 40s are quite above your reach on Stromm atm, but the Yak proc on the waks will be more than sufficient to keep aggro for a long time.</div></div><hr />
