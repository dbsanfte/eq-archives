<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minowara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on my gear, got level 65, got some AA (3 AA away from ND 3) but I am still having trouble now that I am either the MT or ST for my new guild - I don't really last long enough without max buffs to be a tank. My highest hp ever is 7045 (With Bot9, Kazaad, FoS, Boar, BSS, etc.). I was showed up by a 63 warrior with 0 AA that had 7.3k hps. We only have one shaman so I am missing out on stamina / Focus of Soul most of the time giving me under 6.6k raid buffed 90% of the time. My guild continually farms BoT towers (Other then sand), and we can do KT, Vindi, Xanamech, etc. I have about 14k to work with, what should I get, and what should I assume I am going to get by raids? Keep in mind that I am ST or MT when our MT isn't on, and the MT's gear makes me look like a level 1 warrior all over again. Some items I was thinking of are...<br />
<br />
Mosquito leg earring - 12k<br />
Barbed Rubicite Leggings - 8k<br />
Amaygladen (Spelling is screwed) Chain Mask - 35k<br />
Ornate molds - 40k+..:( <br />
Time invested into getting ornate drops from mini's - 16 hours<br />
Getting 0 ornate plate drops - priceless<br />
<br />

<br />
Tell me ya think<br />
<br />
*note* Items NOT on magelo - Frostreaver, Dain Hammer<br />
AA path - 3 innate Stamina 3 innate runspeed Natural DB 2-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if you're doing Vindi/PoI dragon and stuff like that, well first I'd say go after a Vindo Bp/boots.  Then if you do PoI dragon go after CHSD and woven shim choker.  I mean I guess it depends on how you're guilds loot is distrubted.  Mosquito leg earring would be good, I wouldn't spend money on ornate molds, just keep holding out on getting a drop, I'm sure eventually you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Work as hard as you can on AA, as the more you have the more invaluable you will be. <br />
<br />
Work towards some better haste, if you do NtoV a couple of haste items drop there, or I believe there is a neck from PoI dragon. <br />
 If you farm in BoT, try to pick up an earring there, has 80 hps and some nice resists. See if you can pick up SS MQ legs if you have the faction, bloodclaw or rubicite are also good.<br />
Vindi bp and boots would both be nice for you.<br />
Chokidai hide pauldrons are nice if you can take the neg stat hit. Also may want to think about a hiero cloak. <br />
Obviously any ornate you can lay your hands on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">perhaps you should try talking to the leadership of the guild, if your the MA or SA most of the time then its the guild responsibility to keep you alive<br />
<br />
i herd once that the stength of a guild increases with the strength of the main tank. so the better gear and agro the main tank has the bigger the mobs you can take on <br />
(dps/healers provided)<br />
<br />
if they dont help i'd sugest making a shaman, sounds like your guild needs one</div></div><hr />
