Im finding the past 2 weeks, if i dont start a grp, or go with guild, I can be LFG for about an hour. Which really sucks.....wonder how long most slowers or clerics go lfg.....</div></div><hr />

If I want real exp then about an hour, then I log to an alt.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When PoP came out my warrior was 60 with 20AA and my chanter was 52.  Everyday I would log on my warrior and stick LFG on and sit in PoV for about 45mins to an hour.  Occasionally I got a group, but usually I'd get bored of waiting and log my chanter on.  I never had to wait more than 10mins for a group and I often had invites before I even had my LFG tag up.<br />
<br />
The enchanter hit 65 2 days after the warrior.<br />
<br />
The difference...<br />
Warrior's compete with 2 other classes for the tanking spot.  They don't stack particularly well in PoP groups, they are often 3rd choice for that tanking spot, and theres too damn many of them.<br />
<br />
Enchanters compete with 3 other classes for the slower/CC spot.  They get chosen for groups for 4 reasons: haste, slow, mana regen and CC.  They are the best at haste and CC and 2nd best for slow.  There are also plenty of who would rather get a chanter in their group than buy C3.  They stack well with the other classes that fill the slower spot.  Enchanter + Beastlord, Enchanter + Shaman, Enchanter + bard are all good combos to have in a group.</div></div><hr />

Of course, that's always when I'm LFG, when I need a replacement, there's never one around :)</div></div><hr />

LDoN missions are not really requiring &quot;the&quot; group to win, i've done some with 2 warriors druid bst and monk monk, works fine. Just pick 5 others, make sure 1 is a healer or more if no slower, tada.</div></div><hr />

About 1/8 of the time, it's groups I put together.<br />
<br />
 LDoN has eased some of the downtime, but it's also brought out the johnson-measuring in other tank classes. Usually one rez is enough to cure them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most of my guildmates are heading to bed when i log on so it lets me get a lot of the chores done around the house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am normally not Lfg cause I am momentary helping my 53 shaman to grow a bit together with my 58 druid.<br />
<br />
It nearly alsways start the same.<br />
<br />
I log in 53 shaman and 58 druid and a chanter for KEI then log out chanter and log in my warrior. In that time the shaman will be asked by a chance of 50% if he want to go to LDoN. When I have time I went to nadox in moment for questing spells and easy leveling ... with a chance of 10 % for a next offer for the shaman.<br />
When there is time for raiding I bring my toons back to PoK with the same as before.<br />
<br />
Result over all. My 53 shaman gets around 5 to 8 times more invites than me. My 58 druid gets nothing. And when I say nothing I mean nothing. Not a single groupoffer in the last weeks.<br />
<br />
Best jokes are when I am raiding and sitting naked in PoT I have nearly the best chances for getting an offer for a group.<br />
<br />
But I do not know what would happen if I would have the lfg tag cause all that above happens without that utility.</div></div><hr />

Wish i had ldon on my monk. Back when it came out i was transfering monk to my clerics account, but i lost the CD keys and paid by check not CC. And cant afford to out it on monks right now.<br />
<br />
My cleric doesnt even have to have LFG on and i get invited to grps, while in pok or Baz. My war simply doesnt get invited. Only way i get a grp is if i start it. They gotta think about that if they ever do get around to mele balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that both my cleric and shaman are role because I can't sit 10 minutes in pok without a group invite and my SK still isn't role because I might get bugged once a week for a group, if that, it's not a warrior problem, and it's not really a melee problem.  <br />
<br />
It's a too damn many plate tanks because clerics are boring problem.  Everyone wants to be the big tank that beats everyone up.  My shaman has actually passed my SK in levels now because of their relative need in LDoN groups (where I won't 2 box em like I do outside of LDoN).  No amount of melee balancing will solve this.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather take a bard over an ench slower any day. however, the other buffs of the ench are superior as well :/</div></div><hr />

I'm one of the few tanks in my guild, so when I log on I get instant love.  On the rare days that things are slow in guild, my rule is after 15-20 min of lfg, then I start building my own group.

<br />
Its nice that a bard can single pull with Lull and then bring the mob in already slowed and you dont even have to taunt to take agro off them :)<br />
<br />
Much &lt;3 for bards.<br />
<br />
Shame its hard to find a good bard who is happy to pull and twist haste, mana and slow for 3-4 hours for a decent XP session, and when you do find one they are always the antisocial silent types ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a proven fact that when on a raid and LFG, your tells to join groups go up.<br />
<br />
It's part of the hard-coding of the game.<br />
<br />
I mean why else would a 65 monk, LFG in Akheva Ruins get four tells to join a group?<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

No more than 30 min any other time.<br />
<br />
The trick is to establish yourself as a great tank in LDoN.  Remember when PoP came out.  Most of us outside guilds had to prove ourselves in PoP before we could get into the real good camping spots with groups.<br />
<br />
The same happens here in LDoN.  So rest assured after a few adventurers in the dungeons which are successful you will get a group pretty quick.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I get 4 or 5 tells within 2 minutes of logging in, others it's a barren wasteland of sitting lfg for 2 hours while chatting with guildies and friends.  Anything longer than that I just log and do something else.  Oh and the 4 or 5 tells in a few minutes thing only started happening with the release of LDoN. Before it was not uncommon to go several weeks with guild groups or nothing at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
65 cleric, 230aa.  LFG times this week have varied.  Best: the group tell was there the moment my screen loaded.  Worst: about 3 hours and 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
When I'm making a group myself, the bottleneck isn't slowers or damage dealers: 90% of the time, it's finding an acceptable tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sit in a zone with 5 other tanks LFG.  Starting your own group in prime time can be tough too.  Slowers are scooped up fast.</div></div><hr />

If no bites, I either hop on the beastlord or druid and go solo.  If I'm desperate for exp, I fire up the cleric and go to places like Nobles camp in Veksar.<br />
<br />
Cleric: BOMBARDED with offers for groups if I forget to put on /roleplay.  If I'm just wanting to play cleric and not dual comp, I'm often snatched up in the blink of an eye by guildmates.  (We're low on healers.)<br />
<br />
Beastlord: Rarely LFG for more than 30 minutes if I have it up.  I even get offers when not LFG.  Cast virtue on the twinklord and BAM, tank/slower in one.  =p<br />
<br />
Druid: I can't remember the last time she had a group outside of a raid...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I can find groups, not easily, but I can, if I am willing to do LDoN (experience is slower, but I do want those anger augments).  As I do more pick-up groups in LDoN, more people get to know me, and I get tells for groups more quickly.<br />
<br />
Outside of LDoN, I have a strategy I use these days.  I use my hydra shammy to get a group, he has a much easier time.  Then, I bring the warrior to fight outside of group, and when someone leaves I ask if the warrior can take their spot.  It usually works.  Another alternative, after I am in the group for a bit, is to sub the warrior in and take the shammy out, and let the shammy slow out of group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wait about 5 minutes lfg tops. I have no patience for that. After that I'll try to make a group that includes both me and my dr00d from about 40 or so ppl on my friends if that doesnt work then I just go 2 box someplace like tactics zone in and if someone zones in and ask if they can join I tell em sure. Takes at most 30 min to make a group that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I used to look for groups with my wizard it would take anywhere from 15 minutes to the point where I would lfg for a couple hours and not find a group.  Most of the time I would go solo and put up lfg tag, but then my shot at getting a group was lessened and soloing is boring.<br />
<br />
I stopped playing my wizard because my family quit playing on the PvP server I was on.  I started a warrior with them.  I always play with my family, we have a clr, war, shm, ench, and will oftentimes get a fifth or sixth added to our group that is a friend or acquaintance.  If my family isn't on, I don't bother lfg.  Get your friends to play EQ.  Get them to play and level up a Shaman or Enchanter or Cleric.   Best bet is a shaman.  Once you have a friend who is leveled up, you two as a War and Shm will never have problems forming your own groups.<br />
<br />
Screw pickup groups.</div></div><hr />
