<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me how it works exactly? From what I have seen it just seems pretty random, sometimes I get banished right on pull, sometimes I don't get banished at all, and sometimes I'll get banished in the middle of Tmezing.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure you trigger the shadow step before you lock down and tank. The tank should be the last person to get initial agro on the pull. If you debuff before engaging there should be no reason to be on the list.<br />
<br />
The Rathe encounter is nice due to it not being blow able. Take your time learning it and it will pay off in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if you can &amp; no idea on refresh (although they might only do it like once each or something now that I think of it, but its been a while since I did rathe so I dunno for sure).<br />
<br />
We always just dealt with it - it seems pretty random so as long as your tank and/or rotation clerics get banished its not too bad really, obvioiusly it poses a greater risk the further into the event you get as you usually have to operate pretty lean from tanking/healing stand point near then end.</div></div><hr />

So have your puller pull it without hurting it, then just before it gets to camp start pelting it with stars or bellow.  Once they get ported have them FD/FM and then peel.  That should buy at least some time.<br />
<br />
I don't know how the target for the port works.  I dont' think it is that big of a deal though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
definatly not, there is no &quot;to-be- banished&quot; list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throag</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this :<br />
<br />
Have monk first tag the RC<br />
Have ranger get aggro with snare and bring it to camp<br />
Warrior tag the mob with an arrow.<br />
Now you have 2 choices : The monk FD -&gt; ranger is on top of aggro list, and then isn't affected by banish and will NOT be banished but the warrior is 2nd on aggro list and on top of the &quot;banish list&quot; (since the monk is FD and ranger has aggro) and WILL get banished, exactly the same with rampage.<br />
2nd choice : Monk does not FD, ranger is still first on aggro list  and is not affected by banish, but monk is higher on the 'banish list' than the warrior (because he entered aggro list before the warrior) -&gt; monk WILL get banish and warrior will not.<br />
<br />
Try this and I can tell you it will happen that way, when we were still doing rathe I could predict with 100% certainty who was gonna get banished by following that logic.<br />
<br />
You can believe that it's random and you cannot do anything to prevent banishing, but in that case, I can tell you you're wrong.</div></div><hr />

Like 30+ people entered the agro list before I did. Nonsense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Throag, on the 2 rathe reflag that I have done with you, I got banished like 3times+ at least ( sure thing ), with one time where I did nothing at all on the councilman, beside just moving a bit closer in the nuke range if I recall well.<br />
<br />
Also a necro team can be good to pull them easier and faster, but it would need competent necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throag</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might get funky after a bunch of people get into aggro list or whatever, but I'm sure it works that way at least in the first few seconds of the fight, and that's what is important anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutalliss</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gave up trying to find any pattern in it. I remember one time we did the script where I seriously thought I was jinxed, getting banished each time I tanked :/<br />
<br />
Also, I dont think the banish spot is in any sort of pattern, seems it can be just as random.<br />
<br />
Then last time we did it, not long ago, I wasnt banished once.<br />
<br />
Only advice I can give is not to engage as first person, thus risking banish, but go easy when mob is pulled to camp.<br />
<br />
However, nothing really supports that having first aggro will make banish fire off either.<br />
<br />
Just make sure all the tanks are ready, so if / when a tank gets banished, someone else is fast to step in before healers etc are eaten :P</div></div><hr />

isn't it just shadow step? not banishing?  <br />
You could argue banishing will generally send you to a pre-determined spot and shadow step is a random location.  The Rathe is more or less a shadow step since it'll send you to a random location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from out encounters with the Rathe, it seems to send everyone to pretty much the same location despite being different tiki men doing it.</div></div><hr />

If i so much as sneezed at it before it was fully on land, I got SS'd just about every time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya when doing rathe, i found that if i did not tag with an arrow and just let the puller bring to me, i would not get SS'd.  may have just been pure luck, but when others would tag with an arrow, they would get SS'd so i chose not to tag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pling</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have pulled about 150 coincilmen if you count all the wipes (and our 3 successes) and my estimation is that the puller is punted in about half the pulls, 40% is the snarer punted and 10% is someone else.<br />
<br />
They usually punt early (in like 30 seconds) so my advice is to have 3-4 peeps get aggro on every pull BEFORE it reaches the Tank (example: bard, monk, sk-snare, necro-snare) and have one or two of these four be quite near the councilman on inc to get it to use up his punt on them rather than on the MT.<br />
<br />
Never, never let a non-fd class aggro a councilman on inc. If a druid snares or chanter tash and gets aggro + punt, the coincilman will move towards the punted and that may bring it close to offtanks.<br />
<br />
Rarely a offtanker will get punted, but it can happen if the time drags on, so be ready with some extra tankers.</div></div><hr />
