I took a look at my magelo in full elemental/time gear and I'm gaining like 3890 raw hp, 2980  raw mana (if I had a manapool), 857 ac, 195 atk, 410 str, 412 sta, 227 dex, 271 wis, 253 int, 55 cha but I'm only gaining 145 agi!<br />

What the heck is up with that? I mean sure I could be complaining that I only get 55 cha too, but agi is something I worry more about considering it's semi relative to ac in a small way.<br />

Especially on my non-melee/hybrid classes.  Clerics do nicely with Combat Agility, as we get no defensive abilities other than a 75 in dodge.  If I can add more agi, but not have a strong hit at all on my other stats, I will.  It might only add about .1% more avoidance, but on my cleric I'll take anything I can get to stay alive longer. :D</div></div><hr />

Charisma is more important than agility.....  Where you been?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rumor that agi helped run speed came from the fact that when you were encumbered your agi dropped and you began to run slower.  It was proven false like Binn said.<br />
<br />
As for what agi really does.  It increases your ac by 1 point every 6 or 7 agi.  Thats it.  You don't dodge or avoid more.  Note though, if your agi does drop below 75, then you will take a large hit, but thats the only thing you need to worry about with agi.  It's a worthless stat.  Though I know many are going to say, what about once you've maxed all the others?  It's still not worth bothering over.  Hell, dex isn't worth bothering with either.  I believe the parses came out to 1% increase in proc rates for 100 dex.  Agi is not sexy, it's sad.  Cha actually has a use though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CHA influences the success of DI, several test have been done by clerics and its a proven fact.<br />
<br />
Not proven is its influence on invisibility, probably just a myth...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I bought my toon at level one april 15th 2001. 180 days played and still not a clue. I mean I know what divine intervention is but I've never been a part fo a high end raiding guild and as such I don't know all their tactics on different mobs. I could see the uses of intervention but in the exp groups I'm in, it's a wasted buff slot, well unless the cleric sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DI is 500 mana, costs two emeralds, and lasts 10 minutes.  It's not an exp group thing.  It's not just a high end raiding thing.  It's useful for whatever mobs are considered powerful enough relative to your guild.  So elemental people would be using it on Reparm, HoT level people would be using it on Vindi, etc.  Basically, if you get down to below 15% hps it has a chance to heal you, so no matter what you raid, if something goes wrong and you get that low, it can save you.  If your cleric starting the CH rotation gets a lag spike at the beginning or slow wears off before it can be reslowed and your clerics are doing the rotation for the mobs slowed dps, etc, it just might save the raid.  Though, lower difficulty stuff isn't as hard as it once was, so it's not used quite as often by the guilds that kill them.  Whereas there are some elemental mobs where people use a DI rotation in addition to the CH rotation to keep the tank up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">divine intervention is useful on when you are raiding mobs that have a high chance of one rounding tanks.  It has a chance of giving the tank a free heal when ever they are below a certain amount of hit points.<br />
<br />
Its a kunark spell, however until PoP it was considered a useless spell and few clerics bothered to get it.  In the end game of PoP however with several mobs that can kill a tank in one round any means of keeping the tank up is a big deal and as a result charisma has gained value as it increases the chance of DI going off.<br />
<br />
It wouldnt be suprising that a warrior not in a serious raiding guild has never had DI cast on them.  It was a rare spell back in kunark and there are plenty of clerics out there today who don't have it, so why the fuck rag on him over it?  Does it give you a little woody to say &quot;did you buy your toon&quot; or something?  Make you feel special?  &quot;ooh I know something about a game on the internet that someone else didnt! I r so much uberer than them!&quot;<br />
<br />
FFS people.  You don't have to be rude, if you dont have something constructive / interesting to say then for once try and restrain yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess the guilds I've been a part of were just too gimptastical to use this spell then. Or maybe we just had the mobs overpowered and figured we didn't need it or something. Besides, this entire thread was posted as sort of a joke because I was laughing at the fact that armor no longer has agi on it after a certain point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DI is a rare spell...not unusual for clerics not to have it.  I've seen it for sale on Veeshan for 10k+ lots of times.  Many clerics just don't have it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For whatever reason, agility is the hardest 'melee' stat to cap in the long run. I know there was a while where my unbuffed WISDOM was equal to my agility (30 above it if you didn't count innate agi AAs). But if you really want/need to max it on a raid, it shouldn't be hard to do with a couple of buffs.</div></div><hr />
