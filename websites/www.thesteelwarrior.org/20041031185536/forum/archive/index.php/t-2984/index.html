<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sure, you could add a second stun to a GSoT, but would the Windblade DPS trump the two procs?  I was also thinking of adding stun to my old Katana of Pain.  Would great ratio + stats + stun proc &gt; a second proc on my CHoS?  <br />
<br />
I think a few tests are in order.  &gt;:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know a lot of us are thinking about this. I was thinking WMBS + stun proc since it is much faster and DPS is similar. But then I'm thinking another stun proc on GSoT sounds nifty. Personally I'm going to save my points and think long and hard on it because it is an &quot;investment&quot;. Perhaps I will save until I can get a BoC or similar quality weapon and turn it into a monster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Then what would you use for dps? :D<br />
<br />
But sticking to topic, war marshalls would be a better choice for quick buyable 2hs dps+aug weapon.  I would assume that war mashalls has an aug slot?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:bleh slow poster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, the WMBS has a type 4 augment slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wondering cause I'm still waiting on LDoN ... has the Split Blade of Destruction been given a slot appropriate for a stun ...? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All existing weapons were given Type 4 Augmentation slots.<br />
<br />
Type 4 = procs and such<br />
<br />
You cannot add stats (+5sta, +20hp, etc.) to existing weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For duel wield I thought Shortblade of Lightning + Falchion of Storms w stun aug would be nice, also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Moss Covered Twig with stun proc yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe one of the easier items to get is a Strike of the Ykesha proc augment from the Guk area (100DD + 0.0sec stun...assuming 55 limit)...somewhere around 450 points.  From early reports from the beastlord and cleric boards, the augments have their own proc rate (although MUCH lower than cleric hammers hehe), but do not interfere with the original proc other than it cannot proc at the same time.  More testing needed, tho.<br />
<br />
Just think...a warrior with 4 stun procs on two weapons. :D  Wonder if there's going to be a &quot;increase hate modifier&quot; augment for armor as well?  There's also an &quot;Anger II&quot; proc (200hate increase) available at one of the camps...probably for about 500 points.  Wonder how useful that'd be augmented onto a BoC or BoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's Anger 3 at one of the camps (can't be bothered to look up which now) and that's +300 Hate. I'd much rather have Wrath of the Ykesha tho, 150dd and 0.0 stun. 1100 points to buy at South Ro. <br />
<br />
Gonna add that to my GSo4W asap, then to my GBoS and to another 1h-er eventually when I have one worth putting it into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*boggle* Just got to thinking, stun/aggro proc on Ornate Greatblade, Crowfooted Lance or Stone Etched Warsword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I added Wrath of  Ykesha to my SoD. The it seems to go off as much as the 288dd and had one round of double procs. Needless to say 443 of dd in one round was incredible. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nm, found the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wymp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jaws ... how many adventure points was Wrath of Ykesha?<br />
<br />
Only Strike and Force have been stated so far, so give us some helpful info, there, skippy.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jaws, that sounds awesome, just awesome.  Could you do some parses with your mod'd SoD pleeeease???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK Wrath of Ykesha 1150 a-pts from the Guk adventures.<br />
<br />
Yes I will parse when I get home tonight</div></div><hr />
