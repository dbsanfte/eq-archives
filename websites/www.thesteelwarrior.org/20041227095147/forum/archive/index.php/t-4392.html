Overheard over the clamor of the Tavern here at TSW is some really newsworthy...err, news....<br />
<br />
Remember Kerafyrm? Yes, 'The Sleeper'. Seems those PeeKays who reside over on Rallos Zek Server have heard something was 'unkillable' and put that myth to rest. Overheard was this quote from one of the Zek's inhabitants:<br />
<br />
&quot;Im proud to say that 3 mighty guilds Ascending Dawn, Wudan and Magus Imperial Magicus have defeated Kerafyrm(aka The sleeper) on the Rallos Zek server. /bow to all my wonderful guildies in Wudan, all my friends in AD and MiM. We showed everyone how much heart we have on this Zek server.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems they put all their squabbles and manhunts aside and decided it was time to show us 'bluebies' just how powerful they really are and how they can work as a team....the headcount was around 170 or so; and over the course of hours and the incorporation of the 'new' MassGroupBuff &quot;resurrection&quot; they knocked the wee beastie down to size and got to fight over the corpse that had.....nothing on it.<br />
<br />
I guess that saved them from killing each other over the cloth caps eh?<br />
<br />
But join the festivities in in The Tavern (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4383) and slide one of them 'reds' a beer and a word of congratulations. Just make sure when you leave for the evening you don't run into &quot;Team HarmTouch&quot; trying to jack ya for your wallet.</div></div><hr />
