This is for every warrior who has time and time again pleaded on the forums with great suggestions about how to fix the class and make a warrior a WARRior again and for those who want to see some results.<br />
<br />
So come on down to the Argent Dawn server at 7pm pacific and create your very own gnome warrior too show your support. Many fun events will be happening so don't miss it. Whether you are a warrior yourself or just want to support your fellow warrior friends, this is for YOU!<br />
<br />
My responce:<br />
<br />
We have already gotten a responce. What is the point of this protest?<br />
<br />
Trust me if it uis justifited I will throw down with the rest of you, but in this case its not. We already have a dev responce--about 72 hours ago, just how fast do you expect their ideas about rebalancing to gel?<br />
<br />
Not to mention with number of responces, just being there in an organized fashion has a very good chance of lagging the server and disrupting others game play. I garentee you that will earn a responce. But not the one you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Having gotten &quot;attention&quot; this is neither the time or the place for this action to happen. And if the devs do cave, I am outta here. WOW will be one unending disaster as it panders to anyone who can get 500 responces on a thread.<br />
<br />
Looking briefly over the thread they have no specific demands. Hopefully the smart warriors will start leaving the Blizzard board and coming here....</div></div><hr />

Then again, I don't play WoW ....  just throwing in my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think some of them really want to ruin anyones fun. all though i do think they want to bitch and moan. I play a warrior, went to the forums, saw the many of the post and decided I want to see how this works out. I will not go to any of the highly populated servers. It is irresponsible to intentionally or knowingly crash a server. However, it could be a really fun and interesting to have people do something like this if it doesn't end up hurting anyone else. Maybe its just me, but I think a horde of gnomes gathering together training is funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Becuase most other classes can solo two +2s and the like. We level slower and harder. Most other classes take can take even con elites (at least if the class is well played). I think all other classes have a way to escape a bad situation. <br />
<br />
I am not sure I could define it more precisely than that, but I can tell you, for example, that over half the warriors in my guild have switch classes and mains. Our talents are considered underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I'm sure it'll be an interesting sight to see.  I'm also sure its an exercise in futility.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is gonna take all the time they feel they need to address any class balance issues that need addressing, as they ought to be doing.  Congregating every warrior who feels slighted on one server in one spot will do nothing but cause that server horrible lag, annoy the players on that server, and probably get some folks banned for a while.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if Blizzard was stating they are leaving warriors excatly the way they are I would have a lil understanding.  Fact is, they have stated on numerous occasions that the warrior class is being reviewed by the dev team.  People want some kind of admission that the class is broken (even when clearly it is far from broken).<br />
<br />
Warriors are a touch underpowered if anything.  That makes them harder to play than other classes.  But this aint like the pre-Incite PoP days in EQ when warriors really could not accomplish anything.  In WoW they still have lots to do, even if its not the way the player thought they would be playing the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A protest against a protest? :P<br />
<br />
I have been following the blizzard forums to find out whats really wrong with warriors. Only some people have been able to describe the problem. Mainly, our abilities do not scale to level. Not one of them. You have to see how powerful ALL other classes become at very high level. You have to see their talents and how effective their abilities are then compare those to our own before you comment on this. Our abilities and talents just do not scale with level. Then your rage never goes above 100 wether you'r level 1 or 60, you have 100 rage max. While other classes utilize huge mana pools.<br />
<br />
It also includes some of our talents being not worth the talent points. Take Thunderclap for example. How much AE damage does it do and what is its use? It slows AE for 10% which will remain the same, and its damage at high levels is what 35? Whats the point of improving this Thunderclap damage through talents, seriously? Two handed weapon spec (arms) increase damage dealt by 2handers for 1%. More talents like these. Look how feeble is Revenge. Improved heroic strike, save 1 rage point. If you switch stances (which is like breathing in a pvp scenario), you lose all your rage unless you have TM that saves 25 rage. It severely hinders us, and what for? What purpose does it serve? Why nerf a class so much that always had the honor of being the weakest and most neglected in previous MMORPG's. Besides, it was clearly stated by Blizzard that a warrior will be &quot;a damage dealing powerhouse&quot;. They should deliver that. Seriously, whats the use of Mortal Strike now except a very costy debuff that you use against healers. <br />
<br />
These were some of the questions put forward on the blizzard forum. Miss rates at level 55+ or so. Maybe in instances facing much higher level creatures. Not much idea about that.<br />
<br />
The domestic problems these protests are facing are. (A) People haven't experienced the end game and start to differ with high enders foolishly. Ofcourse warriors are great in pvp at level 35, esp if you have heal potions. (B) EQ warriors are too used to playing a pathetic warrior, even this nerfed wow version makes em feel high and mighty so they start thinking there's nothing wrong. Hopefully the devs can see past this.<br />

Bliz said they're looking into it like a week or 2 ago.  Thats like a nanosecond at the speed of which stuff happens in MMO's.  The last thing we need is some rushed fix that serves no purpose other than to break us in the long run. *coughs*enraging blow*cough*<br />
<br />
Ability scaling, and ability damage/powers are really the problem with warriors.  If they uptuned that, and tweaked the miss rate a little we'd probably be golden.  The way we are makes us wimpy in PvE and PvP, but it hardly makes for the broken useless class that WoW board pretends we are.</div></div><hr />

Once you know this, it makes saving for that horse a lot fucking faster.<br />

You should see my trainer...there is a WHOLE lotta green there.<br />
<br />
3g so I can do 5 more damage with a cleave?  Hah.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, lets not drag Blizzard board garbage here.  It's unreasonable, every one of us knows it's unreasonable, there's no point in talking about it.  The people that post there are fucking idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree...95%. I only disagree with the word &quot;pretend.&quot; I think it is more like they &quot;preceive&quot; it to be a broken class. As a warrior at currently lvl 21, i do feel inferior to many other classes. I get a chubby when ever a Paladin decides to join my group. However, I do not think it is broken. The above suggestions seem reasonable. As mentioned earlier, though, Blizzard has a priority with the servers issues. I will not abandoned my warrior, and will level him with the faith that Blizzard will tweek the class appropriatly.<br />
<br />
I'm still going to check out the protest though. Oh my god, 20-30 or more gnomes training would be so funny. I think a well planned protest adds depth to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seb I suggest, strongly, that you stay way from the server. AD is a heavy population server with lag issues around the AH. And its an RP server. Tempers are going to be very short. Additionally there are already 2 other events planned  for the server (run by the server community).<br />
<br />
Tempers are going to be short, the queue to get on long and fun it will not be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SebastianDesoto</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, i do not plan to go to AD. There is an alternative server, bloodscalp. It is a PvP, low pop server. this was brought up by one of the original posters. There is actually a split in the protestors community. One want to gain attention by going to a populated server, the other just want to organize. I for one, respect the server fragility issue and will not participate in any thing that will bring headache to others. I think it should be the other way around. People shlould see an ingame protest and think, &quot;OMG, this game really does have a sense of community. thats cool.&quot; Out of players concerns, i have posted on multiple threads, multiple times on the main forums that people should NOT go to AD, but to Bloodscalp. If you can think of any reason this is a bad idea, other than calling it a stupid idea all together, please advise.<br />
<br />
By the way, my main objective is to see how this thing actually works out. It goes beyond the concerns of the warriors. Its about community. I will take screenshots if anyone is interested to see them. I won't know if it really is any good until it happens.</div></div><hr />
