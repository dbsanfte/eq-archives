<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some of the AA skills I really would rather see than some of the ones tey already have in beta:<br />
<br />
Increased Melee Stat Cap: Raise str, sta, agi, dex up to 355.<br />
<br />
Improved Dual Wield (aka Ferocity part 2):  More ranks to improve dual weild skill.  Ferocity was nice, but our DPS from offhand is still only 25-30% of our total damage at best.<br />
<br />
Offhand Damage Bonus: allow us to have a damage bonus with our offhand weapon.<br />
<br />
Improved Bash/Slam Damage: They've got it for kick, why not also for bash/slam?<br />
<br />
Double Bash w/Shield: ability to have a double bash when you have a shield equipped.  Skill should end up being as frequent as double attack is for regular weapons with all ranks maxed.  Give us more offensive damage when using a shield.  Also makes Furious Bash shields more useful.<br />
<br />
Anti-Riposte: Give us a skill that can actually help us avoid ripostes.  Not just strikethrough (tactical mastery), but also avoiding the return attack of a riposte.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give me a reason to Dual Weild again.<br />
Give me a reason to use the FB4 shield I carry around with me.<br />
<br />
Sturdiness and Weapon Affinity are great, we just need some more help like the stuff I listed above.</div></div><hr />

I might be wrong, but wasn't Ferocity the Double Attack increaser?  I thought Ambidexterity was the dual wield increaser.<br />
<br />
Improved Bash/Slam Damage: They've got it for kick, why not also for bash/slam?  Weird that you should mention this...Paladins get this AA.  Shadowknights don't, though.  Brenlo has made a post somewhere (okay, he was talking to Rangers) saying that the lists for AAs out there are incomplete, so Warriors might actually be getting more than what's been seen.<br />
<br />
Also, looking at the AA Shield Specialization that Warriors are slated to get:<br />
<br />
Shield Specialization<br />
This is a passive ability; it does not need to be actived.<br />
Requirements: Level: 65, No previous ability requirements.<br />
Ranks in this ability increase your chance to block with your shield.<br />
<br />
This looks interesting, I think they expect the &quot;block with shield equipped&quot; ability to be in game around the same time GoD is in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right you are, it is ambidexterity I was referring to.  It's been so long since I worked on those AA it's all starting to blur together now :)<br />
<br />
I just want AA and skills that are balanced so that we have several options that are viable choices for different situations.  Here's how I think the choices should be:<br />
<br />
Dual Weilding = Maximum Agro<br />
2h weapon = Maximum DPS<br />
1h + Shield = Maximum Defense<br />
<br />
Right now this isn't exactly the case, or at least the difference is not substantial enough.  For example, I have a Stormrider's Carapace which is 125hp 55ac (I think).  I also have a Blodied Berserker Blade 2hs augmented with Anger 3 that has 125hp and 40ac.  That is the best Furious Bash shield I have access to and one of the best 2h weapons I can get right now.  No matter what 1h weapon I pair up with the shield, it just cannot compare with the BBB.  I lose so much DPS that it really starts to affect agro in a negative way when I use the shield.  I may gain 100ish hp and 15-20ac by using the shield, but that is not enough of a difference IMO to afford losing that much agro and that much DPS.  <br />
<br />
So the shield sits in my bag unused.<br />
<br />
Also, I get eaten up with riposte damage when I dual weild, and in general my 1h weapons have little or no ac on them so I take more damage on each regular hit too.  I don't dual weild at all any more.<br />
<br />
I just want some skills or AA that make these various combos all equally useful in different situations.  I want to feel comfortable equipping the shield knowing that my defensive capability will be superior to any other choice.  If I need agro I want to be able to dual weild and not fear for my life for the extra damage I take and get 1-rounded by some mob that hits for 2k+/hit because of ripostes.</div></div><hr />

Shouldnt Dual Wield be a combo of Hi DPS and Hi Aggro V Lo Defense?<br />
2H Be med DPS and med Defense med aggro<br />
1h + Shield... V hi defense lo Dps lo aggro ?<br />
Where VHi = 3 and VLo=0<br />
<br />
That really doesnt help us... unless we can switch weapons and rely on taunt and incite(gawd forbid)<br />
<br />
I can see what youre looking for, and it makes sense... to me at least</div></div><hr />

<br />
To make shields actually be a viable option, it'd probably be better to make it ... very high defense (like noticably higher), very low DPS ... but very good, solid consistent aggro generation. That way a tank would actually WANT to equip a shield.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it will continue to be nothing other than a cute toy.</div></div><hr />
