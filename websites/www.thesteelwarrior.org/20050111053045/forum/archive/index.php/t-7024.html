Gates of Discord gets retuned!<br />
Greetings Norrath!<br />
 <br />
Gates of Discord is being tuned to rework many of the experience areas to better balance the expansion for all classes. It is our hope that this re-tuning will allow for more group diversity and better use of individual class skills while maintaining the challenge of the new content.  We hope to roll out these changes within the next 2 weeks. Here's a quick breakdown of what's changed -<br />
* Experience has been increased in several zones.<br />
* Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges.<br />
* NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank mobs they previously had difficulty with.<br />
* Spell drops have been increased.<br />
* Zone travel has been made easier.<br />
* NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<br />
* Animals in various zones across Gates have been made non-agro. <br />
 <br />
Note: Please keep in mind that these changes do not affect every zone. <br />
We would like to thank all of the folks on the Test Server who have been helping with the re-working of the encounters and we hope that you enjoy the changes when they go live in the very near future.<br />
 <br />
Thanks all!<br />

So, this fixes the somewhat legitimate problem knights had ATing and tanking exp content in GoD, but without any of the outrageous ideas for turning into warriors with extra spells. Should stop the complaints from the knights with brains anyway.</div></div><hr />

Actualy this fixes nothing.   These are not the zone in question.  I go to Ferubi all the time and tank there just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I read it, they didn't say which zones the mob changes were in...the mention of Ferubi was referring to the zone in general.  The next bullet point talked about mobs not hitting for max as often.  I can see how it's easy to read that the mob hitting only applies to those 4 zones, but it could also be read to apply to unspecified zones.  (either way, the statement is poorly worded :p )<br />
<br />
Maybe SoE will clarify the wording??</div></div><hr />

It's obvious, at least to me, that each bullet item is a self contained statement unrelated to the one above or below it.  So when saying experience has been increased in several zones, that's not necessarily referring to Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi.  Just as when saying that they've tuned those zones for the level range intended, that doesn't necessarily have any bearing on NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often.  Read each item on it's own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, for me, there is only one way to read that line.  Mob have lowered atk so AC has more effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It means they reduced their attack, it's definitely the best solution for everyone. It means everyone but knight and war get their tanking abilities increased significantly, but at the same time, it also means defensive is less effective on those mobs, therefore the difference between a warrior and a knight tanking is less than before. <br />
It also means it's still impossible for undergeared people to do these trials, with 1800 AC you'll probably still get slaughtered.<br />
<br />
That's the definitely the easiest and most efficient way to please everyone. Single group tanking, the 'gap' between warrior and knight is smaller while the other classes still can't tank these at all.</div></div><hr />
