anyways about how much hp/ac do you need to have to be a good/capable tank in RS? i buff to about 10.6khp / 1.6kac and have every single defensive / hp aa.. BoC and GbOS both with anger augs... Think i'll be ok?<br />
<br />
btw...<br />
i have all my faction armor quest items but i need to faction, does anyone have any tips for me in raising faction? very excited to get the armour as it's gonna boost my stats a shitload..<br />
<br />
thanks for ur help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you could prolly tank RS with that... however, if you get adds(it WILL happen in RS) you need a good chanter/bard that has their 73 mezz, I don't see you tanking 2-3 at a time.  If I were you I would prolly just stick to MPG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MPG is doable for you though, and once you get some oow faction armor you might be able to do RS. Since all the mobs give the same faction increase, go slaughter mobs in draniks scar for a while to raise faction.</div></div><hr />

I buff up to 11.2K and 1900AC with clr/druid buffs only.  I frequently 6box in Riftseekers and bet that you could tank there.  Would it be tough?  You betcha.  You'll be getting hit for 1200 a lot.  MAke sure you have all your defensive AAs done, I don't know that I'd venture in there if you're missing those.<br />
<br />
You'd be looking at having your cleric non-stop casting CH for the most part, but considering how short the fights are, that wouldn't be a biggie.  You'll get 5% an AA a kill at level 70 as well.  You will also find there are plenty of spots where you can single pull as I do that with my warrior always pulling.<br />
<br />
You will find almost all the mobs near the zonein area are singles.  There is a camp on the stairs up to Researcher/Summoner which is all singles, as well as the researcher/summoner camp (except for the researcher room, that's a double).  I'd say start with the zonein area as you can do short pulls and get a feel for the zone.<br />
<br />
However, as others have said above, doing Muramite Proving Grounds is more up your alley.  You'd do well there, but it isn't quite as challenging =)  Keep in mind all drops in Riftseeker's are slot8 (augs 7/8).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be rough and inefficient I would guess. With a back-up healer it would be doable, but I'm not sure it would be worth it. Plus, there are almost no mobs in the zone that give Dranik faction for your quests. Once you have your armor, I'd try going in there. AC is king in OoW from my experience so try to snag any AC you can and then head back when you buff at least 11k/1800.</div></div><hr />

Dunno about the faction issue, for the loots, they are not as uber as RS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a very good cleric and a backup healer, RS mobs will tear you a new one.  <br />
At that point you may be able to &quot;tank&quot; the mobs, if the 2 healers can out heal the intense ass raping that you're receiving.  However a group of players at the required level for this setup would most likely be able to obtain a tank that wasn't such a liability tbh.<br />
<br />
Given single pulls and the good healers above, you could live through the mobs theoretically, but there's little margin of error.  You might be able to kill 10-15 mobs, but eventually the numbers will catch up with you.  And CR's are a bitch in RS, gotta run through MPG naked. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would hold out until you pick up your oow gear.  It'll upgrade you more than the stuff that you would be likely to win in the same amount of time in RS.  As stated above, MPG exp is about the same as RS (unless you can handle fast pulls in RS)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haven't been lately, but still, I remember having to run from draniks to RS with invis potions only and get raped by a mob near those crosses in mpg on way to RS, it sucked.<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually just left a couple corpses in WoS/mpg with invis potions sitting on them (invis potion stations) when expansion came out.  Actually saved me once ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you get a port to WoS you risk getting seen. In WoS there is the Discordling Warfiend that sees invis (roams so can be avoided). In MPG there is the Blind Hunter that can be up that sees invis. Inside RS every mob has a chance to see invis now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not correct. Dependant on mob name.  Most stuff in RS do not see invis. CRs are usually quick, even from deep in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, only certain mob names can see invis. However,  a lot of the spawn points can spawn mobs of different types so you can run into see invis spawns all over the place. More often than not though, you can get to your corpse without running into them if you are careful.</div></div><hr />

Funny, because just a couple nights ago he killed our cleric and beastlord while attempting to run past him, they were both invised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know I have noticed this with a number of differnt mobs, you can run right on top of them at run5 and they dont agro as long as you get out of their range fast enough... stick around a sec and they will agro.<br />
<br />
Maybe they work on ticks and if you get in there range right after a tick (second one) and get out of there range by second 5 before the next tic they dont agro.... <br />
<br />
<br />
Im like 10.1KHP and 1600ish AC with conviction and BP buff (9 out of the 10 defesive AA done - is that what you mean by All defensive AA, those 2 OOW ones that need 50 AA to finish or is there more)<br />
<br />
You can tank but law of averages will sooner or later catch up with you, I can 6 box RS also but at some points you will hit a spike and die. My big edge though is that the fights go under 40 seconds as 3 wizards is serious dps. But ya you can take in RS, the question is do you want to play where you have to pay attention every second and the smallest error is death or to you want to have a bit of leway so that small one second errors are not automatic death.... <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes you can run from the WoS port into RS with no see invisible mobs. Iv done it many times....</div></div><hr />

We wipe every 2 hours due to an add or cleric healing 1 second too late, its that close. RS will never be a sit back and relax zone, but the loot and xp is worth it. Check out the augs I have so far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do RS, but I would advise getting level 70 and getting the OOW AAs maxed first.<br />
<br />
Also, having Vie and DI on you at all times would be a good idea, so make sure your cleric has emeralds.<br />
<br />
The spikes will hurt, but it WILL be doable.   And if you do go, I strongly suggest getting a Riftseeker group.  Spend a night there and you'll have four 25ac augs, improving your AC a whopping 160 (although at the cost of your bracer/bp/leg augs, so potentially losing 80hp).  <br />
<br />
After that, next on the list would be camping the summoner for his 70hp ear/finger augs, but you'll be there a while as everybody and their mother will want one, and the camp is frequently taken (to casters, the RS camp is really only good for exp when summoner and stairs are taken -- most frequent drops are a 25ac aug and a 140hp bow, I think)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Heh, it's not quite that easy to pick up the augs. People kept making it sound like Riftseeker spawns over and over and the augs are free. It took me at least 4 hours before a single augment dropped. He is streaky since he can spawn in 3 spots. Sometimes he'll pops more than once in a round, and sometimes he hides forever. Getting the augs isn't that rough, but I wouldn't plan on getting all 4 in your first night, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed.<br />
<br />
As far damage spikes, a shaman is really good to have in your group here if you are underequipped. Betweem HoT, fast slow, and decent patching they can really make up the difference for lack of gear and you don't have to either pray that the complete heal is gonna land, or sit around medding because the cleric has to spam pious light and blow through their mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morf</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TBH, I prefer enc for mezzing adds (need to have oow mez) and druid backup healer.

I'm struggling with 1950AC and sometimes they still spam me to death before slow landed.  you will NEED a patch healer on inc cuz they can dish out some serious dps before slow lands and sometimes your clr just cant heal fast enough.   your HP is fine, just need to bump  your AC up before you look into RS.</div></div><hr />

just use a solid 2 hander and you can do fire area jsut fine. im still getting some logs to parse, but it seemed to me mobs riposted allot more after slow. i used my shitty Ornate greateblade + ferocity and i lost agro to the BL (our slower) maybe 1 in 8 times and never for very long.</div></div><hr />

The mobs in Riftseekers will have sudden bursts of dps out of nowhere. Some will have a 1500 AE DD as well. This is coming from a cleric point of view (seeing as my cleric is my main, and warr is secondary), Unless you have 11k hp and 2100 AC or so, it will be hurtful on the clerics mana, and cause alot of downtime.<br />

Your going to find it very hard to tank there and exp there unless your chanter can mezz mobs...Even agro will you will have some troubles too, but if your skilled and know whats going on it can be done go to the queen room, just take the flight of stairs all the way up tell ya come to a statue its a good safe camp there most of the time if you fight close to the statue, But your going to have your work cut out of you ~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cleric/chanter/sk of similiar gear might be kind of tough.Have to play safe with spawns while killing slow.If the chanter can mez and healer has your aa it might go ok.Better with a patch healer and dps prolly.My wife(shammy) has solo healed me in the room slammer mentioned while clerics have been on breaks and stuff so maybe it wouldn't be so bad.We did have dps tho.O if you root them the casters like to gate hehe.<br />

wasnt  bad at all, id use stonewall on the named just so wed be able to keep killing without medding. their hit range was huge and they rarely like for over 1k, and with 2hander i cut down on ripos allot. it was cake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that low of stats I couldn't imagine tanking in RS. My stats are not the greatest but they are above average and I had a REAL hard time until I went and maxed out Slippery Attack. The riposte on RS mobs is just sick esspecially after they are slowed. <br />
 Granted, after I found out how sick the aaxp is in RS I now live there when not raiding. On the other hand, if your AC is below 2k, I wouldn't recomend RS. MPG is very nice xp and is a hell of alot easier IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Max with your HP, AC, and AA's I really don't see how you could of tanked in RS and call it &quot;cake&quot;.  You probably had an Anguish geared cleric, otherwise they were huffing and puffing to keep up on mana.  <br />
<br />
Not trying to knock ya or anything, but with AC well below 2k, HP barely breaking 10k, and  not even finished defensive AAs, RS is a bit out of your league. Hell even MPG would be trying.  There are warriors with almost mirror'd gear and more AA's having a tough time in MPG.  So unless you know some secret the rest of us have missed, I am just not seeing it.</div></div><hr />

lvl 70, buff to 12k, 2k ac, have epic and a few MPG stuff and my OoW armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximiusm</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max with your HP, AC, and AA's I really don't see how you could of tanked in RS and call it &quot;cake&quot;.  You probably had an Anguish geared cleric, otherwise they were huffing and puffing to keep up on mana.  <br />
<br />
Not trying to knock ya or anything, but with AC well below 2k, HP barely breaking 10k, and  not even finished defensive AAs, RS is a bit out of your league. Hell even MPG would be trying.  There are warriors with almost mirror'd gear and more AA's having a tough time in MPG.  So unless you know some secret the rest of us have missed, I am just not seeing it.<br />
<br />
we had a good slower and the cleric was very good, but only ep geared. just cast a hot on me before we engaged, and once the mob was slowed i never got below 40% hp or so. i did have my necro parked there to feed him, but we would clear statue room and head down to riftseekers room and he would be fine on mana clering that whole room +/- named.<br />
<br />
the biggest thing i noticed in rift was mob possitioning... adds are death even if you had a very well geared group. i was sitting at statue LFG and there was a time/god gear warrior tanking with a cleric and shaman in his group... he kept pushing mobs wihtin agro range of the roamer the comes to the top of the stairs and wiping everyone there heh.<br />
<br />
i do have to agree with you tho, i thought RS was gona eat me alive but im really not seeing that big a difference over being in MPG a few lvls back. i think the fact that everyone there is 70 and my skillcaps are higher is the biggest thing.<br />
<br />
that and the 1 time i did die was when another groups tank dropped while i was LFG and i tanked their mob... with 1handers... i was mostly unbuffed but i got chewed up. 2hander are the big in that zone.<br />
<br />
**edit** the 2 hander i was using is not in my magelo, its that crap taunting blow wep from Solro, obsidian greatblade or some crap. was holding better agro than my GSo4W. also forgot to mention ive been back 2 more times now and had no problems tanking even without my necro there to twich /shrug.<br />
<br />
guildie brought up a point that it might be zone might be coded to take into account the stats of the players, aka, the reason i was getting so many hits in the 500 - 800 range was cause it recognised my stats, thus makign ti difficult but not impossible.<br />
<br />
was an interesting thought, but i dont think SOE has that kind of creativatey</div></div><hr />

It isnt easy, but if your cleric can keep you up doing a double, then he should be fine mana wise on pulled singles.<br />

Only real trouble we have so far is not knowing the camps and getting adds without the proper mez spells yet.<br />

By saying that you mean with 8.3khp and 1.8kac you tanked 2 mobs in RS?<br />
If you mean that I bet your cleric was OOM by the end of the fight for sure, I buff up to 13.5khp and like 2.3kac, when we get 2 mobs on camp and we dont have another class to tank nor mezzer I have to burn my disc and I really need a lot of heals.<br />

<br />
Tho I meant  8.3 / 1.8 unbuffed<br />
<br />
And ya, I tend to drop stonewall when that happens... not sure why I wouldnt.<br />
<br />
My groups cleric is only 7k ish mana, but max FT ... we dont have much problem with OOM and our DPS sucks.<br />
<br />
Was a druid with us also.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Sometimes I need PL's pumped into me and that hurts mana pretty bad, but in these cases when you actually have 2 to tank and you are just trying to recover from a bad pull... being low on mana at the end does not make us all start crying and running back to MPG.<br />
<br />
In any event, when we have our mez spells I know for certain with my HP/AC we will have no real issues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me and my mate pulled it off! :)<br />
Well the Riftseeker/Balancer camp anyway.<br />
<br />
Capped flowing thought on the casters, max AA, and the chanters 3 minute AA mez seemed to make it... Somewhat easy. We could only keep 5 down before repops due to lack of DPS and we wiped about 3 times due to pure pulling stupidity on my part, a see invis mob we didnt know was a see invis mob, and a damage spike.<br />
<br />
If you are under geared or under AAed, have a lot of time on your hands, and REALLY want the 25AC augs.<br />
<br />
I recommend using Stonewall disc and pulling the mob between Balancer PH and Dragorn PH. Pretty easy to single pull and the Riftseeker pops there occasionaly.<br />
<br />
Doesnt seem to pop on the Balancer or Dragorn spot at all.<br />
(Least not in our 4 hour session)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Blackmoonx is correct :) Keep your first two buffs clickies like grim aura or charm bangle. Before pulling Riftseeker, unclick them. Have chanter dispell if you get charmed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackmoonx</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your biggest threat are the named that charm, Riftseeker and Researcher. x4 them immediately. You will want an OT in the group for when your MT gets charmed and maybe a secondary healer too. This will also take care of any adds you might get if you are unable to mez.<br />
<br />
Ice side is a completely different story. You get tons of wandering adds everywhere and there are not too many safe spots past the first stairway. Also the mobs use ice base stun spells so keep your CR up and maybe have an OT. Some of them AE it too so watch mob position.<br />

<br />
We camped the place two days in a row and killed Riftseeker with few problems.<br />
Mob would normally melee and charm maybe two or three times a fight.<br />
<br />
Then yesterday Riftseeker pops, I click off my first buff like normal, get charmed, get dispelled... Then watch as Riftseeker charmed the rest of my group.<br />
Thinking it a fluke, we CRed and tried again.<br />
Again mob goes completly charm crazy.<br />
<br />
Third time we try chanter's AA mez to debuff the mob before engaging, resists and again charms three people.<br />
<br />
Were we extreamely unlucky on that particular Riftseeker? <br />
<br />
Or extreamely lucky on the first six?</div></div><hr />

we had that happen once.. at one point the whole group was charmed but somehow the clerics faded first, he blew DA, i dropped next and used furious, then  everyone else seemed to drop atthe same time. riftseeker was at 25% so once the wizard was uncharmed it was game over in 15 seconds heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seraz</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i started going to RS a lot now... and have been there quite often and won 2 hp augs... really i dont quite get what the hype is about how hard RS is.... it wasn't that much harder than MPG except the mobs run super fast and have insane aggro range..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it wasn't that much harder than MPG except the mobs run super fast and have insane aggro range..<br />
<br />
They hit a HELLA lot harder than in MPG :)<br />
<br />
You can compare most RS mobs to the Lightning dudes in MPG.<br />
Its very doable, but its even more unforgiving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The charm in RSS is very random and without rhyme or reason.  I try to exp there every day to finish off my ac aug farming and I'll be damned if I never can predict how a riftseeker is going to act on any given pop.  Sometimes they'll just attack and summon a pet.  Sometimes they'll summon a pet and charm.  Sometimes they'll charm like crazy and sometimes they appear to not do anything but die. <br />
<br />
I have a personal theory that when the named in RSS spawn they are assigned random skills (pet summon, charm or mez/stun in the case of the cold side).  I think they might get up to 2 skills that happen to be on seperate timers.  So sometimes you'll get a summoner that summons a pet on pull then charms.  <br />
<br />
Its also possible that its entirely based on RNG and my crazy crack pot theories are just that.</div></div><hr />
