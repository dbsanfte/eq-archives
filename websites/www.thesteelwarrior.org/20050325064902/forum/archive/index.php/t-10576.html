Can we do if off  the shield block ability? Or only with natural shield blocks? Testing and logging as I type, but just not seeing any full blocks.</div></div><hr />

Yep, it looks like this in the CombatLog:<br />
<br />
1/31 19:44:15.828  Slavering Ghoul attacks. You block.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure it happens on either type of block.<br />
<br />
In that log I parsed in the other thread, I got  73 of those messages in about an hour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did loose my default combat window--so there is a posibilty I am not seeing the message (and I can't find the restore defautls).<br />
<br />
Can you only fully block attacks that are lower than your shield block + strength?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats what seems to be the case for me.  Of course, I have no logs to back this up,  it's just casual observation.</div></div><hr />

All in a range though. So every time you see a hit on you for tiny damage, (I see the occaisional 3 hit, or 1 damage) you just blocked. I also get the occaisional full block, with the block message appearing in my char photo just like dodge and parry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe what was throwing me is that the full blocks can only occure when you are getting hit for what you can block or less. Since since I was playing around with 0 to +2s I was seeing no full blocks (of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I logged about 4 hours of fighting against mobs from 0 to 3 levels lower than I was last night.  There were MANY less full blocks, but I still did see 29 out of the 437 blocks I had during that time.   This leads me to believe that Full Blocks ARE linked to the block value on the shield.<br />
<br />
I posted a table in the other thread if you're interested in the numbers I got.</div></div><hr />
