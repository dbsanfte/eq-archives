<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so, lets make it offical weather this is the shittyest expantion or what.<br />
<br />
post your bitch, post your asskissing whatever<br />
<br />
my personal bitch as follows.<br />
<br />
There is only 3 zones i can use so far, there is no ramping up, just a brick wall, fuck GoD, there is no progression for someone who groups with whoever is on at the time.<br />
<br />
worst fucking 25$ i even spent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">personally i love it. doing expeditions has been fun. havent died so many times on a crawl before. i love the challenge and the CRs dont bother me. havent died once ona CR run before, but i have died a few times to the expedition NPC... but i find that amusing.<br />
<br />
so far only got up to tipt, but i like that it really keeps everyone on the ball and it doesnt take much of a mistake to wipe the group. <br />
<br />
<br />
whilst i do feel sorry for the pallys and sks being pushed to a secondary role, i must admit its also nice to be back in demand again.<br />
<br />
there are a couple of things i wish could be changed though.<br />
<br />
trials can take a bit too long, especially with a wipe. i know theres some who can burn through them but 2-3 hours seems average and not unknown to go past that.<br />
<br />
i actuall dumped some tribute points yesterday and it was costing me abotu 250 pp for hp ac buffs. thats not a problem for me to afford for trials and stuff, but it is on the high side imo and simply out of reach for a lot of people. i think the cost should at least be halved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't like it. And here's why:<br />
<br />
- The weight on items annoys me as a monk. And packrat? /sigh ... waste of points but being forced on me if I actually want to start equipping a bunch of the gates crap.<br />
<br />
- The cost of AAs annoy me.<br />
<br />
- Waiting for a boat annoys me.<br />
<br />
- Having to go through trials all over again gets on my nerves.<br />
<br />
- The storyline is cheesy at best, and horrendously bad the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
- They nerfed the tribute system. And I'm not talking about the bait nonsense. That NEEDED to be fixed. But at this point, I just can't justify paying the amount of plat it costs to maintain 150 hit points or V-10 or whatever. They swung the axe too hard, making it not even worth my time to use. Which sucks cause I liked the idea. It could have been great for getting items out of the economy.<br />
<br />
- Tradeskill UI messes up quest combines. That's annoying.<br />
<br />
- They broke my Melee Fix, TWICE now. Imagine how pissed you'd feel if incite were broken, TWICE, after it debuted.<br />
<br />
- Much content is still bugged. Which sucks, cause I already think this was rushed out the door.<br />
<br />
- Customer Service is at an all-time low and with buggy content, that is a recipe for disaster.<br />
<br />
- Each new twist and turn and tidbit about this expansion that gets revealed has done nothing but annoy me. There's no &quot;wow, I need that&quot; or &quot;wow, I'd love to see that.&quot; Every other expansion has provided that.<br />
<br />
Are any of these reasons I list all that important? No. <br />
I'm glad a lot of people like this expansion. I, however, feel like it was a waste of my money. Which is saying something, since I've been excited about every other expansion to date. I guess you can't please all of the customers, or whatever. And Gates is simply an expansion I don't like much at all. No big deal. I'll survive. As will you. Sorry if you read through this post this far. There's no hidden truth. I'd refund you your time in tribute points, but at this rate you'd only get about 2 tribute. hahahahaah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only 3 zones Gerick?<br />
<br />
Theres the boat zone, then Natimbi, then Quinini (sp?), then Barindu or you could go to ferubi or Riwwi from there aswell.<br />
<br />
Thats 6 zones.  From Barindu you can also go to the instanced expedition zones.<br />
<br />
When PoP came out you had access to PoK, PoTranq, PoI, PoN, PoD and PoJ.  Also 6 zones, and no instanced zones so on day one you had more content available to you in GoD than PoP, and the expedition zones are much more forgiving that PoJ trials were when PoP opened up.<br />
<br />
Also the loot attainable by a single group at this stage of the expansion is far superior to what you could get in any of the free access zones at PoP's release.  Check out that thread of Wandor's in the Battlefield to look at the loot a single group of 65s can get, theres some nice stuff in there, some nice augs are dropping in the expedition from Barindu too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Also 6 zones, and no instanced zones&quot;<br />
<br />
How soon we forget ... PoP offered the very first instanced zone in EQ back then. And anyone could access it. PoN ... Hedge Maze!<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">announcing the level range for GoD would be 50-65 to get more sold copies was pretty &quot;evil&quot; of SOE.<br />
They should have stated its a 65 raid expansion with only very few casual zones, this expansion is 10 times more hardcore than Velious was.<br />
And before any monkeys here rush in and claim this to be &quot;smart marketing&quot;, there are plenty of first world countries where delibaretly misinforming your customers in order to sell stuff can get you into trouble in front of a court, so just because your country lacks Consumer protection it doesnt make lieing  &quot;smart marketing&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats 6 zones. From Barindu you can also go to the instanced expedition zones. <br />
<br />
a quick look at Gericks most casual gear tells me he is better off not entering any of those by you suggested zones.<br />
I'm pretty sure plenty ppl like him got scammed with GoD.<br />
<br />
<br />
But its definatly not the shittiest expansion.. Luclin wont ever be de-throned there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally love it so far.  Learning the Sewers expeditions was a bit ass, since they didn't really explain what was supposed to happen at all, and instead left you slaughtering everything hoping you do it right (mainly pools, seriously, the text the npc gave you for that was shit, and didn't explain anything).  But it's not so bad once you know how to do it.  My second issue would be with Vxed.  I enjoy the zone itself (and thank god for having no more green after sewers).  It's just the length of time it takes to slaughter the number of required mobs.  Considering we cleared up the middle to the top, went right to below the end room, back down across the bridge, and still had more to kill, it just takes too damned long.  Tipt is fun though, the suprises were interesting.  The fact that a lot of it can be gimped through is annoying, but when you do it as it is supposed be done, I enjoy it.<br />
<br />
I agree they should have said it was for people lvl 65.  Though I also think it is a lot like PoP.  It has a PoK type zone (many quests, tradeskill stuff), except it doesn't have easy access.  And it has some minor zones for lower level people, but not much.  It is definately not the shittiest expansion.  It is quite enjoyable if you are skilled with single group stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just a tip but for vxed u dont have to crawl. just camp at the ZI and pull from all 3 intersectinos. 3-4 mobs from each side and that should get them in time for 15 mini repop. once u hit 70 mobs (count by aaxp 2pct per mob), then move up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GoD makes me happy. Makes everquest hard again. I dread dying in Trials and stuff. I like having to run all over the place, and be careful.<br />
<br />
Thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i agree with tron about the leve range, the 3 zones i refer to are AS, natimbi and Quinini i cant find anyone that dares to venture further.... pussys, they are waiting for SoE to make it easy like they did in PoP, but it isnt gona happen<br />
<br />
my gear has changed but im still under 5k hp, im still under 100 AAs, so im still casual imh.<br />
<br />
luclin... nexus was a neat idea, poorly done(i think the books wouldnt have hurt the druids and wizzys if they had a larger timer) the raiding content was shit but the vah shir were an interesting change in playable races, sorta like the iksar's where except luclin had &quot;nicer&quot; newbie zones, beastlords where a interesting idea, to bad it was a hybrid instead of its own being, its all about the shity implementation, sad to say but there hasnt been a long honey moon period with this expantion as there has been in the past</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You haven't seen anything yet.  It doesn't get any better.  If you can't handle the introductory zones then stop now because you are only going to be throwing corpses into a pit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have to say that I'm generally unhappy so far with it.  Not saying the expansion doesn't fill a needed niche for the higher level player, but for anyone less than that it all adds up to a waste of time for me.  <br />
<br />
I've explored about 4 of the zones so far, was able to reasonably tank most of the trash mobs.  For the risk vs reward though killing the trash there doesn't seem quite worth it to me.  I found the cash loot/sellables and exp to be nothing special.  I expected that seeing as GoD is kind of a raid oriented expansion.  If I thought I even had a prayer of completing any of the trials I might think better of this expansion, but I don't and I know it.  And I'm not terribly wild about camping crappy exp from mobs that kick the crap out of someone of my gear for the chance at a *random* drop from them.  My time would be much better served getting decent exp in BoT and hoping for the possibility of ornate drops.  <br />
<br />
As for Sony saying this was good for lvl 50-65, I think thats kind of a load of crap.  Sure, a group of lvl 50s might be able to hunt in Natimbi but for all the above reasons its really just not worth the effort for them.  Sony knew they had to put out higher content to keep the higher level players interested, but also new they had to sucker in the more casual players somehow, seems that they were successful.  I personally don't believe I will be going back to GoD anytime in the near future, and I'm kind of upset I wasted the money on it at this time.  I'm sure everyone who does have the gear to handle this expansion is having a great time though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">they basically wanted to downsize the PoP, server cache, more or less bot, so what did they do? make a place for everyone above that to go to since the higher zones have been deserted latly its stopped some bottemfeeding, but at least i could have a chance in pop, every 3 levels from 53 on i could move to a new zone, to me, this new one looks like its all about having a bigger penis than the next guy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like GoD so far.  The ramped up challenge is nice.  I don't find it too hard to run to an LDoN camp, port to Nedaria's Landing and then port to Natimbi.  I keep 5-6 invis potions handy, but then again I usually did.<br />
<br />
I just got through sewer #4  today and I'll be heading to vxed/tipt soon to try it out.  I enjoy the challenge and so do my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For the casual player GoD can be tough yes.  Jumping off a cliff for 20K is a good substitute for the harder GoD zones: same result, but less pain.<br />
<br />
That said, the sewer expeditions can be easily farmed for some pretty respectable gear.  We must have got 20 sets of Pitted Vambraces from the lair level while farming spells in just 3 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoN maze wasnt instanced really it was just 3 maze's in one zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">as i said in another post, if you are not geared enought to go past natimbi, go away from GoD, period.<br />
<br />
i agree that say this was a lv50+ expansion was a Bush's level lie (i think nothing can stop SoE from steal our money) but this was intended to be THE hardcore expansion, much more than PoP has never been.<br />
<br />
GoD is all i wanted from an expansion, new hardcore shit to kill that put previous mobs to shame, a not-so-bad storyline, cool zones and nice loot to feed my magelo ego :D<br />
<br />
i hope the next expansion will have a huge red-shining &quot;lv65+300aa only&quot; sign on it when/if we will enter the realm of discord to fight any badass mobs in it<br />
<br />
do you remember the very old days when you was lv 5 and priest of discord was shouting every 2 mins about the absolute power of discord ? seeing GoD mobs im starting believe it (yes, im a maniac of storylines ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My #1 complaint about about GoD is the number of people that complain about without actually doing it.<br />

That and the tribute system...which was nerfed a bit too hard<br />
<br />
And the casino, and the performance issues of the servers.<br />
<br />
But I really like the challenge...last night someone had trained a red rare to the zone...1k 1k 3k heh and I still squirmed away to live another day...go l33t fleeing skills!</div></div><hr />

I'm not hardcore, I got a tonne of upgrading to do.  (Which goes slowly, as my guild matches my gear fairly well, and we have trouble with getting numbers for events, but that's a different story altogether :P).  There are a few zones of GoD I've seen, and I've enjoyed them - I like the feel, the design, the new models, and the atmosphere.  I wish that I could see more, and I probly will at some point.<br />
<br />
I think they nailed it, with GoD.  We were long due for an expansion geared towards the high end audience, and by all accounts they're happy.  And there are opportunities for the mid-game crowd (just as there were 60+ opportunities in LoY), if we seek them.  The only dissappointment I've had with the GoD expansion so far is the way they chose to implement Leadership XP.  And that mebbe the new AA don't look like a whole lot of true class improvements for me - but at that, most of the old ones didn't either.</div></div><hr />

Hehe ... well if I didn't prefer em, I wouldn't use em.  I find em a lot more readable, better for overview, and so I switched when they folded the LUCY item collector in for profile updating. (And premium alla membership gives me more bang for the buck than magelo.)  My magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=447288) is largely up to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ok, what info does all sheet give that magelo doesnt?<br />
<br />
Also, what does Allakhazam premium give ? I've seen advanced item search for free on other sites already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">arf arf<br />
<br />
Same info, different presentation.  Alla gives me advanced searches, no ads on alla (and so, faster page loading), and auto-update of my profile.  Mebbe LUCY tweaks too, I switched about then, and wouldn't know.  Assume no benefits from LUCY.<br />
<br />
Magelo membership gives me auto-update of my profile.<br />
<br />
*Magelo is also cheaper than Allakhazam.  Money is snug, or we'd have both.<br />
<br />
Neither sheet gives more info than the other, so far as I've determined. *The main thing about tha alla search which I like is that it can do a weighted search that is connected to my character profile - if I am seeking better AC on my arms, I can search for that, and if HP is important to me I can add that.  I can invert the prioirity, if I want to.  Stuff like that works for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've never seen an advanced item search on another site on par with the Alla search - but I haven't spent much time looking.<br />
<br />

<br />
:-)  <br />
<br />
Are you reeeetaaardded...<br />
PoN doesn't have instance zones of anything.<br />
If you look at the maps that are avalible for the zone you will see that the maze and other thing is basicly setup in 3 areas each.<br />
There is no instancing.. IE YOU DON&quot;T NOT ZONE...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Instancing is technically a LDoN engine thing, which is post POP.  Things like the Nightmare Maze worked surprisingly well with the setup they had.  It had bugs but it was better than what they did for Justice.<br />
<br />
Of course it is my opinion but some of the trials are too long.  I could be farming the sewer trials but that is multiple hours burned getting nowhere.  For a casual player that isn't so bad.  Its one solid night of work.  For others who are advancing there is no time to stop and goof off.  I have had no great desire to hang around the Plane of Disease but I bet I've gone into it a million times more than the Purifying Plant.<br />
<br />
To each their own.  I put little value into the work going into these six player trials.  Having some call it them &quot;six player raids&quot; shows just how desperate some of them are for an idiotic challenge.  Beating hard hitting monsters is not a challenge but in the end it is what ever keeps you interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&quot;Are you reeeetaaardded...&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm going to edit this, removing the flames. I'm tired of being flamed, and very tired of flaming back.<br />
<br />
It's really very simple. PoN hedge maze, plane of torment keeper of sorrows and the stomach thing ... these were all EARLY attempts by the EQ designers at toying with instanced content.<br />
<br />
It obviously differs from what eventually became LDoN. However, it is the groundwork. PoN hedge maze is not something you just walk up to in the zone (like it's another part of the zone). It's also not something you click into (like in Vex Thal). It's a quest you initiate. Once initiated, it takes you elsewhere. And it is indeed the very first basic attempt at &quot;instanced content.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feel free to call me a retard or whatever. You're only making yourself look retarded for not being able to grasp the finer details of the game as it moves from expansion to expansion.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the grandmaster glox trials for the monk shackle of tynnomium is also another example of the early attempts at instanced content. Of course, I'm sure you'd want to call me retarded for stating that too, eh?</div></div><hr />

I think people are getting confused with the trials.  There is a thread in the Overlords Sanctuary discussing some of the end trials (Ikkinz/Tipt) as being 6 person raids as thier purpose is to open up raid content.  <br />
<br />
The sewer expeditions on the other hand are like an LDoN run but without the timer (for the most part).  Calling them 6 person raids is just taking your &quot;EQ is too hard&quot; mentality too far Aeka.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Worst thing about GoD - bugs.<br />
<br />
Guild groups getting all sorts of weird bugs like being dumped into trial 4 with noone in group having done trial 3 ( then finding it's impossible because you can't hand the item to the guy because you don't have it ) or not having the npc spawn in the furnaces, or not having the stonemites spawn in the purifying plant etc etc.<br />
<br />
Best thing about GoD ( in theory ) - less crowding.<br />
<br />
Of course the reality of this is that bottom feeding gimps are not going to do GoD because it's too hard, so they will continue to bottomfeed, the well focused uber guilds that switch entirely to GoD other than their weekly time clearing weren't causing crowding to start with.</div></div><hr />

The Sentinel of the Altar can eat a dick.  Several in fact, and then several more.  That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well, I'll be devil's advocate and say GoD is too nice for casual players.<br />
<br />
There is some elemental quality gear farmable by one group - might not be easy to get but its easier than joining a 100 member guild and waiting in line for loot.</div></div><hr />

We raiding GoD now, and its some insane fun, especially the loot is just excellent, I already couldnt hold back and bought 2 items :-/</div></div><hr />

<br />
GoD pre Ikkinz trials is pretty awesome really, but it goes downhill fast when you reach them.<br />
<br />
You going to play WoW Kildace?<br />
<br />
To be honest I doubt I'll spend much time on a computer game again after these 4 years, I'm enjoying Real Life right now, but I'll prolly be on WoW yes, as a casual nobody ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I think you missed something.<br />
We are raiding Ikkinz, Chambers of Righteousnesses, Transcendence etc .</div></div><hr />

If you are actively doing the flag quests, camping the piece of shit ground spawns, doing trials for your whole guild, farming these raids and attempting Uqua, and really do think that GoD is fun well .. I envy your optimism :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Yeah, that's what we did 2 nights ago, Forgotten Martyr camping. It's very nice for a change, and alot better than 0 exp VT / Emp keying.<br />
<br />
Maybe I enjoy not doing everything with a 50+ raidforce<br />
isn't Askeer in your guild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">isn't Askeer in your guild?<br />
<br />
He's my former guildleader ;)<br />
<br />
And yeah, not gonna debate it, some people like GoD, some don't, I don't :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">GoD has turned very quickly into a crock of shite. <br />
<br />
We completed the elementals and entered PoTime in May last year. We proceded to farm PoTime as our main raid.<br />
<br />
LDoN came out. We did the raids there, collected the rotting augs and class specific stuff from limited raids. We continued to farm PoTime as our main raid.<br />
<br />
GoD came out. We did the raids there once the bugged crap got fixed. We continued to farm PoTime as our main raid.<br />
<br />
Noticing a theme here....<br />
<br />
NEARLY A YEAR OF FARMING FUCKING PoTIME AND *STILL* NOTHING BETTER OUT THERE TO DO <br />
<br />
But wait! There are raids in GoD!<br />
<br />
Once the untested beta bug crap was fixed, it became apparent there's absolutely no challenging content in GoD. You go from the obscene triviality for a PoTime equipped guild doing trial1/2/3/4/Yttxt, into the stupidly tuned Uqua. I'm not talking 'really tough content' here either, I love a decent challenge. I'm talking about stupidly hard, impossible to beat content. <br />
<br />
Taking a group of L1 gnomes into Crushbone to kill Emp Crush may be fun the first time. Uqua is a case of taking those same L1 gnomes to Everfrost and trying to kill Vox. After the 20th hour of trying, people are gonna wise up and say 'Fuck it, this ain't happening'.<br />
<br />
Grats SoE - You're driving into the ground the most active high level player base. The most dedicated EQers, those who lead the high level raid forces, are quitting in droves, or at the very least seriously considering it for the first time in 5 years.</div></div><hr />

People used to say that about the Statue in Kael...then someone drowned him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2: There's no equipment left in preceding content to upgrade the raid force to such a degree we can come back in a month after gearing up and do any better. The AA advancement options won't turn the content around either. <br />
<br />
3: The Clue Fairy has left a message under your pillow. It says 'Hi there. SoE has already downgraded the majority of mobs at the beginning of Uqua. If it was balanced for difficulty, why would they do that after only a week or two of player effort?'<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining about 'hard', but when a guild that wipes on P3 PoTime regularly can reach the same point in the following expansion as one who's been past that for almost a year, there's something fundamentally wrong in the progression.<br />
<br />
If Uqua gets beaten in it's current state I'll eat my chunk of humble pie with pleasure.<br />
<br />
The general theme of post-Kod content however has been very much: Let the players get so far, hit an impossible cockblock, retune those few mobs, let them move 3 feet into the next one.</div></div><hr />

Vulak &gt; Ssra farming? Because then this is the same! People say it everytime, they just try and twist it a bit so it sounds different.</div></div><hr />

Was that for me? How many times did Emp, Seru and cursed changed?! I guess that's the same then, and who's the clue lacking then?</div></div><hr />
