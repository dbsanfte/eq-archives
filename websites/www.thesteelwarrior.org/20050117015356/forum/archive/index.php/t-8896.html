Anyone agree that this focus effect is completely useless and horse sh*t? What is the benefit of shortening the time on incite when it doesnt stack with itself and u can already use it again before it wears off??  :mad:  Anyone have a reason why this focus effect would be useful? plz post!</div></div><hr />

A lot.  Esp on a ugly pull.  Hopefull the mezzers live but in a pinch a warrior can keep multiple slowed mobs on them with np (esp under defensive).<br />
<br />
Yea not the greatest focus but not worthless either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So while u dont get any benefit from the the dot part of incite, you do get the extra 400 initial hate. while this doesnt really help me and i now think its just useless for me  :D , i can see where this would be beneficial to someone who has trouble with holding agro, from lower quality weps, no anger augs, etc..<br />

good thing the epic is available in version 1.5 for those people that actually need the focus  :cool:</div></div><hr />

I guess im spoiled to a certain degree, im at the lvl of the game where i dont have to put up with idiots for my AA exping or farming needs most of the time (although ive noticed alot of newbs have started to make it into PoE on my server, Fennin Ro, lately  :D ) i guess what im trying to say is i can count on one hand the number of times ive tried to tank two mobs at once. I usually have a competent chanter or bard or someone to offtank so if my puller gets a bad pull (sooo fired!  :D ) i dont really worry about it :)</div></div><hr />

I find its rather useless, maybe if the focus was improving some discs, that'd be cool, ei higher mitigation on stone/defe,m ore evasion on evasive</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, no way to predict what effect lvl 70 spells will have on agro handling, but the extra 400 hate every 20 min (assuming the dot just overides itself and stays constant) wouldnt make very much differece, especially since my anger3 aug in my epic will go off every other round with WA5 and get alot more hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/AGREE 100%<br />
<br />
this focus would be so much better if it lowered the reuse time of all discs not just incite, or increased the benefit of discs (such as an extra 200-300 hate on the snap agro part of incite, more hate over time for incite etc..), or made them last longer, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread should be in the outhouse...<br />
How often do you tank two things at once (and do you want to tank two god mobs at once?) and if u were to tank two things, how long after the next heal does the second mob go after the healer? heheVery often does this occur. In PoE, I normally fight 2 mobs at once, and only have the chanter/bard mez if we get 3 plus, though I've been known to tank 3 at a time as well. And with this change.. it'll be that much longer after a heal lands before a mob turns on the healer, but if your good, you don't have that problem anyway. <br />
<br />
and keep in mind im playing a warrior not a bard  , im too lazy, nor do i want to hit 100 keys per minute to switch targets back and forth between two mobs to tank them both at the same time (if this is practical at all)Then I doubt you're playing your warrior to it's fullest potential. I looked over your Magelo, wether it is up to date or not I cannot say. But you are at the point in your game, judging by your additude, that you get people killed with your arrogence, and give other warriors a bad name with your... &quot;ub3rness&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wether or not I need this upgrade is yet to be seen, at this time, it really isn't. But I welcome any change SoE cares to make that will make my job and that of my peers easier to accomplish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lordaeron</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of things ODB, why create the extra work for me and the group by trying to tank two mobs at once when the chanter can easily mez one? while i could probably tank 2 mobs at a time after some practice, i work hard enough in my raid teams tank rot that i like to use exp groups to unwind and relax. <br />
<br />
Also a chain pulling bard or monk, or anyone that knows how to avoid the traps in poe can single pull and have a mob in camp to fight at all times, eliminating the need to have 2-3 full health mobs in camp at once.<br />
<br />
Finally i am not arrogant, nor do i consider myself uber, im far from it, and i also do not get people killed. What specifically from what i said makes you think i get people killed lol.. What makes you think im arogant? the fact that i said that i get little use out of incite and others get more? i was just stating the obvious that not all people are at the same lvl and thats fine i wasnt putting anyone down..<br />
<br />
My magelo is pretty up to date, i have about 280AAs, everything you see there i have earned. What is it about my magelo that gives you a wrng impression of me lol..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I often group with no CC or for whatever reason tank two mobs at once in exp groups.  I find that after a few initial swings I can concentrate on one mob (the one the dps is on) and just occaisionally toggle over to the 2nd mob and use incite to stay ahead of the healer.  It's also not that unusual for me to be mashing incite and watching &quot;you can use this in 9..8...7...6...5... etc when I am trying to get a mob off of a slower and taunt isn't working, so 20 second incite is certainly an improvment in my book, but I'm sure I can think of many other things I'd rather have and if you do mash incite every 20 seconds you will run yourself out of END.<br />
<br />
Single pulling is inefficient if your group can handle more.  Not all exp groups have a mezzer in them, or in the case of a bard, you are lowering your group dps by having them mez instead of playing overhaste, nuke focus, mana regen, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lordaeron</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes i agree, single pulling is ineficient, thats why i mentioned chain pulling. I dont really do pickup groups, so most of the time i have a solid group with solid cc or puller that can pull up to what we can handle. I admit that tanking more then one mob at a time could be beneficial.<br />
<br />
I also admit that there may be some things about incite i overlooked, and that shorter reuse on incite could be beneficial in some situations. I think weve gotten a little of topic and thats to be expected when the question was answered but people didnt agree with what i had to say, but thats ok :). My original point was that for me and my current situation, this focus effect on an epic wep is considerably underpowered, and i may very well modify my opinion on this matter later for what ever reason. I dont think personal atacks on me were necesary, ODB, if you knew me maybe you would feel differently :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they were to put a compensating amount of endurance regen on the epic then it would be a little better.<br />
<br />
Incite is 30 second refresh now, then a 0.66 multiplication of reuse time would make it 20 seconds so a 50% increase in endurance regen would make up for the extra drain and be useful when using other discs.  <br />
<br />
2/3 x 30sec = 20sec<br />
<br />
1/(2/3) agro cost = 3/2 agro cost =1.5 agro cost<br />
<br />
Even if they did do that, I still don't like this focus--I would much rather have something like a +50% strikethrough or a +25% dodge modifier or even a +25% agro modifier (upgrade of the focus on the Raex bp) rather than an incite refresh modifier.  Agro based on incite is far less useful than a passive effect would be since it will just make us run out of endurance faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't mind having a quicker refresh on incite and others in the line, and i think quicker refresh on all discs as long as you have the epic equipped would be even better. But I also think quicker incites without more endurance regen is going to lead to people, myself and others in this thread included, running out of endurance, or low on endurance, more often than they like. Keep in mind that the OoW incite line ability is more endurance than incite, and you will be able to use it 50% more often, and OOE is gonna become a much too common problem.<br />
<br />
Give the focus effect improved end regen, or reduced costs on all discs, or I'd prefer something else. hell i probably would prefer something else even with that, but meh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that effect lack luster. It shows no little thought on the ability or compareability to other classes abilitys, perhaps if it was a incite every 20 seconds free then mabey bu it is not. I can and DO tank 2 mobs and sometimes 3 at once if I need to in raids and groups, I dont need help doing it more than I have atm.<br />
<br />
Make it extended range and or duration on all dis's like +10% to all dis's duratons or ranges and then you have something closer to epic.<br />
<br />
This indeed seems to be warrior epic 2.0</div></div><hr />
