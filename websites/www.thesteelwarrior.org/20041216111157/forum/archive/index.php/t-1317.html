<br />
If a warrior and a knight were wielding the same 2H weapon, at say level 53 [with no AAs and no other gear] - would there be much of an intrinsic difference in DPS?.<br />
<br />
If the weapon was a windblade for example what factors determine the difference in damage output between the classes?<br />
<br />
I just want to get an idea of the variation in DPS between the classes? <br />
<br />
Does level affect the disparity [if there is any?]<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

And WAR DPS should be a tad higher, we are on a different damage table, but that may not come into effect until some time after 53 so chances are you would be pretty even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your question: A warrior will have higher DPS with his weapon than a knight of similar skill/gear/AAs.  Undead are an exception to this for paladins with the Slay Undead AA, and high level SKs can buff their attack to warrior like levels (don't know if this can be sustained though).  This doesn't take into account other offensive spells.  In any event, the difference at 65 is not large.<br />
<br />
Simple answer to your question: The warrior will deal more damage due to having a higher attack due to having a higher skill.  However, I doubt that the difference would be significant.</div></div><hr />

Using the exact same weapon, warriors will do more damage thanks to higher weapon skills.  Would have to parse it to know how much the difference would be.  SKs have damage spells though, and I believe an SK going all out for DPS can outdamage a warrior with melee and spells combined.<br />

I wouldn't believe the dps calculator personally.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you honestly that there really isnt much of a difference. If you parse over a long period of time, the difference comes out to about 10-20%.  that's not much at all.</div></div><hr />

Add in the fact that a SK's mana is going to get tied up in Zevfeer's Bite, a SK really doesn't have the spare mana to do damage.<br />
<br />
And to be fair, you should consider a warrior's DPS with Aura of Hate since that spell is shared.  Otherwise you can say Paladins do more damage because they get self-haste and have more HP if you're in a group without a cleric and they only buff themselves not you (symbol/hero/brell/Aura of Crusader).  If the warrior gets the Aura of Hate then warrior will definitely outdamage the SK.  If no Aura of Hate, they'll probably be doing roughly the same damage given the mana limitations of the SK.</div></div><hr />

True, though it's much harder on mobs that are immune or highly resistant to disease-based spells.<br />

Aura of Hate is a level 65 spell.  The original question was asked about level 53 :p<br />
If no Aura of Hate, they'll probably be doing roughly the same damage given the mana limitations of the SK.<br />
That brings up an interesting question... does a higher atk value via buffs affect the hit/miss ratio?  I don't have my misses turned on, so I can't really tell.  If not, a warrior is still going to hit more often regardless of Aura, and will probably do more melee damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Atk values do not affect the hit/miss ratio.  That is governed solely by your weapon skills.  Atk values are used in computing where on the damage spectrum you will hit versus mob AC, the higher the atk, the more often you'll hit for max damage.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that level played a part in accuracy. Is this true or not?  I know that I seemed to hit more often at 65 vs 60 against same mobs, but I have no parses to verify it.</div></div><hr />

Actually at level 40 knights cap their offense and weapon skills.  From then until 65 they have lower skill levels than a corresponding level warrior.  The effect become more pronounced after 50 when knights get 3 points per level versus warrior's 5, but there is an effect starting at 41.</div></div><hr />

<br />
UMM. WRONG At that level Both wars AND Knights cap at around 40-ish both offensive and defensive at 200 ish PRE 50 (might be 210)<br />
<br />
Knights dont cap POST 50 untill about 55-ish so at 53 there should be NO DIFF between the offensive and weapon skills between a knight and a war.<br />
<br />
SK offensive cap is 230 post 50, Pallie is 225 post 50, war is 252 post 50, SK and Pallie weaponskills cap is 225 post 50, war is 250 post 50...so around 54-55 is when the knight caps and the war still gains skill each level. Thus at 53 there should be NO DIFF given same weapon and attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great question Valeris...  :) <br />
<br />
My understanding is that it is primarily *not* MTin for the group.  <br />
The DPS figures *DO* include everything,  pet/spell/procs, etc. the whole nine yards.<br />
<br />
It should be noted, however, that those DPS numbers for a SHD are with an *offensive* spell lineup.  IF the SHD switches to a MT role, the spell lineup changes and goes *defensive*.  In that case, you are looking at approx 1/2 those amounts--perhaps even less.<br />
<br />
I do think he tanks a little at the beginning, then passes the agro to the WAR so that only the 2 of them get hit.  In that regard, I think he tanks a little to help with agro control, but not the majority.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your ques<br />

<br />
&quot;In a full burn situation most of the casting times can be negated by casting between swings, even with the way to low delays of pop 2h weapons, I can hold it up for about 90 seconds with my manapool in a full burn raid situation (dont use those spells in exp groups), in 90 seconds I would cast Blood of Hate 2 times (2.0 cast), Ignite Blood once (2.2 cast), Bond of Death 2 times (3.5 cast - this is the only one that costs me any significant melee damage), Touch of Innoruuk 7 times (1.6 cast), Touch of Volatis 7 times (1.6 cast), Spear of Decay 2 times (.5 cast), Zevfeers Bite once (2.0 cast) thats 38.6 seconds of lost melee from casting, which isnt that bad, about 40% of the fight, which would translate to a 40% loss of melee damage, with appropriate buffing I can hit about 140 dps in melee (including shroud of chaos procs), with a 40% loss of melee damage thats 86 dps added from melee, and 32 from my pet, 86+32+138=249, assuming a 5 minute fight (anything beyond that straight burning a mob down really wont work) ht will add 24 dps (7200 damage), giving you 280 dps.<br />
<br />
Now for the exp group explaniation, im using my mental corruption for mana, and have voq up, in addition to my aa/ft, giving me ~62 mana/tick regen (no bard), which is enough mana to keep up blood of hate/aura of hate/zev's bite non stop, which is good for about 30 dps (not including melee damage aura will give to others... dont count that as mine), throw my pet in as well, with no mage aviable to give me items for it, i get another 25 dps off it, pushing my non melee damage up to ~65 excluding proc damage, mental corruption will give me about 10 dps directly (main benefit to additional dps from it is the mana i gain), and then theres my own personal melee which I get 18 dps from swarm pet procs out of, and another 117 or so from melee bringing me to 145+spell damage, for 210 sustained dps in optimal conditions in exp groups of course nothing in eq is ever an optimal situation so using that as an example doesnt work so factor in mana/time fd'ing and mana used on taps and that damage falls to the 185 I was parsing at.&quot;<br />

Actually I was wrong there.  I thought since rangers capped lower defense than knights pre-50 they'd cap higher offense (as well as warriors).  This is not true.<br />

Nope sorry, but you are wrong there.  I get 3 offense skill points per level post 50.  At 52 my offense and weapon skills capped at 206 (defense at 52 capped at 220).  Once I hit 53, they capped at 209.  At 58, they are 224. While the gap doesn't appear until 51, not 40 as I thought, it does appear at 51 and get slowly but progressively larger.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... ok, I didn't realize ya didn't get 5 per level like everyone did pre 50. But the difference at 53 would be what... 4 points given max skills?? <br />
<br />
Grim Aura gives ya +13 attack :D <br />
<br />
Hehe, anyway... the answer to the original posters question is still the same I think... pretty much the same DPS.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget offense is also 6 points higher at 53 as well.  And grim aura is a 10 point atk buff.<br />
<br />
It's probably going to be about the same DPS, all other factors being equal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attack buffs from items give 1.3 benefit, since I can't cast I do not know if that carries over for self attack spell buffs, but a gobbie earring gives me +13 attack, AoB gives +13, venegence I +7, Avatar +130......</div></div><hr />
