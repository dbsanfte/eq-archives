I am using CHSD in main and CHOS in secondary with max haste.  Every mob I would use incite and taunt, on multiples i would AE taunt.  On 95% of the mobs I couldn't keep aggro from the chanter.  She was tashing and slowing at 80% so not to early and sometimes at 50%.  I am lvl 65 btw.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug, fluke or just plain bad luck?<br />

<br />
i'd give it another go before altering anything. methinks you didn't appease the RNG god that day. what you got equip-wise + abilities sholdn't be the problem IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might be dex. I still don't have max dex, and I can always feel the difference when I am grouped with a chanter when I don't have focus. I am not sure where your aa and augs are at, but as you get WA up and yak/anger on yuor weapons you will see agro problems less and less. <br />
<br />
Then again, could just be a bad day, warrior agro is never perfect and always has it's low points.<br />
<br />
The other thing is devide up debuffs and slows. If all you got is a chanter, it is a rough haul all the time. But malos is almost no agro, so having a mage or shaman use malos instead of tashing mobs will help alot. Or if you got a beastlord with his best slow, have the beastie slow and the chanter tash.</div></div><hr />

I was taunting smashing until I got a successful taunt then laid off as usual.  I have never had a problem quite like this before.  I didn't use NDT because of max Dex btw.  Only had the chanter for debuffs.  We had necro, chanter, rog, cleric, wizzy and war (me).<br />
<br />
Man if the RNG took that much of a dump on me yesterday, I should gold for a LONG time!</div></div><hr />

NDT will almost negate every proc he has on his weapons. NDT must proc first then it goes through the cycle to see if the others would proc after. I'd never use NDT if i'm the main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, NDT goes the other way around: Weapon procs suppress buff procs, and buff procs are not affected by WA. NDT is still a valid dex + atk buff, so long as you don't have avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I used NDT long before there was wa aa and it helped me alot with aggro when i had low stats /shrug.Gunnar was ST/MT then.He's been MT since pop and my aggro's always been good relatively.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you had a bad day hehe.Group wasn't in synch or other factors were mitigating your aggro.I used those weapons a good while without wa or augs and they worked well.I wouldn't worry over it. :)<br />
<br />
PS. Thats the way I thought it worked..Thanks Arathena.Hate when ppl post crud like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jigga wha?  I'm not sure what you're smokin there .. but pass it my way!<br />
<br />
NDT procs do no interfere with other procs.  With his current setup he should see his with 305 dex:<br />
taunting blow x 2 <br />
Force strike x 1<br />
<br />
With NDT<br />
taunting blow x 2<br />
force strike x 1<br />
NDT x 2<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been there and felt your pain before bro.  Get out there and buy some aggro procs from ldon while working WA.  Once you get 2 augments and some WA your days of aggro problems will all but come to an end barring extreme circumstances.</div></div><hr />

80percent is really late to tash, I tash at over 95 on my chanter and my warrior can keep agro.<br />
<br />
Oh you don't have wa5 and two agro proc aguments well doh...<br />

I know that Ingenuity fires on it because i see it doing 70 point critical damage lifetaps every so often.  If one weapon proc AA works with it it seems logical to think the other one probably does too.</div></div><hr />

Try grouping with other chanters and group with her again.<br />
If the problem only applies to her you can pretty much figure out its her. Theres always one in the bunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I've been casting anarchy, but thats not the problem. They always resist the stun&quot;<br />

Thank god for Spell awareness.</div></div><hr />

I would guess that I seem to have agro problems in advs about 1 in 20. I would almost chalk it up to the dungon being weird. If its a one time thing.<br />
<br />
Also be sensetive to levels and AAs. Hold agro is much easier in an all 65 than a mixed group where the casters may not yet have spell casting subtilty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just try to get used to taunting right after tash lands and right after slow.  Tash is a quick cast so you can time it well and their slow takes a bit to cast.  I have a BoW anger aug'd + WA5 and there's still times when a chanter with SCS will get summoned, you just have to be ready to taunt right after you see &quot;Target looks nervously about&quot;  Tash is a ton of aggro, their slow on the other hand isn't too bad.  If it's something with less resistant mobs ask them to slow first then tash or if you have a mage in group it can go sinia--&gt;slow--&gt;tash to give you sometime to establish aggro.  Basically just get used to taunting at the right times if you haven't already, I pretty much always place taunts after I see &quot;Target looks nervously about&quot; and &quot;Target slows down&quot; as those are pretty much the key areas you'll have aggro problems with.</div></div><hr />

You get an unusual one once in a while that  you have to write them off due to ldon madness and move on.<br />
<br />
The other day, I could not hold agro at all in a normal EF ldon.  I would chase the mob to the slower and he was casting at 85%.  I would chase the mob to the cleric whenever they healed, it was bad.  All the casters were taking agro, and they were doing nothing strange that I was aware of.  All of them were fellow 65s with secnd title.<br />
<br />
I was weilding a Blood Frenzy in my main hand, Obsidian Scimitar of War in off hand, both had Anger III augs, my dex, and str were at my max of 285, I had Vallons, and NDT cast on me.  I also have WA2.  When mobs came in, I would hit them with an arrow before they made it to camp if i could, I would engage, hit taunt, then incite.  After that, I did not click taunt unless mob started to run. When mob started to peel off, if taunt worked, he would stay on me, but if it failed (which it did a lot), I was running after the mob waiting for taunt to pop up again.  None of the casters got beat up much since I would get agro back, but it was annoying.<br />
<br />
Usually, I can be on auto pilot once mob gets down a little bit due to all my anger processes.  My OSoW is farily new, and prior to this I would wield a Sword of the Blood Sworn in off hand with Ang III.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WA3, Anger III x 2, CHSD, BoC, 150 AA in ramp, aet, nd3, pp, pd, lr5, id5, ambidex and the rest in &quot;additional attacks for 1h weapons&quot; AA = crap agro.<br />
<br />
I was working on WA5 when I gave it up playing a warrior (see below if you wish to know why.)<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Using Swiftblade of Zek and Trueborn elite dagger:<br />
<br />
1) Warrior pull mob with arrow, incite at max range.<br />
2) Enchanter with SCS3 and tash hate reducer (40 percent one) casts tash at max range.<br />
3) Enchanter starts casting slow as soon as gems pop.<br />
4) During slow casting, warrior engages with melee (no anger III procs, no procs.)<br />
<br />
You will never, ever, lose agro with or without a pet in vxed/tipt.  I have tested for days and days and days.<br />
<br />
Using WA3 all AA above, CHSD, BoC, 2 x Anger III:<br />
1) Warrior pull mob with arrow, incite at max range.<br />
2) Warrior engages with melee but gets no procs before step 3 or 4.<br />
3) Enchanter doesn't have SCS3 or Tash hate reducer, casts tash.<br />
4) If no proc from warrior before tash lands, enchanter will have aggro in vxed/tipt.<br />
5) If (and only if) I lose aggro, I pray taunt works.<br />
<br />
Very annoying.  Makes paying not much fun.  Since if you can't play with an enchanter with 200 to 300 AA, you can't play, period.  At least I won't play where someone dies every 10 minutes and that is exactly how vxed/tipt is for me when I play with any non enchanter slower or any healer or enchanter without SCS3.  Basically no SCS3?  I won't be your tank, ever.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter, I love eq, but I can't play it any more.  I have already switched from druid to cleric to warrior main's.  If I were to come back to EQ, I would come back as my cleric.  OOW is the nail in the coffin for warriors.  They are giving away too many mitigation boosts to knights that warriors can't use (due to lost hate on offhand damage) and the disciplines (while VERY attractive) don't make up for the raw tanking loss that is to come.  There is already less than 10 percent undisc'd difference between warrior and knights, the shield AA will make knights take less overall dps than a warrior and the disciplines don't make up for it.</div></div><hr />

I've been looking for info on OoW aa's and our tanking future in general, if there's a link in TSW which someone could point out I'd appreciate it.<br />
<br />
On topic however, someone mentioned mage pets which I was thinking about while reading this. Who did you lose aggro to? The chanter? or everybody? or did the mob not move, but turn on people only. My only thought to add to what was said here is that I am caught by surprise every once in a while by a character who will root every mob, which will seriously screw with aggro.</div></div><hr />

Who I lose agro to:<br />
Enchanter<br />

Druid<br />
Wizard (if snaring)<br />
<br />
Who I rarely lose agro to:<br />
Wizard (nuking; not snaring)<br />
Mage (pet or nuking)<br />
anyone with SCS3</div></div><hr />

Most ppl don't know it excists, when I still used it I met plenty of chanters who had no idea what it did either.</div></div><hr />

I simply could not hold aggro when the shaman slowed.  Basically, I shifted my strategy to accomodate this.  When the puller brought a mob to me, I would get initial aggro with a Kick only.  I accepted that the Shammy would get aggro from his slow / debuff, and saved my taunt / incite until after he got whacked once or twice.<br />
<br />
This may be really basic info, that I'm conveying.  But perhaps it would help in your situation.</div></div><hr />
