<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I anger 3 augmented my sword of SSRA and while it does help me mt some mobs a lot better with( i am almsot positive the +7 planar hits the gods, i get pretty good dps when i tank them), the proc itself doesn't go off as much as i would like when in normal xp groups, and it usually takes 2 to off before the casters feel they can nuke without fear of aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's always frustrating being tied to a proc from the Gods of Randomness and Dice Rolls.<br />
<br />
:-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Procs suck. <br />
<br />
I can proc 16 times one fight and none the next. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loydah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm i have total different experience with anger 3 on my SEWS. Two words: it rocks.<br />
3 - 5 procs per fight, either rune3 or anger3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, sure, overall I proc a few times per fight if you average things out. (Don't know which is EB from BoW and which is anger3 aug as they have the same emote). <br />
<br />
However, I still say procs suck. <br />
<br />
Not being in control bothers me I guess! It just seems to me it will always proc (and proc a lot) when I least need it to, generally. <br />
<br />
I don't mean to come off as complaining here, as I am not in a position to complain in comparison to the average geared warrior (which I was not all that long ago myself) but I do stress that procs themselves are lame. <br />
<br />
I shouldn't have to beg my weapon to proc. We should know eachother so damn well by now that I'm completely in tune with it and able to command or will it to do my bidding! Ehh... anyways just my opinion. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have had my Emp 2hs for a while now and never actually seen any hard evidence either way on the planar Bane.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm what mobs that bane works on if any at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">175 yeksha plus GSoFW = ownage :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think that with the LDON augments dual wielding made a strong comeback, being able to get up to 5 (2 per weapon + Call of fire/symbol of the planeswalker etc.) agro procs to me outweighs the extra dps from twohanders, especially while exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a SEWS and the DPS on it alone (when I don't get an early proc) is usually enough to keep the mob on me through an enchanter tashing and shaman slowing. I do have pretty much maxed offensive AAs now though, and I'm sure that helps. And sorry, but anger3 does not suck :p. I know it's not a solution to agro problems, but it certainly goes a long way towards helping with me at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bane on emp sword only works for old world gods, meaning like 2-3 mobs. CT in fear, Inny in PoH and I think thats it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Either way, i get better dps mting god mobs than id's expect with a normal weapon with no bane.  I wonder if there'd be a way to find out.  <br />
As for anger, i do get rounds where ill proc up to 6 times or none at all.  It would be nice if the enraging blow message would tell you it went off so you don't have to rely on particles being on, or sorting through battle spam.  Overall i like my emp sword and anger has improved it quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">procs are overrated with our new EB button(tm) on test.. Can't wait till they fix it to see if it works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What is this EB button that I keep hearing about?  Is it the Provoke skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yep, 150 range +hate. Uses some endurance and has a 30 sec recycle time apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have found that if you really want the LDoN mods to be reliable you need to tie it to an existing weapon that already has an EB/stun proc on it.   The &quot;double&quot; hate proc weapons are pretty mean agro though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I also have The Emp sword auged with anger 3, but I also have aten gloves. With the stun and anger 3 going off I usually dont have many problems keeping agro in an exp group or MT'in on a raid. In an exp group the only people i ever have problems with is wizards when i dont get an anger 3 or a few stuns. I think if i get the chance to win a SEWS or a BoW im gonna jump all over it but for now i am happy with my emp sword.<br />
