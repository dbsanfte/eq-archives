<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tharak Soulhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Over the last few days I and a couple of other warriors in my guild have been noticing that none of our aggro creation methods seem to be working. Additionally I had an enchanter friend state that she wasted an entire bar of mana on boggle and the mob never left her alone. So it would appear that aggro creation and reduction spells/items in the game are no longer funtional. I saw a post on the developer forums but that only pertained to augment procs. Can anyone help confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard some casters talking about while exping at IS in BoT last night.  I didnt really notice much of a difference though myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yesterday in phase 1 of Potime, I broke mez and taunted, the taunt message did not say it failed, yet the mobs attention never left the enchanter (had hott so I'm 100pct sure), the enchanter said that she was boggling also, I managed to succesfully taunt 7+ times yet the mobs attention never turned to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karlea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm having problems with mezz breaking lately. I approach a mezzed mob, taunt it, got no failure message thus it was successful. I attack and break mezz, the mob runs off to the enchanter without looking at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aggro was fine on saryn raid for me monday night, hedge maze sunday, and villagesr and virgins trials in hoh tuesdaynight. only time i had problems on mezbreak, was when the enc was sitting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suspect it has something to do with boggle, although it hasn't happened enough to figure out exactly what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Odd, I noticed similar problems doing a normal LDoN in BB. Generally when I break a mez I taunt until succesful and Incite, but for some reason this wasn't working. It would sometimes, but both myself and the Enchanter (who was 2boxing a Ranger) noticed that something was up since I'd grouped with him before and not had problems like these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been having similar problems with holding aggro myself.<br />
<br />
normally, my EB weapon, or my FoY rune3 2hander, auged with Call of Fire, is more than sufficient to hold aggro with WA5.<br />
<br />
Recently, I've been constantly losing aggro to rogues, monks, chanters, and shamans, as well as nukers.<br />
<br />
Not at all sure what the problem is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only problem I have had recentally was taunt saying it worked (no fail msg), but instead it didn't.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some new coding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yep somethings screwy had to break out the old 2h swing agro  <br />
<br />
nothing like seeing anger 2 proc 3 times+ incite and the mob run after the wiz on the first AT cast. and stick on him for 4-5 concussions while i land 2-3 non failed taunts.<br />
<br />
by then shit was dead though and it didn't matter that i got agro back. just in time for it to enrage on everyone who was hitting it while the wiz tanked.<br />
<br />
switched to 2h un anger auged and started holding agro. i was seriously saying wtf.<br />
<br />
sk in the group was saying the same shit. his agro spell wasn't doing squat and had to start casting chain cd. but was snagging all kinds of agro off heart flutter or whatever that upgrade is. got so bad he would anounce he was casting it so i would be ready. and cleric could prep to heal him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have seen a lot of things you guys have said, even just tonight in BoT... was really annoying seeing a successful Taunt, weapons proc a bazilion times, and then immediately lose agro to the monk.<br />
<br />
Played my wizzy the other day for a group, and it seemed that anytime I nuked I got agro instantly - and I even wait til 50% before go all out... this normally never happens for me.<br />
<br />
Used Ancient concussion about 4 times in a row tryin to get the mobs off me and never worked.. while this normally does the trick the first try.<br />
<br />
So, ya.. Hate modifier spells/proccesses are broke imo.</div></div><hr />
