<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking a little last night (always dangerous) and this hit me:<br />
<br />
Why is it a paladin can cast an ineffective low level stun for aggro, yet the innate stun attacks we have don't generate the same effect, even though they are more effective (i.e. they can work on higher level mobs than the stuns)?<br />
<br />
I know this would be a possible disadvantage for the non-large races pre-55, when kicks stun, as only Barbs, Ogres and Trolls can slam, but they can still bash with a shield (more encouragement to USE a shield as they have been professing they want). Maybe see if kick can be a stunning attack from say level 20, instead? In terms of aggro generation, all melee/hybrids can do this, so its not detracting from their ability to lock mobs if they want to, yet it does give us another avenue to build aggro.<br />
<br />
It just seems inconsistent that a magic stun should piss off something at an incredible rate, yet a &quot;physical&quot; stunning attack doesn't (yeah I know: looking for consistency in a fantasy MMORPG... :p).<br />
<br />
Idunno... what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put it off as long as I could (48 levels) ... but eventually even I caved in and started to learn how to ghetto bash.<br />
<br />
I'm not super good at it yet, but it's served me well a few times. I think I lose some noticable DPS, but when I do use it, it's in situations where the bash is needed but the DPS isn't. So it evens out.<br />
<br />
Now that FB shields are starting to show some results, I'm thinking it may have been a good idea to practice this long lost skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arantius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We're seeing the problem of an over-stressed design, stressed unimaginably past what it was first intended for.<br />
I would venture to say, safely in my opinion, that holding aggro became a significantly more visible issue when PoP came out.  Even up until then a warrior could really do it just fine, and it wasn't too common for a paladin or shadowknight to use their spells for aggro as much as they do today.<br />
Spells, of course, were designed to be use by the spell casters.  One of the primary design fetaures was that spells generated aggro.  Enough aggro that the caster must play with skill in order to not end up a pile of goo.<br />
This was a very good thing.  Back in the day.  Back in the day, every class was much better balanced, and as a result of that, or part of that depending on yoru perspective, would generate aggro at about the same rate, and taunt as it exists now and always has was good enough.<br />
Things have changed and it's a result of the over stressed design.  It's very true that if you seriously beefed up/altered the way a warrior taunts that it would fix PoP.  But it would alter, in a negative way, a lot of other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most endgame warriors say they already hold aggro more than well enough due to high end gear and AAs.<br />
<br />
Adding paladin level stun hate to their slam/bash/kick attacks would let them hold aggro significantly better than even they currently do, quite possibly making endgame encounters noticeably easier.<br />
<br />
Since top end raiding is the one area of the game which Sony appear genuinely to have an interest in &quot;balancing&quot;, I think we can safely assume that anything which adds significant innate sustained aggro over time for warriors is a non-starter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would point out that not all melee/hybrids can kick... For example, Knights Can't, I don't think Rogues can, but I may very well be wrong there.<br />
<br />
Interesting idea... I'm long held the totally unprovable idea that kick adds more aggro then most people think.</div></div><hr />
