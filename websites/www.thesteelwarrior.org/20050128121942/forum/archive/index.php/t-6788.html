Looking at my Magelo, you can see I pretty much buy all my items in the bazaar.  I have no problems tanking in BoT however.  That said, any suggestions on an upgrade or will that suffice for DPS.  I own a GSoT that I rarely use as I just cant get over using such an ugly @zz weapon!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will most likely have to kill Fabled King Tranix to get to him.  Tranix rampages, Skarlon flurries.  Skarlon drops Razing Sword of Skarlon (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68262).  It looks like the old Razing Sword of Skarlon, kinda neat.  No proc, but the faerune effect is great.<br />
<br />
Tranix drops Fabled Crown of King Tranix (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68256) as well, it might help you convince people to kill them.  :)<br />
<br />
Fabled Magus Rokyl drops Fabled Rokyl's Channeling Crystal (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68277) for the casters.  I have never killed Fabled Rokyl myself.<br />
<br />
If fabled mobs have been removed, nevermind!</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly (and if the bazaar on yer server is at about the same state as the one on Tarew Marr), not only will you gain in DPS, you should also be able to turn some profit selling off the Ga'Nak and getting the WMBS.</div></div><hr />

I can steal his.  As far as DPS etc, any parses between the two?  I have some decent hits with the Ganak.  Also just started in a DKP public raid system.  Did a mini raid with no deaths, so Ill stick with em a bit.  Working our way up.  Ill try the WMBS and juggle the two in hopes of landing a sweeter 2hs off of the lower tier Mobs.  Any of them drop anything decent that I would spend DKP on?  Sorry can get to Alla's to look from work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm looking for a good 2H agro weapon (preferably 2HS, blunt and pierce have crap animations :p).<br />
<br />
but i've just seen 3 good 2HS for tanking : Anathema, BoW and SEWS... and well, those are kinda out of my reach (my guild is about to enter ssra atm)<br />
<br />
i've spent quite a few hours magel'ing and allakhaz'ing and... found nothing :/<br />
<br />
i'm starting to think i should get myself a GSot4W but i'd prefer not and let the monkeys out there (or warriors without fabled exe) loot it first. not to mention that the &quot;innate&quot; agro of the GSot4W is quite low :/<br />
<br />
any suggestions ? did i miss a weapon somewhere ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do you want a 2-hander?<br />
<br />
I don't think you'll find anything worth bagging your BoC for until you get to Rallos Zek.  If I were you I'd look to pick up a bloodfrenzy since you're headed to Ssra.  Bloodfrenzy/BoC will be the most aggro you'll see before plane of time.  <br />
<br />
If you really want a 2-hander, your best bet would be a Bloodied Berserker's Blade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=30530) from Seru.  Decent tanking weapon, but even auged probably won't touch a BF/BoC combo for aggro.  Ripostes won't be an issue for you until elemental planes +, and even then it's debatable whether they're really important or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I currently have a GSot4W with Anger III.<br />
Are there any bazaar buyable weapons that will beat it?<br />
I know the BoC does, but not sure about offhand.<br />
<br />
Its been bothering me for awhile and I dont want to throw down that kinda cash for a nominal aggro increase.</div></div><hr />

I do not know from personal use but that is what I have heard from a few other Warriors i know.<br />

Buyable the best agro 2hander is the GSoT as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

Its been bothering me for awhile and I dont want to throw down that kinda cash for a nominal aggro increase.BoC+A3 coupled with any agro weapon will blow away GSot4W+A3 for agro. Unfortunately, you already have A3 on the GSot4W. Since you are obviously capable of looting tower bosses, I would get my hands on a GBoS and put A3 on it. Then strip A3 off the GSot4W and put one of the life tap procs on it so you will have a good DPS set up to go with your agro set up. BoC+A3/GBoS+A3 will serve you well until you can get a BoW. If you have rotten luck, that combo will work well enough until you can loot some Time 1hers.</div></div><hr />

Only one hand options available to me be bazaar.<br />
<br />
Was thinking BoC and CHoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stick with the aug'd GSO4W, and buy two 40HP augments instead with the 2300 points that you would have spent replacing your existing Anger 3.  If you have aggro problems (which you didn't say you have), then ask your SK friends to keep Voice of Terris/Thule on you, it's a noticeable help.</div></div><hr />
