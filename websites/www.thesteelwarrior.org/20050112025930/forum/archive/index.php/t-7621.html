<br />
 Would the great staff of thunder with a anger III aug keep aggro as well as duel wield with similar procs. Like I said before, I have read through the library, but I am still confussed. I am not ep flagged so the weapons I would use would be bazzar equivelant.<br />
<br />
 2 hand vs dueld weild is really the question vs aggro I guess.<br />
   <br />
<br />
 thanks,<br />

Dual weilding 2 stun weapons, such as CHoS and SotB, is better aggro due to more procs. GSoT is probably more DPS and is definitely less ripostes. A GSoT will be less aggro, but probably good enough especially augmented. And it sure is cheap!</div></div><hr />

If you're willing to do that, go with dual wield -- but otherwise, you should be decent with just the GSoT</div></div><hr />

If you have enough points to anger 3 the GoT then you could also anger 3 either or both the 1 handers.<br />
Procs = agro<br />
Swinging 2 weapons  = more chances of procs<br />
<br />
Just an opinion from someone who had all of these weapons at one point. I was never impressed by the Greatstaff of Thunder.<br />
The real problem is that everyone has the Copper hammer/Bloodsworn combo thanks to more crappy SOE itemization. You will find agro challenging to deal with when the people in your group are equipped with the same weapon(s) you are using.<br />
I played my Cleric alt in a mid 50's group the other day where the Ranger, Beastlord x2, Warrior and Bard all had the same weapons equipped. I was always curing whoever had the latest proc.<br />
A greatstaff of Thunder would make no difference in this case IMHO.<br />

Go with the CHoS/SotB combo if you want some aggro, and only aug them with Anger2, don't go for 3.<br />
<br />
Besides, get a WMBS if you want a 2hander.  I used this as a toy for a while and thought it was pretty decent, and before WA5, warriors using the GSoT couldn't pull aggro from me, though im not sure about now.  And the most important reason is to get the hell away from the gay 2hb animation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in the long run the duel wield may catch up on procs, but GSoT holds aggro fairly well with no procs, whereas your aggro with duel wield is 100% dependant on getting that lucky proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
back when i used the droga combo and GSoT, i always had to whip out the GSoT to hold aggro off a good rog.<br />
<br />
duel wield only works well if you have duel ldon procs + duel innate procs.  weapon affinity 5 helps you pull even further ahead.  for simplicity sake i would stick with the GSoT.</div></div><hr />

Greatstaff of thunder, and even warmarshalls staff is VERY close to the same DPS as droga weapons.<br />
<br />
You definitely don't need both if you don't want them.<br />

<br />

<br />
This is totally, 100% fucking wrong.  Droga weapons held aggro better than the Greatstaff before augments and before proc increasing AA's, and always will.  Dual wield &gt; 2h for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This argument is a toss up and has been made in about a gajillion threads. Droga vs GSoT?  Do them both or do either, you will be content either way.  Back in the day I did GSot but then later aquired Droga and customized them for situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Haass is right, 2 x 1h &gt; 2h for agro.<br />
2. Don't make the mistake that I did, A2 is a waste of points. A single A3 aug generates the same amount of hate that 2x A2 augs do. Save up and buy 2 A3 augs. Soon enough they will be reusable anyway so you really aren't wasting points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max, you don't actually say what 1-hand weapons you have, or what level you are. If you have the Droga weapons, then I'd certainly be inclined to go with them &amp; aug them first. If you've got enough LDoN points for Anger 3, do that on the weapon you use for mainhand work.<br />
But if when you say &quot;similiar&quot; procs on your 1 hander, you're talking about a Venomous Axe + some other dd proc weapon, then the procs are not as good as GSoT. If that's the case, use the GSoT but get the Droga weapons asap.<br />
GSoT is really nice if you hit your mid-50s with a warrior main and don't have the plat to get the Droga weapons quite yet (because you just upgraded your armor/haste/whatever). You can work with the GSoT to hold aggro, even unagu'd. That gets harder to do the higher your level, mostly because the people you're apt to group with are more likely to be beating on the mob harder and faster and thus they will be generating more aggro. Aggro that you have to stay on top of. When the GSoT becomes equipable, though, you can hold agro with it if you pay attention. A lot of warriors hit lvl 56 with a good bit fewer than 200 dex, so one of the nice things about the GSoT is its speed. You'll have a bit of aggro even before you proc, and careful use of the incite line will help with early aggro.<br />
But, my sense of things is that, given your choice of bazaar weapons, Haass &amp; Naralli &amp; Wandor &amp; company are right.</div></div><hr />

before i had ldon procs on my duel wield setup and any amount of WA, i remember how completely random procs were ... some fights i would have 10 others i could go 4 fights without 1, so dont fucking tell me that in jo blow low end grouping situations duel wield is god.  the dps is higher on the staff, therefore the effective aggro on the staff will blow the measly extra &quot;assumed&quot; 1 proc from offhand out of the water.<br />

i wielded that fucking combo for the better part of 5 months .... i KNOW what it can and cant do.  its good aggro, but my experience always showed the staff to be better.  add in ldon procs and weapon affinity, and you see more consistent procs via duel wield.  either will work.  THE END.<br />
<br />
want guaranteed decently strong aggro .. go with the stick and save some money.  if youre willing to stick it out and grind out 2 aggro augments ... then go with duel wield.  othwerwise, the 2hander will come out on top ... especially when youre finding procs to be rare (which is when you need the aggro the most).  even though the dps on the 2 are close, mobs fucking hate fast 2handers ... and for some reason 2handers generate more innate proccless aggro.</div></div><hr />

You're wrong, and I'm gonna tell you you're wrong until you understand it.  Fortunately for you, I'll also explain it.<br />
<br />
You think procs are streaky with Dual wield?  They're more streaky with 2ppm than with 3, so nope...no advantage for you there.<br />
<br />
You think the greatstaff of thunder outdamages droga weapons?  Nope, you're wrong, I parsed it myself. The difference is miniscule, so nope, no advantage there for you either.<br />
<br />
Your assumptions are based upon incorrect data, and observations, which are inherently flawed by the fact that you do &quot;Jo blow&quot; pickup groups every day.  My conclusions are based upon logic and the fact that I had the same group, day in and day out for the better part of 2 years.  The DPS is equal, the procs favor dual wield more, and there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING anywhere that shows that mobs hate 2 handers more than 1h, so you're full of crap there too.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it all breaks down when you look at it logically.  You can say shit like &quot;Well, I did better with the greatstaff on thursday than I did with the droga weapons on wednesday,&quot; but that doesn't take into account the fact that maybe your group was better equipped on wednesday, maybe you were paying more attention to the game on thursday or anything of that nature.  Your assumptions are wrong, observations are skewed and your conclusions are naturally flawed because of them.</div></div><hr />

That is the nicest, most clearly worded rebuttal Haass has ever posted. And not a single FUCK in it.<br />
<br />
You feeling ok Haass?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, what he posted is spot on too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haas, you aint gonna change my mind because i've been there before ... sorry bub might just wanna save the energy.<br />
<br />
GSoT parsed just aroud 10dps higher than the droga combo in a number of different 10min-5hour parses i ran ... its consistently better dps.<br />
<br />
now you might say ... wtf i'm a warrior .. give me procs not dps!  procs = aggro.  well, even at lv 65 and all levels leading up to, <br />
<br />
if procs were something you could always count on having, then yeah the droga combo is better.  i'd be a fucking moron to think otherwise.  BUT ... the random number generator can be a bitch ... so that extra shitty 1 per min offhand proc which you can go 10 or more fights without seeing is not going to help you in the xp groups.<br />
<br />
3 procs are better than 2, granted, but there were too many times before i got my first ldon proc that the duel wield setup just wouldnt cut it because i just plain wasnt getting the procs.  aggro is not an issue IF you get the procs.<br />
<br />
1. mobs hate fast 2handers<br />
2. procs before auxillary ldon procs or WA even on duel wield are sketchy at best<br />
<br />
seriouslly though haass ... this argument has been around as long as these weapons have been in the game.  there is no clearcut answer, but having owned both for ~6 months ... after scads of parses and fucktons of banging my head on the keyboard asking &quot;WHY??&quot;, i sold off my droga combo for good and kept my GSoT.<br />
<br />
on the lighter side, not too long after that i won my GBoStorms and finally put that anger3 i had been saving to good use.  A BoC from a guild raid came later and i have never looked back.<br />
<br />
in the end 1 offhand proc that you probably wont see in most xp group fights will NOT make up for the loss of aggro from not using the GSoT.<br />
<br />
assuming you get the procs your golden and your aggro is stronger, but any warrior who has been around the bush a few times can tell you that procs are the devil and can be pretty god damn stingy.  Hell, i've duel anger3 augs on hate weapons and weapon affinity 5 and i STILL can go more than 40 seconds at the start of a fight with 0 procs.  its fucked up if you ask me .. but thats how it works  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ps- am i the only one that has noticed that its possible to hold aggro through a malo/slow with a GSoT and 0 procs but not with the droga combo an 0 procs?  it happened to me a lot, and i can still use it when i whip out my 2handers every single time.  i can hold aggro through tash/slow with no procs with 1 but not the other ... crazy stuff eh?<br />
<br />
i agree haass it doesnt add up ... but it's just the way it works in my experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
To this day i can use an absolute piece of shit 2hander (PLG 75/65) and hold aggro through a slow better than my primary combo (duel augged) assuming i get 0 procs.  the dps sucks but for some reason it never fails.<br />
<br />
Duel wield aggro is stronger for me if i get the procs, but if i dont get one in the first 10 seconds of a fight i can kiss my aggro goodbye to our tash/slow ench.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. mobs hate fast 2handersHuh? This has already been rehashed a million times. 1h or 2h doesn't matter. Yes, a single GSoT swing is more agro than a single SotB or CHoS swing, but the combined number of swings from the 1h combo is easily enough to make at least as much agro as the total number of GSoT swings.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. procs before auxillary ldon procs or WA even on duel wield are sketchy at bestHow in the fuck can you sit there and say that a 2h weapon with a single 2ppm proc is more consistent than 2x 1h weapons with the same basic proc on both??? If the RNG is streaky for 1h weapons, it is streaky for 2h weapons as well. The difference being that it affects the 2h much worse because they have less procs to begin with. Even if the GSoT does parse 10dps more than the droga combo, there is no way in hell that the miniscule amount of damage makes up for a 50% higher proc rate. What are you smoking? Seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps- am i the only one that has noticed that its possible to hold aggro through a malo/slow with a GSoT and 0 procs but not with the droga combo an 0 procs?This one time in BoT camp, I held agro through Tash+Malo+Slow with only a shield equipped. Since H2H + shield is clearly superior agro, I have decided to sell all my weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh my point being that GSoT will hold aggro better without the procs than the duel wield setup.  dont like what i have to say or my past experiences ... i could give a fuck.<br />
<br />
3 procs is better than 2 .... but the 2 with a weapon of higher innate aggro generation generally wins out over the god damn 2handers and the extra offhand proc per min.  that extra 1 proc cant be counted on all the time in xp groups.  on boss mobs where youre fighting for more than 3 or 4 minutes it will work itself out, but otherwise its all luck.<br />
<br />
there is a big difference btw potential and actual dps .... potential dps on the GSoT is much higher than the potential dps of the droga combo.  potential and not actual dps is what governs aggro generation.<br />
<br />
My weapon setup now will pull in more aggro over time than an anger3 BoWar due to more procs, but you can bet your ass that the BoWar will kick off with stronger aggro and hold aggro better in those unlikely events where you get no procs.  it's really the same deal except scaled down with buyable weapons.</div></div><hr />

How can you say that the potential DPS of a GSoT is much higher than the droga combo when their actual DPS is near exactly the same? Are you saying that the 1h weapons have a higher hit ratio? Maybe you are saying that they hit for max more often? Which is it? How can 2 set ups have near identical actual DPS while having considerably different potential DPS???<br />
<br />
You are trying to agrue using observation and gut feel. This is a computer game with hard coded rules. We have been able to figure out how the majority of those rules work through parsing and now you are telling us that all of that is wrong. Think about that for a minute.</div></div><hr />

People who don't know any better come to this board to learn how to be a better warrior and how to play the game better. Generally they will take what people who have been around a while (i.e. people with high post counts) and take that as the truth. Posting seat of the pats crap that flies in the face of parsing and logic is spreading bullshit to people who will think there is a basis for your post. This is just like all the idiots who swore up and down that their SoDs proc'd more than their BoCs. Anyone who believed them and dumped a BoC for a SoD was making a mistake because of bad information, just like you telling someone asking for advice that 2h is better agro than 1h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mr wizard ... its pretty common knowledge that fast 2handers will do a fuckton more dmg if you have max possible attack.<br />
<br />
my first char was a ranger (300+ aa) my business was knowing what weapon setups put out dps.  my fast 2handers always outdamaged my duel wield setups when i was running at high attack values, but the duel wield would run about the same dps at lower attack values.<br />
<br />
assuming that you got all maximum hits from 2handers ... they beat the hell out of comparable duel wield weapons every single time.  since potential dps per swing governs aggro generation, and not actual fucking dps ... see the picture yet?  for all the mob cares youre getting max hits every swing (hit or miss).  <br />
<br />
THAT is why comparable 2handers (especially fast ones) will generate more aggro in the long run w/out procs.<br />
<br />
Procs are always more important for aggro generation, but you cant always count on even getting procs.  especially when you dont have any WA or any ldon augments.</div></div><hr />

either weapon setup will be good for non-hardcore raiders, but you will have consistently stronger aggro with the GSoT than you will with droga weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my point was never that procs are less important than dps aggro, but that procs are not always reliable aggro in grouping situations until you have some proccing aa's and some ldon procs under your belt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you're getting there, but you're changing your point so much that it's difficult to tell where you're going.<br />
<br />
Take your statement there, and repeat after me &quot;GSoT does not outdamage Droga weapons by a margin significant to be considered for aggro purposes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, what do you have left?  Jack and shit. Your 2h is not holding aggro any better without a proc.  Get a fucking windblade, see how much aggro you hold with it.  You don't hold shit.  Get a warmarshall's staff....once again, you're not holding aggro for shit.  DAMAGE PER SECOND OR POTENTIAL DAMAGE DOES NOT EQUAL AGGRO.  Go look up that thread in the Arena a couple weeks ago, you'll see it ended abruptly the moment that Gnoll Hide Lariats were brought up (3/20, effect stun).<br />
<br />
You are wrong sir.  You have no argument that has any basis in fact, only observations, and we all know observations are innaccurate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i guess this is why a Jagged oynx staff sucks for aggro compared to a BoC.  Jesus fucking christ ... dps does play a roll in things.  procs are superior, but when procs are slim (and they are sometimes) its gonna be your potential dps aggro which keeps the mobs attention on you. youre a fool if you think otherwise ... why the fuck do you think a BoW is so nice other than the 50ac ... it is nicer than comparable duel wield setups with more procs because of its dps aggro.<br />
<br />
*edit- my original statement was:<br />
&quot;assuming you dont have WA5 and you dont have duel anger3  augs to put on weapons, GSoT + anger3 will be more aggro always.  in the long run the duel wield may catch up on procs, but GSoT holds aggro fairly well with no procs, whereas your aggro with duel wield is 100% dependant on getting that lucky proc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like i said, my argument affirmed that 3 procs will win out over 2 in the long run, but in average xp group situations, the offhand proc on the droga combo wont really match up to the dps aggro loss from not using the stick.  if you get the proc then youre fine and your aggro is solid, but if youre shy on procs you are liable to lose aggro to a person you wouldnt otherwise lose aggro to.  either setup with an anger3 would be just dandy, but you'll get more mileage from a GSoT with anger3 if youre only going to buy one augment.  with more than 1 augment the duel wield setup will own hands down.  At his point in the game it's choosing between having aggro all of the time to a slightly lesser degree occasionally or having stronger aggro on lucky-proc fights and not being able to hold it at all when the RNG is being a bitch.  thanks, but i'll take the aggro although occasionally to a lesser degree.  if he were a raiding warrior and was looking for the max aggro possible i would tell him to go grind out 2 anger3's and slap them on some aggro weapons like i myself have done.</div></div><hr />

My take on things: I've noticed that 2 handers SEEM to draw more aggro than DW in general. I actually have no idea why this is. I don't know of any particular reason why they should, but it's a trend I noticed in early PoP. I was grouping with some friends in PoV, the MT was using a BoC and a SoD and I was using a Frostreaver. I could barely keep aggro on him. Mind you, I wasn't 65 and he was, and I know Frostreavers proc is good aggro, but I was drawing aggro ALOT. I'm not claiming this to be proof that 2 handers &gt; DW, but it IS something I've noticed before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't plan on upgrading and are only ever going to grind out one aug then there probably won't be a big differance and go with your personal taste.However,the common upgrade path for most warriors at that point involves 1 handers.Having that a3 auged CHOS will come in handy if you can grab a BF,HG,BOC,GBOS,CHSD,the tactics scimatar,etc.etc.The GSOT will get parked.If you never get better weapons you'd be well off to grind out the a3 augs for the CHOS and SOTB.Much better aggro than a a3 GSOT imo.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather have more touches than 10 dps /shrug.The GSOT is a godsend and can do the job a lot better than stuff I used to tank with.It's not as good as the Droga combo even without augs and wa-5 imo though.And with augs and proc aa the margin stretchs even further.A BOW is another ballgame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thinking back to Brodda Thep's post about agro generated per swing and what he showed with each swing generating a set amount of agro regardless of DPS etc.  If I remember correctly he showed a couple of other things in that thread too... the agro per swing of the offhand was insignificant compared to the main hand, and that the damage bonus created a larger portion of the agro per swing than the remaining portion of the potential damage.<br />
<br />
What this means is that assuming your 2hander has a delay greater than 28 (so it qualifies for the larger damage bonus) then a swing of your 2 hander creates more agro than a swing of your 1 hander, and Im pretty sure that 2 swings of your 30 delay 2hander will create more agro than 3 swings of your 20 delay 1 hander.<br />
<br />
I don't have any hard parses to back this up myself and I can't be arsed looking through brodda thep's data to provide solid evidence, but I will give a few examples based on my in game experience (and some of my guildies) that have supported this.<br />
<br />
First off - Blade of War vs BloodFrenzy/BoC combo.<br />
<br />
Every one I have spoken to about the BoW has been impressed by its &quot;DPS Agro&quot;.  We had a pretty poor run on BoW's with RZtW so we were pretty far into PoP before most of our tanks had them.  Initially on some mobs - Warlord Ginto and Xegony in particular we were having issues with agro while our tank was using BF(w Anger3) and BoC offhand.  If he didnt get the procs Ginto would eat DPS/ healers on a blur, and we had a few cases of Xegony leaving the tank and cleaning up the clerics early in the fight.  Once we had a few BoWs these problems just went away, the DPS agro of a BoW was enough to hold Ginto after a blur regardless of procs and we havent had a problem with Xegony agro since either.<br />
<br />
I know several tanks who have bagged BF/BoC type combos for BoW because BoW is more agro (less procs but more agro).  I never had a BF, but there was no question that the BoW was a tonne more agro than BoC/SEM combo.  I picked up a darkblade a couple of weeks back and until I put anger 3 on it BoW+Anger2 was more solid for agro than DB/EoE, I haven't had it anger aug'd for long so I don't have an opinion for DB(Anger3)/EoE vs BoW(anger2) yet, in the time I have had the DB if it didnt proc it wasnt impressive for agro, the BoW was impressive for agro even without procs, hell even my BBB seems better for &quot;DPS Agro&quot; when you get those dry spells of no procs.<br />
<br />
So having said that I have no problems believing that the &quot;DPS agro&quot; of a 2 hander is noticably more than the &quot;DPS agro&quot; of a DW combo despite them putting out very similar actual DPS.  Wheel out 4 procs is better than 2 procs as much as you like (though its more like 6PPM is better than 4PPM due to the lower offhand proc rate), DPS agro is still an important factor in choosing weapon combos especially when you are choosing between droga weapons or a GSoT as alot of tanks at that level wont come by the points to buy anger augs easily and probably wont have finished their Weapon Afinity AAs.</div></div><hr />

Here it is for those who haven't read it, I think its up there with the uber mob tanking guide as one of the most important bits of info ever to be posted on this board.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789<br />
<br />
His original theory was that agro per swing = damage bonus which he proved wasnt the case however he does say &quot;Damage Bonus + Damage is pretty close.&quot;.  In the GSoT vs CHoS example I used in my previous post that gives us the following numbers:<br />
<br />
Assuming 100% Haste, in 60 seconds a CHoS will swing 60 rounds and we'll pretend that it double attacks every round giving us 120 swings.  Agro for the CHoS per swing is roughly 13damage+13db = 26 so we have a DPS agro of 1560.<br />
<br />
In the same conditions a GSoT will swing 40 rounds and pretending it also double attacked every round we would have 80 swings.  Agro per swing is roughly 31damage + 36db = 67 so we have a DPS agro of 5360.<br />
<br />
Sure theres alot of assumptions made around the actual values but it makes a pretty strong case for using 2 handers for agro.<br />
<br />
It seems that the amount of hate is determined similar to the values used to determine DPS for a given weapon combo. (damage * modifier + damage bonus) Except in this case the modifier is VERY low. IN damamge calculations you will have a modifier of 3-4 anymore, but in hate calculations it seems to be around 1. So damage bonus is a significant contributor to hate. Thus why off hand weapon generates much less agro than primary hand weapons. (Of course being swung less often is also a factor.) As you get better weapons your offhand will perform better hate wise in comparison to your main weapon. THis is why a less damaging two handed weapon can out taunt a more damaging one handed combo.<br />

<br />
I tank with my BOW over my BF/BOC.I have accumulated 2h swing aa that I think helps a lot to make the BOW a reasonable choice.I don't feel that my aggro over time is better with the BOW.It's close enough that luck could make either setup stronger round to round.I think my necro friends prefer the BF/BOC ,however.They do seem to get summoned marginally less with that combo.I prefer the BOW for fast raid mez breaks and the little defensive advantage it gives me.I swear I die less using the BOW(parse people shoot me now) and I have good  aggro with it compared to any tanks I play.I aggonized over which setup to use since I got the BOW hehe.They're close.<br />
<br />
High dps 2 handers(read - not usually a GSOT relatively) can pull aggro early,but, in my experience it's the procs that carry it over time.Just imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Eoden, that was just sort of information i needed to back up my &quot;gut feeling&quot;.  This also would explain why i can always hold aggro through a quick tash/slow with both my slow-ass, gimpy dps Plankton laced greatsword (dps is not as good as my duel wield setup 80%+ of the time), and my greatstaff of thunder, with 0 procs where i can never hold aggro through a quick tash/slow with my duel wield when i get no procs.<br />
<br />
i'm sure the numbers are not entirely correct, as i dont think the GSoT could generate that much hate per minute, but <br />
<br />
if i had to choose btw duel wield and a 2hander of comparable stature for tanking, i would choose the 2hander any day of the week barring serious differences concerning available procs.<br />
<br />
I still hold to the 3 procs &gt; 2, but the extra offhand proc isnt reliable in and of itself to warrant losing the superior non-proc aggro you'd find on the GSoT.  This is my opinion and mine only though.  Others may share it, but i know that many would disagree because the numbers point in a different direction.  <br />
<br />
If the rumors are true in that augments will be not only removable but reusable, i would just anger3 the stick and bag the DW combo.  1 anger 3 would be more useful on the staff in my opinion.  When you get a weapon in the next &quot;tier&quot; of aggro generation, remove the augment and offhand a CHoS.  if you have the guts to grind out another anger3 or a yak proc right now though, you will probably have better luck with duel aggro auged duel wield.<br />
<br />
EDIT-<br />
and to gunnar:  in my opinion the GSoT is to the droga combo as a BoWar is to a BF/BoC combo.  the latter will produce far more aggro in long fights and with good luck on procs, but the BoWar will produce reliable aggro that can't be robbed from you by a shitty RNG run.  In both cases the duel wield setup provides more of everything but DPS aggro and armor class, but in both cases the 2handers provide a more solid, stable kind of aggro.  Granted, the difference isnt nearly the same as BoW dps &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BF/BoC ... but you have the same general idea goin on.  You yourself said that the BoWar aggro was a step back from your combo back in the day when you were thinking about it and then finally bid on it.  What did it for you?  Why do you like it so much?  I'm sure in the end it's a combination of +ac, less ripostes, but most of all the dps aggro is nicer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did use a GSOT and the droga combo for quite awhile and I believe unauged without wa the advantage went to dualwield.With augs and wa a dualwield combo becomes stronger in contrast to a 2hander similiarily supported so the advantage would be magnified.But this is splitting hairs.All these weapons are  good aggro and can be used to tank well given their content.<br />
<br />
The thing is DPS &lt; aggro procs.At 65 buffed ,procs exert a stronger influence on aggro than dps no contest.DPS is relavent.However, it takes a big advantage in dps to show good aggro results.Obviously there are people all over my mobs making my dps look like....erm pewp.People who draw aggro off me arn't usually melee dps even though there dps far out weighs mine.I had to tank with dps weapons on Stromm for a long time ...it sucked.The BOW  is reasonably fast with a wicked ratio comparatively producing high threat aggro(just imho) so it does well.However,without the proc It'd only be good for assist.I don't parse I just like stuff to hit me.So I watch in game results(however skewed to perspective that may be) and read the opinions of greater minds here and compare.<br />
<br />
The GSOT without it's proc is firewood imo.My wife doesn't get slow aggro anymore whatever I use unless I'm slacking or tanking 3+ mobs.Slow aggro is not a good measuring stick for an aggro weapon.When I tanked on raids the droga combo held aggro better for me than the GSOT.Both will work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a nice theory Eoden, but yeah, as Gunnar says, it doesn't hold up, because the Blade of War is just gonna mulch BF/BoC on dps, and as I've stated before, Droga weapons = GSoT more or less depending on AA's.  It's apples and oranges.  I won't argue that extreme cases of DPS differences are going to see aggro results going the other way, but that's not the argument being made here, and it doesn't hold up. <br />
<br />
And jesus christ, what the fuck is this?<br />
<br />
assuming you dont have WA5 and you dont have duel anger3 augs to put on weapons, GSoT + anger3 will be more aggro always. in the long run the duel wield may catch up on procs, but GSoT holds aggro fairly well with no procs, whereas your aggro with duel wield is 100% dependant on getting that lucky proc.&quot;<br />
<br />
So if you augment your greatstaff it's 4 procs is gonna be more than 5 on dual wield?  YOU'RE STILL NOT GETTING IT.  LESS PROCS = LESS AGGRO WHEN SIMILAR DPS.  Christ, It's not a difficult concept, how can you possibly be having so many issues with this?  The dual wield was superior before LDoN, the dual wield was superior before GoD AA's, AND IT IS SUPERIOR NOW.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, aggro weapons FOR A LONG TIME were things like the Jade Mace, the Lamentation and the Seb Dirk.  Saying that dual wield is completely reliant on procs is bullshit as well, and it's just spinning current events to meet your argument's flaws.  Dual wield is no more or less reliant on procs than 2h, and never will be.  If you're pumping out damage, you're causing aggro.  The greatstaff of thunder puts out nearly the same DPS as the droga weapons.  Show me a parse where it doesn't and you *might* have a leg to stand on, but until then, it's just hot air.</div></div><hr />

Yeah right. GSoT has about the SAME agro as a DBotW. SUUUUUUUURE it does.

With all due respect I think the &quot;potential agro&quot; THEORY is unproven.  I raise this point every time people start stating it as fact.  I also challenge the premise for his formula as it is not based on anything empiric I've seen.<br />

Exactly.  Its not that dps doesn't generate agro but does it generate the SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIATING agro from other classes that we rely on to tank?  In my opinion it doesn't lending the study to the dustbin of irrelevance for warrior purposes. Proc agro is the significant differentiating agro.<br />
<br />
GSoT or Droga doesnt matter...both can/will get the job done.<br />
<br />
or as Haass said<br />
<br />
 Droga weapons = GSoT more or less depending on AA's. It's apples and oranges <br />
<br />
With proc rates averaging out (due to scaling of procs over time with delay)...again over time you should see about the same proc agro. As the delta in dps agro is fairly insignificant that = a WASH FOR AGRO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually not quite what I was trying to say.  Apples and oranges refers to comparing Blade of War vs Bloodfrenzy/Blade of Carnage against Greastaff vs Droga weapons.  <br />
<br />
The DPS is a wash, but the aggro difference from procs is going to increase linearly in favor of dual wielding.  That's not to say that the greatstaff of thunder can't get the job done, but it's false to say that it's better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh.<br />
I'll take a go at this.<br />
First, since Flair has posted some doubts about the potential dps theory, let's be precise about what it depends on.<br />
1. the many many tests using different weapons posted in the library thread referenced by E. above; tests showed that different weapons turned mobs based on number of swings taken at mob (some sort of potential dps). Different weapons took a different number of swings to turn the mob (duh) but each weapon turned the mob regularly on the same number of swings. The rest of the thread consists of people trying to reverse engineer the math formulas that would explain why weapon X always turned the mob in Y swings given an initial aggro of Z.<br />
2. Lucy's damage bonus chart for 1H and 2H weapons.<br />
<br />
Read the library thread carefully, keeping in mind that the formulas evolve throughout the thread and they never get &quot;perfect.&quot; What you'll see is that the final formulas derived there are approximations. The &quot;best&quot; formulas developed in the thread predict that the weapons will turn the mob about 6% faster than the weapons actually did. But the error seemed to apply both to 1h combinations and 2-handers.<br />
<br />
They do not attempt to assess hate from proc. This is NOT a design flaw in the tests; they used non-proc weapons to eliminate a variable that they were not testing. However, we know that proc hate is significant, and the higher the level of the warrior (DEX &amp; AAs) the higher the percentage of his total hate will be coming from procs and thus the less important potential dps will be in his ability to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
So, those are the limitations of the derived formulas, and in and of themselves they are such powerful limitations that I'm tempted to stop right here. But my dander is up. Even given these limitations, the formulas, properly applied, have something to tell us about this question.<br />
<br />
The best-guess formulas presented in the thread are:<br />
1. For 1h weapon in the mainhand: (weapon damage + 1h bonus)/weapon delay.<br />
<br />
2. For 1h weapon offhanded: weapon damage/delay.<br />
<br />
3. For 2H weapons: (weapon damage + 2H damage bonus + 1)/weapon delay.<br />
<br />
The weapons we are considering (pause a moment and reflect that we, and not the original poster of this thread, brought up the Droga weapons, by the way):<br />
<br />
CHoS: 13/20<br />
<br />
SotB: 12/19<br />
<br />
GSoT: 31/30<br />
<br />
Now, if you are following me, you should immediately suspect that on a potential dps basis, the SotB is the best weapon to use in the mainhand, and the CHoS is the best weapon to use in the offhand, and you are correct, so I won't bother to type out the math for using the CHoS in the mainhand.<br />
<br />
The 2 one-handers for a 65 warrior yield:<br />
Mainhand: (12+13)/19 = 1.3157894.<br />
Offhand: 13/20 = 0.65<br />
Total: 1.96578<br />
<br />
The GSoT yields:<br />
(31 + 36 + 1)/30 = 2.266666666666<br />
<br />
BUT ALL YOU 2H FANS HOLD YOUR HORSES A MINUTE.<br />
<br />
No, I am not going to say that the 1H guys have been arguing all along that proc aggro is so large that it exceeds the difference between the potential dps aggro of the GSoT and the 1h set up, though that's what they have argued, and nothing here shows they are wrong.<br />
<br />
What I'm going to say is that the potential dps advantage of the GSoT does not hold true for the 56 Warriors out there. <br />
<br />
Yep, that's right: the increase in the damage bonus on 2H weapons from lvl 56 to lvl 65 is so huge relative to the increase in the 1h damage bonus, that the aggro advantage changes, giving the two 1handers a tiny tiny advantage for the 56 WAR.<br />
<br />
Here's the math for the 56 WAR:<br />
Mainhand yields: (12 + 10)/19 = 1.1578947<br />
Offhand yields 13/20 = 0.65<br />
Total yield 1H set up: 1.8078947<br />
<br />
Yield GSoT:<br />
(31 + 22 + 1)/30 = 1.8<br />
<br />
Now let me be clear: on a dps basis, these weapons are very close to being a wash, especially for the 56 WAR (infact, if the 56 WAR mainhands the CHoS, then he'll cut his potential dps aggro enough that the GSoT will yield more potential dps aggro). For the 65 warrior nowadays, these numbers are also trivial, because so much better weapon combinations are apt to be used by at least one other warrior in a raid, and because anger augs have further advantaged a 1H set up. You're just apt to have better options than the GSoT by the time you have been 65 for a while.<br />
<br />
Retards, overpulls, lag, your own errors, and that most evil of all gods (the RNG) will get people killed more often than any difference in these weapons on a potential dps basis.<br />
<br />
But something else: it's easy to forget what an enormous jump in scale a 65 WAR with max DEX and WA AAs has over a 56 WAR in the proc department. Really, the large-race 56 war's unbuffed DEX is apt to be hovering around 100 unless he's  twinked, and in either case he'll have no offensive AAs. Anyway, his DEX ain't gonna be 305, that's for sure. And he's not going to be faced with a choice of slapping Anger III two 1h weapons or just putting one Anger 3 on a 2-hander, because he doesn't have enough LDON points to buy 2 Anger 3s. He simply can't: if he had that many points, he wouldn't be lvl 56 any more unless he's spent an unusually high percentage of his time jumping off high places to delevel himself.<br />
<br />
I guess my main point here, given the original post, is that if you are lvl 56, and you can afford a GSoT but not the Droga weapons, you ain't gimped, and if your 1handers are significantly less effective than the Droga weapons, the GSoT is your very very good friend. You are a warrior and you can and will hold aggro with this this weapon if you know how to play your class and the people you are grouped with are not complete retards with a death wish.<br />
yeah, repeat after me: I am a warrior and I can and will hold aggro with this weapon if I know how to play my class and the people I am grouped with are not complete retards with a death wish.<br />
If you can afford the Droga weapons, though, they ain't a waste of plat at lvl 56, and I believe that given augs and increases in your DEX, they'll be more useful the bigger you get (with situational exceptions concerning your hitpoints vs. riposting mobs).<br />
If I had the Droga weapons and enough points for an Anger3 or two Anger 2s, I'm prety sure I'd get the Anger 3 and put it on the SotB. Anger 3 because it's the best aggro going in an aug, and the SotB because it's stun works on higher level mobs than the CHoS, so it's likely that you would mainhand it longer than the CHoS even if you completely discount potential dps aggro advantage.<br />
<br />
Somebody please shoot me if I post on this issue again.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh, some stupid error. Original post I accidentally said that GSoT gets the advantage for the 56 WAR, but meant to say (as the math does) that the two 1H weapons get the tin tiny advantage. Now shoot me please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brabble hit the nail on the head IMO. At level 56 I compared CHoS + SotB vs. GSoT with another warrior in a POV xp group. Neither one of us took aggro from the other without taunting, whichever combo we used. Personally I thought the GSoT looked dumber than the droga combo, so I never used it much. <br />
<br />
In answer to the original question. I think it's pretty clear that an augged GSoT is is significantly inferior to an augged &quot;2 hand combo&quot;, provided the 2hand combo has a innate aggro procs and the same augs. You will just proc more, plain and simple, and procs ARE the lions share of the hate if you use the formula's from the thread for swing aggro ( (damage bonus + 11 * RND(damage / 10)) / effective delay ). I have no idea where you guys are getting (damage * modifier + damage bonus) from. <br />
<br />
All that being said, an augged GSoT will hold aggro just fine, and given that you should be able to remove the augment later, it's a pretty safe, low-cost choice.<br />
<br />
Fact is, a quick finger on your taunt button will make up for most aggro deficiencies in an xp group pretty reliably anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;So if you augment your greatstaff it's 4 procs is gonna be more than 5 on dual wield? YOU'RE STILL NOT GETTING IT. LESS PROCS = LESS AGGRO WHEN SIMILAR DPS. Christ, It's not a difficult concept, how can you possibly be having so many issues with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
i'll say it for the umpteenth time haass ... the issue for me was never which is stronger assuming i get my procs ... the issue was which was going to be more reliable when procs are slim.  either works just fucking peachy if you get the assumed proc rate every single fight, but any warrior knows this isnt always the case.  the question is, can anyone put forth an valid way of determining whether or not the GSoT can produce more dps aggro than the duel wield combo?<br />
<br />
the stick always held more reliable aggro for me as that offhand proc only ever went of once ever 5-6 fights sub 65 with no WA.  the rest of the time i was working primarily with primary hand only procs and whatever dps aggro i was putting out.<br />
<br />
I'll stand by the stick if youre only going to grind out 1 aug, but if youre willing to go with 2 then go with the duel wield.  Either will get the job done, i'm just telling you which one was more solid for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brabble's numbers above are pretty spot on with the best &quot;research&quot; we have atm.<br />
<br />
Here's the math for the 56 WAR:<br />
Total yield 1H set up: 1.8078947 hate / sec<br />
Yield GSoT: (31 + 22 + 1)/30 = 1.8 hate / sec<br />
<br />
Personally, my gut, like your's, tells me that 2handers do a bit better for swing aggro than belied by those numbers. Maybe a couple of lucky early double attacks or something contribute to it, but I know that without procs I feel a lot safer with a 2hander than a droga combo. I know I can do dang well in an XP group with my gso4w+lifetap, but that ain't no GSoT, and I'm level 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would dare to say that you will double attack with a 2hander with a much greater frequency than quad with duel wield.  you simply have less skill checks to go through.  IF you get a successful duel wield you still have to go through a separate double attack check for the offhand.</div></div><hr />

Now the first total would be higher based on dps aggro alone if i had calculated it with GBoS in primary and BoC secondary .... now answer me this .. if the above is correct, why can i hold aggro through a fast tash/slow (i get 3 seconds before tash on each), with 0 procs with the inferior 2hander when i can hold aggro 0% of the time through the duel wield?  Quick answer= this 2hander is producing more aggro with inferior dps.  Why does it work this way, because logic points in one way while personal testing and my gut feeling points in another way?  I have no bloody clue .. but it does.   If you dont like it then go test it please, because i've spent about 3 or 4 hours testing this out in both xp groups and with some of my friends within guild.<br />
<br />
Of couse, though, once the first proc comes out of my duel wield setup it simply blows the PLG out of the water.  Procs &gt; DPS for aggro ... but i know that from lvs 60-65 when i was not running at 305 dexterity, that single offhand proc (which is very easily distinguished in the droga combo) would not reliably let me hold aggro.  when it went off my aggro was much stronger, but most fights it didnt, and in certain groups with decent rogs and casters i would have to swap out to the stick to hold aggro.</div></div><hr />

Now you are saying that the potential DPS theory wrong according to your observations? I have the same 1h weapon combo you have, and I have fast 2her (which you suggest has much more DPS agro).

delay is under 28 ... which means youre getting shit-all for dmg bonus and might as well be using a souped up 1hander with nothing in the offhand.  i'm only telling you  that my tests and experiences tell me otherwise, which means that your the theory may need to be revised when calculating aggro generated by dps.  all i know is one lets me hold aggo with no procs 100% of the time while the other one doesnt.  it's that simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hell it's how we hold aggro off people who do more dps than us (which is everyone practically).<br />
<br />
dps aggro is an important factor, though, especially when your working with the regular old proc rate and sub 305 dexterity.  The GSoT was my steady mule and always reliable in xp groups.  The duel wield had the potential to hold aggro much better than the GSoT but often did not because that offhand proc wasnt very common.<br />
The entire PLG vs my aggro setup was to show that yes good 2handers will produce a good bit more dps aggro than comparable duel wield setups.  i never lose aggro on a tash/slow using my yak + GSoFW, whereas i will lose aggro now and then when unlucky on procs with my duel wield setup.  In the longrun, though i lose aggro with the GSoFW to a strong wizard/rog/mage/necro almost every time, whereas in the long run i rarely lose aggro with the duel wield setup thanks to the wonderful flow of procs.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying a PLG will outaggro a BoC/GBoS or that everyone should ditch their duel wield for a proccing 2hander.  With WA5 and ldon procs duel wield shines once again over 2handers.  Without WA5 and ldon procs, though, you fall back into the old debate of BoWar vs BF/BoC ... which is better??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use the CHoS/SotB for assured aggro.  If you're using weapons like these you're probably exping in BoT or PoV, and normally groups take so long to kill those mobs that you'll just come out ahead using duel wield.. eventually it is going to proc.  More chances to proc = more potential aggro.<br />

And yes, the BoW fucking owns the BF/BoC.  I have all 3 anger3 aug'd.  BoW is great &quot;DPS aggro&quot;  and until someone shows me hard evidence that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, I'll keep thinking that.  I can slow mobs with my shaman almost immediately after I engage them, and never pull aggro from the BoW unless slow is resisted, and even then its a 75/25 chance that I'll lose aggro.  The BF/BoC is a whole different story.  For some unknown reason I was using my DW set up in KT and was fighting one of those nasty kyv fuckers, So I cycle my hotkeys and slow immediately w/o thinking.. BAM dead shaman.

The equations do produce quantities, and quanities always look real and sort of official even when they aren't, heh. Thus, quatification ought always be squinted at.<br />
Another thing you should squint at: my rhetorical strategies. I try to look reasonable, logical, careful. I would try to look this way if I knew what I were talking about. But I would also try to look this way if I were talking out my ass, too.<br />
Look, the base data on those tests looks good to me. The effort to generate a set of predictive formulas is impressive.<br />
The testers themselves discuss the fact that the formulas do not exactly predict the observed behavior of mobs and weapons (the 5-6% difference thingy). Late in the thread, one poster even worries about comparability in real-world time between the 2h and 1h formulas.<br />
The testers do make sure that different weapons are tested by the same characters, but I think all of them were level 65, so no attempt was made to check what happens to these weapons at different damage bonus levels either.<br />
But, hmmm. A theory that a 2h weapon out-aggros a 1h set up on this level necessarily depends on the idea that the 2H set up out aggros the 1h set up through the agency of dps. So, I wanted to see what this set of formulas said about dps.<br />
I'd call it a theory if you want: this particular theory suggests the dps difference is not, on the surface, huge. It says that what difference is there is more present for lvl 65 characters than for lvl 56 characters, but it says nothing abuot whether this difference scales as fast as the ability of lvl 65 characters to proc more often and to have access to higher-aggro procs. <br />
2H aggro might be greater until the 1h set up procs, but the longer the fight and the higher the warrior's DEX and AAs, the smoother the proc aggro and the more stable the 2 1handers are going to be: they will catch the 2hander faster and faster and get farther and farther ahead.<br />
If I had another theory that yielded different results and was backed by hours of testing, I'd look at it. I don't though.<br />
Now shoot me again.</div></div><hr />

At this point, it would be interesting to know if one combo wins after a long while in and of itself.<br />
<br />
The velium gemmed long sword is a high dps, no proc 1-hander, although maybe it's more expensive than you want to spend. I think theres a 1hand hammer in the same line, too. Heck, going old school with a jade mace and lamentation would probably work  too. <br />
<br />
Ideally, the 1-hander combo and 2hander will have the same &quot;calculated hate per second&quot; number though, so we don't have to introduce another complication to the calculation.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a better method of testing &quot;early aggro&quot;? It would seem that pulling with an sk for the fixed hate and measuring the procs / swings to pull aggro off like was done in the original test is about as good as you can get.<br />
<br />
I guess another way to do it would be to pull with an arrow, start fighting, and then try to pull aggro OFF the warrior using something like slow. See if the number of swings or seconds required to keep aggro from getting pulled off is the same, and how many it is. It would be tougher to get the timing right, but it would be the exact analogue to what everybody's gut is telling them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually, it occurs to me that a very interesting comparison would be the new droppable dps king, the velium gemmed greatsword, vs a pair of the velium gemmed 1-handers. I'm guessing SOE designed them to be roughly equivalent, and they're certainly from the same era with no procs. I haven't seen them parsed side by side, so that would be interested, too.<br />

No you won't.  I've owned both since I was level 58 and they're the best aggro 1handers and 2handers I have.  I spent alot of time trying both in various situations and the dual wield combo has always been more aggro for me  (That's with no offensive AA's yet).   Now I'd like someone to explain to me why my experiences and &quot;gut feeling&quot; after 7 levels and 65aa's worth of using both of these weapons is that the droga combo owns the gsot since it is the exact opposite of apolyons experiences and &quot;gut feeling&quot;.  After I got 65 and got enough ldon points for anger augs I aug'd the dual wield combo without hesitation (both with anger II, still kicking myself for not just A3 auging one of the other).  If I had A3 on all 3 of them I'd still probably only break out the staff on mobs that mitigate slow and hit hard enough for me to want to even out the damage spikes from riposte. <br />

To answer the original poster:  Particularly at your level, the droga combo is better.  In my experience at any level the droga combo is more useful in more situations than the GSoT, particularly if you anger aug both of the droga weapons.  Ultimately either will work, and since I don't know that I'll see better I'm planning to put A3 on all of them (especially since the rumor that they'll be removable soon so I wont be wasting them if I do get an upgrade).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used a 10/18 sword off the general in echo in main till I got a GSOT.That thing was godly in comparison.Anyone who says it can't be used well to tank at it's intended content level is wrong,confused exagerating etc.Of course if you're dex is 100, life is gonna be tough no matter what you're wielding.I farmed the Droga weapons soon after they came out and promptly bagged the gsot.The CHOS alone was great and aggro was better for me with the dualwield set-up.Auged, the differance will be greater and upgrades often come one hand at a time.<br />
<br />
When I was using these weapons I played about 50pct of my xp time with a shammy...my wife.She was new to eq then and I called the slows,debuffs,heals,etc.On Stromm our gear was definately lacking and she ended up hitting 65 with a total of 25 defense.All of her xp time was with me duoing at this point.The GSOT gave me no appreciable advantage over the Droga combo holding slow aggro.The longer the Droga combo was equipped the more likely i was to proc and that was that.I never went back to the GSOT,although, the differance between those setups was minute compared to what I had before.I quested a lot of weapons 1-60 on Stromm and these were significantly better.<br />
<br />
The BOW is not a lock.With augs I believe the BF/BOC combo will often out aggro it,but, it's close.</div></div><hr />

I know it is hard for you to understand, but there are other warriors who have possessed the VERY SAME combo of weapons we are talking about. Some of us had those weapons long before the masses did and we even took a little time trying them out to see which worked best. &lt;GASP&gt; Maybe you didn't notice that the majority of people calling bullshit are doing so from personal experience.

i'll still hold to my experiences and tests which yield comparable 2handers to be more solid aggro than their duel wield counterparts when procs arent part of the equation.  the game has changed since the first few expansions, and 2handers vs duel wield dont work quite the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh. Let's try this another way.<br />
What elements of this problem do we agree on, and for which do we have shared and certain knowledge.<br />
I imagine that:<br />
1. We agree on the proc rates for all three weapons.<br />
2. We know approximately what hate each proc generates<br />
3. We know that over a long period of time, the proc hate of the 1handers &gt; than the proc rate of the GSoT<br />
3. We should agree that, no matter what we think about the various estimated potential dps fomulas, the testing that Brodda and others did clearly shows that weapons generate a set amount of hate per swing based not on actual damage, but potential damage.<br />
4. We know the damage and delay of these weapons.<br />
5. We should be able to figure out how many swings a given warrior would take with each weapon combination over a given period of time.<br />
<br />
What we can't seem to agree on is the potential hate generated per second by the &quot;potential dps&quot; element of these weapons.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at is this; There are two possibilities for any given warrior:<br />
1. The non-proc hate per unit of time of the GSoT &gt; the non-proc hate per unit of time of the SotB + CHoS.<br />
2. The non-roc hate per unit of time of the SotB + CHoS &gt; the non-proc hate per unit of time of the GSoT.<br />
<br />
If #2 is the case, then the two 1-handers exceed the hate generation of the GSoT by every measure, and would always be better.<br />
<br />
If #1 is the case, then we need to know the difference in dps hate generated per minute by each weapon set. Then we'd have a known dps hate advantage of the GSoT. We ought to be able to figure out the &quot;average&quot; proc hate advantage per minute of the 1-hand combination. At some point, even if the dps of the GSoT is higher, the 1-handers' procs will overtake the hate of the GSoT.<br />
<br />
The first question becomes when that occurs.<br />
<br />
I think it makes sense to look at the average of the proc hate, even given the streakiness of the RNG, because the streakiness is a different animal than the average: the average will always be true; streakiness is a risk factor.<br />
<br />
The second question is a bit squishy, but the answer has dramatic in-game consequences: how often does the dps advantage of the GSoT (again, assuming it has an advantage) -- how often does that advantage matter? <br />
The only time the GSoT's (theoretical) potential dps hate advantage really matters is when someone else in the group exceeds the 1-hand hate by less than the amount of the dps hate that the GSoT has generated.<br />
Here's a theoretical example: 10 seconds into the fight, neither weapon set has proc'd yet. The 1-handers have generated X dps hate. The GSoT has generated, say, X + 10 dps hate. Now, if a caster lands a spell at this point that generates X + 100 hate, then BOTH warriors will lose aggro. If the spell hate is &lt;X, neither warrior will lose aggro. The only time a GSoT warrior will enjoy a practical aggro advantage is when a spell lands that generates hate somewhere between X and X + 10.<br />
<br />
The smaller the GSoT's dps advantage, the less often that advantage will have a practical effect before the proc advantage of the 1-handers starts adding hate in, say, 450-unit chunks.</div></div><hr />

I think that's about as concise as it's gonna be in explaining the situation, we just have someone who never loses aggro with a non proc weapon.  He's teh man you know, and 2h always works for him, even if it doesn't have a proc.  That's the real problem here...the real world physics don't work when you're superman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, there is a minor problem I have with your post, Brabble. <br />
<br />
  It's somewhat over semantics. DPS aggro isn't exactly accurate. There seems to be an aggro bonus based on the damage bonus of the weapon. This means that a weapon that might actually perform better via DPS, such as an Ornate Greatblade might perform worse for aggro than a slower weapon with a higher damage bonus. I don't know exactly which situations this might occur, and I feel it's easiest to look at a 2 handed weapon comparison for this example. Also, attack affects DPS differently for different delay, but doesn't affect aggro at all. Perhaps we should refer to this concept as the aggro per swing, rather than the DPS aggro.<br />
<br />
  As a side point, and to bring this topic to a much broader goal, is there ever a situation where a proc-less weapon could perform better than aggro proccing ones? This seems to be the case to me, because I would imagine that 2 gnoll hide lariats would lose out to most higher weapons, even the proc-less ones. Is there a weapon extent that would beat the droga DW setup without procs?<br />
<br />
  One last thing. Could a weapon like a Plankton Laced Greatsword beat out the aggro from an early slow? In other words, could the hate per swing high enough for it to be worth equipping until slow for the absolute guarantee of high aggro, then switching in a higher hate over time setup? If for this weapon the answer is no, is there a weapon where it could hold true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fitemore,<br />
Aye, there's a language problem involving capturing the elements you describe in a term than doesn't take a line-and-a-half to type.<br />
I got lazy typing; what I mean by dps aggro is some value of hate generated by the non-proc aspects of a given weapon set swung by a given warrior. Is damage bonus in there somewhere? I'd be stunned if it weren't. But, as I said, there is disagreement over what the fomula is and how the parts are mathematically related, so I was trying to see what we knew without having that exact formula.<br />
Some quantity, call it a Brodda value, exists for the non-proc hate generated per swing by each given weapon for each given warrior. One of my points in an earlier post was that hate varies by the level of warrior precisely because of the damage bonus, and that the damage bonus for 2handers scales faster than for 1-handers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the issue of rhetoric, you'll note that my conclusion in the post above would look much better for the GSoT camp if I had simply reversed the way i said it: &quot;The  greater the GSoT's dps advantage, the more often it will have a practical effect before the proc advantage of the 1-handers starts adding hate....&quot;<br />
<br />
So, okay, where are we? I think I'd rather use the Droga combo. I'd look at any reasoning that says otherwise, though. And I still say that at the level these weapons become usable, a warrior who can get a GSoT but not the Droga weapons is not gimped. The price on the GSoT really levels the playing field for broke warriors, even if it's not better than the Droga set. At the level the GSoT becomes equipable, I'd have complete confidence in my ability to hold aggro with it in a normal experience group. Are there weapons that would be better? Uh, yeah. Are my casters going to die because I'm using a GSoT? Hell no.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think we might have frightened the original poster away, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
look at my magelo ... look at the combo that i use.  my aggro setup is EB/Stun with duel anger3.  when fucking around with a new toy i spent a good bit of time camping i noticed that i never lost aggro ON A SLOW (albeit from a shaman or a chanter).  Other than the early slow, its absolute shit for aggro (especially over time and against high dps) and i've never claimed it otherwise.   It's the same thing with my greatstaff of the four winds.  Without a proc, it will consistently hold aggro very strongly through a slow.  The only reason i brought up the PLG is because the equations people brought up didnt match up with the PLG whereas dps aggro calculated would have matched up with the GSoFW in beating my duel wield combo. I'd tell you to go test it yourself haas, but i doubt you can even access the zone where it drops.<br />
<br />
Without procs, the PoS 75/65 consistently holds aggro better than the 15/20 mainhand and 14/18 offhand.  That is the only point i'm trying to make heh ... not that i never lose aggro with a 2hander or that duel wield sucks.   i think you've lost sight of where the discussion even went in your blind tirade to prove tha duel wield is the answer to every question pertaining to aggro.<br />
<br />
To clarify: the PLG is only my toy.  I dont tank with it in xp groups or on raids as the only thing i ever noticed it was good for other than jousting was the fact that it could hold aggro through a fast tash/slow.  If i wanted to do that i could simply whip out my yak staff as its much nicer dps with a set of procs on it (even though one is only dd).  Duel wield is my work horse for now, and will remain so till i can pick up a BoWar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe killings more fun,gawd why am I here again.I tend to go with the dps potential threat aggro thing.I view weapons with very good ratios(2-handers I prefer over 28 dly-but I haven't really tested that) to inherantly possess more non proc aggro PER SWING.That seems pretty obvious and I think some what accepted.However,when I was a young warrior I preffered fast weapons with worse ratios to the 2-handers over time ,generally.Yeah ,beneath level 65 damage bonus,dualwield checks and alot more will skew the comparison out of wack for us.So my take on the dps threat aggro thing runs like this:<br />
<br />
1) When you engage everyone's swinging for the first time.So a high threat weapon will have an advantage in the opening rounds dps /aggro wise.<br />
<br />
a. this advantage is usually not very large and can be overcome  by position, the ma getting attack on a hair faster, etc.<br />
<br />
b.I agree that a BOW and quite possibly a PLG would be more likely to hold aggro through a slow.The BOW definately holds aggro through my wife's slow np with dps alone.She does have the subtlety aa btw.<br />
<br />
c.This kind of aggro is very weak compared to proc aggro and won't hold your mob in an ep group when the dps gets on it.Sure if you swapped in a PLG you might have a little better luck holding aggro through slow(my wife doesn't get much aggro with my BF/BOC combo either),but,thats a round or two with no chance to proc.Not worth the trade off imo.<br />
<br />
d.I agree with the many posters who have found that higher threat weapons like the GSO4W,BOW,SEWS etc.are more consistent with aggro in the opening rounds.However,again the dps aggro advantage on these weapons is small compared to proc aggro.Something like an a3 GSO4W is going to lose advantage  to auged eb weapons very quickly.That doesn't mean you can't tank with them.People tanked with single proc eb weapons a long time.It just means a 2nd hate proc in the main hand &gt; dps aggro advantage past the first couple rounds.<br />
<br />
2)The origional question involved the GSOT i believe.<br />
<br />
a.The dps advantage of the GSOT over the droga combo is too small to be significant imo.It does not relate well to comparisons involving BOW's and PLG's.Imo using examples of those weapons having dps aggro advantages over thier contempory 1 handers is misleading.<br />
<br />
b.The GSOT is a valid aggro weapon that will serve almost any warrior well until he can get better.It's also usually very cheap.The droga combo would serve the origional poster better if he wants to invest in auging imho.A3 the CHOS if you want to improve aggro and upgrades are distant.</div></div><hr />
