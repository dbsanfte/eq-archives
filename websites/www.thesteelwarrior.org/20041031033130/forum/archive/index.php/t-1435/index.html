<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well, i like to farm zones for cash, but the most i get is 2p a mob.<br />
<br />
this plain SUCKS if i ever want some heraldric, now ive had given up farming a long time ago (around 40) and just started doing casinos, (im making money most of the time but still not any killing involved :( ) <br />
<br />
what i want to know is what mobs/zones could a 54 warrior farm in with 5k hps because id rather kill for cash (choose the right class to kill, but not to farm huh:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have 5khp at lvl 54 I would concern myself with leveling up...<br />
<br />
you obivuosly are not hurting too much for gear if you have that amount of hp at that lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Casinos are gay and you should be banned from this site for running them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Casinos are gay<br />
<br />
/AGREE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slashurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Casinos are gay and you should be banned from this site for running them.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would like to third that motion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">erm, why is that? the rules are in english, a gm told me its fine as long as the rules are clear and i pay out to winners, the randoms arnt fixed if you dont like them because you loose then its your problem dont go nuts over it. if its because of the spam i do it in the back of the zone and no one hears it, i STICK to auctions so i dont see the problem with it. the 5k hp is because i get virtue and HoS before i go anywere(im a crack fiend for hp buffs) unbuffed im only 2605 which is crap at my level. <br />
<br />
anyway, if you cant help someone then dont turn around and insult them this isnt a damn flame board now is it? can we stick to the topic please (if you would have, you may have noticed i DONT like doing casinos)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i mean, really if you want to moan and complain about loosing money to casinos go here<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Casinos take advantage of peoples' greed and ignorance, with your greed and knowledge, and legal or not, they're gay and an illegitimate way of funding your adventuring in Everquest.   <br />

Just because you have the right to do something doesn't make it right to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sad part is them waitresses would IRL be 40+ year old truck drivers named bubba or cooter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">People hate casino's because every f'n gathering zone you goto now has ooc and shout spam by like 5 idiots doing this shit. Having to ignore said idiots or turn off ooc  / shout becomes a burden that we shouldn't have to deal with. Make sense now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well, i stick to auctions, dont like auctions leave the frickin bazaar, i do my rolls in the horse area, unless you hang out around the horses all day you wont get spammed with my rolls. dont like me at all? ignore my mule troll i dont care. <br />
<br />
gambling is not immoral Imho because people do it for fun, and the fact that the random is out of a 100 instead of a 1000 like some people, it becomes easy to know your odds of winning, i also dont have a min bet, so people can do it FOR fun at their leasure. anyways this thread wasnt ment to be a bitch fest on casino's or what ever else hair you have in your ass, its about were warriors can farm for cash <br />
<br />
(you think im BSing? to date ive only made 300p from my casino, i keep it as fair as possible with out me going bankrupt, i only get to keep 20% of all the money that i get from it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well thats about what I had at 54 so I must really suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, what really sucks is i cant use any god alined gear, so everything i buy is eather 2k, or i have to pay 30k because there is no inbetween armor for a godless warrior ( i know this is a blunt and exadrated point, but its almost that bad ). <br />
<br />
im asking because i only have 800p right now and the only BP that i can use thats any better is 40k, my current BP is worth 3k atm so i basicly have to come up with 37kp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Casino's are annoying.  If you use auctions in the bazaar for it then it is twice as annoying.  Most people come to the bazaar to BUY gear.  What do people sell gear in?  /gasp, the auction channel.  It is very annoying when you have to scroll back to catch the auction you want because 4 tards are spamming a channel with casino spam.  IMO, they should make a new channel for auctions so I can ignore them without actually missing something I want to hear.  If you are caught using any channel outside the new one your account should be banned.  That way people can have the gay casinos and most people won't be subjected to the spam unless they CHOOSE to be without sacrificing something else.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to farm money, I would highly suggest getting out of the bazaar and making friends with a healer and killing hill giants, seafury cyclops, or hunting in SEB.  All of these drop very nice cash loot and will net you a little to decent exp.  Solo'ing almost anything for cash with your gear will take for ever and clog up your inventory with bandages unless you have a clicky BP which I am assuming you do not.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Another option I would highly recommend for you would be starting over as an Ogre worshipping Rallos Zek.  That way you can get all the &quot;LEET&quot; gear without leaving the bazaar.  This one move should forever solve all your gear dilemnas and with that gear you should be able to solo back to lvl 54 within a month or so and be lightyears ahead of where you are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At 54 you should be able to kill the giants in Frontier Mts pretty easily.  They drop nice cash and regularly drop crappy weapons and such that sell to vendors for 50-100pp.  You might even get lucky and get a forest loop or something to sell.  Really though farming cash sucks as a solo warrior, you are better off grouping up for xp in sebilis or somewhere that gems and good loots drop</div></div><hr />
