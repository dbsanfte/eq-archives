<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very true, a well played warrior at this point in the development is simply a sight to behold. They truely are the best at what they do. <br />
<br />
I'd like ot note that thats just from a min/max standpoint and the fact that warriors have talents, which many classes still lack. I read a dev post where his said something along the lines that people will really need to get out of there EQ mindsets. The warrior is awesome because he has so many tools at his disposal to do his main functions, damage (and they can dish a quite a bit) and tanking (no question at this point, no other class has the agro and defesive capabilities of the warrior).<br />
<br />
Warrior, rogue, preist, and mage, the four &quot;pure&quot; classes have all been given talents and other classes still have yet to be fully fleshed out. I expect when those 4 are adequately balanced, then the main brunt of the balancing for the rest of the classes will happen. Something that will happen soon, druid and shaman are getting talents tenatively set for the next big patch.<br />
<br />
With only warriors, and paladins for the alliance, able to wear the heaviest armor, I expect that the tank slot will more often than not be open in many groups and good warriors will be in great demand.</div></div><hr />

Pff.  Highly subjective.<br />
<br />
In OB, I had nearly the same gear I have right at the moment, and I screwed around with specs alot.  This time I went 5 parry and 5 defense and my survivability vs mobs has increased dramatically.  I'm talking about going from barely winning a fight to being able to chain kill mobs one after the other because my natural regen is enough to keep me full in the mere seconds between mobs.<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no complaints about going defensive.  Get back to me when people are having problems keeping you alive vs elites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pure offensive works best only against lower level mobs....against higher level ones than yourself the increased threat of the defensive tank is massive.  Let the other 4 members of your group go offensive in their talents.  Your job is to hold the aggro as best as you can and absorb damage.  Look at it this way....if a mage has to hold back because you can't generate enough threat, thats a loss of the total groups dps.  Sure you might do 20% more damage but that little amount won't cover what 2 mages and rogue could do unleashed.<br />
<br />
I like the fact that every other warrior wants to go offensive.  I'd rather stick to sword and plank, require massively less healing, and still control 4-5 mobs with ease.  Makes me more desirable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I played a warrior in open beta and spec defensively all the way.  In retail I am going all offensive until the late levels.  I currently solo almost every quest at level 25 and have no problems killing 26 and even 27 mobs.  Also the offense is the best defensive was in regard to solo not group...<br />
<br />
Secondly, dont bring taunt into this conversation while its still broke.  I played an SK to upper eschelons of PoP, I know how taunt works.  I also know my role.  I also said I was going to respec at high levels and if they fix taunt before I get 50 then Ill respec then for the defensive taunt skills only.<br />
<br />
The statement was about leveling and specing - not equipment.  I will use a shield and 1hand - IF its in the right scenario; the same goes for any other configuration.  Specing on the other hand I am going offensive and I have no problems and I certainly dont have any complaints from group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found taunt works like this.  You use it, mob's on you, and then whoever previously had more aggro than you (which is why you use it) does another action, and now the mob's on him.  Since rage primarily is generated by being hit, now you're stuck with taunt down and no rage to do anything either.<br />
<br />
Besides, I think WoW's aggro is actually based on DPS (though this might be because missed hits don't generate rage), so lose 10% DPS in defensive mode, spend talents points to get +15% which comes out to be .9 X 1.15 = 1.035.  Battle stance seems more idiot proof than taunt.  At the very least I can Hamstring so that while my group members are running around in circles causing most of my hits to miss (lag doesn't hlep either) other people can get a few more hits in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that they should remove the taunt skill, and rename Sunder Armor to Taunt and this problem would be solved.<br />
<br />
And the people saying &quot;OFFENSIVE RULES!&quot; Primarily strike me as Battle Net tards who think everyone's job is damage.  That's never been the job of the warrior, and I highly doubt it's going to be your job in this game too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one time I did have aggro, I dropped like 10 Sunder Armors on the mob.  I had excess rage and it's already max debuffed but it seems pointless to drop a rend or a heroic strike, and you have no real good damage moves in protective mode anyway so might as well throw some more Sunder Armors for extra aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to disagree as well.  I love my defensive skills on my level 26 warrior.  I just picked up the stun that attaches to revenge, and with 3 talent points into it I have a 40% chance to fire off a 3 second stun on a successful revenge.  I had started to spend some points into arms to get the imrpoved rend and eventually the dot on a critical strike, but I am having a blast firing off my stun with my shield and eventually the extra abilites that I can get to imrpove shield bash I'm gonna probably respec soon so I can go almost full defensive spec.<br />
<br />
I don't solo, I almost always have a full group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I completely disagree.  If you're gonna solo your entire life, then maybe, but if you're going to do instanced content and do elite quests at your level, then what the fuck is another 3% damage on your rend gonna do, or -1 rage cost on Heroic strike?  Oh yeah..fuck all of anything.  5% parry however, is a real number, with a real effect, one that is clearly visible when you tank something.  If you wanna be a halfassed rogue, be my guest.  I didn't make a warrior to be one of those tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have a 28 warrior, on a PvE server. I've been debating the whole offensive vs. defensive for a couple weeks now and I've just decided to do a mix (talent wise) until I start raiding at 60. Before you judge me as a &quot;bnet retard&quot; for going mostly offensive talents, I played a SK in EQ for almost five years, so I've tanked quite a bit in groups and off tanked in raids.<br />
<br />
My UI happens to have a built in DPS calculator and I can tell you that I do about 15-20 dps in defensive stance compared to a 70-80 dps in offensive, and I still manage to hold agro in defensive much better.<br />
<br />
I have max tactical mastery (pardon if I have the name wrong, I'm at work) so I keep 25 rage everytime I switch stances allowing me to charge, switch to def, taunt, blood rage, switch to offensive and manage to have plenty of rage for heroic strikes and other dps, yet I can still hold agro much better in strait up defensive stance with a 1h and shield. So currently, the dps = agro theory isn't holding much weight for me, I'm thinking the defensive abilities just innately generate more hate.<br />
<br />
Going to cut this short since I'm at work right now, but that's my experience so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how you're doing 1/4th the DPS in defensive stance compare to Battle.  We don't exactly have awesome DPS skills even in battle stance.  Actually, I think every skill you can use in battle stance for damage can be used in defensive stance as well and since Heroic Strike/Rend are just straight damage it makes no difference on DPS (aside from rage generation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, well I'm guessing it has a bit to do with having dual wield, which generates more rage, allowing me to heroic strike non stop, not to mention I can have rend permanently on my target. I also have the rend talents making them do slightly more damage (around four per tick) and more attacks per round = more chance to crit. My crits currently do around 150, 200+ on a heroic strike which I'm sure are also being factored into my DPS.<br />
<br />
Obviously my heroics and DoTs are factored into my DPS when being calculated. Such factors were calculated in EQ parsers, why would WoW be different?<br />
<br />
I suppose this should be in the agro thread, but too lazy to move it.<br />

It worked pretty good but as I was on the pvp server and was tired of getting my ass handed to me, I switched over to a full offensive build.  You know what?  It worked fine.  For anything that I did.  Admittedly, I ended the beta at 51 so I never did BRD but really, an offensive talent build worked just fine in instances.  If I played smart I could hold aggro just fine.<br />
<br />
The nice thing about WoW is that everything has advantages but there is nothing that is truly 'required'.  On the flip side, there are certain people that are obviously too dumb to group with and you will meet these people.<br />
The &quot;I don't tank, I am a dps warrior&quot; arms/fury warriors.<br />
The &quot;I don't heal, I'm dps&quot; shadow priests.<br />
The &quot;I only do cat form, I don't cast spells&quot; druids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its simple really.<br />
<br />
If you are on a Normal server, defensive talents have an edge.<br />
<br />
If you are on a PvP server, Offsensive wins hands down.<br />
<br />
All that extra protection is not going to save you butt when you have 4 horde on your tail.  Skills like piercing howl allow you to run away AND catch up to them when they are running.  And on the PvP servers, you WILL fight them left and right.  In some places it looks like they come outta the woodwork just you kill you.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the Arms tree allows me useful skills like Tactical Mastery, Deep Wounds/Impale, Imp Charge, and Overpower.<br />
<br />
1) Tactical Mastery allows you to use every/all abilities of the warrior right there, right now.  Intercept, Hamstring, Charge, Overpower, Berserk, Disarm, Execute, Slam, Cleave, etc.  If you didn't have it, you'd have to build up rage to use that one move in that other stance<br />
<br />
2) Overpower is just awsome for rogues that use evade.  50% chance to crit + Deepwounds/Impale litterally destroys them.<br />
<br />
When you fight only npc mobs, defensive would be an easier build.  Defensive does jack for PvP though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG, imo its a warrior MUST!  TM (5 points in it) lets you transfer 25 rage from stance to stance, you can switch many a times.  That 25 rage goes a LONG way, especially with PvP.<br />
<br />
I usually charge in, tap em with hamstring, rend after, and disarm if I get a chance.  You can intercept them if mages blink out and start running.  You have to switch to berserk , but you can catch up to them and lay down the hurt.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'll talk about PvE more because I guess thats what you mainly do.  With TM, you can charge the mob, rend, sunder, etc.  In a group I'm usually in defensive stance so I switch between defense and battle.  On pull, usually the hunter pulls them in.  I am in battle stance rdy and charge one of the mobs as they come in.  I use a shout to grab aggro of the other mob/mobs that follow.<br />
<br />
Then I quickly switch to defensive stance because it has an auto aggro built in.  I procede to spread a few sunder armors around till I have aggro lock on everything.  I use taunt only if it runs toward a caster.  Usually taunt + sunder will keep it on me even after TWO heals, or about 20 secs of the rogue fighting it.<br />
<br />
Once its low, if the mob tries to run I switch to battle and hamstring it.  If I can, sometimes I use execute also.  The beauty of TM is that if the mob dodges, or parrys or so . . . Instead of using revenge in defensive stance, I switch to battle stance and overpower them.  50% of the time I crit for 20% increased damage from Impale and it has deepwounds on it too.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
When I solo, thats when TM shines.  Using all the abilities of the warrior has gotten me outta a lot of situations.  You'll be surprised how little damage a humanoid does without his weapon.  Being able to switch, disarm, switch back is just awsome.  <br />
<br />
I tried out a template without TM in beta and it was horrible.  I had to save up the cash to switch back because I couldn't live without it.  TM allows a lot of flexibility, you will feel complete.  You will never say, damn I wish I was able to do this right now.  (given that you have the rage)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, as I said in my last post, Tactical Mastery is what I use and it's amazing. I don't see what's wrong with mixing talent trees, I was figuring it out and it seems totally plausible, it's not like you need every single offensive or defensive ability to get the good skills.<br />
<br />
The whole agro debate seems kinda lopsided though until people actually get their wars to 60 and we can get some good feedback. It's like judging a EQ class at level 30, although WoW classes may have a lot more skills available to them, it's still way to early to tell.</div></div><hr />

Toughness adds around 3% absorption, shield spec adds about 1%, anticipation adds about 2%.  Improved shield block and revenge are pretty nice.  Arms/fury offers enough dmg to offset defiance and if you are using taunt so much that 2 seconds faster cooldown is a huge difference maker then you are doing something wrong.  Improved blood rage doesn't effect cooldown so is marginally useful at best.  Truth is an arms/fury warrior tanks at least 90% as good as a defensive specced warrior and the defensive specced warrior pvps/solos probably around 70% as good as the arms/fury warrior.  <br />

All builds should get deflection(our best defensive ability and of course its in arms for some reason), tactical mastery and cruelty though.</div></div><hr />

I think you misread my tense Lorre.  I'm already convinced to buy TM because switching stances sucks so much that I'm forced to stay in one or the other.  I definitely see the uses from it.<br />

Care to explain the reasoning for Cruelty? 5% chance to crit on top of our already decent chance seems like wasted points, considering most non elite fights are over in 20 swings or so (so an extra one crit per fight...whoop de doo).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cruelty &gt; Booming Voice by a looooooooong shot.  If you are working towards anything in the fury line then you gotta spend five points between the two.  Improved Demoralizing Shout (increases the power debuff of DS), Unbridled Rath (8% to 40% chance to generate an extra rage point upon a hit), and Piercing Howl (AE snare) are all good things for any warrior to have even if you are only interested in being the toughest tank.<br />
<br />
I had Booming Voice 5 before I respec'd.  It was nice to not have to rebuff Battle Shout as often but thats all the advantage I saw.   I couldnt see any benifit in the extra duration of Demoralizing Shout cause I always end up spaming it through out the fight anyway.  When I respec'd, I dropped Booming Voice 5 for Cruelty 4 &amp; Booming Voice 1.  <br />
<br />
Crits in WoW are not the eye candy they were in EQ.  They are killer damage and that equates to rage building faster along with the mob dieing quicker.  Plus you can get a talent that causes the mob to bleed when you crit on them for a portion of your weapons average damage.  1% doesnt seem like much on the surface but it does seem to make a difference in WoW.<br />
<br />
I can say with 4% added to my chance to crit its a rare fight where i do not crit at least once (and therefore get the rage/dmg boost).  Usually I crit multiple times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to work towards Piercing Howl, you have to spend 5 points in either Booming Voice or Cruelty.  Personally, I feel that extra crits are a bit more worth it than 50% longer Battle Shout (no idea if Booming Voice works with Piercing Howl, but probably not).<br />
<br />
Plus, since I'm also going to be grabbing Deep Wounds which add more bleed damage when I crit, having more crits is nice for me.</div></div><hr />

5 talent points only, thats the reason.  You only need 5 spare points for an awsome 5% across the board.  With the proper talents and +agi items, you can get your % crit chance up to maybe 25%~30%.  With overpower, that procentage bumps up to 65%+.<br />
<br />
I mainly use a slow two hander.  Everytime my overpower lights up, thats usually half of the mobs health right there.  When I pvp Horde Rogues, overpower lights up a few times during the fight.  The only reason I win usually, is because they dodge/parry so much.<br />
<br />
Crits are double damage, and applied across the board.  Im going the MS route, so Im mostly all offesive.  Imagine fighting 2 mobs at the same time with a slow two hander.<br />
<br />
You use sweeping strikes so your next 5 hits hits 2 mobs.  You hit Mortal Strike which does 200% weapon damage.  It crits!  Now you are doing over 400% on BOTH MOBS with a two hander.  Crits are the key to an offensive build in WoW.  Thats the path Im headed.<br />
<br />
If you have ever played any of the Hero Maps with the Blade master, Agility and Crits are the way to go.  Once you get crits, agi, and your damage up . . . You tear thru mobs like they were paper.   :D</div></div><hr />
