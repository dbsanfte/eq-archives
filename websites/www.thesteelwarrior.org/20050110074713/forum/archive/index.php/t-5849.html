Does instancing in GoD take care of overcrowding or is it too early to tell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends. If people start to use the instanced trials as a form of exp grouping, then yes that should help. It remains to be seen if this will be the case though because the trials seems to be on par with LDoN hard in difficulty level. There are some nice loots to be had and some pretty good augments, so the reward is not bad, just rare like the old days of Sebilis. The exp is not bad if your group can handle the mobs, nice thing is you can replace people unlike LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think so - theres been very little elemental raid level stuff that i've seen so far.  Groups &amp; xp are nice &amp; all &amp; some drops in the sewers &amp; mts trials are nice, but they are no substitute for farming elemental minis imo so expect more crowding in plane of &lt;insert element here&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you mean crowding with regards to raiding, then no, GoD isn't going to do anything to help raiding at the EP level. Grouping maybe, raiding not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaboo</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify, I was thinking about the known GoD progression path and instancing.<br />
<br />
The reference to EP as an example of how overcrowded PoP has become.  I'm hoping that instancing takes care of this in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoD exp is about on par with Earth Zone in. That is just the first sewer trial.<br />
<br />
I assume it gets better later on. All I know is that the mobs die much quicker than PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what Ive seen thus far, the requirements you need to meet to progress in GoD have all been instanced. The sewer expeditions you need to get to the mountain expedition are instanced, so are the mountain expeditions that are needed to get into Kod`Taz.<br />
<br />
Kod`Taz isnt instanced, but you just really pass through this zone on your way to Ikkinz, which is the next set of instanced trials that will lead you to who knows where.<br />
<br />
If Im reading your question correctly, then yes, GoD should provide your guild with uncontested progression opportunities.</div></div><hr />
