<br />
Apparantly on my server HoH Graveyard is a FUCKING PULLING SPOT.  IT'S A VALID CAMP.  Who the fuck can not see the goddamned idiocy involved here?<br />
<br />
The graveyards exist for a purpose.  Puling shit into the fucking graveyard DEFEATS THAT PURPOSE.  But apparantly, we have retards who have managed to hit 65 and obtain their class title without figuring that out.  &quot;Haass, settle down, it's just a game&quot;  Yeah, it'a a game with fucking retards in it that camp the graveyard, and do shit like call camps from the zone in, or my favorite, just walk up to a camp and say &quot;This is ours, we were on CR,&quot; When there's no fucking corpses anywhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
How have these mental midgets managed to hit 65?  It's that goddamned PoP expansion.  None of these mouth breathers would have got past level 40 if it wasn't for that collossal waste of space of an expansion, and now we're going to have to deal with this crap for the rest of our days.  Hrm, lets see..the worst players in the game only visit 5 zones...lets make a bunch of zones JUST LIKE THAT so they can continue to be worthless pieces of shit that can't even contribute to A VIRTUAL SOCIETY.<br />
<br />
God I hate this game sometimes.</div></div><hr />

While I would love to do this myself, I don't see it as productive.  I wish they had kept all the damn flags up.  Opening the planes was a horrible idea.  Now if we only had time machines to go back and tell people to not play EQ who will turn out to be these kind of tards...<br />

Oh well, more wisful thinking.  But I agree with ya Haass.  It also boggles my mind when they get mad when someone zones out, and they get onlooker agro and bitch about getting trained.   Thank god for guild groups and Tower of Sol Ro for myself...</div></div><hr />

Haass, we don't always agree, but I gotta be in your camp on this point. And thanks for the heads up on HoH, I know what to expect when I get to that point, seeing as we are on the same server, lol.  Seriously though, why pull to the graveyard, pulling to the area of the exit, like in PoJ makes so much more sense. :D</div></div><hr />

Oh .. big freaking ditto on this one Haas.<br />
<br />
I got my HoH flag (yar, I leached it) a ways back.  Haven't camped it yet.  But I went up with my Incar. BP and snooped around about, loved the look.  Of course Shadows dropped at the worst time ...<br />
<br />
Ran like hell for the exit, was ahead of the pack cleanly and skidded on a dime so that I wouldn't train the bastiges dragging kites all over the GY.  Popped defensive to show the house dr00d the pretty train of angry.  Waited for an amicable cleric in guild who could come, to rez me, and watched the necro in GY raise me to use as his pet.  He said I was a kick-ass pet and stuff.<br />
<br />
Too bad I didn't know about the warrior solo camp at the BACK, I woulda taken my pull there.  Thanks for the heads up!</div></div><hr />

One more level and I get to see this numbnuts lfg in BoT... joy.  <br />

Yeah, I miss the old days when I could log in, grab 5 friends and nail all 4 lower named in BoT (back when they dropped nothing on 50% of the kills).  As much as I loathed the PoJ trials, there was a point to the flag system.<br />

I never get invited to a BoT group unless I go up with Guildies I never even go to the Zone. I have been in Bot maybe 3 times since hitting 62. I have killed one named mob. At 62 I am just a mana spong but I can keep arggo well if people pay attaintion to there<br />
<br />
HoH I use to farm AA with a RL friend of Mine... She is a 65 necro and Kites in HoH, and Tactics.<br />
<br />
She uses the GY in HoH because it is set up to pull and Kite... enough room to kite 3+.  We never call it in CC checks as it is not a camp but it is a place to Solo.<br />
<br />
I understand your rant and I agree it is not a camp spot but  that doesnt mean its not a solo area.<br />
Look at PoI... The GY there is the Camp spot for 2 groups all the time on my server.<br />
<br />
The point is that it is not ment to be a camp spot but if a group can pull steadly and it is worth the xp then people will always camp there.  I agree they should have left the flag system in place.<br />

&quot;Flaming on&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
graveyard kiters do suck though.  thankfully never been killed by one of them rezzing in GY.</div></div><hr />

Wizards, necros, rangers, druids kiting over the GY were common back then.<br />
Funny still when those kiters insist to pull while a trials raid or MM raid is still forming in GY.<br />
Zone in isnt an option here for kiters as its to close to the 2 static spawns and you would have to deal with 2 mobs.</div></div><hr />

You'll observe that the kiting classes maintain that they have a goddamned Right To Kite in HoH graveyard.<br />
<br />
Personally, next time I come across somebody doing this (and it'll be a long time before I zone into HoH again), I'm going to dispell whatever they're kiting and refuse to rez their ass when it kills them.</div></div><hr />

Guilds on Cazic Thule are these big mutants superguilds compared to other servers. Mind you super does not denote any exceptional skill or quality. Hell most of the elemental guilds on the server normally run a two raid set up. I'd go nuts if I was in that boat. I can barely deal with the deafening whining of fifty or so of my yapping comrades in arms. If it came to managing near one hundred of them I'd floss my teeth with a .357. But somehow those other guilds manage to do it. I suppose there is some strange harmony once you get one hundred and thirty other monkeys together to fling poop at Rallos Zek.<br />

Or else he'd understand that when zoning, even FD can't save you from FOUR planar mobs beating on you while your screen hasn't come up yet because FD won't work from that state.<br />

Oogmol hit the nail on the head. Sometimes you just run right into a train as you zone.<br />

BoT exp groups are only a means to a Tower Key.  Just as you said, HoH is almost guarenteed to be hassle free.  That being said, I still dont see any problem with Necro's and Druids kiting along the wall to the right facing the zone out.  Its very far from the entrance, and far enough from the tree that you can drag your corpse closer for rez.....you dont have to rez yourself where it pops, you can drag anywhere inside the GY.  Yes, I have been trained by overzealous druids while waiting at the entrance for a group, and yes I have been used as a pet by necros, but if the solo'er is courteous enough to use the back walls, away from the zoneout, its no different then PoI (where the GY is a 2-3 group camp).<br />

I think the root to the problem is solo'ers in general.  You can go to any zone and be trained by these &quot;mental midgets&quot;.  PoN is prime example.  As for BoT the only SoE ever did right with that zone is make the SR.  You play with yourself for 65 levels and you dont have the social courtesy of a crap-flinging ape......however much that insults the ape.  I dont have a problem with solo'ers who obviously play a group class like warriors, and are simply careful.<br />

And Oogmol hit the nail on the head. Sometimes you just run right into a train as you zone.<br />

It's happened to me in HoH. It's happened to me in HoH B. It's happened to me in Chardok B. It's happened to me in Plane of Nightmare, Plane of Innovation, Wakening Lands (zoning into Wuoshi is the suck), Sol B (5 LDCs and Nox was a welcome sight as I lay unconscious for a brief moment), Blackburrow back before I could FD ... Unrest before I could FD.<br />

My comp doesn't suck either.<br />
<br />
Just bad luck.<br />

:P  <br />

Always awesome to zone into a train. You get double points if you zone into a train because you were zoning your own train.<br />
<br />
<br />
Triple Point Score if you or your groups caused BOTH trains.</div></div><hr />

You are 62, go zone in to HoH and look at it before. Y'know, I woulda sworn I posted a self-correction in response to this, truly.  But I don't see it now.  Anywho, your post clarified my memory and I recanted.<br />
<br />
I did think the ZO was in the GY (the tree, actually) the day I turned around and ran back into my train.  (And watched myself being used as a necro pet later, it was kinda neat.)  I did laugh my butt off at my own fool self for having pulled my train BACK to the ZO (and ZI ... eep) when I found out where the ZO actually was, after my rez.  Despite myself, I had dropped IMMEDIATLY in front of the electric sizzles you click to zone out.  Heh.<br />
<br />
But I had forgotten that, and only remembered having my sights set on that tree and having to turn around before I got there.  So I'm not as bugged as I was, and it's not the best design for a ZO/ZI that SOE has done, but maybe it ain't the worst ... t'anks for the heads up Trondir.<br />

And Ninjaburger is not a monk.<br />
<br />
Or else he'd understand that when zoning, even FD can't save you from FOUR planar mobs beating on you while your screen hasn't come up yet because FD won't work from that state.<br />

maybe people on SH are a little more knowledgable or more attentive, or maybe the lower population just means your less likely to bump into *those* people.</div></div><hr />

Pity really it was in my top 5 favorite zones in Everquest. Was not perfect before, and it had its share of crap, but its 10x worse now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And why was there a train ?<br />
A bard had attemped to swarm kite !<br />
<br />
I never managed to figure out WHY he thought he could do that in there ... really, it blows the mind.</div></div><hr />

/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
BoT outer camps are just impossible to camp these days.Inner camps at leats are spared 90% of the training. Unless invis drops on someone trying to make it to the upper courtyard</div></div><hr />

How many points do I get for logging into a train while coming back from LD, then taking it to zone, and zoning into another train that i then ran to the other side of zone in?  This was at KC, and I think I managed to have a train at both sides of each entrance for like 10 minutes 8D.<br />
<br />
I didnt realize I had done it until i zoned like the 4th time and gotten eaten before i could get FD off.  hehe</div></div><hr />

Bonus points if there's a Dragon in the train btw .. like .. Gorenaire for example.</div></div><hr />
