I know Frodlin largely takes care of the class balance and whatnot, I'm currently not sure whether he will be there though so I'd like to give you guys this outlet for ideas and important notes to be brought up during my time there.<br />
<br />
Same thing as last time, so if you've forgotten or werent around for that, search for the post and you can see. Basically, a list of important aspects of the WARRIOR class, as well as with eq as a whole.<br />
<br />
Thanks  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Update LDoN so that there are level 70 hard adventures with a new droppable loot table.  If no update, at the very least please upgrade the experience gained in LDoN adventures.  For warriors, this is still the only spot to recieve Anger augments.<br />
<br />
2. Would be nice to have a few more &quot;fluff&quot; item quests like the wood elf illusion clickie.  <br />
<br />
3. Feels like mudflation has gone through the roof.  Reaching 10k hp was a wonderful feeling, 11k was cool, by the time I reached 13k I stopped getting really excited.  Don't know how to solve this, just pointing out my feelings.  <br />
<br />
4. A few under-used zones could use a revamp.  Revamp doesn't necessarily mean &quot;make the mobs hit for 1000,&quot; but would be nice to see new types of mobs, storylines/quests, loot tables, factions, etc.  Something like Kael B springs to mind, a new zone off Kael with new faction quests and some challenging new raids.<br />
<br />
5. Actual consequences for Ninja Looters and exploiters.  We had something ninjad about a month ago and SoE refused to tell us who it was or even if they took action against the individual.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I'm going to stop being idealistic and say that the chances of us getting even 33% or so of our ideas implemented is absolutely nil, based on the last Summit:<br />
<br />
They promised to fully instance Time.  They have not.<br />
They promised to put in backflagging solutions.  They have not.<br />
They promised to look at auto loot.  Where is it?<br />
Where are our solo / duo LDoNs?<br />
What about them looking at guild wars?<br />
Where are our new models?  Where are the new race/class combos?<br />
<br />
I referenced this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7457) for my claims.<br />
<br />
I think it would be dandy if they started fixing what they said they'd look at the last time, but I for one am not holding my breath.  I think having another Summit is a good idea but SoE's track record is abysmal.<br />
<br />
edit: Added #5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Update LDoN to handle up to lvl 70 people. This is a nice expansion for non raiders that is going to waste atm. Also add a new loot table possibly some higher point items. Make points usable at all camps. Having to do X number of missions at each camp to unlock it for what you want has become increasingly hard to get groups to do.<br />
<br />
2. Possibly add solo or duo LDoN as well (might be too easily exploited) and no the solo things added with OOW are not it.<br />
<br />
3. I would like to see some of the old zones possibly added on to like they did Chardok and SolB. The old zones still have alot of character that some of the new players never see.<br />
<br />
4. Add some new LDoN camps to help with the repeat of the same ones. Add one in Qeyos Hills with a blackburrow theme. Add one in Toxx Forest with Kerra Isle theme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. LDoN : the only way to get A3 aug and almost the only way to get ykesha aug.<br />
a) add lvl 70 missions<br />
b &amp; c) add multiple new zones and make all type (takk, mir, ...) share the same adv point pool. this is to decrease the boredom of doing the same thing for the xxxxx time (getting point refund at 70% was great but shared point-pool is better) ... Zzzzzzzzz ...<br />
d) the responce to solo/duo LDoN was the task system, which is shit for us. =&gt; Fuse the task system and LDoN system : allow different group size for both with scaling difficulty &amp; loot for intenced zone and shared difficulty &amp; loot for open area (current task system). <br />
<br />
2. revamp some old zones<br />
<br />
3. kill every knight ... argh, my bad, it's a derail.<br />
<br />
4. back to topic. they actually solved much of LDoN past issues with OoW (task system, first tier of armor, open zones, ...) but some need a little tweak (task system is shit) and some need futher change (add to loot drop table in GoD and OoW some more aug for weapons). As I said, LDoN is boring as hell so I am happy to not have to do it again for better armor and so on, however we still need it for aug. Thus droping A3 aug would be a quick fix while addind diversity to LDoN would be a bless (more theme, shared adv pts pool, some randomness, ...).</div></div><hr />

<br />
OOooo Yoda you just gave me great inspiration for a new idea.  :D <br />
<br />
Why not have LDON give access to old world dungeons with different monsters and such? Such as using blackburrow dungeon with mobs of appropriate level/risk. Imagine a zone like Unrest having an assassinate mission! Screw the lore, it's pretty much dead already, so why not play with the idea of instancing any zone with ldon rewards? No more cookie cutter crap  that's for sure  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah that's great, instead of trying to create new lore/zone/mob just revamp old zone with intances that scales with group lvl. with the shared pool it would be fun again to jump from old dungeon to old dungeon for fun and still have a chalange and reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm an instanced Unrest having to kill the ghost in the basement. That would be wild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I'd like to see a single group source for Armsmaster Bp and Legs. Make it in RS, or deep into MPG, or whatever. Was good fun getting the other 5 pieces. Be cool to be able to get a full set.<br />
<br />
2. Make at least a single decent warrior weapon you can build out of LDoN. Something with an innate proc that you can add an A3 or Yak to and have something solid.  Curently every single weap you can build out of LDoN is crap for warriors at the level you can actually get the points for it. It doesn't have to be some monster ratio game breaker either. Something with good hp's, good AC and a decent innate proc (maybe even with a proc mod?) would be groovy.<br />
<br />
3. As posted above, more quests that are &quot;just for fun&quot;....I want to have to go collect weird shit in beholders maze for my Minotaur Illusion Ring sorta quests.<br />
<br />
4. Something to jumpstart LDoN again.<br />
<br />
5. Quests/Trials with multiple options for the reward. Gather quest pieces/do tasks/do events and get to choose what slot you want to upgrade.<br />
<br />
6. The yak aug in BF is a good start. Add another agro aug or two from exp mobs. A nice AC debuff and dd (like SoMWV and Butchers Cleaver have) would be cool.<br />
<br />
7. Get some alternatives to the &quot;good HP with crap AC&quot;  drops that seem to be the norm outta GoD and Omens. Especially the attunable stuff is terrible AC in almost all items.<br />
<br />
8. Make invis potions that stack. Even just 5 shot invis. With the amount of stuff we carry around nowadays (potions, clickies, ToD, snare whip, weap set-ups, arrow summoner, gate neck, wood elf crown, components, mana batteries, etc.) Im running out of room if i loot 3 gems. Hell, get stacks of arrows changed to 40. Hell, I dont know. need more room :)<br />
<br />
9. Gimped out version of Endless Quiver for Warriors :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in my view things are pretty good for warriors now compared to how they've been in the past.<br />
Frod's &quot;Top 10&quot; list would be a good place to start, however. Not much on that list that is wrong.<br />
I think the two biggest problems my warrior has at the moment have to do with needing a lot of LDoNs for hate augs and, secondly, a lack of any way to boost regen on my END pool. <br />
I realize that the devs must have spent a fair amount of time considering the time/reward ratio for LDoNs, and that they've already put in means of removing augs and selling back LDoN items, but the practical problems of getting enough other folks interested in griinding out the adventures needed for the hate augs are growing larger every month. And warriors have no real alternative.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there couldn't be a way of &quot;building&quot; a hate aug. You might need a drop from an LDoN (please please not an ultra-rare drop), some sort of adventure-merchant-purchased item, and perhaps drops from outside of LDoN (thus, the total time one spent getting an aug might not go down, but not all of it or even most of it would have to be in LDoNs). These augment parts could be combined in some fashion (smithing skill? Jewelcraft?) to create an augment that would serve as a possible alternative to massive adventure grindage. Obviously OoW has a parallel system already in place for bulding armor. It would be nice as well if pre-65 warriors could make some progress on such an aug-building path (in other words, if the parts drop from zones a level 60 warrior can't fight in, well, it won't do him any good; similarly, for reasons purely related to self-interest, it would be good if the parts dropped outside of big-raid-only mobs/big-raid-flagging-required zones, and thus would be relatively accessible to casual warriors). Also, I personally would go insane if some of the &quot;parts&quot; to augs so vital to warriors required the foraging skill to get, lol.<br />
<br />
END of course can be managed (and I realize that it must remain limited so that managing it is part of the game--you should have to make a decision), but in the case of every other stat on my warrior there are avenues of increasing those stats (either AAs or buffs). Not much love for END so far, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Find aditional ways to accelerate progress to level 65 and increase the number of lower level players. My son reached level 70 in less than a year in FFXI and is level 50 already in WoW.<br />
<br />
2. Reintroduce Fabled Mobs.<br />
<br />
3. Class Definitions.<br />
<br />
4. Many fewer tradeskill failures and much more liberal drop rates. The contrast between sucess rates, speed in mastering, and drops rates compared to other games is astounding.<br />
<br />
5. Either re-energize LDoN making it less of a timesink and more rewarding, or drop the augments in other simular difficulty zones. IF #4 was done, they could add recipies for Anger III, 50HP, and 15 AC augments to the game as an alternative to LDoN.<br />
<br />
6. Improve the ability of Warirors to solo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually what would be a breakthrough in MMO's industrie is the creation of pseudo-instanced zones : instead of creating a zone for a group attuned to its lvl, generating some miroring standard zones (no player # limit) but of different power. thus a lvl 1-20 would get in a standard Crushbone, while a lvl 30-50 would get in a harder Crushbone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">recurse</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDON (agree with most of the above, exp, etc), convert them to use the expedition system. How many times have you had someone  LD etc and not come back? <br />
<br />
VT/older keyed content, we've changed the requirements for pop to be BAF'able etc, why not retroactively do the same to all of these zones. The new zone backflagging soution applied to those zones might see their use by mid-tier guilds again.<br />
<br />
Barring a change to ldon, more npc dropped aug options. Making them drop off something close to their level of use would be nice also, ie a2 BoT, a3 elem+, a4 riftseekers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Lets see a new teir of LDoN Armor/spells with slightly lesser stats than teir1 oow gear, and lets see the prices of origional LDoN stuff reduced, augments included. I'd also like to see more points per success, since its so damn hard to get a ldon going thesedays, though this is mostly evident when i play (after peak hours).<br />
<br />
1150pts worth of grind for a 40hp aug? for anger3? yeah i understand the time investment vs reward is how sony makes their money (ie by keeping people busy with bs run around and timesinks like ldon grinds)  and thats all good and fine but guilds are dying and we need an easier way to gear up in single groups. not to mention the derease in points earned per dungeon due to pretty much everyone being 66+ now.<br />
<br />
2. How about some duo loving? My g/f and I duo a good bit (war/dru) and I'd love a good duo ldon option or hell even instanced duo/trio'able xp zones. I realise this was somewhat addressed with draniks hollows but its difficult to single pull with a warrior once your far in.<br />
<br />
3.EP/VT Flag/Key alternate quests. Yes, flame me, hate me, etc. but I paid for PoP and dammit before EQ dies i'd like to see it. I'm not beyond earning access (through a quest or guild kills, as my guild is currently flagging for eps anyway) but some people dont have time to dedicate to raiding etc and on my server the ep's are staying pretty empty except the occasional backflag raid. As for Vex Thal, I have never seen it and I have pretty much abandoned hope of seeing it. I'm positive my guild could kill emp and break in, but most of us are fully EP flagged and the rest of us are only a few kills away, so this would be a huge timesink and a step back for us in the long run, whereas it would be immediately beneficial to us (and im sure most all mid range raiding guilds that havnt broken into eps yet) to let us fill out the rest of those unworthy gear slots until we are farming EP gods. I don't care how its done, I dont even mind farming all the shards, but I dont know any guild willing to go through the emp key + bane weapon bullshit anymore.  If these two changes were implemented somehow, more midrange guilds would stay together, because they'd be able to do things with smaller numbers. <br />
<br />
4. LDoN Experience/Loot table revamp: LDoN xp is poo, and warriors will always need ldon for anger/hp/ac augments, no matter what point in the game we are. You mgiht as well throw us a bone and add some nice attunable 100hp+ items in the drop tables, because lets face it, with OoW's uber nice attunable gear who wants to go do ldon anymore? <br />
<br />
5. More old world revamps. Hooray for VP revamp! too bad it requires a raid force ele+ capable to even see, in spite of my countless hours farming the origional key. Lets do it right this time with Mistmoor and Splitpaw. Put good xp spots for 66+ to grind in both zones and put in at least 3 raid encounters of different teirs, ie: entry level (bot towers difficulty), VT difficulty, EP difficulty etc, not just one zone full of more mobs that the intended audience (ep+) will skip because better is right around the corner. Revamps are supposedly for everyone, and while we need high end challenging content, for gods sake revamp something that helps mid range guilds gear up a little easier, even with attunable gear and new GoD quests the disparity between raid and casual players FT/hp/ac/mana wise is still huge. For every quest/attunable whatever bit that non ubers get, an item 3 times better/more stat inflated drops for an uber raid mob that again, only people in the end game will see.<br />
<br />
6. Can i have 6? :P Epic 1.5 Difficulty - I understand this is a cake walk for most guilds, hell VTB has lots of 1.5's running around in guild but with the fallout of so many players leaving for other games, its harder to come by a raid force capable of handling some of these encounters without recruiting outside the guild. Make the 1.5's for everyone who wants to do them, make the 2.0's for the ubers. The origional epics became status items as their quest difficulty in some cases (warrior, necro, mage ffs) considerably outweighed the usefulness of the items, and with new items being better and better, the 1.5's will become the same thing eventually. Might as well make them easier to get for those of us that plan to actually use them.<br />
<br />
PS: How about an OoW War only pure hate+ one hander? Maybe one from MPG trials and one with a mini eb (500-550 hate, not another CHSD please) for mid level/pre-elemental guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even with friends, It will take me FOREVER to get these. My friends and I can group maybe once a week to grind out 3 Dungeons. Please increase the Pts per dungeon. That seems to be the easiest solution to a lot of problems. <br />
Another solution would be to add an LDoN xp bonus. People don't want to go to zones where the xp is bad. And let's face it, now a days, any XP zone that isn't awesome, is considered bad. I am not one of them. I still grind XP in Velks occasionally. However this does me no good if I want to grind some LDoN's when my friends can't be on. No one is doing them. (a bit of an exaggeration) <br />
<br />
XP bonus.<br />
<br />
More Pts per Dungeon.<br />
<br />
Simple yet effective fixes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.) Add an &quot;Anger&quot; aug, doesn't have to be LDoN, drop off of RS king and Queen or something.<br />
<br />
2.) Give warriors a decent weapon in highend OOW(I mean, come on, MSC has the same ratio as Blade of Forgotten Faith. Blade is 1hs, MSC is 2hs.. See a problem?)<br />
<br />
3.) Revamp old zones, that noone goes to anymore, even though that didn't work with the hole to well(Example: Befallen or Splitpaw.).<br />
<br />
4.) Make a new &quot;crushbone&quot; zone for higher end. The last Orc i saw con darkblue was at level 53 or something, and it was Ry'gorr chief.<br />
<br />
5.) Make Lockout timers on 1group MPG trials same as Raid MPG trials. Tired of having to wait 2hours every time i do a Group trial, ad being able to go straight to the next with a raid.<br />
<br />
6.) Change drop-rate on Blessed Shard and Ground Murkglider eyes. No, I don't mind camping 20ac aug. Yes, I do mind the fact that it takes 8hours(Or 9-15 killing of all primals to get a blessed shard)<br />
<br />
7.) Increased Droprate for Fleshbiter, and or Prism of Dark hues. Don't care about Darkblade, will prolly never get mine.<br />
<br />
8.) New instanced zone or two. I love Ikkinz Trials and MPG trials. They are fun, and require atleast a little talent.<br />
<br />
9.) Add a mini-raid encounter for Vxed and Tipt, something like Rhondo raid.<br />
<br />
10.) Give Warriors(And paladinds/sk/ranger/etc) innate Invis AA.<br />
This allows us to make a hotkey to invis ourself for set-duration, but can only be clicked every now and then.<br />
<br />
11.) Rampage of the Arch Lich:<br />
This ability grants warriors a chance to score a second, and possible third sucessful rampage when they activate the rampage ability.<br />
Requirments: level 70, Ambidexterity, Rampage.<br />
<br />
12.) Give warriors a better mitigation disc than Defensive/Stonewall.<br />
<br />
13.) Gift of the Oppressor:<br />
This disciple grants the warriors the ability to always score a crippling blow, with the force of a giant. Basicly, a mightystrike-fellstrike mix that has a 40minute re-use and only last for 12seconds.<br />
<br />
14.) Divine Superiority:<br />
This ability grants the warrior supernatural healing benefits. Heal spells landed on the warrior will heal for more hipt-points by 5% per level. 5 levels.<br />
Requirements: level 70, Delay Death5.<br />
<br />
Just some oddball ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">um... going to say a few ideas are dumb and why.<br />
<br />
&quot;10.) Give Warriors(And paladinds/sk/ranger/etc) innate Invis AA.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry there's just zero reason a warrior, monk, or paladin should have a innate reg invis.  SKs maybe, rangers sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;14.) Divine Superiority:<br />
This ability grants the warrior supernatural healing benefits. Heal spells landed on the warrior will heal for more hipt-points by 5% per level. 5 levels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again not something in line with warriors, paladins sure.  Hell maybe even sk's, give them a advantage that's not taking away from ours.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;4.) Make a new &quot;crushbone&quot; zone for higher end. The last Orc i saw con darkblue was at level 53 or something, and it was Ry'gorr chief.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some races are too stupid to live long enough as a whole to get those levels, orcs are a rule, the exception, is you guessed it, LDoN orks. (they are db to 70 =-)<br />
<br />
&quot;5.) Make Lockout timers on 1group MPG trials same as Raid MPG trials. Tired of having to wait 2hours every time i do a Group trial, ad being able to go straight to the next with a raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
yeah cause then farming trials would be quick and easy and painless then, and we can ignore the impact time has on people gear wise by just farming trials...  (maybe address some issues with the trials like how in fear trial you can just simply never get a fearless, or only get fearless.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.) Add an &quot;Anger&quot; aug, doesn't have to be LDoN, drop off of RS king and Queen or something. <br />
<br />
Yeah but the aug shouldn't take up a loot slot.  Having it drop randomly off trash right around the King/Queen would be neat though, or maybe a random % chance of the King/Queen dropping it as an 'extra' loot.<br />

This is a nice idea, but it will never happen.  They stated months ago they were &quot;looking at&quot; the loot tables of Ikkinz.  Guess what?  9999900000 elfshoe ranger blades still drop and rot.  I seriously doubt.... no, actually I'm going to say with certainty, that, based on SoE's continually and absolutely abysmal track record, they will NEVER revamp ANY current loot tables unless they are totally revamping a zone.  It does no good asking for one. <br />
<br />
I don't mean to dog on people who put their ideas out but wouldn't we be better served if SoE made good on their previous promises?   Waiting on new patches is like waiting for Diablo v1.10.  I  rather SoE not hold any summits at all because I'm tired of getting new hope of life being breathed back into the game.</div></div><hr />

Maybe some higher armor, but that is not my biggest concern.  I just want people to start doing them again so I can get some augs like a Yak for my slot 8 on my Epic 1.5 and a few of the ac augs would make me moist.  I don't get to group often since I am an officer for my Elemental level guild and when i do get to I want to be able to make it productive.  It is like pulling teeth to get folks to do LDoN's to help me get augs.<br />

A zone revamp or two for some old stuff would be alright, but I think I would rather see some fixes for shit that was told it was being &quot;looked into&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I realize SU/Holforge is situtational damage, but when you are in that situation you're in it if you get my meaning. In higher level raid zones from PoTime on it's not all that uncommon.<br />
<br />
SU/Holyforge - level 59, 5 minute duration, x10 multiplier, ~7k+ Cleanses, no impact on the ability to defend yourself<br />
<br />
Savage Onslaught - level 68, 5 tick duration, I get a max ~1500 Cripple, can't use a defensive discipline while it running and it consumes Endurance which fuels the other Warrior disciplines.<br />
<br />
SU/Holyforge's damage boost and duration for which it is sustained is pretty amazing for something with no downside.<br />
<br />
When comparing the two, you would think that since the Warrior damage boost has such a smaller multiplier, it's for such a short duration, and it has a downside that at the very least the frequency of getting a Cripple would be much greater (like 2-4x).<br />
<br />
For a level 68 Discipline, Savage Onslaught is pretty anemic.<br />

I love the idea of having to invade the mansion at Unrest, having to kill your way from the zone in to the mansion and then going into the basement to find a boss mob that is tough but one groupable.  Several other zones would be awesome as well (Crushbone, Permafrost, Warrens)...<br />
<br />
I would like to see the various offensive discs actually serve some sort of function.<br />
<br />
I know that they are putting in some ways to make backflagging easier on the elemental+ guilds.   Why not also create a way to make it easier for the family guilds that are still in the Tier 1 planes to flag players that are new to the game and are just getting into PoP?  I know a lot of family guilds that still kill off Terris Thule and Behemoth and Grummus because they want to turn into elemental guilds but are forced to backflag to get a raid force big enough to tackle RZ etc.  The whole backflagging game in general has really gotten old.  It might be a good idea to make those quests that allow access to Tactics, Torment, etc be allowed for planar progression.<br />
<br />
Anger 3 augs are still in high demand, but LDON's are not.  Just stating this to support what several others are saying.  I have my augs, but I have no idea what the warriors that don't have them yet can do.  I don't think it's right for them to not have a way to get those.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty happy with tank balance at the moment.  I don't think they should change anything there.  <br />
<br />
If anything, I worry that the DPS classes aren't getting enough thrown their way.  Soloing has been pretty much eliminated, and it seems like I see a lot less wizards and mages and druids these days.  Maybe I'm wrong.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
I think they should quit creating new expansions.  The world is big enough.  If they want us to give them 30 bux every 9 months or whatever, fine.  But let's stop creating these ghost zones.  It really makes EQ seem vacant.  The population of EQ is shrinking.  Don't magnify the problem!  <br />
<br />
On the same note, the servers, imo, were overpopulated before.  A little shrinkage was good.  Don't consolidate!  At least, not yet.</div></div><hr />

Concider making the LDoN adventure merchant spells normal spell vendor salable (and refunding LDoN points for those that have spells that could have only been obtained from LDoN merchants).

Sure I'm biatched, cause that's the point of progression my guild is currently at, but having 2 mobs in all of the 4 Ikkinz raids drop Ranger Blade and Chain BP just seems downright unbalancing to me. Rogue weapon only drops in Ikkins3, Shadowknight weapon only drops in Ikkinz4 and in those cases only off the harder bosses.<br />
Having 8 or so mobs dropping Chain class loot and Ranger only weapon makes absolutely no sense to me. On the other hand, making the augments drop from the big bossmobs only makes no sense to me either, here we're talking items that everybody in the raid can and would use, and they drop of mobs where you're lucky to get 1 pr raid, where as it's not uncommon to see 2 ranger blades or 2 chain bp's pr raid.<br />
Move the augments to the named in Ikk1, 2 and 3 that you have to kill to get to the loot dropping named. Killing 3-5 named that drop no loot only to get to a named that then drops a Ranger blade like it's done the last 8 times you killed it is no fun.<br />
<br />
From a warrior only point of view, I'd say they need to look at taunt and it's failure rate, need to look at the Epic worn and rightclick effect and need to come up with something new and interesting as our lvl 70 discipline instead of the useless thing they've given us. I don't think we need another Defensive / Stonewall, but maybe a new Evasive discipline. From my perspective, Stonewall was an upgrade to Defensive. I don't see why our lvl 70 discipline couldn't be some kind of upgrade to Evasive. I don't think out lvl 70 discipline should have to be the discipline to end all other disciplines, but it should at least be something you'd be interested in. As it is at the moment, I'd pass on a lvl 70 rune any day of the week since it'd be much more usefull to any other class than me.<br />

Met a mid-50s cleric this weekend who was desperately trying to get 5 more points in North Ro for a spell. All he needed was one normal, so just about any group would do. I was on a 56 war. We each talked a guildmate alt to come with us. It took well over an hour to recruit a couple more players, and we ended up with cleric, warrior, sk, pally, pally, beast.  Actual fighting-time exp was awful, not even counting recruiting time. <br />
<br />
I was also unsuccess in getting the group to take my two suggestions: that the beast be main tank and the 2 pallies, the SK and I assist, or, alternatively, that the cleric tank while the beast was main healer and the sk, pallies and I assist. Instead I had to MT.<br />
<br />
We did a normal collect, which was profoundly not challenging (one pac failure was mildy amusing, but we had no real cc and not much dps and still we didn't bother with strategy--we just off tanked everything to death). At one point in the adventure I asked the cleric to stop healing me and it was 2 or 3 pulls before I went berserk and got to do the eyecandy Mighty Strike for fun. There were two 10-minute periods during which no collect thingies at all dropped off the mobs we were killing. We still won, of course, and cleric got his spell, but meh.<br />
I think at this point far and away the easiest method of keeping LDoNs viable is to put them in the &quot;hot&quot; exp. zone rotations. You could cut the item costs in half and i think people would still avoid LDoNs.</div></div><hr />

If exp in LDON could be worked on as well as loot tables I have no doubt more peeps would do LDON and not go to GE, PON or POV.<br />

These for the most part require a cleric healer.  Compared to say PoFire 1st or 2nd castle where my shaman can keep me healed when I duo.<br />
<br />
The difference?<br />
<br />
PoFire in full group is about 4%AA per kill at 2nd Castle.<br />
<br />
LDoN in full group is less then 1%AA per kill at any camp.<br />
<br />
LDoN should be boosted to about 3%AA per kill at lv 70, and should be closer to 4 or 5 for lv 65's.<br />

The exp in LDoN zones is simply wrong, putting class required items (aka anger augs) in a place where people avoid going like its the plague is mind boggling and cruel!  I am so glad I got my anger augs before it became impossible to get LDoN groups.  But now I am stuck trying to get HP augs, something thats not quite required but extremely helpful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the ldon coments, especially adding more loot, both drops inside ldon and available from vendors so I won't repeat what others said on this item.<br />
<br />
I see lots of good upgrades for most slots in oow that are single groupable, or two groupable, but see none for legs or chest (tier 1 chest/legs require raid as far as I can tell).  Would like some options for an upgrade here, appears I am about dead ended on these slots.<br />
<br />
Epic Quests - I thought I heard that these were suppose to be doable by 1-2 groups (or was this just a rumor?).  If so, these quests need raids to finish, and decent size raids for some fights. They are not 1-2 groupable.  I sure hope sony did not tune these for GoD equiped people.  Would be nice if a pre-elemental guild could push through all of quests.  Shammy eqic does not seem too hard, several in guild have finished, but others are much harder.  Adjust fights.<br />
<br />
GoD still sucks - Adjust loot tables all you want for the high GoD zones, there is just no enjoyment in pushing through this expansion and I doubt I will ever visit the high zones here.  I see myself eventually hitting Time or Anquish, but not high GoD.  This is due to difficulty, time needed, groupage/raid needed,  but mostly due to lack of enjoyment.  The GoD quests are also poor.  Tantilize me all you want with a link to some uber loot off a uber named, this whole expansion can just be deleted with the exception of the arena in Riwwi (was fun xp at 64), and Vxed.   (They are able to update GoD loot tables with a patch, why not LDoN?)  Why are zones so packed with wandering mobs that can kill you fast, can potentially see invis, and you darn invis drops at random?  why why why?<br />
<br />
Epic effects - Adjust.  Other threads go in detail on this.  Focus effect is lame, Click effect needs to be altered.<br />
<br />
Graphics/Mob Positioning - Sometimes the fights get real annoying:<br />
<br />
1.  Mobs summoning too often.  Summon rate is just too high some mobs, not sure what the purpose of this is. (assasins cave in wos comes to mind)<br />
<br />
2.  Mobs summon when you are next to them.  I have never figured out why a mob that you have agro on, and you are standing right next to summons you.  Please implement a range check of some kind.<br />
<br />
3.  When you get summoned, you are usually summoned past mob and are facing away from so you and mob have to turn to face each other.  If you have mob against a wall, you usually end up inside the wall, then the mob follows you into wall, then warps out.  (North wall camp in WoS comes to mind here.  Have had mobs  summon me into wall, mob follows, then mob warps out of wall farther down the wall and agros more mobs....blah blah..).  If a mob summons, you should be in front of it, not behind it.<br />
<br />
4.  Melee range too short.  On some mobs, paticularly large ones, you have to fight inside mob to be in range and cannot see anything.  Again, just annoying, not sure what value is added to game play.<br />
<br />
5.  Mob hit s me, and I cannot hit mob.  Too often mob is able to hit me, and I am unable to hit mob.  Often I get message that I am out of range (mob is not), or sometimes it is just becasue I am unable to see mob.   I notice this most on uneven terrain and on hill sides.  The affect became quite apparent to me in Dranik Scar farming soloing green mobs for faction.  When I stood on hill side, I did not do very well, but when I found a flat spot, I jut ripped through them.  This is not a small affect, but a vey obvious, very repeatable affect.<br />
<br />
6.  Too much mob dancing.  Both me and mob move around too much.  I think it is due to the above effects.  <br />
<br />
The above items are mostly related to graphics and hopefully some fine tuning will fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior/pallys unbalanced in xp groups.  I will not go into details, but from casual observations, pally stuns works so good in OOW, they got a big jump in tanking ability for xp groups.  I think it has gone too far.<br />
<br />
Keep game fun.  Yes, rewards should be function of time/effort/skill, but keep it fun.  Repetative grinding for xp in same location is not fun (not many spots for us level 70s), mindless killing of mobs for faction is not fun, camping spawns for hours is not fun.  Please keep fun a central focus of game.<br />
<br />
More invis spells of set duration available.  Tactic of turning  invis is understood and makes sense; having see invis mobs to contend with makes sense, but the random droping of invis is just annoying.  Too many times I have gone LFG, got group, group starts to move to camp, and invis drops on someone followed by death, rez, lost time, group break up.  A potential evening of xp turned into a corpse recovery.  Not sure what is gained by all this, just some more mindless roadblocks to our progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
More policing of players - Both banned programs, and behavior needs to be watched.  Plese put a GM in WoS once in a while and crack down on the nonsense<br />
<br />
More policing of guilds -  With guild benifits such as ability to flag, comes resonsibility.  I  have observed lots of bad behavoir by supposedly reputable guilds.  Guilds need controlled like payers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite tone of much of this post, I am farily happy with EQ1.  OOW is a good expansion.</div></div><hr />

We hear a lot about how non-raiders shouldn't have to raid to play the game, so why should raiders be required to spend so much time exping outside raids. If I can get VT level raid gear in single groups while exping, how come in an 8 hour raid I'll only get half an AA?<br />

4: Summoning<br />
If it's possible to do with existing code, summoning by mobs needs to be looked at. It puts your midpoint at the midpoint of the mob, which usually means your field of vision is staring out of the mob's ass. Make summon place you halfway between the mob's midpoint and it's max melee range<br />

Great idea but I don't think the code of the game will allow a proc mod aug.  Now I could be wrong, but with the proc rate tied directly to the weapon in the database it just doesn't seem possible.  Now maybe just for that aug itself.  That would be easy enough to add in, but to make an aug that adjusts the rate on the weapon I don't see it happening.</div></div><hr />

yes it's possible since aug ID file has the proc rate mod filed, which indeed is set to zero.<br />

proof here (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=42179) as you can see, and the buttom of the second colum, two lines under the name of the aug, there is a field for proc rate mod. It's set to 0 has almost every procing weapons.<br />

1. TS hate augs is a great idea. Any implementation is fine with me, but I'd particularly like to see them end up with a procmod.<br />
<br />
2. GoD loot tables. At least pre-kt, GoD rvr just completely blows compared to OOW. It's a fun expansion, but with all the stuff dropping like candy in oow noone wants to go. I've spent hours spawning sewers and vxed exp's and killing random barindu named trying to find yiktu runes so guild shaman's can get balance of the nilhil.<br />
<br />
3. Summoning / melee range. Tons of BS there, see above posts. I agree 100%. I shouldn't have to stand with my head inside a bazu or dogs gut in order to stay close enough to avoid getting summoned through the mob. I end up fighting 'zoomed out' most of the time to avoid this, but that makes cornering or playing with my back to a wall real nasty.<br />
<br />
4. Ldon. A level 70 hard ldon would be fun, with new loots and maybe some new buyable items too. Make the xp not suck too bad.<br />
<br />
5. Raid XP. With the monster group XP bonusses, raid xp sucks hard. At least allow normal group xp bonuses in raids. Raiding for 4 hours, clearing good xp trash for 3 of it and ending up with 10% or less AA seems pretty stupid.<br />
<br />
6. OOW Warrior disciplines: suck except for (sorta) bazu bellow.<br />
<br />
7. Epic focus: Useless. Epic clicky: Damn near useless. In keeping with the cleric epic, perhaps the epic clicky should be a fortitude or furious disc, on it's own timer. Having a second 'oh shit' key would be hugely usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great idea but I don't think the code of the game will allow a proc mod aug.  Now I could be wrong, but with the proc rate tied directly to the weapon in the database it just doesn't seem possible.  Now maybe just for that aug itself.  That would be easy enough to add in, but to make an aug that adjusts the rate on the weapon I don't see it happening.<br />

Actually Yoda we agree, but my wording was a little off since I wrote the post at like 5 am or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">12-17-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aside from the top 10 list of Currently Being Evaluated..... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
 1) LDoN was a tremendous idea that since has been handled so badly that it isn't useable.<br />
<br />
 a) XP rates need to be comparable to other zones. Don't give me any guff about the instanced nature of the zones - if I can go to WoS and pull blues and kill them all day long, I should be able to go to LDoN after LDoN after LDoN and pull and kill blues all day long and get similar XP. Points are a bonus, but they're not so much of a bonus that you need to cut the XP rates to a third of a normal zone.<br />
<br />
 b) Points. The day LDoN's were changed to reflect level 70 was a direct nerf on everyone 59-65, which included those who hadn't bought the expansion yet. As a level 65 pre revamp I was getting 51 points per easy LDoN, after as a 65 I was getting 47? WTG. Points should either be restored to original levels, with level 66-70 pulling more base points, or merchant tables should be trended downward to reflect the fact that you've skewed the tables downward. Of course, they should have been trended downward for the lower items anyways, given that the RvR for lower level toons sucks, especially in regards to spells.<br />
<br />
 c) Interchangability of points. If they want to upgrade the charm, let em have to keep going to the individual camps to do so - but if they want to spend the points, they should be able to. This would obviate the single biggest problem with LDoN, that pre-65 no one wants to do any LDoN in EC or Guk, making those items essentially nonexistant.<br />
<br />
 2) The instanced zone idea above is a wonderful idea. Alternatively, have more LDoN camps that do not upgrade the charm, but allow the points to be universally applied. Unrest, Befallen, Blackburrow, Crushbone are all ideas that would be very popular, especially with long time players.<br />
<br />
 EDIT: Ah, who am I kidding? We all know the next summit will be all about Anguish and MPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">12-19-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another Idea I have been kicking around in addition to my other post here.<br />
<br />
Would be good if warriors had some means of stopping mobs from running in emergencies.  I would really love to summon a running mob back to me (they do it to us, fair is fair, lol) but I providing root or snare would not fit our class.<br />
<br />
This could be done several ways using an additional disc or AA as the means of implementing it.  Regardess of method, I see this having a reuse timer, and also the limitation the mob is in a certain range.  For example, a mob is running and we grab it by the arm and pull it back, or we kick mob in the leg and he stops running, but is still fighting.<br />
<br />
We can use snare weapons, but who here has had their snare weapon out and realized in horror it is not processing, and the mob is running and getting ready to bring freinds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">12-19-2004, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been beaten to death, but I would love to see LDoN become a viable means of XPing again.<br />
<br />
One way to do this is to increase the level (and the difficulty) of both normal and hard adventure mobs.<br />
<br />
65 Normal mobs could be level 63-64 (Named 65) and be scaled up so as to hit roughly as hard (and as fast) as Tier 3 PoP mobs.  XP at roughly 2 ticks AA per full group kill.<br />
<br />
65 Hard mobs could be scaled up to lvl 65-66 (Named 67), hit about the same as they do now but faster with some/more slow mitigation.  XP at roughly 3% AA per full group kill.<br />
<br />
Add in a 68 normal (which would be the same as a 65 hard), and a 68 hard (70 normal) which mobs would be level 68-69 (Named 70) and hit about as hard as the 65 hard mobs, but faster with slow mitigation and proc a DD (~500ish).  XP at roughly 4% AA per full group kill.<br />
<br />
Add in a 70 Hard in which mobs are 70-71 (Named 72-73), hit a bit harder (1100ish), proc DD (~700ish) and have the same speed (maybe even a little faster) and slow mitigation as the 68 hard mobs.  XP at roughly 6% AA per full group kill.<br />
<br />
Scale rewards up a bit better also.  Something like:<br />
<br />
65 Normal:  55-60<br />
68 Normal:  75-80<br />
70 Normal:  110-115<br />
<br />
65 Hard:  110-120<br />
68 Hard:  150-160<br />
70 Hard:  220-230<br />
<br />
Of course, there would have to be some fancy new stuff added to the loot tables for higher level adventures and perhaps some better stuff added to the adventure merchants for a higher point cost (1950 point stuff anyone?).<br />
<br />
SOMETHING has to be done to make LDoN worth it again.  LDoNs are great for the casual/non-raider, but right now, it's torture trying to get people to do them because they aren't a viable XP option making only 20-25% of an AA per adventure.<br />
<br />
I suppose you could also argue that something has to be done about some of the other worthless expansions (LoY just SCREAMS worthless), but I can't offer any suggestions right now.  I don't know, maybe make some instanced zones in there or something.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuddar Raddut</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's actually several non-raider types going to the Summit, quite activist ones as well.  Klonn-Darkbane, Nolrog, Iceblossom, Loral, and Woody off the top of my head.I think his point was to have some folks there who maybe represent a lower end of the spectrum of raiders. Like folks who are in pre-EP guilds, stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Many guilds are stuck in an endless loop of doing old content, pretty much regardless of what content they are progressing towards. Attrition has kicked into high gear with the release of new games. While the new backflagging system helps in some regard, it's too little I think to keep guild's heads above the water, so to speak. And depending on what content your doing, the new backflagging system can be a double whammy. While it's helpful for Time+ guilds, pre-EP guilds can expect additional member losses because now there's one less barrier for going to those Time+ guilds.<br />
<br />
It's hard to progress when your losing folks faster than your gaining them. Regardless of the level of content your doing. If your attrition rate gets too high, those left will get frustrated at having to do old content and will leave, further deepening the cycle.<br />
<br />
I think SOE needs to re-examine flagging across the board and flatten it. A few flags is fine, deep flag paths is just insane.<br />
<br />
SOE needs to get out of the mentality of using flags as a barrier of progression and get into the mentality of making the encounter itself the barrier of progression. While a subtle difference, it is a substantial one. If guild XYZ can beat mob ABC right now, then it makes little sense to require guild XYZ to have to beat 10 other encounters before even being able to face mob ABC.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents. I think this above all is the most important issue facing EQ today.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Summit/Warrior Top 10/Weekly Wish List/Class Balance/etc....It just makes me feel good to have a couple gripes in the pipeline, regardless of where they end up :)<br />
<br />
1. New LDoN missions with no time limits. Points earned based on number of mobs killed. Would be the equivalent to doing a series of &quot;kill X mobs in 90 minutes&quot; missions, without having to take a break every 45 minutes to go get a new mission then travel back to the dungeon.  Adjust exp for all mission types to make it viable to do exp camps in LDoN. Have all points be good at all camps.  If VP dragons know every time i kill a greenie in Mistmoore, and can adjust my faction accordingly, then a sophisticated bunch like the wayfarers ought to be able to communicate how much ive helped em out throughout all dungeons and sell to me accordingly.<br />
<br />
2. Further flag/key relief. In conjunction with the recent Flagging changes for upper level PoP and GoD they should take a look at changing some lower level keys.  The ones im thinking about are Emp Key, VT, and the re-vamped VP. Thats a lot of good content that a lot of people are now grading as &quot;not worth the effort&quot; due to the time associated with keying up. Hardly anyone i know has done much in the new VP aside from some quests. Lot of guilds been skipping VT for some time. Having an elaborate time-sink key process for Emp made sense at the time Luclin came out. I think that time has passed, and the loot is no longer worth keying a whole guild for, bane weaps, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panazule</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My son reached level 70 in less than a year in FFXI and is level 50 already in WoW. <br />
<br />
I don't think that's a good thing personally.  If people want that kind of rapid progression, imo, they aren't really in the market for a MMORPG.  They are in the market for a souped-up diablo type game.<br />
<br />
Considering how short WoW has been out, I think that's going to be pretty detrimental to the long term playability/boredom factor within WoW and what inevitably happens is people rapidly hop games, something we're going to see alot of as these new games break the addictions of current EQ1 casual players.  It'll come back to haunt SoE and such in the long run but probably enough time to release another short haul game with a keyword like &quot;Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Matrix&quot; or what not.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is some level 70 LDoN's.<br />
<br />
A quest based UI system, similiar to EQ2's but not neccesarily the same, that would allow you to not use every last bit of your inventory for things such as BiC, etc.<br />
<br />
Something to still be done with the fail rate of Taunt on red/yellow mobs.   OOW was a short term fix which brought many mobs that were yellow/red to become blue, which artificially raised the taunt success rate but once back in zones with red/yellows, it's back to the dismal success ratios, solutions could include a small bump in success rate, some sort of hate even on failed taunts if not the top of the aggro list, etc.<br />
<br />
Fixing of the graphics bug where everything but the sky/particle effects disappear completely, a bug that's been with us for WAYYY too long now.<br />
<br />
I don't think we should be pushing for easier/alternate key quests to places like VT.  If those zones are becoming so easy then gaining access and killing what's needed to get there should be that much easier as well.   I wouldn't be against upping the drop rate of com1/2 pieces and the shards but make the players still do the emperor kill. Removing the need to kill the emperor for VT access is just rewarding laziness considering how easy it has become since level 70, attunable gear, new aa's, etc, etc.  VT is still a viable upgrade path to guilds who wish to actually progress through the game and it's tiers, it's the best way to gear up quickly for a successful, non boring, run through elementals.</div></div><hr />

Guild is past and done with that content but I spent 1-2 weeks for 4 toons to get them all keyed. That zone is a special zone as cna only be cleared once ever 6 days and basicaly only one guild can riad in there at a time. There are a few guilds who wanted tot ake it over and I spent countless hours sitting at emp throne room to kill him to lock out others. Time  can have 7 guilds raiding it vt can have 1 leave that content alone.</div></div><hr />

Make aten drop keys and allow 85%'ing in. Ain't no way in heck I'm going back to farm that key, but it would be fun to get a tour with my guild sometime :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">flag issues would only be a short term solution.  and not really one that i think would make a large differance is the overall picture. <br />
<br />
With the release of OOW armor can now be bought to completely bypass most of the older content.  so flags for those events/zones are pretty much a non issue.<br />
<br />
one problem is the population is so damn low right now that upper end guilds are having serious problems fielding enough people to even attempt to progress.  <br />
<br />
now that problem will solve itself slowly with people returning from eq2 and wow as well as recruiting once they get bored with how easy those games are. <br />
<br />
at this point i belive that what should be considered is Small raid content. <br />
<br />
other then mini names there is very little in the way of doable stuff for low population guilds to do other then exp and hope you get enough people online to do something.</div></div><hr />
