basalt greatsword of the protector (http://www.magelo.com/components/eq_item_shot.jsp?num=25987) ?<br />
<br />
Just obtained it, planning of sticking anger3 in it and see if it could be my mini-BoW or if I have wasted my points :P<br />
<br />
I am in guild that hasnt killed RZ yet but will very soon (couple of good tries). I am nowhere near being MT, but I would like to be able to do some tanking soon.<br />
MT has dual-EB, and about 5 active warriors have EB+something<br />
<br />
My old weapons were SotB + red epic, I was probably next in line for BoC before I got this weapon if I saved my points. SSRA has been very stingy about EB weapons for us.<br />
I just got tired of waiting for EB, especially with the new system possibly giving some alternate ways to manage aggro.<br />

Gnome Overlord<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
And no, I wouldnt be close to getting BoW. Even if I did nothing but save, I would in best case scenario get it 3rd or 4th.<br />
And I need to stop this stupid saving and get some armor upgrades too :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guildie uses that and swears by it.  One of the top 3 warriors in guild atm, and does not appear to have any agro problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilwee Beasty</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd rank it just above a BoC + non proccing off hand wep in terms of aggro. With Incite, you should be able to hold aggro extremely well. Adding anger 3 to it should make it an extremely viable aggro weapon on almost any raid unless your guild is overflowing with BF's and BoW's or dual EB 1hers.<br />
<br />
Yes I have one, used it sporadically for about a month before I got my BoW (never been a big 2h fan till the BoW opened my eyes). However when I did use it, it performed quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocaly</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every warrior I know has avoided this sword like the plague.  Anything that has a dot proc will make you seriously unpopular with mezzers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always figured the one class that would be LEAST affected by a dot proc would be a warrior, since they can &quot;Tank-Mez.&quot;<br />
<br />
And if it's in an XP group, well, then the DoT'd mob becomes the new target, and the CC works on the other, non-DoT'd mobs. Peeps are supposed to be assisting the tank's target anyways right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always avoided dot-procs.<br />
<br />
Does this happen:<br />
<br />
2 mobs are pullled, both attack MT who has a &quot;dot&quot; weapon.  MT engages Mob2.  Mob1's blow is riposted, and the weapon procs.   No one realizes it, but Mob1 is unmezzable, and eats the chanter, then the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocaly</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So if you dot a mezzable mob the enchanter can tank the unmezzable ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On 100's of raids with a fair number of OG's and a few Basalt's I have yet to see one melee with it be the one who dots a mez mob. Assuming you do everything right(assist, right target, etc etc) the odds of you being the one to dot the wrong mob are astronomically low.<br />
<br />
 Seriously, don't worry about the dot proc as far as mez breaking goes, on a raid anyways. LDoN group it could be more an issue I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought you couldn't proc on a riposte?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;So if you dot a mezzable mob the enchanter can tank the unmezzable ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
/em whispers something about how you warriors now have an aggro DoT SKILL that can go a long way towards helping you multi-tank.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocaly</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info but dots from provoke will not break mezz.  Big difference.  I have seen weapons with boil blood or boiling blood wipe experience groups and cause some frustration during raids (mostly with enchanters).  Basalt Greatsword is a fun weapon but you need to bag it if you are in a situation where you may be switching targets to tank unmezzable adds or tanking mezzables while an enchanter locks them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">draz</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use this weap for dps and like it a lot. But as said earlier you gotta take some caution when using it, blood boil lasts to damn long to dot the wrong mob. In places like vt where there are a lot of mobs that need to be mezzed i usually switch to another weap just to be sure.<br />
But the dps/hp/ac makes it a great weapon, with a anger augment it should be a nice weapon to tank with.<br />
