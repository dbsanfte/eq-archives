<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Vah shir have a progressive series of quests.  Each of the 5 classes progressed through a series of quests (involving a separate tradeskill each...smithing - warrier, tailoring - beastlord, baking - rogue, pottery - bard, brewing - shaman), then you have to have the cooperation of someone from all the other classes to make a Sonic Wolf Bane weapon...then the quest continues (but they're all the same after this).<br />
<br />
Through it all, you have a cloak that slowly gets better and better.  Now, the whole process culminated in a huge raid war (that put the 10th ring war to shame in difficulty and mind-numbingly agonizing pain...not strategicly hard, just sucker-punch hard) that gave you the Hollow Acrylia Obelisk and the Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl.  Those Hero cloaks were theoretically the last in the line, and were useable by all races that could be the class.  When the Grimling Forest change went through, tho, that last step was removed, and no one knows if the Hero cloaks can ever be gotten again.  No one even knows for sure if anyone ever got the Hero cloaks (the links and stats came from an emulator), but there was a patch message that said the shaman hero cloak was changed, so SOMEONE must have gotten it.<br />
<br />
There's a new final cloak now, but it's vah shir only...Officer's Cloak of Service (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=63168).  The hero cloaks are long gone, as far as anyone knows.  You can peruse the Beastlord forums (http://www.eqbeastlord.com/forums/) quest section for information on everything after the sonic wolf bane weapons...however, finding 4 other people who have bothered to do the quests and make the items is the REAL pain...and the rest of the quest stuff is just plain rare.  Lots of trouble, but the cloak is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I got as far as the bane weapon section in the last 2 days, so up to there still works My Spoiler (http://mywebpages.comcast.net/xrac/cloak/cloak.htm)<br />
<br />
I also found this post (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23141)<br />
<br />
This part of the quest doesn't exit anymore (not unless Sony decided to go back to the original Vah Shir class quests with LDoN launch).  Now instead of this you get Officer's Cloak of Service, and btw, the Hero cloaks are no longer available either. Thank Sony for nerfing a great quest item.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is true course, since I haven't found the other people to make the items <br />
(might make twinks and do it) but if the Hero doesn't drop then screw it the effort is worthless.<br />
