<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When using defensive disc, as well as taking less damage, you lose a corresponding amount of your DPS.  While using stonewall, you don't lose this DPS, but you have being snared instead as the penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont think you can cornertank with stonewall, for some reason it warps you outta the wall, and closer to the mob. I may be wrong though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, Stonewall is the disc you use when dps really matters.  Like, for instance, you're fighting one of those challenging boss mobs with a single group where all the extra dps helps.  Otherwise, the mitigation is the same.  For raids, I never use Stonewall.  I simply don't like the idea of losing my mobility just so I can do an extra 40 or so dps.  That's the job of rangers, rogues, necros, and whoever else does sizeable dps.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, it's a great disc, but I don't think it was intended for raid purposes.  I think it was really put there for single group GoD trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use both defensive and stonewall.<br />
<br />
Stonewall is very nice for group encounters, since your dps isn't hindered.<br />
<br />
On raids I use both, depends on encounter.  If mob is permarooted, I will use stonewall, otherwise i will use defensive for the added mobility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like Froggerx said, stonewall is not good for corner tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">gotta strife left and right to move the mobs when in stonewall, sorta sucks =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never had an issue using stonewall while corner tanking. If you strafe while using stonewall you move at fullspeed so mobility isn't an issue :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost always use stonewall for corner tanking also.  There may be an issue if you have to backup a long way to get the mob to the corner but as Payn says strafing lets you move pretty quick while stonewalled.  I've never had a problem with stonewall once in the corner.<br />
<br />
Otherwise defensive on raids vs non cornered mobs, stonewall vs cornered mobs, mobs that snare and in single group situations like LDoNs and GoD trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use stonewall when I need to gain aggro fast, and mobility isn't such a big issue, like in Time p1-3. The snare is kind of bad as in you can't move backwards unless you strafe or turn 180 degrees, but it's workable with some practice (using mouselook to move, like in a FPS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewall is my favorite defensive style disc.<br />
Only time I wont use it be against mobs like Yel that AE a knockback.<br />
<br />
Mobility for me is not an issue for tanking and it has no negitive impacrt on my cornering.<br />
<br />
For me its an issue of DPS or no DPS.<br />
Thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">do you generate less aggro per swing while defensive?<br />
<br />
i know that actual dps has little to do with aggro, and the potential dps is what is key ... but when you lower potential dps in defensive .. does it lower your aggro generation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Stonewall when cornering all the time.  Mob knockback is usually more than enough to keep me safely ensconced in the corner and once I'm in the corner, I don't care in the least about my mobility.  As far as I know, yes, Defensive lowers your dps aggro.  <br />
<br />
My defensive-type disc choice is Stonewall &gt; Evasive &gt; Defensive.</div></div><hr />

The use of Stonewall is not causing you warp out of the wall and closer to the mob.  That's the direct result of the Geometric glitch caused by introduction of the new graphic engine and it's very buggy collision detection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much like others, I use stonewall situationally when DPS matters, which is pretty much in one group situations.  The mobility thing is annoying but I can deal with it when more dps is required.<br />
<br />
On raids I use defensive since my personal DPS is just a tiny percent of the overall and it's nice to not have to deal with the snare which can be annoying if you're fighting something outside of a corner where you have to move and adjust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being snared is annoying but damn there's nothing I hate more than being blinded, then when it's cured you seen on the screen, &quot;i'M blnd cuer me motehr fkuers!~&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe ya mobs that proc blind suck, either you have someone chain rgc'ing it, and you start getting sick because the screen is blinking, or you hydra and can just look through the other window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I rarely use defensive anymore...there is just no need when stonewall does the same relative thing and has the benefit of the additional DPS.  I'll use def only when mobility is absolutely required (KB effect like AL etc)....for corners it really is nice.<br />
<br />
The other nice thing about stonewall is that you can use to solo blue mobs; albeit not many but still better than w/o.</div></div><hr />

GoD trials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't really parsed anything out but I favor stonewall over defensive because I believed that was what it was supposed to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same mitigation.<br />
<br />
Just choose between -45% damage modifier or a 70% snare.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I will become a STONEWALL !!!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Straffing is when you use CRTL+right/left arrow to move sideways, or in the case of tanking, use CRTL+right/left arrow while moving forward or backwards to move diagonally. Due to the way EQ code works, when you are snared you can still strafe at full speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Wandor will try this when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to strafe is to hold down on your right mouse button while using the left/right arrow keys. It's a little simpler to do on the fly since your fingers are already on the keys.</div></div><hr />
