<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just last night, I inherited a BoC from a former guildmate who is temporarily retired. While I was estatic...I'm also worried.<br />
<br />
Offensively, I have TM1 and PB1 - which leads me to continue to use my GSot4W (aug'd with 50 fire DD, for cheap, 40AP) for general DPS, mob control, and fewer ripostes.<br />
<br />
However, I did try out the BoC. I mean, I'm not stupid (I don't think). I mainhanded it, and tried a variety of weapons offhand - red epic, blue epic, AP Mace. The aggro wasn't too much of a problem - proc proc proc constantly, and the mob was mine, so it was hard to judge the effectiveness of the offhand, but my dps suffered so much, my small-group adventures (war/clr/mag - sometimes add nec) were suffering from a significant DPS decrease.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on just bagging it for big boss fights...my guild currently does mobs on the level of Vindi (attempts, no successes yet) and PoStorms Named giants (mini-bosses, not the big lords). I've had extensive tanking experience in a much more powerful guild - TT, MB, AoW, NToV, RoVulak, Ssra named, etc - even though I was the &quot;baby tank&quot; at the time; meaning, I know my tanking game. But am I missing something important by not using the BoC all the time?<br />
<br />
Would acquiring Ambidexterity increase my DPS enough to make up for this amazing loss I seemed to have?<br />
<br />
In my mind, saving up for AngerIII for my GSot4W would result in better aggro and DPS, but maybe I need to put that on the BoC and on red epic or on a Premier Mace of the Secundae...<br />
<br />
EDIT - while I'm posting, I'm also taking suggestions on upgrading my equipment, and on AA advancement - current plan is CA3, LR1, CS2, CS3, ID1, then on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use the BoC in situations when you NEED agro (Raids).<br />
<br />
For XP, unless agro is way out of control due to others, just use your GSot4W. Especially when dps matters like LDoN.<br />
<br />
Ambidex helps a little, but won't help put your DPS with BoC anywhere near GSot4W.<br />
<br />
Put Anger on the BoC. If you put it on the GSot4W you will no longer be able to use it for dps when you are NOT tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I agree with the poster above.  What I do it use my two hander unless agro is a big problem then I switch to my dual wield setup (BoC and such).  I would advise you to do the same.  BoC + anything is more agro than GSo4W, but often the GSo4W has enough agro to get the job done and its not worth losing lots of damage by using the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Adding to what other folks said...I see 3 setups:<br />
<br />
1. dual wield high agro (low dps)<br />
2. 2 handed high agro (moderate dps)<br />
3. 2 handed DPS (high dps)<br />
<br />
It looks like you just upgraded your first capability, have a solid #3 capability and now are questioning the second.  <br />
<br />
My experience is the the 2nd capability is only needed in exp groups that have high agro compoents (say incredibly high dps exp groups).  Odds are you could use the BoC in those situations (unless you just buy a GSoT and put an anger mod on it).<br />
<br />
Any how just my 2 coppers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sold my BoC, and my other options for weapons are SoD/Copper Hammer and Windblade, if that gives you any idea of what my logic behind it was.  The BoC, while nice, is just not what everyone makes it out to be.  It is indeed, the pinnacle of tradable warrior aggro, useful for when you absolutely require that the mob stays on you, but since I don't do much raiding, and my DPS is relatively important, I had it bagged for like 2 months.  Having a 400k weapon bagged is just fuckin retarded, so I sold it.  Haven't really played in a month, but I really doubt i'm going to miss it.  It is useful, no doubt, but it's not the be all/end all weapon some people make it out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Flurry AA help immensely with the BOC.<br />
<br />
If you want to use it get flurry. Bonus for you is flurry applies to two handers as well.<br />
<br />
Cant stress how nice Flurry and Raging Flurry is as an AA line for tanks both DPS wise and aggro wise regardless of weapon choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any idea which is more dps, the BoC or the CHoS with the proc factored in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Imho the gsot4winds is a much better weapon than a BoC.  I've seen a well aa'd warrior tank RZ and lesser pop bosses with 4winds and have no problems really with aggro or otherwise.  And that was before augments.  BoC is a fine choice for VT on down, but I don't see it really has a place in PoP or LDoN.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I would be happy with the flexiblity augmentation provides. . . I'd put anger3 on the greatstaff4winds and use it as your primary exp and tanking weapon.  You can use a frigging warmashall staff for dps on bosses when you're not tanking if you need to.  Once you upgrade to another aggro weapon setup, you can change out the proc on the greatstaff4winds to some non-aggro DD and have a sweet dps weapon when you don't want aggro.  The only weapons that are like to be an upgrade from greatstaff would be bladeofwar, obsidiangreatblade (barely), bloodfrenzy or hategiver (to use with BoC), sews. . .but from the sounds of your raid capability, it sounds like GSot4winds is the best weapon you're likely to get for awhile.  I'd be very happy with that and make the best of it with anger3.<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">anger3 is 1 handers only i thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anger3 is now usable on 2handers as well. I've got it on my Stone Etched Warsword and I'm holding and stealing agro like a champ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since the BoC is a loan, for an indefinite amount of time (possibly permanently), I'm leery of spending tons of points to put a major augment into it - I don't acquire points very quickly, and I'm working up to the level where I can at least GET AngerIII and Permafrost augs for my weapons.<br />
<br />
My thinking is to put some small DD procs on my offhand DW aggro setup (I use red epic, because I've got it, and it works) and into the BoC - that way, if I burn the augment to return the BoC, I'm not out a ton of points, but it still boosts the effectiveness of the sword.<br />
<br />
I'm also wavering b/w a big DD proc (permafrost) or AngerIII on the GSot4W, since, as mentioned above, if I'm not the tank, I won't have a DPS setup. I suppose I should look into getting a warmarshall's staff, or a GSOT, or something. Maybe even reduce myself back to the 2h epic, since that proc never really stole aggro for me...<br />
<br />
In any case, I'll probably go with A3 on the big 2h, since it is the best weapon I'm likely to see (...for a very long time).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice, folks. I feel I have a good idea of when to whip out the DW Aggro grabbers (like when I tank Vindi, and the priests are heal-happy).<br />
<br />
Any comments on my gear? (Magelo is posted)</div></div><hr />
