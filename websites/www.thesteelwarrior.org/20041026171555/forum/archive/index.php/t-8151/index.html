<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While going to check Ring of Slime ( :mad: the change _ when was it changed btw?  :p )  for my warrior, I meet a nice little group of well geared characters untagged, being a curious person, I made some fast little research and oh surprised what was I thought was right..<br />
A screenshot is worth a thousand words  :<br />
<br />

<br />
I added their &quot;old&quot; guild tag naturally ( ops there is no S at steels sorry ! ), this &quot;group&quot; is on karana ( they are farming 4C in CT mainly and  gogo MQ at first view too... ), so it is happening on other servers too?<br />
<br />
And happily that cross server transfert supposely didn't allow this kind of things!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So what you're saying is 6 people from various uberguilds transferred to your server for the purpose of farming CT?  I don't know why they would do this, but I also don't see why it would be a problem.  Sorry I don't understand what your concern is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all the char has been ebayed/bought. ( magelo with named like &quot;cleric&quot; or &quot;enchanter&quot; ).<br />
My concern is 1/ is this kind of shit is happened on other servers <br />
2/ how in the world they could transfert when they aren't original character ( cross server transfert policy ).<br />
3/How they can be at one place in CT, then the next second at top of 4C all stacking exactly at the same place ( my main is a wizard so  I can bind sight ).</div></div><hr />

Hope they read the manuels.</div></div><hr />

What was changed?  Also what is it you think they are doing wrong besides ebay/PA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">prolly used the macroquest thing to warp to that spot. if thats what your getting at.<br />
<br />
did you realy think pa didn't buy up all the good farming bots. they can prolly make back the money spent on one good farm bot in a cupple hours.</div></div><hr />

I have been away for like 5 / 6months from EQ, and it was the first time I have seen this kind of group, so I was a bit surprised and amusing to see ebayed char from 5different guilds... <br />
<br />
Else for RoS, it poped to his bind point ( instead to where the runner dies )  and it poped adds during the event....so his adds ( an acidistic ooze, 2 times the size of the mass ) while killing the 5 oozes repoped was kinda annoying....dunno if it pops more adds also later or not :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wtf, little behind the times?<br />
<br />
People have been selling characters forever, and it's easy to transfer servers via Stormhammer, and has been forever.<br />
<br />
That's the way it is, no use worrying about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Strange anyhow that they would grab 'known' players to farm lightweight stuff.  Whatever though, I guess it could be a bit annoying.<br />
<br />
Heck, there's been a hydra of 6 in SolRo's tower for as long as I can remember on The Nameless (Hi Mike!) farming ornate cheerfully.  (Actually, we all kinda like Mike because he keeps the zone core pretty much clear of mobs which cuts down on the need to clear into the chamber or wherever folks are heading.)  I'm sure there are other farm-teams in various zones and of course it can suck if you want a legitimate shot at the mobs but there we are.  Hell, I remember the hydra team that farmed the backside of 4c using casters levved on the walls not two months after the zone was revamped also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They just opened up Stromm recently. :mad: <br />
Couple troublemakers have bought time chars/wars because they had shot their Rep's and transferred them in for their bot armys.<br />
<br />
Some nice folks also got their friends/significant others to come over too though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea, someone definetely farms BoT towers and other crap here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We've got a bot crew that farms Sol Ro all the time.  Moving from one place to another in the zone instantly is a macroquest warp thingy.  Report it if you see it or something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tanok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">RoS changes are as follows:<br />
<br />
The acidic mass pops at the trigger spot regardless of where you kill anything else, and is rooted.  <br />
<br />
If any character walks out of the back circular room where the event is triggered after acidic mass pops, he will spawn adds at a rapid rate, till that person comes back in.  <br />
<br />
I am not certain, but I also believe he periodically spawns these adds, regardless of where players are (maybe every 5-10 minutes, not sure on this).<br />
<br />
This also means that every 15-20 minutes the 5 room spawns will add on you.  <br />
<br />
Definately not 2-3someable as it was before, potential still there to 1 group it, but it would take at least an hour with all of the adds, and you would need a very skilled coordinated group.  <br />
<br />
I doubt you'll see many people who would use the gear for anything other then twinking that are even capable of doing this event anymore, and those that are doing it for twinking will probably find it not worth their time anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spent about 20 or more hours helping him camp phinny for his epic.<br />
<br />
Nice guy ... or was ... not sure if he ebayed or not.</div></div><hr />
