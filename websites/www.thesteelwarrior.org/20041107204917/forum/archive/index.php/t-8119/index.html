<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some guildies of mine have experienced getting hit through furious (although the mob is in the front arc)<br />
Is this something that others have experienced?<br />
Some suggestions is that mobs have been given some sort of tactical mastery skill ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Flurry and rampage both hit through it, not sure about reg attacks going through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive seen this happen a few times too. I might be because of lag or something but it could also be b/c the mobs are reposting back.  Its not that big of a deal to me at least b/c if never had the mob get enough attacks through to kill me anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If they have attack on they could be getting ripostes from the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is actualy an emotr that tells you he has you on agro and is gona ignore you. It is not reposts and not warriors not haveing agro it is a game change for repost. A monk and rogue both got the same text as well btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is actualy an emotr that tells you he has you on agro and is gona ignore you<br />
<br />
Hmm...that sounds like the Tipt/Ikkinz anti-defensive emote?</div></div><hr />

I bet this is it.  Fortitude is the way to go on a mob that flurries a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they repost your repost i think lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As mentioned before, Rampage and Flurry both hits through Furious.  Enrage also hits through Furious (pretty sure it's treated as if neither mob nor player can riposte).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This has happened to me once when I was tanking on a boss.  100% sure it wasnt a flurry although I did get hit with a quad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Against a mob that doesn't flurry or rampage I get parry's and dodges mixed in with ripostes for some reason. Only thing I can attribute it to is that the mob riposted my riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LUMMP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Had this happen on Smith Rondo last night. Hit me twice before i got furious off for about 6k in damge, I know should have done furiuos before Bellow. Then he fluried me thru furious 2 more times for about 6k more. SPLAT<br />
<br />
Not sure this is ripost damage as I havent witnessed this with mobs that dont flurry. Pretty sure its the Flurry damage.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, if you furious when a mob ENRAGES, its considered null, neither side works, and you melee normally as well as the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vyrance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I saw someone mentioned earlier about the tipt boss and using defensive against him.  I got the emote for him &quot;ignoring you&quot; because i accidentally used defensive.  Yet i didn't lose aggro once during the fight.  He shouted the msg about 15 times during the fight and didn't seem like anything special was happening.  Seems that using defensive just lowers your aggro, doesn't act like a DA though and completely wipes aggro.<br />
<br />
A mob that i always forgot not to use furious on is Hydrotha.  He always came out with those quick flurries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">DA doesn't wipe agro. It lowers you on the hate list, then when it wears off it puts you right back where you were hate wise (of course if the tank is doing his job you will be OK since they have built more hate the the last 18 sec).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Haven't done this recently, but furious/etc when they first came out was used during enrage to crash zones and force a repop of velious mobs. After that they changed it so you cannot riposte a riposte- If you fired furious on enrage, neither you nor the mob could be hit by normal melee or riposte- You'd do a normal attack, mob would riposte, you'd get the message that you riposte but you wouldn't actually swing. Same thing if mob attacked you normal, you'd riposte, get the message that he'd riposte, but no actual swing.<br />
<br />
I've never seen a mob get through furious except for rampage/flurry, or didn't notice it if I did, but wouldn't be surprised to see a mob with some sort of strikethrough mod, TM and Strikethrough have been in game since PoP and VI likes to add PC abilities to mobs. Especially with the cry to nerf furious going up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There's no mobs with any kind of strikethrough ability as far as I am aware of.<br />
<br />
If you furious and a mob enrages, you will both hit through each other's auto riposte.  The game seems to just treat it as if both of you can't riposte to avoid dealing with potentially infinite loops of riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Use fortitude on God mobs..<br />

No.</div></div><hr />

Please go into less detail.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Mobs that flurry or Ramp it is  a good idea to use it,If your MT goes down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I tell all my tanks in the tank line to pop furious and then call the attack or something thet lets the clerics know you are for shure the next tank in the tank line.  The only thing I have seen hit through Furious is special attacks like Flurry or a Rampage. I have even used furious on AoW he didnt hit through furious.  Wich i will say clerics love when you use furious  if your MT goes down and your the new tank. Even if he does hit through it a few times the dammage will  be a signifacant  amount  so that the rot can start on you.<br />
  I use fellstrike on  boss mobs after my /def is down that way I can get some good hits in before I go down. I also use my 2hander for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If something can kill you through Furious with people actually healing you, you really should consider the effectiveness of the healers.  It can happen, but it really shouldn't.</div></div><hr />
