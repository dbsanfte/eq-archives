<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK lets say you have 10 warriors in your guild. have 9 of them disband from the guild and join another guild. then declair guildwar on that guild. then when you get to the Boss of a zone you have everone in the guild bunch up around the Boss and summon as much pets and swarmp pets as you can. then have all 9 warriors Shakerpage the guild.  this will cause a nice amount of damage to any boss that isnt resistant to Earthquake.  and as long as you have bard playing resist song, the guild should be protected from getting hit.<br />
<br />
warriors can repeat this everytime Rampage refreshes. (Raidpage)<br />
<br />
:)  *hands out Cookies and Little Milkboxes and Handi-Wipes*<br />
<br />
NOTE: If  I remember corectly Bladestorm's Rain of Swords effect hits the weilder also Unless there is a giant class mob in range. then the Giant will take the hit or block the hit. if thats corect then your can Rampage with Bladestorm and have every proc the rampage causes to hit the boss mob.  even if its 1 hit per person, as long as the giant class boss is in range he will take twice as much damage as if you use earthshaker...just a lastminute thought.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">funny stuff ... but dont you realize that in doing so you  will probably wipe out your entire raid at the same time?<br />
<br />
Hehe ... zerg dps is rarely the problem with boss mob encounters ... it just seems like an awful lot of trouble for ~200-500k zerg blast ... <br />
<br />
still ... i'd be funny as hell to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am thinking It would potentially be around 150k to 300k damage per mob/player affected if 10 slowed warriors used rampage + earthshaker on a raid force of 72.<br />
<br />
Roughly:  280ish damage per proc x 50 procs/war x 10 wariors = approximately 140k but that is not including WA, crit blasts, or a few dozen pets either so this could be almost double.  I sure hope those bard songs are effective because it will be the fastest wipe ever if not.  <br />
<br />
The spam would probably crash the zone but if someone does it i would love to see the parse summary.<br />
<br />
As a back up plan, everyone could level up a shadow knight alt with all HT AA skills and do a mass harm touch to finish off the mob if the first blast doesn't do it.</div></div><hr />

This should be try, at least just for fun.</div></div><hr />

afterall in the fight mechanic, the raid crew is just spectator from the Boss point of view.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder if they would be able to loot the Boss prior to anybody else :rolleyes:<br />
this open interesting perspectives.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smells like an exploit, you'll need 10 people to form a guild and everyone in that guild could be banned...although I'd love to see some screenshots and dps parsage as well.  Oh yeah, does anyone but the warriors get RPP (points awarded for attending said raid)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just a note, but swarm pets would have little to no effect.<br />
<br />
Swarm pets have 100hp (or about that, iirc), so the first warrior to proc would kille them all. That warrior would only get the benefit of that 1 hit + any player/mob/normal pet in range, and the rest of the warriors would only get the effect of any player/mob/normal pet. Fun idea, just too bad it would not work =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why can't the 2 guilds at war be in the same raid? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How many people in the raid do you think will resist &gt;95% of the Earthshaker AE's in order to survive them?<br />
<br />
If &gt;200k AE damage is resistable by players, then why would it pose any danger to a raid mob?<br />
<br />
Here's what will happen:  The first warrior to hit the rampage key will slaughter the entire raid.<br />
<br />
The next 9 warriors will have no targets left to rampage except the mob itself.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a good enough reason to try it anyway heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">not really, most npcs are debuffed or have low resists, so spells with little rseist modifiers can land on them, npcs cast spells at -150+ resists, that can be reliably resisted by PC's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So what if you kill everyone else in the guild. Just put one cleric in the guild with the warriors to res the rest after. And as said even if it cant work, it sure would be fun to try. But would be even better on a raid with multiple mobs needing to be killed instead of a single boss mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So what if you kill everyone else in the guild. <br />
My point is that the idea only works if the rampage targets survive, which they won't.  Don't get me wrong, though, it was a cool idea. :)<br />
<br />
280 damage * 110% for Ing3 * 1/1 proc rate slowed with WA5 * 72 rampage targets = about 22k damage done to each target by one warrior, before resists.<br />
<br />
If the players resist 90% of the damage and average 7k hp each, then the 4th warrior to hit rampage will (on average) wipe out all of the players. :)<br />
<br />
The mob will have taken about 88k damage before resists, which is not enough to kill Vindicator or Glykus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I still think the best use of Rampage + Earthshaker is warrior soloing (with bots) at about 5 aa an hour...or powering toons from 44-65 in a week.</div></div><hr />

you think about the earth cycle isn't it?</div></div><hr />

eh who cares this would kick ass.</div></div><hr />

The 50 page long log and damage parse would be worth seeing for that as well.  A 300 mob earthshaker rampage would be somewhere around 15 million damage.   Nothing with under 40 to 50k hp would survive it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I suggested this back when we where doing CoD but people said that you cant have more then 100 skells spawn. never bothered to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If the players resist 90% of the damage <br />
<br />
Earthshake is a Magic based PB with no resist modifier so we could expect a 500MR player to have more than 90% domage avoided.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FYI there appears to be a limit on how many mobs can be affected by a PBAE, I think its around 100.  I've tried repeatedly shaking with ~150 and a goodly number weren't even hit by the AE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe the pb radius was smaller than the mobs dispersion radius. but it might be possible to be capped at 100.<br />
Nevertheless, we only want to touch tem all with rampage and that the big boss receive all the pb (is others don't receive them all, we don't care. actually it would solve the pb of killing the rampage pool before all the tanks had rampaged them all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Pappee Puddlejumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am on a pvp server.  I do this to my guild all the time.  If it is a stong AE pull.  I get a proc from everyone and every mob.   I am MT and I dont even call it anymore.   I just do it whenever I feel it is a huge enough AE pull.  This instant aggros all the mobs on AE pull.  If you pin yourself in a corner and hit furious afterward then defensive you will generate enough aggro to tank the entire AE.  Wizards just finish all the mobs off safely.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes other warriors will walk up to the AE and do the shaker thang.  It can save you from a wipe if everyone knows what you are doing.<br />
<br />
BTW the AE from earthshaker does not hit your raid.  As long as you are raided everyone in the raid will get hit by your rampage and be immune to your AE.  At least this is how it is on PVP servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Personally.. I want to see a rampage with like 10+ warriors with Pet weapons. Granted their proc rates aren't increased like earthshaker, but if you did it on 70 or so mobs with 10 warriors.. 30 pets up at once would be amazing. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Interesting, Pappee.. if two blue-server guilds are engaged in guildwar, and they join the same raid, do they become immune to each others' AE's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I am not used at all with PvP, but, Papee, can you really hit a groupmate in blue server? because it looks strange to be able to swing at them (rampage) but not casting at them (AE proc). Or do you disband from the group and/or raid prior to rampage to be able to attack them ?<br />
Because if you use this tactics sometimes/often as you said, you shouldn't be on another guild during all the raid just for the case you need to rampage.<br />
<br />
Can you give us more expanation please.</div></div><hr />
