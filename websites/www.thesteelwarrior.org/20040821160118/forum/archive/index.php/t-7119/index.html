<br />
Dev_01 &quot;OK fellas, I just got out of a meeting with the big wigs and hot topic of the day is to stop the downhill slide of long term players, guilds and ubers all folding and moving onto other games. We need to come up with something FAST.<br />
<br />
Dev_02 &quot;I know!! Let's lift the level cap to 70! I know we said we would never do it, but think about it, no one can resist the level race even after 5 years of burnout right?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev_03 &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Let's also add Epic version 2.0. Yes I know we said we would never do it but if we make it totally unrelated to existing epics and aimed at the high end players then they will come back in droves! Nothing pulls everyone back to EQ than having their own new big shiny dick swinger to show off to everyone else!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev_01 &quot;Yeah, this is sounding more like it! Even though we wern't planning an expansion but we need something to hold the ship together until EQ2 is out. Lets get together a flyer, some blurbs, some prelim drawings, package it all together and have something ready for pre-order, I'll run it past the big wigs and lets get it out there!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is really how it happened. Honest!<br />
<br />
/snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Funny. But their intensions were to always release GoD as a 2 part expansion, with all the &quot;perks&quot; that were rumoured to go into GoD part1 (ie, Levels, Epic2)~ <br />
<br />
Keep trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like Britty's version better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought Epic 2.0 was a rumor started with velious :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LoV was PoP part 2, <br />
<br />
OoW is part of GoD ..<br />
<br />
Think they do alot of programing for expansion, packs first one with content, and puts the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; into the second one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OoW is part of GoD ..<br />
<br />
So if you hate GoD, don't bother buying OoW eh?  Good, that's a relief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good one with the write up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is anyone else sick of them pumping out expansions at a rate of a couple per year, without addressing the bugs/issues of previous ones? I mean seriously, this is the first one I am looking at with a &quot;no way unless it makes the game unplayable for me&quot; attitude... and if it does that, I might just say to hell with it. This dropping $30 every time some exec at SOE needs to take a shit is getting old...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dizastor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so if OoW is part of GoD then it's free to those who bought GoD ... RIGHT?<br />
<br />
and if you didn't buy GoD you get it free with the purchase of OoW?<br />
<br />
Yeah... and then I woke up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Hey mike, lets eat at tocobell&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
later that night<br />
<br />
(mike) man i gota use a toilet!<br />
<br />
and thus, OoW was created! hazaah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What really stinks is that when they raise the lvl cap the almost force you to buy the expansion. If not you start suffering even in basic pickup groups especially as a warrior. Hmmm lvl 70 war lfg and a lvl 65 war lfg. Easy to figure out who is going to get asked to grp first.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I am afraid of is alot of the content my guild is still working towards will beciome trivial with 5 more lvls. Our guild is by no means ready for elementals much less Time. Would like to hear from some that are at this to reply with how easy the content might become at 70 vs 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Okay, let me ask this.  Is OoW going to be another expansion primarily targetted at the high end player like PoP and GoD were?  Is it going to be one of those expansions where the average player can poke around in the first couple of zones but forget about seeing anything any deeper?  Because as far as I'm concerned, if that's the case, they can forget it.  I won't buy it even with a level increase.  Because it's just a freaking waste of $40 bucks for me and people like me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">basically they were gona make GoD 1 expantion, but then they decided to take all the bells and whisles out of it and put it in a differnt expantion, OoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cazzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ALOT of things were fixxed with the recent retune of GoD. they made Kod taz a worthwild xp zone, and alot of the dx9 bugs are only due to the fact the engine isnt fully in yet. <br />
<br />
Personally OoW wont be a bad expansion, lvl 70 = win, epic 2.0 = win (even if they suck it would be nice to have) , new AAs, tradeskills, content....maybe its the fact i am in an end game guild that i see this as good or maybe not /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I liked GoD, a lot, before the retune. Now I love it. Frankly, I think your all a bunch of whiners. Now excuse me while I get back to the game I love.</div></div><hr />

It's a damn good thing no one cares what you think then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>drake247</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What i find is that most people dont understand that it can take a long time to fix bugs and things. People kept winning about epics and they got them. People wanted easier ways to travle and they did. People wanted more things to do as high lvls and they did. They complain about not enough low lvl stuff. get your butt out of PC and go explore you got the karanas, kurns, a good portion of Kunark, alot of velious is made for mid lvls, luclin has a lot of zones like HSM and SWT besides pc. Theres also runnye eye and perma frost which are great places. But just remeber things can take time with SOE</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is, for people like me, who played before even kunark was out...I've been there, done that.  I loved the game back then, had loads of fun.  Now, with two 65's under my belt, elemental flaggige, cool toys...I find I hate the game, I can't stand to log in for more than 5 minutes at a stretch.<br />
<br />
Why?  Its hard to want to play, when you've died 6 times due to NGE bugs...getting you stuck in geometry and having mobs beat you down but you can't hit back, falling beneath the world, crashing in PoK...the list of new bugs that have totally broken the game for me goes on and on.  Don't hand me this BS about bugs take time to fix.  These glaring, obvious, game breaking bugs should have NEVER went live to start with.  PERIOD.  They have a test server, how about testing things before it goes live eh?  And now, with higher end people leaving in droves, many many people having issues with  the NGE...suddenly we have a new expansion...again.  With there still being a few issues with PoP, and still many more to go with GoD, game breaking bugs running rampant still...and they want more money from me?  We're going to get another expansion thats only half finished and riddled with even more bugs to expound on the bugs from the LAST expansion thats STILL not finished?<br />
<br />
No thanks.<br />
<br />
Both accounts already canceled, its too late for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This expansion will work for those people in the higher end of the game (Elementals, Time, etc).  However for those that are the casual players its a waste of their cash.  Personally I think this is only a ploy to hang onto those kind of players until EQ2 comes out.  Maybe I'm talking out of my rear end on this, but as Drach said <br />

Increasing the level cap in and of itself proves that this is not the case.  Even if you can't explore the content or get epic 2.0, you can get to level 70 as a casual player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is a fact and I have not bought the expansion as of yet but I am serriously considering it. I have no intrest in any of the other games out there now. I will play the beta of EQ2 and decide if I am going to continue playing or find something else to do with my time. I have cut back some of my playing time already and will be cutting back more as the wife is getting excited about doing some gardening and landscapeing.  :eek:  :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
/flame suit on<br />
I hate the bugs as much as anyone but I also know about how hard programming is as that is what I do some of for databases and you change one line and you can screw up tons of things.<br />
<br />
As for the comments of try it on the test server while yes that is the way it should be done there is no ammount of testing that can be done as everyone who plays the game uses different hardware and has different things loaded on their rigs. What I mean is that while Mob X is in the ground to me the rest of my group says he looks fine and when they swear Mob Z is in the ground it is fine to me. <br />
<br />
There is work to be done for sure but as far as I am conserned I can live with the minor inconvineces at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Groovey, so you can be a level 70 player that can no longer gain experience in the majority of the game except for a few places in PoP and GoD?  Sounds like fun.  And know that your gear still won't see any significant improvements beyond late Velious era gear unless you commit to a raiding guild or spending a six month or longer stretch living in LDoN?  Gee, sounds like great value for an expansion huh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
    And ? lvl 70 is a BAD BAD BAD move !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should hope you enjoy it. It was aimed specifically towards your segment of the EQ population. Someone like myself who bought it blindly on 2 accounts through the pre-order process should rightfully feel cheated. I enjoy this game, but I don't like the whole bait and switch thing they pulled.<br />
<br />
And I agree with what Glatius2 says about the post 65 levels. PoP isolated me too much last time to want to rush into leveling again. Besides, I still need a ton of old AA's before I obsolete my gear.</div></div><hr />

Well other than this new gay bug, I concur completely.Content wise EQ is more fun than ever to me.Now if they would stop breaking stuff that worked.....</div></div><hr />

Since you can at the very least explore the ground-level content (think the PoJ of pop, or the natimbi of god), you will have the new expansion to explore.  You will have plenty of unforseen places to explore (BoT towers, HoHb, PoTactics, Hard LDoN (which becomes like easy) wings are all 64-68 and would be within the 5level limit up to 70)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that increasing the cap to level 70 will be nice for the guilds that are just barely not able to get to elementals or time and have lots of casual players but are stagnating from lack of progress.  There are still a huge number of people who have not seen plane of time, etc. and for them this will be nice.  If there are enough new zones in OoW then it could possibly relieve a lot of overcrowding if it is implemented correctly.  <br />
<br />
I think the biggest effect on casual players will be that it will open up a lot of the previously higher level experience areas in zones for them where before they needed elemental or time equipment to group in before (such as castle 2 in PoFire, red mobs in tactics, or areas deeper in GoD) like the above poster mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If I had to guess i'd bet that GoD and OoW were origiianlly conceieved as one big expstnation, eventually soe cheif people said something like we need an expstnation out by feb 10th, devs said no way it will be done by then so chopped it in half and did it as GoD, but a lot of the problems we saw were becuase it was origianlly intended for level 70's, but they had to quickly scale it back, while trying to fix bugs, and and still had to release it by a certain date, so it was pretty untuned.</div></div><hr />
