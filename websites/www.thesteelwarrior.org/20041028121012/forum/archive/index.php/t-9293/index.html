<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tooby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello, <br />
<br />
Still wielding the old droga combo with AIII, and im getting a little tired of it. Then theres this new weapon, Sludge Covered Short Sword, 14/19, Vampire Claw (40dd), 75hp, 10dex, 10str, 15 sta, goes for 2 - 5k on luclin.<br />
<br />
now, i can see that the proc is poor vs Sotb, but for offhand - and without any WA im not relying on ofhand procs for aggro - would the better ratio make up for it? then off course there is more hp from raw hp and sta which, while not a decider, does not hurt.<br />
<br />
Did anyone try it, and is there a verdict. Its sellling like its junk - is it?<br />
<br />
oh and a final thing. The old Splitblade o destruction which seems to be love-to-hate no1 on this site. 90hp-20ac- offhand. For me at 5600, 1270 that makes some differnce (its better than my wrist items). If it cost the same would you still rate it below SoTB, is the aggro really that much worse despite a 15ish% better ratio?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It could cost 15 plat.<br />
SotBS is vastly superior.<br />
<br />
There is a reason 90% of full time warriors despise the SBoD.<br />
It REALLY sucks.<br />
<br />
And the new weapon has a life tap.<br />
Also craptastic aggro.<br />
<br />
Stick with Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is obviously no great aggro-weapon.<br />
But regarding the very low price (probably because of the level 66 requirement) i think it can be a nice weapon for soloing (livetap) or DPS (if you dont use a 2-Hander).<br />
At least there are no other buyable and warrior usable 1-hand weapons with a ratio like this and such a low price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually had the same question so I took my Anger II out of my SotB and stuck in this thing.....and the aggro was sad. <br />
<br />
Just say no to the Sludge-covered for an aggro combo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ugle Smashur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Saw this blade last night, equipped, for the first time.  It looks like the original Ykesha graphic...if anyone remembers those, before the kukri design was implemented.<br />
<br />
Bought one for a couple k and gave to my Ranger, for kicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ya, aggro on this thing is gonna suck, even with an aug. However, unless you had a better ratio weapon, wouldn't be a terrible dps non-aggro weapon for those times when you don't actually tank anything ;) However, the asstastic graphic of this weapon leaves little to be desired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and without any WA im not relying on ofhand procs for aggroNot having any WA AAs doesn't change the fact that you ARE still getting alot of aggro from the procs in your offhand. Don't give any a proc up for a few extra stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
isn't that what the spiroc wingblade looked like too when you equipped it?<br />
now i remember the sword from karnors that looked like that too; swordbreaker ( or something close..bladebreaker?, it was 9/20 +10AC) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's the old school yak / bloodfire graphic, as noted. The thick bladed diamond shape with red hilt.</div></div><hr />

How does agro on these weapons compare to the Yak procs?  The Jagged Antiquity is fairly cheap on my server, if the proc give good agro I might try it out.</div></div><hr />

Picked up one for 1k :) I was very surprised at how cheap it was, highest priced was 5k.  Am I wrong or is this just as good as a CHoS?  Going to give it a try, at least I have that and a FSSoY so I'm no longer cookie cutter LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/cry i want some of those...but im too poor to buy any and my guild cant take down some of the mobs that drop em.  oh well, ill just keep workin on my epic 1.0...only 3 mobs to go...</div></div><hr />
