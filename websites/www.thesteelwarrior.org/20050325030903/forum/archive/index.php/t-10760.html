This totally blows.<br />

Thanks SoE for another not so obvious push toward DoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We ran into it last weekend with a mini raid. The problem seemed to be that the mobs were spawning underground is all. They could still be pulled with AE type spells to clear ph's and pop named. My guess its just another accidental bug related to positions/graphics engines.</div></div><hr />

Do it in a reasonable manner, please, Grumbuk is one of the ones who listens. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, which ones are like this? I'm not attacking you or anything, but having something a little more substantial than &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;most&quot; are screwed up may help. I remember Discordling Enchainer was like this, but what other ones have you seen that are no longer around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menon</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know Discordling Enchainer Kurunon disappeared on the Seventh, and could not be pulled even with AE.  Haven't spent much time in MPG, so not sure about other mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, I have a map with named on it, so with my rogue did a little tour of the place.<br />
<br />
I know for sure, that those following named, are not in their room, nor are any ph.<br />
<br />
Aneuk Tyranist,<br />
Captor Supplescales,<br />
Battlemaster Denik,<br />
Fleshreader Dshaii,<br />
Sentinel Siofet,<br />
Discordling Enchainer Kuroun,<br />
Noc Bloodluster Zieh,<br />
<br />
I'll have to recheck the others, but those are the one I saw totally missing.<br />
<br />
Neuromancer is still there, so is odi, bh, tc, miseryfiend, and a couple other, Hunter Leisov is still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild had a small mini raid clearing mpg named/ph's and killed Discordling Enchainer Kuroun on the 23rd. I wasn't there for it but a cleric got the leggings.<br />
<br />
On the 20th we got the Pendant of Introspection off Noc Bloodluster Zieh, he was wandering through the 6 way camp(north of Odiumate Isienne's ph). I was told he normally is farther northwest but I've no personal experience except that kill of him.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not saying they aren't bugged but I'm betting its a geometry thing, popping underground or resetting there after a cancelled pull or some new variation. Maybe ph's/named not pathing back to where they should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelyan</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm that would explain why we found Fleshthreader Dashii sitting halfway across the zone from his spawn at Lheun spot. None the less the named do still seem to be spawning, but from what i'm reading their just a little buggy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">even before this, the following have had problems with spawning under world...<br />
<br />
Battlemaster Denik,<br />
Fleshreader Dshaii,<br />
Sentinel Siofet<br />
<br />
Sentinel Siofet bieng the worse with having his aggro somehow assist the other two mobs in the room, and then aggroing the big lightning guy east of body trial... somehow.<br />
<br />
so it's all underworld specially since they don't always check z axis proper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">03-05-2005, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">MPG is still fucked, found stormer, and deishii totally not where they are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Also got a noc to pop on us as Odi camp's safe spot.</div></div><hr />
