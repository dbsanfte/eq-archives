Can I set a link in cell 2 to have a target of cell 3? Making it so when I click the link (in cell 2) it will appear in cell 3. This is similar to using a frame, except that the whole site would be on one page instead of needing the frame src page. I can't remember ever learning a away to make the link's target another cell of a table, but there may be a way I don't know.<br />
<br />
If its not possible, how can I set up a frame src page to have this layout? (one row on top that spans two coloums, then 2 columns on row 2) the only way I've been able to do it is by having a 2x2 table then making the top left frame blend in with the top right and bottom left frames.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You want a named anchor tag, I think.<br />
<br />
In cell 2, you'd have &lt;a href=&quot;#cell3&quot;&gt;Link text&lt;/a&gt;.  In cell 3, you'd have &lt;a name=&quot;cell3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I'm pretty wore out atm, so you may wanna double check that for syntax. ;)  If you just want to slide cell 3 into view, then the named anchor should do the trick.<br />
<br />
If the intent is to load new content into cell 3, you could do that with an IFRAME.  &lt;IFRAME name=&quot;cell3&quot; ...&gt;&lt;/IFRAME&gt;.  And link with a target of *cell3* will load in the IFRAME, just as with a FRAME.<br />
<br />
To do that layout in nested frames, you could use a nested frameset - one frameset that slices the window across the middle (a top and bottom half).  The bottom half would be a frameset with a left (cell 2) and right (cell 3) half.  You can nest framesets ad infinitum, tho it gets easy to lose track of them the more you do.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Check out http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/, it's a pretty good site for design and code tips, tricks, and refreshers.<br />
<br />
Double check all of that, I AM sleepy ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he is trying to use frames, if this is the case you need an index file which defines your 3 frames, and references which content goes in each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Originally I wanted to do it in a table mainly because I couldn't get frames to format like this, but I figured it out today pretty easily (I guess because before it was pretty much trial and error, and now I know how to manually make tables and it makes more sense now).<br />
<br />
This'll set up frames like my picture above if anyone cares..<br />
&lt; frameset rows=&quot;20%, *&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt; frame src=&quot;header.htm&quot; name=&quot;header&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt; frameset cols=&quot;15%, *&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt; frame src=&quot;nav.htm&quot; name=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt; frame src=&quot;main.htm&quot; name=&quot;main&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt; /frameset&gt;<br />
&lt; /frameset&gt;<br />
<br />
Thanks for the anchor tip though Dogga, that should accomplish what I wanted, even though I'm not going that route anymore :) BTW, that htmlcodetutorial.com link doesn't work.<br />
<br />
THIS (http://www32.brinkster.com/chswrestling/redesign/index.htm) is what I have so far on the site. Also, if anyone can figure out a way to disable those &quot;Web hosting by Brinkster&quot; text ads or that big blue and white box it would be much appreciated, but I can't think of any way since the code the server injects starts with a bunch of stop commands (&lt;/ &gt;).<br />
Also, the text ad line uses my style for the link, so I think it might be possible to make it seem to dissapear, but I can't figure out where to put a style tag to make it effect only that line. Also of note is that that link only uses my hover and active style.</div></div><hr />

Hrm ... the link is working today - here's a BB Code version (http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/) just for kicks.  Yer approach (what I was fumbling at with my description of nested framesets) will work well, the only caveat with frames is bookmarking and linking, and that's inconsequential for a personal/community site, sez I.<br />
<br />
I can't see anyway to hide the brinkster ads, as they *pre-close* all of the tags  I can think of to hide it with.  (You can't hide it in a div tag, f'rinstance, cuz they put this line - &lt;/object&gt;&lt;/layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/applet&gt; - at the top of their code, and so  an invisible div is already finished before it gets a chance to cloak the ads.  Scanning thru the script, it looks like they've also covered any tricks I mighta come up with.  However, there are cheap hosts for basic HTML files if you want to go that way - I use the free service (http://www.gotoecom.com/services.php?type=free) at http://www.gotoecom.com, and it works well for me (plus I have a permanent web address, which is nice when I switch ISP).  It's not 100% free, I pay 10$ a year for *set-up* fees and I have to pay for the domain registration, but I have no monthly fee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Brinkster is a pain in the butt, http://www.domaindlx.com has a much better service and the Ads are hardly noticeable, they are at the bottom of the page and are simple text, no fancy graphics or anything, besides, DomaniDLX hosts free ASP pages, which rocks :D<br />
<br />
By the way, Brinkster ads are embedded, there is a way but they will either close your account if they notice or just modify the code in it to show again.<br />
<br />
Framesets are evil these days, DIVs with a STYLE=&quot;POSITION:absolute;top:x;left:y&quot; is much easier to locate and IFRAMES are better if you want to load another page inside of it, add a NOFRAMEBORDER attribute to the &lt;IFRAME&gt; tag and it wont even show its a frame, the only problem is that IFRAME only works with IE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... the only problem is that IFRAME only works with IE.<br />
<br />
The IFRAME tag also works in current Mozilla builds and Opera 6+; I don't know offhand how long either browser has suported IFRAME.  I think, tho, that you were referring to hiding the IFRAME border in browsers and not the tag itself - to do this ... frameborder=&quot;0&quot; always works for me, and should work cross-platform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, thats what I meant Dogga, otherwise, the IFRAME appears sunken and it can look bad :). Didnt know Opera supported them, always good to know Opera will be able to see whatever I do with them instead of just IE hehe.</div></div><hr />
