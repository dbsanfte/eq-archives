<br />
I have a hotkey set up to /shield my slower and one for my cleric in an xp grp.<br />
<br />
So any time i lose a mob on a slow or a CH i can absorb some damage until I get aggro back....<br />
<br />
When I am /shielded it RARELY takes me more than ONE taunt to get aggro back, regardless of whether my weps are proccing etc..<br />
<br />
But if /shield is down and I cant use it, it usually takes me 2 or 3 taunts to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed that its easier to pull a mob off a caster when you have them /shielded??</div></div><hr />

I use my /shield all the time, my groups love it =)  After a slow lands, I'm usually able to get it off the slower with a proc or a taunt.  If I proc with either my CHSD or my GoT before slow, the slower can sit down and they are ok.</div></div><hr />

I don't touch the mob at all, and the shaman slows it and gets aggro.  I /shielded the shaman, and after it wore off I was still non aggro on the mob.  So no, shield doesn't add aggro.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it has something to do with the mob?  I havent been anywhere more advanced than PoD cy camps so maybe it works differently in the harder encounters.<br />

Thats exactly what I did to prove it doesn't give aggro =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it has an agro modifier, although I bet that would be extremly hard (or impossible) to test. Like it has a 1.5 agro modifier or somethin like that, giveing you more agro with each hit... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I was getting at was this ...<br />
<br />
You're already on the hate list of the mob BEFORE you shield the caster (by virtue of being naturally KoS to the monster, or by virtue of having already hit the monster a few times before it veers off making a beeline for the slower).<br />
<br />
Since shield has a low range to activate it properly, you're practically standing on top of the monster as it is.<br />
<br />
So ... perhaps it's just PROXIMITY aggro you're seeing that allows you taunt more effectively?<br />
<br />
In other words, maybe it's just good old fashioned, old school EQ, standard tanking practices ... get up in the mob's face and taunt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So far there has been one good theory, I'd like to steer the discussion this way and thinking along these lines:<br />
<br />
<br />
 I do think mobs tend to go after weaker pc's. An example might be a low level always dying during a raid. So if the mob does not see damage being done then they move onto a different pc(also db/da).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now remember kids, I appreciate the answers to the questions i didnt ask...we have established that /shield ADDS NO AGGRO.....my question is:<br />
&quot;why does it seem easier to pull aggro when you have a group member shielded?&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it just proximity aggro?  I dont know, as I am always right up in a mobs face.<br />
<br />
The DA/DV option seems interesting but i didnt know that clerics who are DA lose aggro?....clerics/pallies is this the case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When attempting to insult people for &quot;not reading&quot;, or being misinformed, it's always a good idea to have no grounds for a counterattack.<br />
<br />
1. The thread which YOU started, you titled... /shield = more aggro?<br />
<br />
Clearly, this implies that you were wondering if /shield resulted in more aggro, to which an answer was clearly given, that it doesn't.<br />
<br />
2. You, not having *any* clue that taunt works like this.... roll dice, if the number comes up, it's successful, if not, it's not, and having no bearing whatsoever on /shield or any other gymnastics you preformed prior.<br />
<br />
3. The answer to your question of <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, but I am wondering why its easier to grab aggro using /shield? <br />
<br />
is... are you sitting down?<br />
<br />
It's NOT easier, it's merely in your rather fertile imagination.   It seems easier because you want it to be, so you fantasize that it is, because as has been shown that /shield generates -0- aggro, none, zip zilch, and therefore you asking why /shield seems to make more aggro is similar to asking why parking near a supermarket seems to result in sales on items.   The two are entirely unrelated.<br />
<br />
If you want to figure it out, it's a good idea not to insult people, especially if doing so from a position of relative ignorance, because you WILL be burned.<br />
<br />
So, the answer to your question, which was ALREADY given, yet you want people to give you something which doesn't exist is...<br />
<br />
/shield has no bearing one way or another on aggro and any &quot;ease&quot; with which you attain it post-shield is simply coincidence, and has nothing to do with the act of /shielding.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed repeatedly it's easier to get aggro back when I'm shielding the one getting beat on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same, but its more of a &quot;gut feeling&quot; than anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read this thread, you will see I posted above answering the question that the title asked.  Frod then posted also, so I was informing him that I had done that.  Of course, who cares about the fact that I gave you facts, and had read the entire thing, I should be insulted for replying to something right?  People who insult so quickly, are quickly ignored.  I'm sorry, but I'm going to save my help for more mature people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladiiesman</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, my original post DID ask two questions.  The answer that /shield = zero hate does answer the question posted in the title, that was my mistake, the title didn't reflect the info I was looking for from the post.  My apologies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, I know exactly how taunt works, but remember before they removed proximity aggro(did they really?  can someone link me to the patch message for when they did that) there are things that had/have an effect on taunt success other than the pass/fail of the taunt check.<br />
<br />
Third, <br />
<br />
<br />
It's NOT easier, it's merely in your rather fertile imagination. It seems easier because you want it to be, so you fantasize that it is, because as has been shown that /shield generates -0- aggro, none, zip zilch, and therefore you asking why /shield seems to make more aggro is similar to asking why parking near a supermarket seems to result in sales on items. The two are entirely unrelated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that mean all of these people have the so called &quot;fertile imagination&quot;?  or might there be something to the phenomonon(sp?) other than perception?<br />
<br />
<br />
I can say that is it does seem to make some difference, but I am in no way sure it does. One of those things that are very hard to judge.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've noticed repeatedly it's easier to get aggro back when I'm shielding the one getting beat on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Same, but its more of a &quot;gut feeling&quot; than anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
And these are not the only people that have noticed this.  Does being /shielded reduce aggro on the caster?  any other theories?  Or we all just wishful thinkers who park closer to the store hoping that something nice will go on sale?</div></div><hr />

I went sifting through the patch messages from all of 2003, and couldn't find anything related to proximity aggro.<br />

Care to elaborate on which patch this was and what exactly the message said?<br />

Cause I'm sure I'm missing it in between rocks being placed in Western Wastes and doors in Freeport being fixed and some NPC's quest text being changed from Lungs to Lunges.<br />

And most of the patch messages this year are chock full of that stuff.<br />

If you use shield, it just gives you a few seconds longer to taunt, proc, or outright do dmg to the mob... which increases your agro. Or am i just missing the point?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, I'm always mad that it seems as soon as I pop /shield the mob is back on me =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xath</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First let me couch this by saying all the follow is my opinion based on casual observance and anecdotal evidence, in otherwords the bane of true schientific inquiry.  This is a game however and not a cure for cancer so I shall proceed none-the-less.<br />
<br />
I get aggro much easier off someone whom I am shielding, be it with taunt, weapon hits, procs, disarm, or spamming my 9th ring.  I have seen all of these be the last action before the mob turned to me when useing /shield.  I have turned the mob as soon as I have hit /shield as well, before another blow landed or before I hit a button to make aggro.  On a few occasion I have /shielded someone and had the mob jump to another party member which was not me. <br />
<br />
Based upon these observations it seems to me that someone has their aggro lowered while they are /shielded.  This idea is supported by my experience with DA and DB (cleric bot).  When a cleric becomes invulnerable he loses almost all of his aggro.  I think this might have been done to prevent the old DA -&gt; sit tanking technique used on a few really powerful mobs.  No matter where it came from really, I see every time that DA/DB vastly reduces the cleric's aggro.  Further support comes from testimony of an enchanter friend of mine.  He stated that the discussion and testing on the enchanter board showed that people got a bit less aggro while runed (not while chain casting rune on themselves mind you, as casting rune makes quite a bit of aggro).  <br />
<br />
None of this is scientific.  I have no parses to back any of this up.  I do believe that it is very reasonable conjecture however.  I continue to believe that the /shielded individual has their effective aggro lowered and that it is therefore easier to taunt off them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how many of you attack REALLY SUPER SLOW when you get low stamina? &gt;:)<br />
<br />
 And like someone above said. I don't think prox agro was &quot;done away with&quot; at all. They just extended the range mobs can pick up agro at. Instead of people 200+ range away generating no extra agro on a raid they now generate some. I don't think it effected up close agro. But I haven't tested it either, just haven't noticed any real difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xath</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed no changes at all in melee proximity aggro either.  Proximity aggro is not really germane to this discussion however, as /shield has a longer range than the standard melee (giant-size mobs excluded).  Therefore you are in fact not closer to the mob when you /shield as a previous poster asserted, or at least I am not.  My distance from the mob and /shield are wholly independant of each other</div></div><hr />
