<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>prophetsueta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">kk i need help, ive been reading past post that frogloks suck, i started a froglok warrior in following of Froggerx casue he looks so damn tight, but just then alot of people were saying that froglok suxor at warriors and SK's and pally are better then warriors in the whole game!<br />
<br />
So now i want you to choose one of thes options for me:<br />
<br />
1) Stick with the froglok (it doesnt matter which race u choose theyll all be the same in the end) IS THAT TRUE??<br />
<br />
2) Start a SK or Pally<br />
<br />
3) Restart the warrior and choose a different race (and what race should i be and plz tell me why)<br />
<br />
4) poop tanks start a caster (insert caster class here)<br />
<br />
ty ill look at this tomorrow  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd go for a Rallos Zek warrior, whichever race has no (or the lowest) exp penalty.  Rallos Zek armor pwns, and exp penalties suck.  I think Frogloks have a severe exp penalty.<br />
<br />
I did the Dorf warrior thing and was dumbfounded when the inequatable cultural armor situation arose.  That Brell armor has great WIS on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont worry about race or deity, they all even out in the end, 5 years ago race mattered, but now it doesnt make any difference, if you wanna be able to get decent armor dirt cheap go for a RZ warrior. otherwise go with what you like. <br />
<br />
Oh yah, SK's and Pally's suck!</div></div><hr />

1) If ya like the froggy, play him. The only race that *really* has any sort of advantage are ogres (fewer front stuns) and small races (fewer shrinks needed is a time saver).<br />
<br />
2) Yer on a warrior board, right?<br />
<br />
3) See number 1. Although, as mentioned, if you want to twinkle yer warrior worship Rallos Zek, toward the end of the game you won't really care what race you are and who you worship unless you roleplay (like I do - Dwarven Warrior of Brell Serilis at your service!).<br />
<br />
4) If you're on my server start a shaman or a cleric... if not, it's all your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unless you're being twinked straight into an EP+ guild, religion matters.  RZ gear is godlike, especially in the non-visible armor slots where Ornate doesn't go.<br />
<br />
Optimal races: ogre for frontal stun, iksar for regen/AC, small races for corner tanking, elfs for high CHA.  Adequate races: any.<br />
<br />
Pally/SK are &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; warrior unless you like to MT.  If you like to MT, warriors &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pally/SK.  And in any case, we're a warrior board.  /bonk<br />
<br />
Tanks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; casters unless you like to solo.  And in any case, we're a warrior board.  /bonk<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Race does not make any difference. <br />
LDoN offers a path to get you started on EP+ stuff.<br />
Also you could do the ssra / VT path as well.<br />
<br />
A lot of people forget about velious. There are tons of decent enough items around to get you going. You will need a few friends, but it will be easy, a lot of fun, and a great bonding experience. Even if everyone else is in VT+ gear.<br />
<br />
To anyone who says froglok's suck... well ..|..<br />
For the record I'm an Ex-Iksar SK, and Ex-Troll Beastlord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I had it to do over again, I would a have probably gone gnome, for the devilish good looks, or troll because they look wicked with the right armor. Woodelves are good choice, you dont see many of those, same with dark elves. Froggies are alright, I just think their armor graphics are crap, mainly it doesn't even look like they are wearing much armor.<br />
<br />
Basicly, I'd choose on looks, because after a while you get tired of seeing ogres and humans, at least I do. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I take you're going to play a froglok because they look cool?<br />
Personaly I'm feed up with the hordes of ogre and barbarian warrior, so if I were you, I would stick with froglok and ignore all the stupid ogre warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One consideration is your budget. Popular race/religion combinations such as Barb and Ogre RZ have, on older servers, tended to leave a lot of armor around suitable for those races/deity combinations. I haven't really done an intensive study, but I suspect that cultural armor for these combinations is cheaper and more readily available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I say go with what looks kewl.  If you like the frog look (you said it was tight), then stick with the frog.  I picked Ogre for obvious reasons, but its a pain in the butt.  Im all ugly, cant RP with folks I know, and need my cobalt bracer shrink ALL the time.  I finally got my woodelf crown faction but quit before I finished the quest.  <br />
<br />
It seems like you are big into looks.  (most people are esp with full plate on)  Go with what you think looks awsome and/or damn sexy, lol.  And def pick Rallos Zek, best gear for cheapo prices.  There are tons of Ogre's, Barbs, Troll warriors around.  Go with something different if you want to stand out too.  I remember watching a gnome warr tank Vindi and thinking it was the kewlest thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taggen_of_Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i choose Iksar because of the extra innate AC, Stalwert Endurence has made iksar an even more appealing choice now IMO...of course we have a bit of a exp penality and can't wear FH armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I went Barbarian (Tribunal) long ago. He was not main for along time too. If I had to do it  again I would still choose Barbarian ,I like them. Any race can be a good war with the right gear. Yes RZ and Tribunal are easier to get gear for but play what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Frogs taste like chicken...yum...But serriously, I would go with whatever you like best. I have a Barb Warrior, and the only thing I really dont like about him is that damn kilt..I cant remember which god he worships, but at one time he had full helanic tundra gear, and then I got bored and sold his stuff..(insert slap to the noggin here).  Fortunatly for me my cousin is dumping a schload of plat on me so I can rectify the situation...I like the orgres, but those damn helmets look like Aztec cookware, so nix to that..lol..Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1) Stick with the froglok (it doesnt matter which race u choose theyll all be the same in the end) IS THAT TRUE??<br />
<br />
Go with #1 and yes it is true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think Frogloks have a severe exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Frogloks suffer from no such thing, no penalties!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bjarki_bearskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">1. Stick with him.  After you have been 65 awhile, you will notice stats maxing through LDoN and just basic item upgrades.  You *may* lag a little before you get to 65, but I doubt it will be noticeable from any other warriors.  Maybe 100-150 HP at the most and that just related to STA.<br />
<br />
2. No. Make an alt, but no.<br />
3. You can, but if you started out liking a frog, then you will probably regret it, if you change.<br />
4. Also no.  You started out with a warrior and haven't really gotten a taste for it yet.  You will always wonder what being a warrior would be like.<br />
<br />
I play Barb warrior because I just liked the combination with no consideration for what was the most numerous.  I had absolutely no knowledge incoming new to the game and walked around clueless for a long time. But, I have enjoyed it and have never changed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naldaienea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Go with what you want.  If you wanted to make a halfling, go for it, or even a gnome.  I made a Woodelf warrior, she's agnostic, which I am now kicking my own head for, just because of the fact that RZ armor is nice, and when I made my warrior, I only made her a woodelf because I thought they were uber hot, and agnostic because of personal beliefs, if I could start my warrior all over again, I'd keep her as a Woodelf, just make her follow RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Does anyone think that the 1-post person that started this thread may indeed be froggerx, shamefully self promoting himself??  Methinks that may be the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Daylenia Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yup ignore the stupid ogre Wars people say there the best but i don't think they are really the best War on my Server as in Biggest hp/AC is auctally a Wood Elf :D <br />
<br />
Proof that Elfs rule all:P</div></div><hr />
