<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the bazaar on CT both Greatstaff of Thunder and WM Bladed Staff are flooding the bazaar.  Both have been very rare, only seen one GSoT for sale in past 4 months and 3 Bladed Staffs all over 40k. The past few days there have been 7 bladed staffs and 3 greatstaffs for sale from 15-25k and a few down to 10k.  Question is WHY now, what is happening to cause this?  Are peeps selling off there toons and moving to SWG or are they selling to buy molds?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whats happening is the Planes are getting crowded. With the flags removed everyone is going to 65 now and there are that many more folks camping stuff. Heard of one group having 3 WMBS rot. Prices on Ornate are comming way down, along with a lot of other stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I picked up 4 Greatstaves over the weekend in BoT.  Soon as I'd sell one, another would drop.  They dropped off just about every named we killed in South.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I paid 40k for mine like 4 months ago when they were horribly rare.  Now they're going for 9k</div></div><hr />
