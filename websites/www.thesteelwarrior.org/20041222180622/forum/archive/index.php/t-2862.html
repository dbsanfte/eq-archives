<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Purdypog</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, I just spent an enjoyable 3 hrs in BOT with<br />
<br />
1) Warrior<br />
2) Cleric<br />
3) Shaman (me)<br />
4) Beastlord<br />
5) Wizzy<br />
6) Mage<br />
<br />
Now, since we didn't have a usual puller the warrior just brought in 2-3 mobs at a time to speed things up. And we sure as heck never ran short on mana by the way.<br />
<br />
Warrior was using a 2 hander also, lol. And had about 8k hps and 1400 ac (nothing uber). <br />
<br />
OK, result.......rocking...only 1 death, the beasty because cleric fell asleep once, lol. Wizzy and Mage NEVER got agro, NEVER!! The cleric got agro a few times, but only when warrior got beat on during the pull and needed a fast heal before the fight started. I got agro a couple of times, but usually only when I wanted it so I could park the mobs. Heck, most of the time I didn't bother parking, the beasty just offtanked. Now did I get summoned? sure quite a bit, but I didn't get beat on - the warrior TAUNTED it off me, lol.<br />
<br />
Guys, I still don't think you get it. I guess I'm questioning the peeps around the warriors, the bad shaman, the bad chanters, the over agro dps, the bad clerics, etc. The beastlords and monks who don't know how to offtank (cough cough). Warriors are NOT broken! and AOE taunt rocks! It is bad groups which hurt the warrior, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
You know, if you are convinced you suck there is nothing I can say and other peeps will start believing you suck. Bad agro management is not usually the fault of the warrior unless he is eating lunch and not paying attention.<br />
<br />
Taking the occasional bad group and bad party composition and saying - &quot;See we are broken!!!&quot; is laughable.<br />
<br />
Now, I still think Sony will toss you a bone because of the LFG issue - but as far as I'm concerned its not because you are broken. Working as intended (lol, got to love that old saying).<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />
<br />
yada yada yada<br />
<br />
PS: I think it is pretty funny that in-game I stand up for warriors and never request a pally/sk as main assist tank. Then I post on this message board and make a suggestion that warriors need some sort of improvement and i get a rash of doodie for posting because I suggest that taunt is not the most appropriate fix. Well, my purpose here was to give you folks a different perspective because I continue to say that you don't have enough information to ascertain whether taunt is broken or not. You don't see the resists, you don't know if a skilled shaman/chanter/cleric is going a good job or not because you are not &quot;controlling&quot; the agro, you are just generating as much as you can. It isn't because you are stupid, lol, its because you don't have the INFORMATION. Now I get back to my very first post, I have 190+aa's in tier 2 zones and above and there NEVER has been a time when I felt that a warrior sucked and I wanted to replace him/her in the group (unless said warrior wasn't paying attention).</div></div><hr />

A larger and larger percentage of people are taking the easy route offered by knight aggro thus sidelining more warriors, your DPS solution didn't address that fundamental problem and has it's own host of balance issues, that and your 'attitude' got you the flames bud.<br />

thanks for reinforcing my arguement that a tank with less than full aggro control (a la the knight) can prosper and provide a fun group for all concerned.<br />

Seriously seek help. You come over here trying to get everyone to flame you after one person says that adding to warrior dps is not a good idea and another one said they didn't like the idea of warriors becoming a dps class. Then go over to the sk boards in an attempt to have them flame us. <br />

I guess I'm questioning the peeps around the warriors, the bad shaman, the bad chanters, the over agro dps, the bad clerics, etc. <br />
<br />
I take some offense to this.<br />
<br />
I am capable of DPSing 200+ with my chanter or about 120 or so while chain pulling for the group. You can argue that I should just slow down but that's your xp slowing down too. I never have problems DPSign to the full extent my mana allows when a paladin is tanking. *THAT* is exactly why they get xp groups and we, as warriors, do not.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's absolutely true that I can adapt myself to the group. With a warrior tank I can pull slower, DPS less, slow at 90 or even 80% instead of 98% . Warriors are able to tank. That's not the issue. The issue is that warriors cannot maintain and lock aggro the same way a paladin can. Typically I won't stay in the group I described above because xp comes in about 1/2 as fast and I can guarentee you I will have at least 1-2 accidental deaths that are no one's fault but merely related to a /shield having just been used and a weapon failing to proc. The death doesn't matter but having to med afterwards certainly does.<br />
<br />
Lastly, one final point... IMO pulling 2-3 mobs at one time causes the group to split heals, waste mana redoing debuffs, waste mana on CC and waste time and mana recouping for mob regen. This is definatively slower xp than chain pulling.<br />
<br />
K.. BTW.. nice trolling. ;) You got me again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Let me quote the three posts he made on the SK forums:-<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;The following is my 3rd post on the warriors board and I can't tell you what a rash of criticism and rants I received, lol. Heck, look yourself if you want some good laughs. Shaman perspective on warriors in class balance section. It is funny what sort of person is drawn to the warrior class (and I know that is a huge generalization but I think it is true more often than not).<br />
<br />
Ok: I pasted my last post below:<br />
<br />
<br />
It appears that &quot;narrow minded&quot; peeps just don't get it still. Warriors don't necessarily have to be equal in taunt to be equal tanks - they just need other areas improved to compensate. My goodness, it seems that everyone is so absorbed with the taunt issue that no other fixes would satisfy them.<br />
<br />
And peeps, even now warriors are the best tanks - let's get real, how many times in an experience group with equally equiped/level/aa Pally/SK is the warrior an offtank - the answer is NEVER. Anyone who really plays the game knows I'm right on this one.<br />
<br />
So, the $100 question still remains &quot;do warriors need further balancing?&quot;. And despite what some of the idiots posting have inaccurately claimed my position is I continue to think they do for the pure reason that many are having LFG issues.<br />
<br />
Sony's most excellent vision for experience groups is to grab a tank, grab a healer, grab a slower and 3 more and go to town. There should be NO class which is indespensible in an experience group, it's mix and match. If you don't agree that is is Sony's vision and implimentation I am talking to a brick wall and no amount of good points is going to sink in.<br />
<br />
Some peeps are saying that you should need a warrior to fight harder experience group named and I totally disagree. That's warriors trying to exclude the Pallys/SK again. Let's separate raiding from experience groups. Ok, are we on the same page? Is it fair to &quot;absolutely have to have&quot; a warrior to tank an experience group named? Anyone who says yes on this is part of the above mentioned&quot;brick wall&quot; and nothing I say will make any sense to you.<br />
<br />
Warriors being the prefered tank for the &quot;biger named mobs&quot; is one of the advantages it has over a Pally/SK. The other advantages as have been stated are 500 hps, and slightly better mitigation (it's small I know, but it is an advantage). Ok, back to the $100 question, are these advantages enough to put warriors on equal footing with Pally/SK's in getting into an experience group? My answer continues to be no.<br />
<br />
So, what's the solution? Well, lots of you have tunnel vision back to the taunt issue again. Well, I'll try one last time to state my position since I think many just do not get it. The following are a few assumptions that I believe are clear from Sony's class balancing.<br />
<br />
1) Balancing is done not to get everyone on a level playing field on skills, dps, healing, taunt etc. but to help balance out the LFG. If there are no LFG issues then things are pretty well balanced.<br />
<br />
2) Classes should have some differences. If not, EQ would be more boring than it &quot;sometimes&quot; is. Also group makeup causes differences in playing style, in an experience group you can choose to play a bit more &quot;safely&quot; with, let's say a cleric, enchanter, backup healer....or you can opt for more DPS and more risk. It's all about kills per hour.<br />
<br />
Now, lets now talk about warriors since that is today's topic. Hopefully we have gotten over the incorrect assumption that warriors are broken with my argument about who is Main Assist in a group with a warrior and pally/sk. ITS ALWAYS THE WARRIOR.<br />
<br />
Many folks have argued that the lack of initial taunt makes warriors unfeasible in high level experience groups. I continue to say that I have not seen ONE experience group in my 190 aa's which is the case. Now an enchanter does bring up a good point about non shaman groups having more difficulty without malos. I acknowledge that....I know that is true..I know warriors are having problems getting into experience groups because of that...yes yes yes.<br />
<br />
And I agree that some sort of initial taunt increase - maybe kick stun with 1 min refresh would help the &quot;shamanless group&quot; in particular. But don't discount my suggestion of an increase in DPS which aids the group in the kills per hour, protects the other dps during the fight - ie: wizzy nuking during 2nd half of fight and raises warriors to a viable 6th addition in an already balanced 5 person experience group.<br />
<br />
That 6th slot as I have said (and it seems no one is listening) is the real issue friends. The problem is not just &quot;Warriors can't taunt as well as Pallys/SK&quot; it's &quot;how can we solve the problems about warriors LFG?&quot;. And that LFG has 2 components NOT ONE AS MANY WARRIORS REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE; 1) EQUAL choice as main assist, and 2) bringing something to the table to be considered as 6th member in the 5-person balanced group.<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Excellent posts all, I love this board - intelligent thoughtful responses. Maybe because sk's sucked early on the players have given more thought to class balance.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I personally don't see that improving the warrior damage table and/or weapons to be slightly above a monk damage would harm the other melee. Monks have fd pulling and mend - that's pretty good stuff. Rangers have snare &amp; harmony - more good stuff. Only rogues might have a beef because they don't bring much to the table except for pure dps - but I'm not talking about beefing warriors all the way up to rogue DPS.<br />
<br />
Yowser! man the warriors are touchy about things. EQ sucks pretty bad when you can't get a group in a reasonable amount of time - but you old time sk's know about that.<br />
<br />
I do think, though as an aside, that most warriors who are not pulling (the pullers actually do some work) suffer from the &quot;I am great&quot; complex and have no clue that clicking hot key1 and taunt isn't exactly rocket science compared to what a good chanter, cleric, bard, shaman, etc. is doing. Also, most pure melee fail to acknowledge the huge advantage they enjoyed not having to gather and train the spells, having to deal with the stupid fricking spell book for those of us who had to deal with that, having a very late arriving power curve (see shaman and sk's). Heck, they have pretty bad memories about the hybrids who went at least 2 years where it was tough to get a group, yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
Well, anyway I suppose a one dimensional push hotbutton1 class attracts a certain kind of person. Not that I'm bashing warriors in the least - heck its a game and you should play what you enjoy- but I still am a bit surprised about the lack of reality and the tunnel vision they posess - even after playing this game for 4 years.<br />
<br />
Heck, I will say one thing that is a bit of a bash since I'm on a roll (oh yes, thats the topic). Which class is the most obsessed about loot and who pisses and moans and cries and whines and will NBG when it suits them or random if it doesn't.......oh yes, that would be (starts with a W).<br />

&quot;Oh and for your viewing pleasure if you are so inclined you might want to glance at my little experience group loot story that I posted on the shammy board. The shammys got a good laugh out of it.<br />
<br />
Here is a copy of it:<br />
<br />
Ode to the NBG (true life story, of course)<br />
<br />
Ok, group gets started in BOT tables.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hi all<br />
Druid – hi, Chanter – hi, Cleric – hi, Warrior – hi, Monk – hi<br />
<br />
Druid – So how we going to do loot? Random stuff? Upgrades ok?<br />
Shaman – That’s fine with me<br />
Warrior – I want ornate bracer mold<br />
Cleric – I want ornate bracer mold<br />
Druid – hmm, what drops here?<br />
Shaman – This is good camp, 3 mini named, ring, drums, staff etc all worth about 2-7K and ornate bracer mold which is dropping well is worth about 40-50k.<br />
<br />
Druid – Wow!<br />
Warrior – I want ornate bracer mold, it’s for plate classes doesn’t matter what it costs in bazaar<br />
Cleric – I want ornate bracer mold, it’s for plate classes<br />
Shaman (to himself) – I want ornate chain bracer pattern<br />
Druid (to himself) – I want ornate leather bracer pattern<br />
Monk (to himself) – I want ornate leather bracer pattern<br />
Chanter (to himself) – I want ornate silk bracer pattern<br />
<br />
Shaman – Ok, are we going to random stuff or default the ornate bracer molds to the plate classes and roll on everything else? Everyone wins before starting again.<br />
Druid – grumble<br />
Monk – grumble<br />
Chanter – grumble<br />
<br />
Druid – Pickup groups should just random, that’s the fair way to do things, everyone contributes, everyone has shot at good loot. It would be different if this stuff was no-drop, but heck you can buy this stuff in the bazaar every day and everyone needs their ornate bracer.<br />
<br />
Shaman (trying to find compromise) – Well (druid) how about if we default the ornate bracer mold to the plate classes as long as they don’t roll on the other junk? Everyone wins before we start again.<br />
Druid – grumble, ok<br />
Monk – grumble, ok<br />
Chanter – grumble, ok<br />
Warrior – No way, its not fair, NBG man, NBG man, I will roll on everything and trade up if bracer falls.<br />
Cleric – ditto<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hmmm, (points to warrior) a greatstaff of thunder also drops here warrior only, what would you do with that?<br />
Warrior – NBG man, Christ what the heck is wrong with you, that’s a warrior weapon, you would just sell it.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hmmm, well friend I don’t think that sounds very fair and I’ll bet that neither do the other peeps. Warrior, (points to warrior) if you were defaulted the greatstaff would you then also expect a default on ornate bracer mold?<br />
<br />
Warrior – Of course.<br />
<br />
Warrior – (looking at Shaman) If ornate chain dropped here you would want default?<br />
<br />
Shaman – If ornate chain dropped here, and if I needed I would ask the group if I could get default and not roll on ANYTHING else. If the group was ok with that I would thank my lucky stars that I have a generous group.<br />
<br />
Warrior – That’s BS<br />
Cleric – That’s BS<br />
<br />
Shaman – How so?<br />
<br />
Warrior – NBG man, that’s how it’s done. Frickin frackin what the heck is wrong with you, you are GREEDY!<br />
<br />
Shaman – Is that so?…..well I beg to differ…Now like the druid said, if you couldn’t just buy these things everyday in the bazaar it would be completely different. Do you think it is fair to have loot priority over everyone in your group? You know we all need things.<br />
<br />
Warrior – I don’t believe this. What the heck type of greedy peeps are you? NBG man, NBG man. Warrior exits group.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Well, lets get another tank. Cleric you ok with getting default on bracer as long as you don’t roll on the junk?<br />
<br />
Shaman – (silence) ?????? well?<br />
<br />
Cleric – Lets get a tank and see if he needs the bracer. If he doesn’t, then I’m fine with default, but I still want to roll on everything.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hello? Earth to cleric??<br />
<br />
Cleric – I’m out of here, you guys are greedy.<br />
<br />
Other 4 peeps look at each other in mystified silence.<br />

Yes, it's absolutely true that I can adapt myself to the group. With a warrior tank I can pull slower, DPS less, slow at 90 or even 80% instead of 98% . Warriors are able to tank. That's not the issue. The issue is that warriors cannot maintain and lock aggro the same way a paladin can. .<br />
  <br />
<br />
Think we all agree with this and this is the main issue.  Ive been in groups where the MT was a paladin (65 vs my 63) and I couldve fallen asleep.  It went without any sort of problem and I was watching TV the whole time (even during pulls).<br />
<br />
The thing that sucks is that there was absoultely 0% chance of dying and I could only hit slam during all the fights (not slam and taunt).  We need more things to do, or something to keep us awake when we arent tanking.  That would spice us up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugok_EMarr</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thread huh?<br />
<br />
Looks to me like another hyperbole laced rant, that fails entirely to comprehend the nature of the problem.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just stupid, but I'll try again.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Aggro<br />
Is now:        Warrior &lt; Knight<br />
Should be:   Warrior = Knight<br />
<br />
The quality of a tank is determined by their ability to get and hold aggro. Knights do this very well. Warriors do this badly. In fact, *unlike Knights* the group determines if Warriors are allowed to hold aggro. Lucky us.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Tanking<br />
Is now:        Warrior = Knight<br />
Should be:   Warrior &gt; Knight<br />
<br />
As the only pure tank, Warriors must have a HP/mitagation advantage sufficient to offset the benefit Knights get from their spells. I would like to see defensive scraped and Warrior base mitigation improved.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Utility:<br />
Is now:        Warrior &lt; Knight<br />
Should be:   Warrior &lt; Knight<br />
<br />
No complaints here. If I wanted utility I would have rolled a Knight.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) DPS:<br />
<br />
Is now:        SK &gt; Warrior &gt; Paladin (non-undead)<br />
Should be:   SK &gt; Warrior &gt; Paladin (non undead)<br />
<br />
Relative damage between the three is fine. We need to remain well below the DPS melee classes (Monk, Rogue, Ranger). Melee/caster DPS balance is another story.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any parsing, but is the damage Paladins do against undead sufficient to put them ahead of Warriors/SK's against those mobs?<br />
<br />
I believe it is, but if not, it should be. Every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL.. You're kidding right? Weapon procs and SU3 = average about 6k to 7k additional non-melee damage per mob.<br />
<br />
To gear up my warrior I farm undead zones with a 65 pally friend of mine. I DC a pet (70-80 DPS) and he uses weapons that proc against undead. With SU3 he crits for a minimum of 4k additional non melee damage per fight (about 45 seconds vs. 51-51 mobs) and a maximum of about 12k.<br />
<br />
My friend is cerainly at the top of his class in terms of level, AA and gear, but in my (extremely rough) estimation a geared high-level paladin with SU3 can DPS around 200 to 250 against undead. I doubt we have a chance of even coming close.<br />
<br />
In other words, don't expect a CoD group anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What controlled substance are you using?<br />
<br />
Try parsing it next time instead of going off of estimation. Yep, there are some big numbers, but they don't come that often. Try going to PoN and looking up the stickied DPS parse thread.</div></div><hr />

Extensinve parsing shows that SU3 gives Paladins an AVERAGE of 20% higher DPS vs undead.  Individual slays can be quite large, but over time, the bump in damage vs. undead brings us about even with Warriors on undead targets.<br />

<br />
At Slay Undead 3, about half of critical hits  are translated to Slays which are 10x the damage they would have been.  The general rule of thumb is a Paladin can do 20% more damage against an undead monster (50% more if holyforge is activated).<br />
<br />
So unless that Paladin was pulling 200 DPS in the first place, I doubt they were doing 250.<br />
<br />
I like Slay Undead as a skill.  I invested a ton of points in it (during Luclin when it really rocked) but please don't have any illusions about how powerful it is.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure from your reactions I overestimated. Perhaps it seemed like he was cleansing more than he was.. Sure seemed like it proc'd every fight and the fights were fast (45 secs to one minute).<br />
<br />
I'll look and see if I had my log on and I was close enough to the mobs to get the neccessary spam to give a better answer... Doubtful though. I tend to sit on the edge of ER4 so looking at YALP's DPS estimates aren't very good. <br />

<br />
I don't want to get into DPS of SU3 squabbles with people. I trust the research that people put into parsing these things and if it's been extensively parsed at 20% (or 40% if.. yada yada) then I believe it :)<br />
<br />
Even if I wasn't mistaken (which I fully ready to admit is possible :)) There are a number of reasons the numbers I saw could have been different.. The paladin's base DPS, the DEX and even just getting a lucky streak with the timer.<br />
<br />
If you say 20% additional DPS, I believe you. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like that one!<br />
I have several caster alts and its REALLY easy to get high magic skills. You can cast on yourself, the pet, another player or maybe even a NPC.<br />
Magic skills do not have to be raised by attacking XP giving mobs like melee skills do.<br />
Really showing a good understanding of the different classes in EQ.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm questioning the peeps around the warriors, the bad shaman, the bad chanters, the over agro dps, the bad clerics, etc.<br />
Question all you want. Its the knight's ability to gain huge agro on incoming that makes these uskilled players level and gain access to areas where they shuld not be.<br />
<br />
I still stand by my proposed change to make spell agro somewhat random, so its not a failsafe method to gain XP, but actually require skills to avoid agro and even deal with the agro when you get it once in a while.<br />
EQ should not be a mathematical game where everything can be calculated from spell casts. The way it is now I could program a keyboard-feeder to play all groupmembers besides the puller based on castmessages in logfiles.<br />
<br />
Take a look on the suggestion for a spell agro change here:<br />

<br />
That is the stupidest 'everything is fine as it is' argument I have ever read.<br />
<br />
Spells are easy to acquire, were included in the relative drop rates (ie baz costs) to accomodate 'gearing' up casters at the same rate as warriors and spellbooks are next to no hastle whatsoever. In fact I wish warrior discs had spell gems. Then instead of having to *use* /shield to verify whether it had repopped we could see the little gem thingie go from dark to gtg.<br />
<br />
That's just inane!<br />

<br />
Yes, a Warrior is relatively easy to play. But then again we don't get the thought and attention received by casters. Even looking beyond balance issues, we don't for example get our abilities layed out with the equiviant of Spell Gems (although we should).<br />
<br />
Having made a few twinks recently to try to learn more about the game - at very low levels a solo caster is played a lot like a Warrior with a few helpful spells. In groups it take some adjustment to sit back and do your job and let others do theirs. It isn't harder (in fact it's easier) just different.<br />

Calling me an &quot;idiot&quot; doesn't alter your hypocracy, because even if I WERE an &quot;idiot&quot; you'd still be a hypocrate, and the quote would be perfectly adequately represented as a glorious example of your hypocracy.</div></div><hr />

In your 2nd post of the thread, your &quot;buffs take hold&quot; argument says *NOTHING* about changing tanking whatsoever.   Sorry, you're not going to get out of this one.    You're a hypocrate to the bone.    There is NOTHING in that thread that says &quot;oh I made an error, and because of this dynamic, there's tanking equivalency&quot; or anything else of that nature.   <br />
<br />
Would you like salt with that crow?</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should learn the differences between threads and posts while you're out there getting a clue about warriors and balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well since this is the case I think that lessens the demand for enchanters, clerics and shaman since crack, virtue &amp; (f07,boar) can be had outside a group. It also lessens the demand for necros since they are so self reliant without crack. I'm not saying that any of these 4 classes are screwed in LDON, just not as important as they would be if the buffs were stripped.<br />
<br />
It certainly improves mages &amp; wizzys since they are so much better with crack.<br />
<br />
I suppose it all makes sense, but I was looking forward to working within the limitations of the group makeup for a greater challenge. Oh well, more PP for the crackhead dealers and virtue venders. Maybe a little something for the shaman also assuming you need the cash and like being a buffer.<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
PS: And if speed is key as the above poster indicates - throw out the cleric and insert a high aa Shaman. I can't believe that a cleric can heal and dps as well as I can. I would be very surprised if it was even close. The only x factor being rez.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't take an advanced degree in hermeneutics to figure out that you didn't change the tanking aspect of your &quot;perfect group&quot; one iota in the second post.   <br />
<br />
You'll note:  In your 2nd post, you mentioned...<br />
<br />
Shamans<br />
Clerics<br />
Enchanters<br />
Mages<br />
Wizards<br />
Necros<br />
<br />
There was NO mention of changing the tanking, therefore the charge of &quot;Trying to pretend that something is there when it's not&quot; can be added to the charge of hypocracy.</div></div><hr />
