<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got our Time flag last night, will be farming Time very shortly.  With what I currently have(magelo is up to date for gear), what do I want to spend DKP on, and what should I hold off on and upgrade in GoD?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want my advise (although I'm sure you don't, OMG CHOCOLATE!), just look at my Time Wishlist in my magelo :)  With the exception of the bp and blade from rallos, nothing specifically should have a much higher priority than anything else -- although it may do well to hold out on a p4 drop if there's a p5 drop you are next in line for.<br />
<br />
Oh, wait, since we're competing...uhm...spend all your DKP on the stuff in p1.  Yeah, that's the ticket...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, note that in my time wish-list, I am only including potime drops.  That will change as Endorean will start Ikkinz raids shortly (as soon as myself or someone else is actually flagged to do them, /sigh).  Then there are GoD drops available worth looking into.  Really, I'd get the upgrades as they come, paying special attention not to purchase one item when you know a far superior item is just around the corner (ie, what I sorta did with my bp :-x)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably should look in Overloards.<br />
<br />
We mere peons have no clue what time gear you should try and bid on while dealing with the guild DKP system.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Stuff with good AC/HP. *nod, nod*<br />
<br />
PS Grats on Time!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Daab, just once..behave.  Kailyn, I posted it here since Overlords strikes me more about very high end(Time no longer is), and because it is simply a gear question.  I understand your frustration with the gap between high end and 'casual'(hate that term, but there it is).  When a friend of mine is all excited when he hit 8200 hp's buffed, and I have 8500 hp's unbuffed, it really brings how the gap(especially since I am not nearly real high end).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would decide your goal path after your first run through the Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
The PoTime gods aren't exactly, shall we say, easy.  They become relatively easy after you have farmed Time for a while, but to walk up to Tallon Zek the first try and say, &quot;Sup biotch!  Gibborz me your pl0otz, matie!&quot; isn't very likely given the circumstances of his strength vs ANYTHING you've ever tanked before.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't want to give you the wrong impression either.  A lot of your success will depend on how many numbers you can support on your first Plane of Time run.  Ask yourself these questions:<br />
<br />
1)  Do you rely on several key alt-mains for the success of your raids?<br />
2)  Do people in your guild have a tendancy to lose interest after the first initial victory?  Meaning, can ya put out 72 EVERY time you raid Time?<br />
<br />
The reason I write this post is because I have seen a radical change in my own guild as we entered Time.  I now see them in an entirely new perspective.  My guild is very large, and we have a little over 100 people Time flagged.  However, we cannot seem to form more than 55 for a Time raid.  Why is this?  It's because the people who are alongside you raiding Time are really the people in your guild who actually care.  <br />
<br />
Now, to actually get to the real point of this post, what I'm trying to say is... see how your guild performs on their first (and second) shot through the Plane of Time.  This is because there is a real fine balance between the numbers present to take on these gods, and the gear required to actually defeat them.  They're monstrosities in comparison to any elemental mini.  They do twice the dps, have twice the hitpoints, spawn adds in the process, and have AEs that make any elemental AE look pale in comparison.  They require everyone to not only be on their game, but to be well equipped to accept the challenge.  If you are unable to field more than 55 like my own guild, then you're going to have to take a good hard look at where your weak spots are (gearwise), and work on them.  For my own guild, it was the fact that we had relied on two primary alt-main clerics for so long, and never once bothered to equip them sufficiently.  They crumbled very early in the rotation, and we failed miserably because of it.  We have now changed our outlook on awarding gear because of that (and our second run was, by far, a much greater success).  If you can field 72 on your first try, then you will be able to get away with not having everyone so top notch equipped.  Still, your early success in Time will have A LOT to do with how much you geared up in the elementals.  Even if you think you did, you may find yourself repeatedly going to back because Time has a real nasty way of exposing the weak spots within your ranks.  :P<br />
<br />
Because of this (and finally getting to the conclusion of this post), while your longterm goal will remain unchanged, you *might* find yourself benefitting from a few short term upgrades from Phase1-3 in the process, simply so you can kill Phase4 and beyond.  That is exactly the reason they are there.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well what ever else you have to say, your position supports my proposition that PoP is now &quot;old world.&quot;<br />
<br />
But I do repeat my advice that it goes in overlord--not only because of how hard it is to get there, but that most of us here really don't have to deal with DKP systems and their effects on buying loot. Something that looks great for you (and would be) might be a bad thing to save for because it consistantly goes for too many DKP. Or dealing with bootstrap issues as Eriatha points out.<br />
<br />
But that is just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhyls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I admit to a few mistakes in choosing Time equipment. First of all, get the Veil of the Inferno, its a 180hp clicky buff that stacks with everything. That alone is about 2-4 loots worth of hps on average going from elemental to Time gear.<br />
<br />
Next, piss off your friendly neighborhood ranger by picking up a bow off Tallon Zek, expecially if you are the main tank. <br />
<br />
The rest you have to look at what you managed to acquire in the Elemental Planes. You could probably pass on Armguards of the Brute if you have Raex Arms. The Tier 2 gloves are better than Raex because of stats and the strikethrough, but would not be worth spending DKP if you have Raex. Same can be said for CT legs, Helm of Flowing Time, and Boots of Despair vs Elemental stuffs.<br />
<br />
Sadly, Rallos Zek is going to drop several items you will want. If you can hold out week after week, pick up the Darkblade, his melee ring, the BP and the shoulders. Again, do not take the mask from RZ, wait and get the Bert mask. Get the boots off bert.<br />
<br />
My guild had it pretty easy going through Time. I think we beat Quarm for the first time on our 4th or 5th run. VZ and Inny tend to be sticking points, but with a little bit of asking around, I am sure you can find the strats to take them down. With the levels now capping at 70, things won't be nearly as difficult for your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When my guild broke into time I hoarded DKP and bought a BP 1st and it was instantly clear the difference echo of anger makes.  Even XPing recently I was in a group with another warrior, both using darkblade / EoE, I'd tanked for the previous 4hrs so it was time for the other dude to have a turn so I bagged the DB for a DoD (negative agro proc) and still ended up tanking half the time - I had echo of anger, he didn't.  I consider getting this effect the most important upgrade for warriors from PoTime.<br />
<br />
After the BP I'd hold out for the other big ticket items.  RZ ring and cloak, CT Legs, Quarm Bracer and earring, Inny neck and Saryrn range.  Get a DB when you can, but don't blow points on the EoE early cos the bards will spend big and it'll be common later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>OrgroInsanity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you want aggro cheap, and fast.. Get saryrn range. The stun proc owns and it's pretty common.</div></div><hr />

========================<br />
<br />
no no no no no!<br />
<br />
There's so many other nifty range items in PoTime, that bow's not worth a second look to a tank. <br />
<br />
Go search out the database for youself like the rest of us did... but look for certain things:<br />
<br />
Clicky stun -- Avoidance -- 50 Attack<br />
<br />
all of which are more important than being able to hit a hot button to throw an arrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're going to go for the form veil plan on getting the quarm ring instead of RZ ring as forms don't stack with each other.  Veil is pretty damn contested though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just looking at P1-3 stuffs:<br />
<br />
P1 neck would be a 15 AC 15 HP upgrade for you<br />
<br />
P1 ear you have better<br />
<br />
P1 ring is 10 AC 30 HP<br />
<br />
P2 gloves (Gauntlets of Disruption) are nice upgrade 24 AC and 75 HP with 5% strikethrough mod, but Raex comparable if mold is possible<br />
<br />
Elemental leg molds drop in P3. If you're patient and lucky CT legs have +4% shielding mod. Hope your server has a short Time rotation<br />
<br />
Off P3 named:<br />
 Faceguard of Frenzy (Bert's face is highly contested as said above) would be a 30 AC 5 HP upgrade, but lose stun resist mod<br />
<br />
Fiery Crystal Guard 25 AC 25 HP upgrade for you</div></div><hr />

As someone who owns a clicky stun, I would rather have the bow. If you have a Darkblade/EoE combo, with anger3 on both, and the BP (echo of anger) how much a difference does it make? If someone pulls aggro from you with that combo, they are just not practicing proper aggro techniques. Managing aggro is not 100 percent the tanks responsibility.<br />
<br />
Being able to tag a mob from long distances without having to chronically switch out range items would be hugs.</div></div><hr />

 Ok here's where I am going to SLIGHTLY argue with you....<br />
<br />
You can NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER have too much agro....<br />
<br />
When you want a mob down ASAP (like say the 1st time you do quarm) you're ability to hold agro against an army of Trueshooting Rangers, Disc'in Rogues, Overnuking Wizzies before AE's kill em/makes them go OOM, not to mention Healing classes going MGB regen/Heals....It's the WARRIORS responsibility to be AS GEARED UP agro wise as possible.<br />
<br />
The guilds DPS is directly proportional to how much agro a warrior can generate to keep the attention of the mob. If a wizzy has to hold back or cast 1more conc insteed of that extra SoS that could have cirtted for 8k just because the warrior is not quite there gearwise...or a rogue has to evade while on disc when they would have got in 2X 3k Backstabs, I would say the warrior has to have  along hard look @ themselves....<br />
<br />
<br />
This is all just IMHO....please don't take this personally</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah, I don't take it personally, just never had that problem on Quarm and I don't think the Symbol of the Planesmasters was the difference maker in being able to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Everyone has their own way of looking at gear. If I had to do it over again, I would probably forego the Symbol in favor of the bow/shrug. Just a difference in playstyle. I just know from an exp group perspective, I sometimes get locked into pulling in GoD and OOW where the mobs run a bit too fast to incite/bellow aggro safely and I hate flip flopping ranges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drachnyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm starting to question If i even want the darkblade .... I use JoS / EoE both anger 3d and I dont have trouble tanking anything so far &gt;_&gt;.... but maybe I don't know what I am missing out on ... Sure the tanks with darkblades can hold aggro from me but it doesn't seem to be a big enough difference to keep me waiting for it.<br />
<br />
O and I am definetly hitting up that TZ bow... but I have aten gaunts &gt;&lt; so I don't really have the decision to make.  Even if i didn't though I'd still take that bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks alot for the suggestion guys, especially Abividad for the nice slot by slot comparison.  Now, to continue sorta the question:  as best I understand the guild plan, we are going to start work in GoD(and OoW maybe), starting on Primals and Ikk raids, concurrent with farming Time(got to do something when not our turn in the rotation, and too much EP stuff going to alts/apps).  So, the question is sorta:  What should I grab out of Time, and what should I hold off on, and grab from early GoD?</div></div><hr />
