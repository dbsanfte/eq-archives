<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i would just like to know what is the advantage to being a warrior? what is our special claim to fame that almost each class has?<br />
<br />
(necro=undead master cleric= best healer ranger=bow crits etc etc)<br />
<br />
i kinda feel that the only reason warriors are lacking is because the insain buffs these days(unbuffed, most people would see the advantage to having a warrior, but sadly that never happens, also because of CH), in that any plate tank can be just as good as the other with buffs, but there is a LARGE lack of buffs that allow me to majorly up my damage or agro<br />
<br />
as of now warriors have the small hp advantage which can be over come with a few buffs, (no to mention all the extra reposites we get from duel weild kill our advantage)<br />
<br />
Sks have damage on their side.<br />
<br />
pallys have agro on their side<br />
<br />
we have hp.<br />
<br />
out of this, the only buffs that can cause any one to match the other two are HP buffs, there is no agro or melee damage upping buff(powerful enough) that can put a warrior on par with a sk and a paladin, perhaps if they(SoE) started treating damage and agro as more of a tangable reason for grouping, we would see more buffs like horrifying vasoge(i butchered that i know) or stuff like the ranger buffs except they would add directly to damage as buffs add directly to HP.<br />
<br />
guess what im getting at is we need some skill or ability no other class can duplicate with the right buffs(like there is no back stab or flying kick buff)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly, at one time, the average joe warrior did indeed have a fairly significant advantage over other classes.  He could take a beating better than anyone due to his much better mitigation and higher HP totals. In my opinion there was never quite as much of a difference between warriors and others as there should have been, but maybe that's just due to the fact that I grew up on pencil &amp; paper RPG's where if a wizard had 40 hps at level 15 he was a stout SOB. :)   The biggest single detriment to the warrior HP advantage is HP buffs.  I've had my virtue fade in the middle of a raid, not had a virtue capable cleric there to recast, and had some of my guild's wizards get alarmingly close to my HP total. (admittely they still can't take a hit, but they have those HP's nevertheless).  Making HP buffs give a set total of HPs to anyone they're cast on was a very bad idea.  A better way would be to have it be a percentage differentiated by class or make the buffs work like ND3 and give a percent of your unbuffed total.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
it wasnt so much that we had more hp w/o hp effecting AAs<br />
<br />
65th (base)<br />
Warrior = 3775 <br />
Knight = 3272 <br />
Difference = 503 <br />
<br />
what it was itemization now blows, and so do the buffs, it can almost be thought of something like gold is rare, and then suddenly they can perfectly replecate gold, chemicaly, shape size and all that, suddenly gold becomes worthless. used to be there was quest breastplates and quest items that would only let 1 or 2 classes complete, or it had a special reward made for each class, now they just tag all plate armor war sk pal and are done with it, so basicaly gold became katsup and nothing was done to compensate<br />
<br />
if agro had as many buffs, and items(that dont go in the weapon slot) effecting it, it would also become as meaningless.<br />
<br />
<br />
aggro <br />
sk/pally <br />
warrior <br />
<br />
tanking <br />
warrior/paladin <br />
sk <br />
<br />
damage <br />
sk <br />
paladin <br />
warrior(cant use dps weapons, have to stick to procs) <br />
<br />
/ denotes about = abilitys <br />
<br />
so warriors are number 1 or tied in 1 area <br />
<br />
paladins are number 1 or tied in 2 area's <br />
<br />
sk's are number 1 or tied in 2 areas <br />
<br />
the 1 area that warriors are number 1 or tied in is tanking, which can be vastly supplemented with buffs so that any of the 3 classes become more than enough to tank the mobs, while agro and damage are heavly lacking in buffs to make all choices respectable ones. <br />
<br />
Plain and simple fact is warriors are not versitile enough in what they do, which is a limited specialist role they get no reward from taking, mainly because the dev team lacks the skills to properly implement anything new that doesnt involve a buff icon, i guess this class needs to roll over in a tar pit or something, mostly kunark dinosuars. <br />
<br />
at the very least we should be somewhat equal in ALL areas, and if the game was made RIGHT the specialist would mean the best, i mean /shield doesnt come in to effect untill after we already failed out our job<br />
<br />
also i dont mean to attack anyone i am really trying to pick thru the warrior class and find a reason for it</div></div><hr />

In addition, we have dual wield.  (although, with the changes to 2 hand damage a while ago, this is debatable in its being an &quot;advantage&quot;, maybe more lateral than anything now)<br />

Basically the clerics were laughing about &quot;tanks&quot; they have been grouping with.  They would get wanna be warrior knight classes claiming they got 7khp, when in reality a cleric would toss a 3khp heal when they're at 30%hp and be full health or something.  Something like that.  Just point out that while they good at agro, some of the cleric themselves had more hitpoints.  Results in mana issues, their CH is nowhere near its potential healing a 5khp buffed knight ... i'll get link somehow, eventually after doctor takes care of this trojan</div></div><hr />

Unless there's something new, you're referring to an old thread about &quot;paper tanks&quot;.  You can be a warrior and still be a &quot;paper tank&quot;.  They're ranting over these people who think they can go to tier 2 or even 3 with low hp and try to tank (ever tried being a healer in PoV with a tank that has about 2700 unbuffed and no shaman?  It's not fun, trust me).<br />
<br />
They're complaining about tanks who do not have the hp to tank where they are, or sometimes even the levels.  They drop like a rock and it makes healing them frustrating because its very very hard to time a CH on them, you end up using the other heals.  Then others who lie about how much hp they have.  Paper tanks.<br />
<br />
I've seen warrior paper tanks too, it's not just knights in that category.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">HP &lt; 7k NOT just knights, there're some warriors too, just like Kaesorn said, the clerics are complaining &quot;Paper Tanks&quot;, which could be a SK, could be a Paladin, also could be a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Also, I dont see only Warrior access to EB proc Aug is an Warrior over Knight adventage. Knights can just add DPS proc Aug and still can hold aggro much better than warrior.  <br />
<br />
Warrior lose DPS to get closer to knight's aggro IS NOT an adventure.<br />
<br />
<br />
When guild Knights Main Assist, I can just use my Anger 3 augmented BoW, join the fight 2-3 sec later, never have Over-Taunt problem so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
knights have to do something to get agro, its not automatic like your dual wielding proccing weapons with augments, and your procs dont require you to stop meleeing and have no mana costs, have a recast time to wait for,  or have fizzle rates.  Yes, im aware that they require little mana already, however if group is chain pulling, and no mana regen is avaialble, and amongst other things, they will require downtime.  Im also aware of stuns agro, specifically paladin stuns, it does need some tuning down as not only does it halt a mobs dps, but has huge agro.  As far as paper warriors, hmmm guess I gotta wait till I see one since it is much easier to obtain HP / STA items than items with HP / STA AND MANA &amp; WIS / INT (we cant cast without mana, and without a decent mana pool can only do so much till oom, and when oom we offer jack).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lamini, what the hell are you smoking?<br />
<br />
 DW proccing weapons with augments is 'automatic' aggro? What planet do you live on where they changed EQ? Not only does every warrior NOT have Anger III procs dropping out of every orifice NOR do they have raid quality EB items or even the Droga quickfix, but RNG IS NOT, HAS NOT, AND NEVER WILL BE 'AUTOMATIC' LIKE CASTING A SPELL. Got it?<br />
<br />
 Oh, and I love the 'missing melee' comments. With a good 2hander for max DPS, when you throw a stun, you're missing, what, one swing? Ask a Warrior if he'd trade one combat swing for unresistable significant hate generation. Jesu, man, if ever I heard a load of blarney, your post is it. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I believe it was found that missed swimgs generate the same amount of aggro as a landed hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
about wis and mana, it flows like fucking katsup! why do you even have to worry these days? every damn thing is tagged knights and warriors just about, and all of it has 8 wis/int and 50 mana on it(sometimes more sometimes less but its on everything)<br />
<br />
you still get agro on demand, which is the key issue here, we are still on a RNG which means our proc can come off right away, or it can end up finishing the mob off, also we get more reposites meaning we are harder to heal, on top of that there is a haste cap we can hit with that 12/19 and the 41/31 so 2handers get more use out of haste items than 1 handers do, more over, we cant use that 15/22 or the 20/29 because if we do we cant hold agro, you still retain your agro skills no matter what weapon you use, so you ARNT as gear reliant as we are<br />
<br />
<br />
so no i dont see duel weild as an advantage, and i dont see .5-1.5 better mitigation as much to jump for joy about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">&quot;Casting does not interrupt melee anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, when I cast a group heal, a 2 sec stun, or a longer cast stun, my meleeing is not getting interrupted?  I realize that we have slow weapons, but sheesh theyre not THAT slow where we have to wait every 2 seconds for us to swing a weapon, and when hasted we miss quite a bit more rounds lowering our already pathetic damage output<br />
<br />
&quot;DW proccing weapons with augments is 'automatic' aggro?&quot;<br />
<br />
I aint smoking anything.  I have PC spells on and know just how often procs are.  What was implied by this was that if a knight wants agro, he has (actually TAUNT works great and I rely on it more than ANYTHING for agro) to cast spells.  If a warrior wants agro he melees and lets his weapons do his work assuming he has proccing weapons as he has fast agro generating weapons, with aggro procs hopefully.  And yes proccing 1 handers are in your local bazaar for several hundred pp each and you can add augment procs to them for relatively small amount of adventure points.  And the hate from stuns is resistable, ask your warriors here how they strip agro easily off knights.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;At level 52 my Paladin casts chain stuns with no appreciable loss of mana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats good BB, other than the part of you doing no damage if your casting.  However, bring the scene to Plane of Tactics pit area when you get some levels and once you have group heals to cast, with even just a couple of adds on a bad pull and you'll find yourself with no mana very fast trying to keep your cleric alive from CH agro and stunning mobs so they stop raping your chanter, and group healing everyone when mobs break mez and hit everyone while keeping them rooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I solo blues in KC which I couldn't solo at level 55 with my Warrior. Your swing animation is stoped but not afaik the swing or consequent damage. Works pretty nice with a Windblade buffed with Divine Might.<br />
<br />
When I do the same with a group, I take little damage while they pound the helpless mob into oblivian without any danger of it casting or harming them in any way.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Lamini I think in your last post you illustrated something you didnt realize.<br />
<br />
You have many ways to generate aggro and be versatile to the group. You can root heal stun tank etc and you have taunt.<br />
<br />
A warrior can do one thing and thats attack and taunt. Dont misunderstand me there is allot more to a warrior that simple hit a and pray. Positioning and changing of weapons as well as use of disc and ae taunt can effect or capability. <br />
<br />
And honestly I dont follow the line most warriors do that our aggro is terrible, but in fairness I am well geared.<br />
<br />
But the casting tanks have a huge advantage over the main tanks and our ability to function is not as great as the casting tanks who seem to loose very little while having many abilities we dont.<br />
<br />
As one cleric said to me &quot;You are a damn good tank I'll take you any day but thank god for Palidins with root cause you cant do shit about blood aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
You have so many more abilites with so little given up to get them.</div></div><hr />

WHAT in the world is stopping you from getting Enraging Blow weapons?????????<br />
<br />
If proc weapons have such an advantage, GET ONE. Nothing is stopping you. Almost all those EB weapons are available for knights too...<br />
<br />
Then you could just stun twice on inc, and rely on those procs the rest of the fight.. which would still give you an insane advantage over warriors.<br />

Why/when did I play a Paladin?<br />
<br />
My first character was the Paladin. At about the time Kunark came out I felt he was dead-ended. DW armor was junk. He hadn't been in a guild since level 42 and I had changed my focus to my present main - a Warrior after farming most of his equipment with the Paladin (Yaks, FBSS, lol).<br />
<br />
Frankly Kunark made me retire him. Both of my sons quit playing then (both played Knights) and I no longer could find groups. I don't have the patience to play a class that is just about useless. Only the fact that I'm in a great guild has kept me playing Battleblade. The raid leaders insure all the Tanks (including Knights) get to Tank and that means a lot to me.<br />
<br />
Despite my Class Balance posts, I fully support Knights MT'ing. No class should feel it's gimped. I just want competative aggro control and a little more survivability to compensate for the spellbook. I play the Paladin for fun still and I know for a fact he's at least 2 levels more powerful than an equivalent Warrior and a lot more fun to play.<br />

umm Do you know how much dmg a tick those DoT's do?  Festering Darkness the only one I use w/ any regularity (/cheer snare!) is 50 a tick, and last maybe 3 minutes.  Most SK's I know only use other DoT's when agro kiting and even then it is limited to just Ignite Blood, Pact of Hate, Aystolye and maybe Bond of Death if they are liching for mana.  All told those do add up but the mana cost is a real kick in the ass.  The most damaging DoT I posses(sp) is Pact of Hate at 180 a tick for 36 seconds.  Man that sounds nice but when it costs me 5-7% mana each time I cast it it sure isnt something I use all the time.</div></div><hr />

People wonder how Knights can be so clueless, you sir are a perfect example. You don't even KNOW YOUR OWN FUCKING CLASS. Of course you don't think you're overpowered, you have no concept of how to harness and USE your power.<br />
<br />
Here's a tip, go back to LoIo and pull out all your dots, including Pact of Hate (http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1943) *snicker* and lemme know how it goes, ok?<br />
<br />
Most of you guys remind me of a Warrior I once knew who was level 60 and had a Taunt of 4. Completely fucking clueless.</div></div><hr />

Pact of Hate is your 64 Lich spell.<br />
<br />
You must mean Blood of Hate (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3489&amp;source=Live).<br />
<br />
Just being nitpicky this morning. :D<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
And the hate from stuns is resistable, ask your warriors here how they strip agro easily off knights.  The stun is resistable...the hate isn't, even if it's immune.  I tank on my cleric at times just chaining stuns, and heals on myself, while Paladins try to &quot;save&quot; me.<br />
<br />
Your stuns are not the red epic proc, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Frogdoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Honestly I don't know why EQ even keeps warriors around.  The game has developed to the point where a singluar non casting class that cannot heal itself or FD is pointless.  <br />
<br />
Verant made warriors go the way of the Dodo, they just don't cut it anymore.  I mean I am lvl 45 and I have seen even necro's pull aggro off a warrior.  I never seek warriors out for anything.  They are just a bunch of cuddle bitches you chat with patting them on the back as they poo poo about how they are useless and nobody likes them anymore (which they don't) all the while I am doing a /who all pal or sk or monk to finish out my group.  <br />
<br />
Verant has made warriors so completely useless that I find people actually loathing them for being around and have said and heard others say &quot;I wish we could replace all these useless warriors with sk's or paladins and get our group on.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Even if Verant increased warrior aggro/taunt hp up I would still not group with them as their DPS sucks and swallows.  At this late end of the game warriors need some type of magic or kick ass abilities like a monk cause all they are good for is being town guards.  They can stand and watch a city all day and at night cry as they hear all the mighty adventures of the other useful melee's.  <br />
<br />
They should offer peeps who play warriors an option to get a smilar equipped sk/pal/rng/monk and then nerf the class all together.  They could place the Monk's damage mitigation back to where it was pre nerf and things would be right as rain.  <br />
<br />
When I first played EQ my first and only class was the warrior.  Took one to the high fifties, then equipment/skill caps were closed and then the warrior, the essence of the group, became obsolete.  So when I tell peeps I hate Verant for that you can fucking bet I mean it.  The second Worlds of Warcraft or City of Hero's comes online I am gone from EQ forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Lamini, I'm not saying this to flame you or to pick a fight with you, it's just the honest truth;  If you honestly use taunt more than you use your spells to control aggro in a group, you seriously need to learn how to use your aggro spells.  I either dual wield CHoS and wind worn handblade, or use a GSoT for aggro, and if a paladin or an sk wants aggro, they take it. Period.  And they sure as hell don't have to taunt to do it.  Nor do they have to have a proccing weapon with a substandard ratio but a good aggro proc and alot of luck with the RNG.  IF you're serious about using taunt for aggro more than you use spells, no damn wonder you don't think knights are that much better at aggro control than warriors.  Personally, I doubt the veracity of your claim.  At least I hope you're lying, the alternative is that you aren't clever enough to use the tools that are available to you to lock aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">The problem with just hp advantage is that it doesn't scale with buffs.  Lets say unbuffed a war has, oh, 20% more hps than a knight.  So, just to throw out numbers, lets say that's 7K hps for a war.  That means a knight will have about 5800 hps (5800 * 1.2 == 7000 roughly).  <br />
<br />
Now, lets cast some buffs:<br />
<br />
Focus: 544<br />
Kazad: 910<br />
P9: 618<br />
BSS: 330<br />
Total: 2402<br />
<br />
So, now that 7K warrior has 9402 hps, and the 5800 hp knight has 8202 hps. <br />
<br />
Remember that 20% advantage in hps?  It's now dropped to 15%.  The more hps each player gets the less this advantage becomes, too.<br />
<br />
This is why giving a HP boost is not the answer.  Also, BoV is not the problem; it just magnifies a more fundamental problem that will not be fixed, since by doing so it would piss off a larger part of SOE's player-base.  So instead they'll likely just give wars more hps and some skill that improves taunt and call it balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like Kaesorn said, if the stun finishes casting, you get the hate. The method those warriors use to &quot;strip aggro easily off knights&quot; is the taunt button. Paladins get one too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Your right it is Blood of Hate sorry but had a long day at work and my brain was toast.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Keldorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">i play a druid on fennin - and all that i can say is i would much rather have a SK or Pally tank for me in an exp group than a war when im teh only healer (wich is the case 90% of the time). <br />
case in point...LDoN the other day...did 2 missions with war, enc, ranger rogue necro and myself...all 65 - we did ok...finished in standard 30min assassin..i was CHing pretty much every other mob with a few NI's tossed in...war kept agro fairly well -<br />
 after the first 2, war had to jet...so i got a SK friend of mine to take his place...did a slaugther...i casted 2 CH's the entire mission, one very start and another near the end...and i was using NI sparingly - we did a 58 slaughter in like 35 min...becuase i was chain nuking instead of healing....SK was keeping great agro, and was healing himself (life taps ++) <br />
same thing was happening in Fire, was farming rares in field 1, war couldnt keep agro for shit..i ended up tanking half the time heh - <br />
i am 100% in agreeance that warriors need a huge adjustment to there class....if only to keep my RL friend (65 war) from bitching all the time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Throe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I just left a cleric forum.  It is in fact because of your HPs and AC that makes you so special as they are tired of the wimpy knights<br />
<br />
The fact that we used to have an advantage in HP and AC is all but moot now.  Paladins and SK's with good equipment can pretty easily match the average warrior.  I know that at the very top end warriors do still have more HP's/AC, but for the average player, that is not the case.<br />
<br />
The truth is that we really don't have anything other classes can't duplicate to some extent.  Anyone who has played a warrior has more than likely figured this out.  I enjoy playing my warrior nonetheless, but I'm sure that, given a choice, most clerics would choose a paladin/SK they knew and trusted over a warrior they knew and trusted for regular grouping(assuming both are available for a group and only one slot is left in the cleric's group).  The melee balances that Sony has instituted have helped a lot IMO but we[warriors] are still a bit lacking.  <br />
<br />
The problem now I think lies with the fact that we can't increase our END regen rate, and that we have a limit on how often we can spike our agro with the Incite line.  Once every 30 seconds compared to a Paladin who has been saving his mana for when it was needed.  The Paladin in a tight spot can chain cast his stuns quite a bit faster than the Warrior can Incite.  Warriors should be able pop their Incite at a rate that would even or be slightly under the agro generated by the chain casting Paladin(definitely NOT once every 30 seconds).  Also, at the end of this tight spot where an agro spike is needed, the Warrior has no way to even the regen rate of his source(END in his case), while the Paladin has a bard standing there regening his mana when needed.  The buffs that could balance this issue to the way it should be do not exist, and for the time being I see Sony is happy with what they've done.<br />
<br />
I suppose there are too many Warriors that were made happy by the recent changes.  I also think that anyone who complains at this point will be pointed at and called a B**** who complains too much(i.e. what more do you want!?).  Especially by the knight community.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>elfdragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I don't have one main, I have 2.  A warrior and a cleric.  I played several other classes &amp; combos before settling into what I'm doing now.  And being a cleric who reads the cleric boards I can explain all about the referenced warriors make better tanks type threads (which are pretty common) these threads are different than the paper tank threads, that's a completely different topic.  From a cleric standpoint, warrior is THE tank.  Sure, SKs and Pallys do pretty good, but require a ton more healing.  And no I'm not only comparing them to my warrior but other warriors I've played with over the years.<br />
<br />
Warriors general do still have more hps and better mitigation as the same AAed Pally / SK.  Sure they can keep aggro, but so can a wizard ... question is do they really need to or should they.  Typically in LDONs we do more than one mob at a time, Pallys and SKs will ALWAYS need more healing than any warriors in the group, even if the Pallys and SKs have more AAs (or at least claim to).  And some of them I believe as I've known them a while and seen them around for over a year, you don't play a character at 65 for a year without gaining AA.<br />
<br />
On the same mobs I'll heal over time anyone not a warrior when they are a bubble down, then they usually need another heal by the time the fight is over.  Where most warriors will only need the heal over time or even just a CH every few mobs.  Most knights whether pallys or sks want to keep aggro, and while the warrior really doesn't care, it drives my cleric nuts... why should I spend twice as much mana if not more to keep alive a knight when I could have a warrior instead?  I've also played with plenty of warriors with out EB or Anger 3 procs that keep aggro majority of the time and get it right back after the mob aggros on the knight after a spell.  <br />
<br />
I don't know about ya'll but from a cleric's standpoint where I calculate and pay attention to how many hps people in my groups have and how quickly they go down on slowed and unslowed mobs: warriors as a rule have a couple k more than knights.  They may SAY they have more hps, though only a few I've seen have lied.  I don't know if it's my server or the people I know, but there's an obvious gap in the hps of a equal warrior and knight.  With my clerics healing AAs done and extended enhancement to make heal over time last longer, the 10 second cast and the rate at which knights go down compared to a warrior CH is useless on anything but a warrior.  <br />
<br />
My hubby's shaman usually uses his 1400 quick heal on knights when we've several mobs, while I keep my heal over time on them and keep an eye on everyone else's health including the warrior.  Forget what we were doing but the other day after a session with 2 warriors in our group and he was throwing out heals and nukes to use mana.  Afterward he said &quot;I nearly cried when my heal on both the tanks didn't even do a full bubble.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Warriors as a rule have 10% more hp then an equally geared knight.  A warrior tha thas a 2k+ more hp then a knight is obviously better equipped.</div></div><hr />
