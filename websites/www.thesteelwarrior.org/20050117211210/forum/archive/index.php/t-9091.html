- A completely useless Clicky (750hp rune every 10 mins with 1 sec casting)<br />
- A faster reuse Timer on incite.<br />
<br />
Anyone care to tell me why we should bother with this piece of shit exept for the AC/HP/Shielding ?</div></div><hr />

but what is uberdumb is that all epic 1.5 clickies are 0.8s cast <br />
so when we compare them we have to weight them by the chanel skill (0 on all pure meleer!! thanks SoE) Moreover we are the more likely to use it while fighting making it even harder to be effectively casted. :(</div></div><hr />

This is better than any weapon for anyone not in time.<br />

And this IS NOT THE FINAL RESULT OF THE EPIC QUEST.<br />

Jesus crimeny.  When epic 2.0 is exactly the same, but with one more damage, one less delay and 10 more  HP, THEN you can bitch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the same but improved shitty clicky &amp; focus ?<br />
<br />
Group Vie ? No thx i'm a Warrior not a Paladin<br />
As a proc (even at reduced rate) sure why not.<br />
1 Min duration, 1 sec casting , 10 min reuse ? <br />
<br />
Faster Incite ? Yeah right<br />
Instead of Faster Ancient Chaos Incite we get a useless effect.<br />
Voice of Anger please !  <br />
<br />
I am sorry but to me this is a Darkblade/Fleshbiter with 3% Shielding.<br />
Ignore the 3% shielding, and even the Chaotic Black Scimitar from the Zoo is better.<br />
<br />
I do agree its a hella of a weapon but guess what ?<br />
You could remove both the effects and no one would notice a thing.<br />
<br />
And thats wrong.</div></div><hr />

Effects on Epic weapons from versions 1.5 (probably) 2.0<br />

Disappointing... Instead of absorbing 10% dmg for a total of 750, you now can absorb 10% for a total of 1000 dmg :)))</div></div><hr />

You miss the 2 augment slots that allow you to make it do whatever you want, including match every aggro weapon out there, or allow you to use it for DPS?</div></div><hr />

Nope, didnt miss it; but having to add 2 anger augs to give the weapon what it should have on its own is pretty lame.</div></div><hr />

the item would stay a long long long time in bag just for the clicky. but in its current form (and its next : epic 2.0 's clicky (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6264&amp;source=Live)) it will be thrown away like the epic 1.0</div></div><hr />

<br />
People, this was completed in a WEEK.  Probably intended to be more like a month, but hey, it's just another step.  For people that dont farm qvic+ this is one hell of a weapon!  For the 2% of people that are qvic+, this is a toy most likely, but it leads to an even better weapon later on.  And until another expanion releases, it should be indisputably the best.<br />
<br />
Warriors have spent the last 3 years with only ONE weapon proc at the high end, raw aggro with maybe a small dd component.  Here's something new, stop freaking out.<br />
<br />
OMG, the first stat augment from the BiC quest isn't as good as the 80/80/80 aug from Txevu, and that's so easy to get!  Wow, wait until the quest is finished ;)<br />
<br />
This isn't just warriors either, people are all bent out of shape because they just spent an entire week questing this and it isn't the best item in the game.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Omg this sucks it's not as good as &lt;insert raid weapon here, what a terrible ratio, no aggro proc!11!11one!!11one!111&quot;<br />

Just wait.  The very next argument will be:<br />
<br />
&quot;Omg even though this would rot in my bank, I just realized that it would actually be an upgrade for some.  And non raiders might possibly have a shot at it someday!!1!!1!!one!11!1  NO WAY THEY DONT DESERVE THE SWEAT OFF MY SACK LET ALONE A 1.5!!111!1!!11&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The clicky is pathetic. For anyone in a position to obtain this sword, it's completely useless. 750 damage less than if you hadn't bothered clicking it? Pur-lease... Compare that to some other classes such as cleric: Free Divine Arb + 1500 group heal + cure. They'll be using that for years to come. This one isn't even worth the buff slot it'll sit in. What's more, it seems we're getting a simlar effect for Epic2, which will absorb 1000 points of 10,000 damage intake. This will be for high end raiders ONLY, for whom 10k damage will be one melee round on a raid FFS.<br />
<br />
Faster incite timer? Who the hell chain incites with any semblance of regularity?<br />
<br />
And as for the completely unimpressive weapon graphic, don't even get me started...<br />
<br />
Very very disappointed overall, especially at the prospect epic2 will be permabanked the second a new weapon comes out with comparable agro or ratio, just like JBoW was, whist some classes still routinely use Epic1</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here's the other argument.  Not uber enough for them.  That's valid, I reckon.  If I had a Darkblade of the Warlord, I wouldn't be fucking around with this shit either.<br />
<br />
But the fact of the matter is that 99.9% of the warriors in the game AREN'T using Time weapons. In fact, this would be a fucking 100% increase in power for the VAST majority of warriors who can scrounge uhh...from the looks of it, 3 groups.<br />
<br />
So, can you kill Vindi?  Then you can get Epic 1.5 most likely.  Think of the HUGE amount of people it will benefit, even if it doesn't benefit you.<br />
<br />
Now, 2.0...there's where you get to bitch.  Save it for then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, right..cuz most warriors these days are struggling along using 13/20, or 15/20, while Monks can grab a 17/20 out of the bazaar, and do FAR better with any work at all.  Knights get the ol 27/25 ratio weapons in the bazaar for under 10kpp, and we should be pissed off.<br />
<br />
You guys with over 10khp clearly have lost your fucking minds. I mean, all the threads in the outhouse made me suspect something, but it's actually true.  This looks entirely doable by low elemental guilds, and there is absolutely NOTHING out there even close to 28/26 with 45 ac for those people. <br />
<br />
Keep your Darkblade of the Warlord.  I'm not asking you to fucking replace it.  But shut up, and quit bitching about a HALFWAY reward, that is leaps and bounds beyond anything that the lowest tier of people who could complete the quest could get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bitter ?<br />
as I said the clicky isn't bad at all since it's stackable, and 10% domage reduction is good (even if capped at 750 overall, thus it will consume before 1min if the mob dps is above 13.9dps). the chance to resist spell is good for big bad boss. the only drawback is the casting time and the obligation to wield it.<br />
<br />
remember that shaman epic 1.0 was given with two other items. if the war 2.0 is the same with a (any slot / can equip 0s cast time) and two special procing aug (chaotic strike VII with an increased proc rate and for the second something similar) it would rocks more than enything.<br />
<br />
so just wait and see what happen next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope giving us two aug slot for proc is better than putting an innate proc inside.<br />
<br />
in non uber normal content A3 is better than ykesha, but in higher content other non hate spell get hate bonus thus in Qvic+ content ykesha is better than A3. putting two slots allows us to tune our weapon to the content -&gt; it permit optimisation which can't be done on innate proc.</div></div><hr />

I was talking to Qvic+ People because they are the only that can see<br />
the sheer stupidity involved with this weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly i do like the stats, and the 2 augment slots are awesome.<br />
(We can assume that means 2 procs of our choice which is more choice than Anger+LDoN)<br />
<br />
Thirdly take a good closer look at both effect/focus and ask yourself this question :<br />
If there were no focus/clicky would anyone really notice ?<br />
The answer will probably be no. And for an item like this, its insane.<br />
<br />
Fourthly i wont even compare the DPS output vs Paladin/SK ratio based.<br />
Hello 28/26 vs  61/35 ? Please you gotta be kidding me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wont argue its a great weapon for its difficulty.<br />
Or that its absolutely insane for non Time+ People.<br />
<br />
BUT, if you look at the overall picture.. Its a piece of shit.<br />
Why ?<br />
<br />
Its a subpar weapon compared to the other epics, with 2 absolutely pathetic effects.<br />

I was talking to Qvic+ People because they are the only that can see<br />
the sheer stupidity involved with this weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly i do like the stats, and the 2 augment slots are awesome.<br />
(We can assume that means 2 procs of our choice which is more choice than Anger+LDoN)<br />
<br />
Thirdly take a good closer look at both effect/focus and ask yourself this question :<br />
If there were no focus/clicky would anyone really notice ?<br />
The answer will probably be no. And for an item like this, its insane.<br />
<br />
Fourthly i wont even compare the DPS output vs Paladin/SK ratio based.<br />
Hello 28/26 vs  61/35 ? Please you gotta be kidding me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wont argue its a great weapon for its difficulty.<br />
Or that its absolutely insane for non Time+ People.<br />
<br />
BUT, if you look at the overall picture.. Its a piece of shit.<br />
Why ?<br />
<br />
Its a subpar weapon compared to the other epics, with 2 absolutely pathetic effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : Demo i love you !<br />
<br />
<br />
Our weapon ratios have ALWAYS been subpar to paladin/sk/monk weapons.. why should that change now?  I can think of four or five near 2:1 ratio paladin/sk/monk usable weapons, both 1h and 2h, for each class available in PoP pre-Time, but not a single one for warriors.  So, for the pre-Time folks, this is a significant dps upgrade.<br />
<br />
Until we get into Time or Uqua+, warriors don't see any greater than 1:1 ratio 1her weapons, and 1.5 clearly isn't aimed at that crowd.<br />
<br />
I think the ratio is right on target for where the epic should be.  The progression will end up being something like:<br />
<br />
BoW --&gt; Epic 1.5/something pre-time(stone etched mallet maybe) --&gt; dbow/Epic 1.5 (better ratio/stats than EoE) --&gt; dbow/jos,cbs,demerix(insert ikkinz+ weapon here)<br />
<br />
Looks like it fills the gap between the BoW and the Dbow nicely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are the rest of your warriors doing?<br />
<br />
Are they removing their foot from their mouth like you?<br />
<br />
No need to remove my foot from anywhere on my anatomy as I never asked for, or said, that War epic should be for DPS.  You want DPS use another weapon.  War epic should be for aggro.  Yeah on raids you only have one tank at a time, but lots of times SA or TA has to step up and there's also off-tanking responsibilities for lots of ecnounters.  And non-raiding Warriors are almost always MA in xp groups.  <br />
<br />
That's how I see it.  Fine it has 2 augs and is decent DPS, and good stats etc.  I still feel it should have a hate proc.  I'll do it, as I want Epic 2.0 some day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it is, even if the 2.0 follows this same pattern, a year to two from now will be banked with my 1.0.<br />
<br />
 Epic weapons for any class should be something worth using for at least an effect for the characters career.... I was the fourth person on Saryrn with epic 1.0 and I can only say that I have to get really bored to take it out of the bank, and that is only to look at the partical effect.... this peice of shit I would use like any other weapon for a period of time, but two years from now I wont even take it out to look at the neat apperance. With epic 1.0 I banked it shortly after Velious came out... the expansion right after they were introduced.... please people learn from the freaking past....<br />
<br />
Hmms how about a clicky 400 pt aggro and maybe 60pt ac debuff that I can recast every 10 minutes.... That really wouldnt be broken and I would use it for my career just for when I need that little bit of extra aggro.... For heaven sakes since you guys at sony are hyper recast happy, take advantage of it, and make clickies that are worthwhile with the recast balance.<br />

I'll concede that you're right here.  For folks non Time or EP flagged it probably is darn nice.  And I think that's what its geared towards?  Still I'd think even for those players Sony would put a some type of a hate proc on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it an absolutely awesome weapon for those pre-Time people for whom the quest to this point is truely 'epic' ? Of COURSE it is, and noone's denying that.<br />
<br />
Is it craptastic for a 16khp Tacvi warrior who did the entire quest with a couple a pals between raids? Damn right it is, noone assumed it would be otherwise.<br />
<br />
THIS IS BY DESIGN. GET OVER IT. WE EXPECTED IT. WE ALL AGREE.<br />
<br />
The point is, when looked at as a whole, and in comparison to equivalent 'epic' weapons it's sorely lacking. The effects could've been 3 times as powerful and noone would've been up in arms. That means they're either underpowered at their current values, or such a marginal effect that increasing their power has marginal effect. THAT IS THE PROBLEM.<br />
<br />
If it was a 10%/2000 vie effect, would anyone REALLY have kicked up a storm about it being overpowered? If it lasted 3 minutes, would anyone really have even noticed? It'll still be used up within a few melees rounds on a raid or against a mob you feel the need for extra mitigation from. Most of the time, especially with the probable epic2.0 effect, the buff slot is too valuable to waste on junk like this, equivalent to a crit heal once every 10 minutes, or a couple of clicks on a Prayers of Life.<br />
<br />
If it knocked a third off the incite timer, would people be tearing their hair out at the overpowered nature of the effect? Incite is 400/70 and Bazu is 600/100 and no-one blinked. Echo of Anger is 30% on top of those values. Does anyone ever actually incite more than once or twice per mod anyway? Any agro problems (at the level of play required for the epic) have only ever been about the first minute or so before proc rates equalise out<br />
<br />
Even the graphic is... so what? It's most certainly not as jaw dropping and unique as the other classes. If definitely didn't have anywhere near the same amount of effort put into it's design. Hell, screw new artwork and expense, just give it the pre-existing 'Seru Sword' graphic files and people might actually bother SSing themselves wielding it. Hell, when I first saw the picture, I thought WTF, that look just like the BoWar! I'd completely ignored the so-called 'epic' weapon in the other hand, heh.<br />
<br />
It's good, but not epic.</div></div><hr />

12/18 10str/dex/sta 50hp  DD288+Stun<br />
Oh you use one, good so we are getting somewhere.<br />
<br />
Now lets say your SoD (which by itself is a good weapon) had for a clicky :<br />
Casting Time 10.0 , range 0 ,  Increase agro by 10.000 <br />
<br />
How would you qualify it ? Absolutely shitty and useless clicky right ?<br />
<br />
Good ! Now change SoD to Epic 1.5. TADA ! Do you now see why i am pissed ?<br />
<br />
I like the weapon for its stats, in really look foward to 2 augments.<br />
But guess what ? The focus &amp; The clicky are just to show off.<br />
<br />
Maybe the 5 (5 secs ? or 5%) reduce timer on the incite could prove usefull.<br />
(I chain pull with Qvic+ People and rarely have troubles because of Incite Refresh timer).<br />
<br />
But the clicky is useless, why ?<br />
Take a look at defensive, when do you use it ? When things get dangerous.<br />
Which means that defensive is never used on a regular basis because of that risk factor.<br />
The same will apply to that clicky, you will always keep it ready.<br />
<br />
Thus not only it is useless (because we already have defensive) &amp; shield &amp; ae taunt.<br />
But it takes away a perfectly good upgrade we could had gotten in its place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm well I think it's pretty decent but could be tweaked some.  If it's a group vie with a recourse hopefully it will be going in the bard spell slots but since you can buy more buff slots with this expansion that probably isn't the case.  The only real complaint I have is the focus sucks ass, using incite that much will kill peoples endurance, even on named I really only use it on inc so I can conserve the rest for when we start moving again.<br />
<br />
The two augment slots and no proc is sort of cool imo because people can just aug it with 2x lifetaps and it's something to swap in your offhand or mainhand I suppose paired with an aggro weapon where you can gauge your aggro to second/thrid on the hate list.  Customizable is good.</div></div><hr />

So for those who have been negative towards the 1.5 so far, the gripe is pretty much with the clicky?  I think everyone can agree that in relation to the other 1.5 clickies, this clicky is sub par.  (Cleric one rocks, again).<br />
<br />
So how about some constructive feedback.  I'm sure that if everyone here focuses on getting a change, it will be more productive than all of the &quot;the 1.5 is great&quot; &quot;no it sucks&quot;.<br />
<br />
So if you think the clicky isnt up to snuff, what kind of improvement would bring it up to par with the other 1.5 clickies? (Keep in mind that all of the 1.5 clickes so far are some sort of group benefit, so I seriously doubt it would be possible to get a change to some sort of Anger proc, if that is your goal)<br />

<br />
Compare with Time weapons, the SK epic wins over the Greatblade of Chaos (W5) on ratio.  The offhander most PoTime warriors went for was an Edge of Eternity (W4), which has an inferior ratio.  The Quarm hammer is comparable, though the Quarm hammer was arguably crap for aggro on its own.  Again, comparable to this weapon.<br />
<br />
The SK epic clicky benefits the group by increasing their accuracy almost one percent, and allowing them to be healed for twenty percent of the damage they deal in melee.  Kind of groovy for certain situations, except that the effect is a recourse and can be resisted.  The resist check is heavily augmented so that chance is relatively small, but still present.  It has the chance of clicking that effect and having nothing happen.  The focus on it is actually inferior to a line of foci that most SK's will have already strove to obtain.  Am I saying it is bad?  Not at all.  I think it is a beautiful thing, despite being inferior in ratio to two weapons already bagged.<br />
<br />
I think that most warriors will find this weapon to be likewise.  The only issue it really needs to have addressed is the casting time on the click versus having a zero Channeling skill, essentially labeling it a non-combat effect.  That, and the clicky essentially requiring two buffslots.</div></div><hr />

Yea the clicky effect is kinda gay but so what.  Better than nothing.  I also like the lowered reuse on the incite line.  Its more damgeless aggro (granted you'd have to do something to the mob first to get on the hate list or you dont get the full initial hate effect.  disarm works for that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I moved it for a reason. Any qvic+ warrior will not be stopping at the epic 1.5 and therefore discussing the stats in comparison to qvic+ weapons is pointless.<br />
<br />
This weapon is obtainable by killing a few mobs that hit for ~2k with some weak ae's. The final mob was killed by 12 time geared people. 12. Is that not enough to show you that this weapon is not meant to be jaw-dropping for those people?  It's a halfway step, give it a rest.<br />
<br />
This weapon is fantastic for the people it's designed for. Save the bitching for when 2.0 is completed.<br />
<br />
War epic should be for aggro.<br />
<br />
No, it shouldn't. I refuse to believe that any warrior who knows what he's doing has difficulty holding agro with the augments and skills available today. If you want this weapon for agro, put your procs on it. That's a major bonus to this weapon, adaptability, and It's something that warrior weapons have been lacking for a very long time.</div></div><hr />

That is kick-ass for any player this epic was actually designed for.  Do any of you warriors understand you have the only group vie in the game?  Clerics don't get a group vie.  This is literally a partial /shield for everyone in your group, except you don't take any damage for it, plus you get something better than just  &quot;resists&quot;.<br />
<br />
I agree with Haas, high end raiders get to wait for their epic, the 2.0, before they get to bitch.  Don't sit here and whine just because the 1.5 epic isn't a &quot;must-have&quot;, none of the epics are designed to be that.  It's a offhandable weapon that has 45AC and a kickass ratio for those it's designed for...<br />
<br />
And to the person who said looting it could cause griefing...remember that they have a system in place where only a person at that point could loot the item (warrior epic actually has a piece like that).  It stands to reason that only the warrior who triggered everything could loot his epic.</div></div><hr />

Clearly it is not...to be honest I can see myself getting more utility from a Guard 3 aug than that effect.<br />
<br />
We should focus this conversation on the clicky and not whether the underlying weap is good/bad (clearly with 2 open slots it exceed any existing pre-time agro weapon by a considerable margin).</div></div><hr />

This system makes me angry just because it's so poorly thought out.  Hell just make the mobs trigger'd events then instead of regular spawns or just limit looting the class that can use.  Not being able to obtain epic pieces out of order is messed up.  It's fun raiding mobs then finding out no one can loot the piece that dropped and then if by chance there was a chest spawn after you loot you won't know unless you wait for the corpse to rot yay!</div></div><hr />

Ok, let me reword that then for you.  Wasting time on a killing a mob to find out that no one can even loot the piece is stupid.  The mob should be triggered, it can be up but don't make it attackable or something.  If you can kill the mob you should be able to loot it out of order.  Even before people had gone through the epic you can already make a good guess at what &quot;a decrepit hilt&quot; is going to be used for, war/pal/sk epic.  I do play the game, I wasn't even there for my epic, we just decided to pull it and having a corpse rot is lame as hell.  Even if I had done it in order you can still only visit each zone once so not like that matters.  Hell you can't even identify stuff since you can't loot it.  I can understand you'd think it's good to automatically limit spoilers which makes sense but again the mob shouldn't be attackble then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior 1.5 epic gives the group a 10% mitigation advantage for 750 damage absorbed and also raises the chance for the warrior to resist spells by 15%.<br />
<br />
Is the SK epic's effect so much more powerful?<br />

If anyone gets to complain I think it would be the paladin, their's just gives them a stun proc. and gives them improved healing by 20%</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see the gap.  10% mitigation is very nice and perfect for warriors.  And you WILL be able to cast that while tanking.  I cast my ring of the crimson bull while tanking all the time and it's a 1.0 sec cast time.  Just hit it when you see a round land and it will rarely be interrupted, even while tanking unslowable boss mobs.<br />

I would rather the effect increased the hate on incite than lowered the recast.  20 second incite is going to drain you're END if you're not paying attention.</div></div><hr />

That's great in theory, but 750 damage saved until the buff fades is peanuts for anyone in a position to obtain this sword. It's one riposte every 10 minutes against low blues. Don't think of it as 10% mitigation, think of it as a 750hp HoT.</div></div><hr />

We have no idea what melee mods are going to be on the 2nd epic.  There is no reason to assume it will not be appropriate for the level it is obtained at.  I mean the DBotW only has strikethrough.  Does that mean all future warrior aggro weapons will have strikethrough?  Just wait until you have something real to whine about.</div></div><hr />

11:  Lifetap from Weapon Damage <br />
12:  Accuracy Amount(50) <br />

If I'm reading that right, it's 18 seconds where all melee damage heals the group for that amount? Say 200dps on the SK, that's... 3600hp group heal. Kinda puts 750 into context, no?<br />

Bottom line.  Cant get a better 1.5 for clerics in Time or any Uber GoD zone.  SK's ratio beats anything in Time atm.  In fact as a member of a guild that raids plane of time.  Every single Epic up until the warriors was better then anything in Time.<br />
<br />
 Warriors epic does not even come close to Darkblade.  The effect seems usefull with raid mobs.  Problem is I will still use Dark Blade and Shield.  Sony gave us shield block AAs.  So this wep wont go in offhand.  The lack of an innate proc of any kind is disturbing.  &quot;It has two augs&quot;  Well the problem is I have never seen a Type 4 anger aug.  So unless there is new type 4 procs or unless I dont see any.  This weapon will only have one proc on it.  <br />
<br />
I would use this in exp groups.  It is only a little better then my offhand.  Lack of innate procs makes them closer.   Been in Time for about 2 mounths now.  Only have gotten to Ikkiniz 2 raid.  I am sorry to say but this weapon really does not do anything for HATE and DPS.  The stats are good but a shield is better.  Maybee there is better weapon augs to be made by players.  Who knows.</div></div><hr />

It's not very hard to see that war class weapon in primary + epic &gt; epic in main + random weapon in just about every way.  Unless epic is way better than the endgame war class weapon (which it shouldn't be), we can only use it for offhand.<br />

Now if you don't have any of the high end War only weapons, I guess the epic is pretty nice.  I'd take epic 1.5 over a Darkblade.</div></div><hr />

You're not going to find many 1handers comparable to a 2hander at the same stage of the game (let alone in the same zone).  The SK epic has better stats than the Warrior epic?  Hell yes it should...it's a 2hander!  You still have another arm you can stick another weapon or a shield in!<br />

It's better than EoE so it's an upgrade for my offhand.  If Epic 2.0 is also offhandable I suspect it'll beat Brutish Blade of Balance and wind up in primary until we find something better and then it'll go in the offhand.  The upside to that is that we potentially have an epic that will remain the best offhander in the game even after it gets repped in the primary slot.<br />

I'm assuming of course that epic 2.0 will have a better ratio than Brutish Blade of Balance and still be offhandable.  If not then I'll feel like we were cheated.</div></div><hr />

Its definately better then any OFFHAND in Time.  If the SHIELD BLOCK AAs are worthless then I can see some warriors duel weilding raid mobs I guess.  You could get the no reposte and no DS AAs for offhand and not have to worry about it.<br />
<br />
Thats my only problem with it I guess.  We got a nice offhander but how much will we be using offhand weapons on raid bosses in the future?  Who knows.<br />
<br />
And is an &quot;Epic&quot; sword really supposed to be in the offhand?  Or during the biggest fights sitting in your bag?  <br />
<br />
I am glad it is both primary and secondary useable.  I figured it would be good enough to compete with Darkblade in main hand.<br />
<br />
Is that so wrong?<br />
<br />
How long has Planes of Power been out?  Hopefully epic 2.0 will atleast = Darkblade of the Warlord in terms of aggro or dps either one.<br />

I know epic is easier to get then Darkblade and the only reason I compare it to Darkblade is because everyone elses epic is better then ANY weapon you can get in Time.  So why not the warriors?</div></div><hr />

Clearly it's a situation of everyone thinking the world revolves around them.  Personally, I will be working on this quest.  Whether I can finish or not with my new work/class schedule, we'll see.  But it is obviously better than anything I'm using or will be getting in the near future and I'm very excited for it.<br />

It is what I was looking for, an amazing ratio for a hardcore non-raider, a unique effect, great hp/ac and a little sugar topping in the shielding (something not readily available to me).  On top of all that, 2 aug slots ... woot.<br />

I have a couple questions though.  Why is everyone saying A3 + Yak?  There are type 8 A3 augs in BB i thought.  So couldn't we have A3x2?  Or does that not work?  Another question, I saw in another post someone said A3 sucked and Yak was now the way to go ... why?

You could have a type 4 and type 8 Anger III if you wanted to. It's all a matter of personal preferrence. I dumped an aIII on my EoE but probably could have gone with a yak proc and still been fine with aggro.

Except you now have to have the appropriate (invisible) quest flags to loot epic items.  Gonna go out on a limb here and assume that turning in the final items to Krekk gives you the flag to loot the item.  The only potential conflict would be someone that got to the end of Epic 1.5, then failed.

We understand.  We're happy for you.  But that doesn't make our point invalid, after all, we're arguing to make the weapon that you want to get BETTER, not worse.<br />
<br />
Ubers: Yes, it's not intended for us. Anyone in Time+ is going to find this a questionable upgrade at best, epic 2.0 is for us.  We know this.  Most of the bitching isn't &quot;The epic sucks because it's not an upgrade for me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
----<br />
The stats are nice. 235hp 45ac and 3% shielding is damned nice in an offhander.  28/26 is pretty good, it's not dps material, but it's not bad.  We're not complaining about that, however.<br />
<br />
Warriors tank. It's what we do.  If a warrior isn't tanking it's because A&gt; he's waiting to tank or B&gt; he just tanked.  <br />
In order to tank we need two things.<br />
1&gt; Good hp/ac/mitigation<br />
2&gt; The ability to hold agro.<br />
<br />
This sword accomplishes one of those things.<br />
<br />
Yes, the sword has two aug slots.  However, so do the other epics, with the exception of the cleric shield, which lacks the type4 aug, since those are exclusivly melee procs.  Yes, you can drop two a3/yk augs into it and make it decent agro.  However, no one else needs to double aug their epic for it to be good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of the box&quot; the sword isn't very good.  It needs aug'd to be good.  And that's the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the effects...<br />
The sword is good for vt-ele people, decent for time+ people, and &quot;ok&quot; for qvic+ people. But no matter where you are in the game, those clickies aren't very good.<br />
<br />
The clicky is a group rune that provides 10% melee mitigation to a max of 750 before dissipating, duration 1 minute.<br />
That means mobs hit you for 7500 damage, and it dissipates, saving you 750 damage.<br />
<br />
It's going to last 1-15 seconds on you before dissipating due to damage, and will, in all likely hood just take up a buff slot on everyone else.  The recourse is good, I won't deny that, but it's self only.  Only lasts one minute.  However, this is assuming that it's an auto cast when you click the sword.  Haven't gotten that confirmed from a warrior without it.  If it's a process of the click, (like the lifetap proc on NDT, for example) the spell resistance becomes completely and utterly useless, as it'll never have a chance to go off.  But as I'm not sure, and am secretly hoping that this will not be the case, I'm not arguing this as a point in my argument.<br />
<br />
As for the focus, it's a joke.  We all know it's a joke.  Admitting that the focus is completely useless doesn't make the weapon any less an upgrade for you than if you're telling yourself it's useful.  It's either 5% or 5 seconds off of the reuse timer of Incite.  Five percent I believe, but I haven't been able to verify it, just going off of similar focuses on epic 1.5's held by guildies.  You shouldn't be chain inciting to try to hold agro.  It's just really not going to make a difference.  Incite is handy for cementing early agro, but a 1.5 second reduction on the reuse isn't going to make the ability noticably better.  It's already good, but 1.5 seconds isn't going to make it better.<br />
<br />
And I know a lot of pre time people are upset, saying things like &quot;this is our epic, save your bitching for epic 2.0&quot;. Well... we already know the effects for epic 2.0.  They're in the spelldat.  We know that the clicky is  a 10/1000 rune, and the focus is 10% off of incite.  Getting the effects changed helps everyone.  We're not trying to make the 1.5 harder to get, or telling you that you suck because you think it's good.  It is good.  I'm in a qvic+ guild, and even in its current state, I will use it in offhand, (suitably aug'd).<br />
<br />
The points people are trying to make are...<br />
1&gt; The warrior epic needs to be aug'd to be useful as an agro weapon.  It is negligible agro without 2 proc augs.  <br />
If the warrior epic had an agro proc, warriors would have the same choices available as every other class.   Instead, we put two agro augs in, or we wear it for show.  We could choose to use proc augs for more agro, or we could choose to use stat augs, or we could mix them.  <br />
2&gt; The focus is a joke.  A couple of seconds off of the reuse timer isn't going to make or break any fight, it's not going to make a noticable difference in 99.9999% of fights.  A reduction of the endurence cost on defensive disciplines would have been much better, or even Echo of Anger for the 1.5.  That would have given pre-time warriors a chance at an agro mod, and still made the epic 2.0 focus useful, since at that point most warriors getting it will probably be either using qvic gloves or still holding onto raex bp.<br />
<br />
Fixing these two things doesn't subtract from the desirability of the epic for &quot;non ubers&quot;.   But non agro warrior epic is akin to a rogue epic being 1hs.  If the rogue epic was a slasher would they be pissed? You're god damned right they would be.  And so should we.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying the &quot;epic sucks&quot; because it's not much of an upgrade for me.  I'm saying that the effects are deplorable, and more they pave the way for the 2.0 whose effects are minor upgrades to these effects.<br />
<br />
Should the epic 1.5 be the best warrior weapon in the game off the shelf? No.<br />
Should the epic 1.5 and 2.0 be decent without having to put 2 agro augs in them? Yes.</div></div><hr />

All of the above are very valid points on why the weapon is good. All we're saying is that it could be made BETTER without being out of balance with other epics, particularly in the case of the effects (which is the part that denotes longevity)<br />

I dont' know why people are being so retarded about it, but it's a great weapon to use with a shield (inverse Dmg/Dly ratio), it's got the 2 aug slots for massive aggro, it's got the incite timer lowering proc, it's OFFHANDABLE, which is the most important part, it has GROUP VIE which is insanely good.    The proc is NOT for you to mitigate more, the AC/HP and shielding acheives that, it's to protect the rest of your group in the unlikely event that you lose aggro and it STACKS with real vie.    <br />
<br />
Jesus, it's 4 relatively easy kills and picking up 8 bags on the ground, and it's among the top 5 offhandable weapons in Everquest for a warrior.   <br />
<br />
The epic is a home stinking run, it's almost perfect in every way, and people can get it pretty darned easily.    I'd rank it #2 or #3 in terms of the other epics (Cleric being best so far, then SK,  then ours).</div></div><hr />

It's the focus + clicky that is the problem.<br />
<br />
Group BoV is insansely neat, but the 1 minute duration kills it. It would have gone over so much better with a 5-7 minute duration (or the runetypething running out, whichever came first).<br />
<br />
The incite focus is just plain stupid. There is absolutely no need for a 1.5 (not 100% on this number) second decrease on incite. It refreshes fast enough as far as I'm concerned. An echo of angerish type focus, or an endurance preservation focus would have been 100 times better then a decrease on incite. <br />
<br />
The thing that steams everyone's kippers is that his focus and click is on epic 2.0 and only slightly upgraded. A lot of people are being told to bitch about this stuff when 2.0 comes out, BUT IT'S NEARLY THE SAME FUCKING THING.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, this statement disturbs me.  It is an epic, asking for something like EoA is not gonna break the game for anyone and all it would do is replace a ridiculously useless effect that is already on the weapon.  Also, I can't raid, my schedule will just not allow it, so obviously the fix isn't to &quot; ... go raid&quot;.<br />
<br />
Second, and the rest of this is NOT directed toward the above quote or the post it is from:<br />
<br />
Regardless, while Echo of Anger or something else to help with aggro generation would be nice, the weapon in it's current state is more than enough for the content I regularly do, and more than enough of a reward for the quest to justify me attempting it.  It is also a good enough weapon that I'm not gonna bitch about it.  <br />
<br />

And mind you all, in SoV I was playing an Enchanter sitting in the backass pocket of raids and playing gems. Yet I still loved SoV, and I'm beginning to love OoW even more than I did SoV, so to me, that's pretty earthshattering.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, my only worry is the possibility that WA5 won't really effect this sword, since to proc anything it needs an augment. In a few threads, I've seen the argument that WA5 was part of the how Sony made Warriors better by increasing their aggro capabilities, and if WA5 is limited on our epic, that's the sole gripe I have with it.<br />
<br />
To the ubers downplaying this weapon;<br />
You can't deny it's badass weapon. It's great in the offhand of an uber or the primary of a non-uber. It's a nice, meritless option if you are raiding time but haven't made the jump to a DBoW yet. We are applying the focus only to the aggro disciplines we know. Nothing's to say there will not be different ones brought into existence later on in the game that this will work well with. The clickie Vie spell is also very nice, particularly during the times you lose aggro.<br />
<br />
But to anybody that's getting uppity about this weapon, regardless of where you are in the game, take give giant steps back and take a really deep breath. Look at all the neat stuff you can get in OoW in general. Clickie Form of Defense 1: cool, and wow it's droppable! Charged Magnetic Armor - ffs, the breastplate has 70ac and begins attunable. That beats out both LDON armor (which we complained about for having too low AC) Ornate Armor, and Trade Skill Elemental Armor. And now this epic. Good for all the reasons I've already listed, with possibly one minor drawback.<br />

Thats a serious question by the way, from where I sit, this is an amazing weapon that can survive in offhand for a long time, though I dont argue that better offhanders exist (including the 2 i named, though those seem to just be more dps offhand), I argue that this is in reality very nice (I see it as too good when looked at vs knights honestly, which are on par with Uqua level items)</div></div><hr />

Surely no one expected better with influential Warriors weighing in against a primary hand aggro weapon when SoE asked for input.<br />
<br />
Besides, as Frodlin says, Warriors shouldn't have problems with aggro - oh wait, the focus effect reduces the time between Incites (aggro) and one of our 4 High Level disciplines is a....... boost to aggro. Aggro is gud, wait not gud, gud, not gud. Force of YKesha is better aggro than Anger III augs - is that a quote?? Why in the heck aren't those Warriors with greater input calling SoE's attention to this fact and getting Anger III (Warrior only) augs fixed insted of noting it like it was the most natural thing in the world????!!!!<br />
<br />
You see the problem is who has SoE's ear. Casual players seem to like it wholeheartedly. But QViC+ (GoD) Warriors note that for a next expansion (OoW) weapon, it's not all that much of an advance. Oh, Epic 2.0 is for us? I beg to differ, the Epic 1.5 weapon should have been a weapon jump for us as well.<br />
<br />
Will I replace my EoE (two expansions old) with this? Yes, until I get something better in about a month in previous GoD content. Epic 1.5 - use before 12/1/2004. Wow, it gets stale fasssssssst. Whooosh.<br />
<br />
Want to fix this *cough* epic weapon which only looks good in comparason to those that are worse? Make a +4 DMG and a Blast of YKesha (0.0 stun to level 70 - 175 DD unresistable) Warrior only augments with a high drop rate in QVic instead of the mana augs. Heck, the casters want the tank HP augs anyway, they won't miss the mana augs.<br />
<br />
Yep, I will probably pursue the Epic 2.0. However, I am a little anoyed that those not doing Epic battles will be carrying around an Epic Jr. that looks like the real thing - it cheapens the whole epic concept.<br />
<br />
I do think it's funny that we get half an epic. Knights can wield 1.5 and have their weapon needs 100% filled. We need 2 weapons, we get 1. Funnier yet is the fact we don't even get the Blade of Strategy half, we get the Blade of Tactics.<br />

I refuse to be forced to use 2 shitty procs just because people want to &quot;customize it.&quot; If the Epic 2.0 doesn't at least have Anger (The DD + Stun + Aggro) It's going in the bag..<br />
<br />
I think most of us were expecting a Weapon we could use while we were tanking, not a handy little non-aggro off hand with 2 stupid effects on it.</div></div><hr />

Give examples of when you would need these effects and what you think the clicky will actually do for you.  If we can just stick to arguing one aspect of the sword.  The one aspect that will not change on epic 2.0  then we can get somewhere.  Plus I want to believe that this clicky will actually do something more then a regen spell would.

you already have a weapon you can use while tanking, its called a DBoTW. this is only epic 1.5 and like many people have already said about it, its not supposed to be better than a DBoTW, epic 2.0 is so shut up.<br />
<br />
id drop my BoW and bring my bloodfrenzy out of retirement once i get this. although not sure which would be better mainhand. seems like the dps on epic would even out the proc mod on the BF and how EB is 100 more hate than a3</div></div><hr />

<br />
No matter how good you are, resists happen.  Pulling two mobs in can happen, as well as the enchanter/CC going down because of resists.  Suddenly, you have to tank two separate mobs.  Interesting concept, no?<br />
<br />
Suprisingly enough, the two effects on it are both based around the idea that the shit can and will hit the fan.  Lower Incite Timer allows you to burn your endurance to keep agro on two separate mobs at once because the CC just went down (or extra insurance using a lower version more often).  The group vie gives everyone in the group a little extra insurance in case they pull agro while this is going on.  Also, if the mob has a dangerous proc...you hit this and suddenly you have 15% higher chance to resist the spell.  How many other effects actually do that without just raising resists?<br />
<br />
That's all the clicky/focus is...it's extra insurance and mitigation when it's needed.  Stating it's a 1.5hp regen or something, as if you're going to click it and try to keep it up every time you can, is foolish and makes you look noob-ish.  The cleric sure isn't going to keep Vie on everyone all the time...that's a waste of mana to them...and in the heat of a near-wipe...you think the cleric is going to stop and vie each and every one of the group?  If you do, you're already dead...<br />

I honestly believe many people are making huge complaints simply because the epic isn't what they thought it was going to be.</div></div><hr />

The epic is supposed to be the pinacle of an award that can be attained via a quest of those able enough to complete it. Epic 2.0 hasn't been completed yet, so no, you can't fucking argue that the 1.5 epic should be AS USEFUL, proportionally, to an uber raider as it is to the actual group of people it was INTENDED to be the hypothetical &quot;pinacle&quot; of. Battleblade what the fuck are you thinking? The epic 1.5 is collecting SHIT ON THE GROUND and handing it into people, with a few three groupable fights! Unless you are arguing that a CASUAL PLAYER/NON-RAIDING PLAYER should be able to attain rewards that a RAIDING PLAYER should be able to attain; so if that's the case, are you willing to go against everything you've said concerning raiders vs non-raiders/casuals, and the rewards available to each?<br />

Maybe a QVic+ dropped Blast of YKesha aug would do it for me if procratemod were high enough. BUT, this is not the case.<br />
<br />
Oh, I understand a godmode weapon is unreasonable to expect. But there is no pratical way, even given the 2 aug slots, to customize it into the Epic (even an Epic Jr.) I want. The problem for me may be the power, variety, and availability of augs more than the weapon itself.<br />

The two aug slots ought to make this a reality. However, it takes putting augs in the game that Warriors commonly encounter and use as they progress instead of universally using LDoN vendor augs - admit it, that's what most of us are using: LDoN vendor augs.<br />

<br />
It's so funny, the Epic is a better weapon than anything up to Demerix (and it could be argued that it's better than Demerix as a tanking weapon), which means it's roughly tied for the *best offhand weapon in Everquest for warriors*, and that's not enough?  It has MORE aggro generated than an EoE when double auged simply due to the melee aggro it generates.<br />
<br />
It's NOT your &quot;epic&quot; Battleblade, it's part of it, it's a useful weapon that can be used while you're finishing YOUR epic.   It's not MY epic either, it's the &quot;halfway point&quot; to my epic, but I'll be wielding it for some time.   <br />
<br />
You talk about LDoN vendor augs as though they're &quot;filthy&quot; because anyone can get em by grinding or something.    NOT ONLY is there nothing wrong with LDoN vendor augs, but.... there's been at least one proc aug found in OOW, and it's indeed possible that there will be others.  <br />
<br />
So, let's see... you can damage aug the weapon and put a LDoN aug on it and make it 31/25 and STILL have a Ykesha proc... You can double aug it, you can put DPS augs on... the choice is yours.    This is a GREAT weapon with the best stats of ANY epic in EQ (same AC, more HP, and more shidling than Darkblade), and it's completely customizable and it's the HALFWAY point to a real epic and you're MAD about it?  Holy toledo, I can't understand for the life of me.</div></div><hr />

 I have 7 words for you:  Finish the quest for your epic then.<br />
<br />
High end raiders get Epic 2.0...Epic 1.5 is a pausing point in the 2.0 quest, where casuals can get finish for a reward.  In practice, you should be getting 1.5 (considering casuals can get it, it should be noooo problem at all for you, right?) then going right after 2.0.  In the meantime, you have a decent weapon available, even if you think it's worthless.  You want a good weapon comparable to your raid equipment...well then you better be ready to do some raiding for 2.0.<br />
<br />
You fail to realize, this is my EPIC too.  Yes, and you're not done with your epic yet...<br />
<br />
I'll even give some help with that.  Here's a link to one of the very few threads that are of people actually trying to finish the final epic.  Very frightening that not many seem outwardly interested in getting a better weapon, yet willing to complain about it.<br />

We have a minor (yes, a minor) difference of opinion I think.<br />
<br />
I believe adding a DMG aug and a DD aug, double aggro auging it, or putting a rune and Vampire Claw aug ought to be within the realm of practical possibility with this weapon. I dis LDoN augs primarily because they don't fit all that well with the customization theme especially for higher level players.<br />
<br />
Make the Type 4 slot into a Type 4,6 (or something) and adding a DMG+ aug becomes more practical. As it stands, I've seen 2 DMG+ augs drop in the last year.<br />
<br />
Yes, Bite of YKesha drops in OoW (there's a Vampire type aug too I think). But I at least haven't been encountering a lot of weapon augs. Add a wider variety of Type 8 augs and reserve the best of them as high level raid loot and everything (more or less) works out ok too.<br />
<br />
Loking at Epic 1.5 this way allows us to see it as a standard model that can be customised as a player prefers and progress permits. As it stands the degree of customization is lmited by the fact most Warriors use LDoN augs and we know of little improvement beyond them.<br />
<br />
As a scaffold for customization, Epic 1.5 still disapoints some Warriors. They would have perhaps prefered a even more pronounced tanking focus for the weapon. I believe this can be overcome with augmentation. BUT, IMO weapon augments are not common on loot dropping mobs and there is not much progression beyond LDoN.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is not exactly the Epic weapon I would have preferred. But, if augments are made available - (for example, in my case a DMG +3 and Blast of YKesha (0.0 stun resistable 175DD unresistable)), I will warm up to it.<br />
<br />
So why hasn't anyone informed SoE that Short Sword of YKesha's proc might out aggro an Anger III aug so it can be corrected?<br />

Here's a fucking clue for you abhorrations of nature.  WARRIORS ARE NOT GROUP FRIENDLY.  We don't contribute jack shit to a group, other than being a motherfucking tank.  We don't buff, we don't heal, we don't have bard songs, we don't have utility, WE ARE THE TANK.<br />
<br />
You get an effect that allows you to bring a minor amount of utility to your GROUP, and you berate it.  Does it need to be fucking overpowering for it to be &quot;Worthwhile&quot; to you idiots?  The ONLY complaint that ANYONE should have about this effect is that it should probably go to the bard buff box, but that shouldn't be a complaint, that should be a suggestion to SoE to make the weapon a little bit more friendly, instead of overpowering the goddamned thing.<br />
<br />
I understand that all of you ubers all insist on bards with FM pull singles for you to mow down, but I've had MANY occassions where I needed incite again to pull a 2nd or 3rd mob off of someone else and clicked it only to see I had 11 seconds left to go on it.  The majority of you mouth breathers spent experience to get an ability called &quot;Hastened Instigation&quot; and yet you can't see the usefulness of a faster reuse on a tool you use more often?<br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks this epic needs improvement in any way, shape, or form, seriously needs to get out into the real world.  The lack of oxygen at your computer desk is making your brain malfunction.</div></div><hr />

Exactly Haas. No utility. When soloing, grouping, or raiding I tank. When I'm not tanking, I'm waiting to tank or I'm dead. So you do get it. It's a Warrior epic, not a Paladin epic.<br />
<br />
I (and others) would have prefered the weapon be strongly tanking oriented. With Anger or better on it - no utility. I will admit to carrying Prayers of Life in a bag, but that's where I keep such things along with ToD, Silken Whip, etc.<br />
<br />
Obviously to be fully customisable it couldn't be focused tightly on tanking only. I think it's the one non-tanking effect that throws people. It is possible to make it an aggro weapon, a DPS weapon, etc. all we need are the augments.<br />

If you double aug proc on it then you're looking at less aggro than a JoS (better ratio, Frostbite + 1 aug is comparable to 2 augs).  <br />
<br />
Besides from the 3% shielding and 20 or so AC, it is worse than a Demerix as DPS, and worse than JoS as aggro.  As a Warrior I care most about aggro, and an epic that doesn't outperform existing offhander (and JoS is extremely easy to get) doesn't serve me a purpose.  If I care about mitigation that much, I'd use a shield anyway.</div></div><hr />

Wake up!  Granted, this weapon is not the greatest thing in the world...But it was never intended to be.  It has great stats.  Its a very viable offhander.  Hell, its a viable mainhander unless you have a DBoW or better.  And people complain, well, xxx is better...blah blah...Ya..that's nice...but not every warrior has access to those weapons.  Even some warriors in high end guilds do not have access to those weapons, just because of luck or gameplay time.<br />
<br />
Its very customizable...you can use it for DPS or Agro.  Before you rant and rave about how you are a warrior and all you care about is agro, consider this..not every warrior wants that agro...basically just the MT and the tanks in the rotation.  Maybe some warriors want DPS, well, they can make this a DPS type weapon if they want, its their choice.  Would it be nice if it had an agro modifier of some kind on it?  Sure it would be, but that is no reason to berate the weapon. It would also be nice if it rezzed someone, took out the trash, and did the laundry, but that isn't going to happen.  <br />
<br />
What can happen, is you place two anger augs on it if you want agro, what more can you freaking ask for?  As seeing its in the same mold as the SK epic, with 2 customizable slots, it makes sense this weapon has no agro proc on it innately. <br />
<br />
It does however, reduce down time on incite.  It might not be a huge amount of time, but its still a reduction.  It gives us a small tiny bit of utility with the Vie type buff, nothing wrong with that. <br />

Its the best offhander known so far in EQ (with the exeption of shields).<br />

For an Offhander you should look for 1)Stats 2)Agro 3)DPS<br />
<br />
THE STATS OWN, NUFFSAID.<br />

It has a semi-useless focus (Weee faster incite).<br />
And a totally pathetic clicky (Weee 7.5hp/tick group regen).<br />

While i do agree the faster incite, isnt that bad.<br />

I'm not a paladin, i dont rune my group, i dont want to rune my group.<br />

Change the rune to self only 10% 3000hp and now its a totally new clicky.<br />

<br />
So it doesn't make any sense at all to you that a warrior could possibly exude an aura of confidence about himself, such that the rest of the group could benefit from his leadership?<br />
<br />
When I think of the real leaders that I know, their confidence spreads to everyone else around them.  I don't think it's out of place at all to have such an effect on a warrior epic.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you don't think 7.5hp regen is enough.  It's certainly quite a bit better than the 0hp regen you gave your group before.  You don't want to rune your group?  Don't fucking click it.  I'm willing to bet we see this weapon in your profile real soon tho.  Prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is my opinion.  I respect your opinion.  Why would you put words into my mouth?  Why do you care so much about me and what I think about a sword?<br />
<br />
I do not like the focus or the clicky.  I like the sword and like I said before I would love to have it in my offhand. <br />
<br />
I was asking for peoples opinions on the focus BTW.  And the clicky.  So three people have talked about the great things we can do with the clicky.  That is great that was my intention.<br />
<br />
Why do you care what anyone thinks about the sword you like?  Fuck everyone else its your sword.  Have fun with it.  <br />
<br />
I think our clicky and focus part of our epic is worthless.  I would rather have a damage shield clicky or a regen clicky honestly.  Focus effect is stupid because I have never looked down to incite a mob and relized shit my incite didnt repop.<br />
<br />
I think this sword kicks ass.  It has a nice ratio for an off hand.  It should make my DPS go up.  I cant wait to see the ratio and stats on epic 2.0.<br />
<br />
Another thing Celiritum said was that I said something about casuals and raiders.  I think those two titles are stupid.  Considering in my DKP guild there is both raiders and casuals.  And everyone has an opurtunity for loot.  The people that raid everynight get more loot.  But a casual gamer can get loot if he saves up DKP.  If you can find a post of mine that I have ever used that word I will give you a cookie. :)<br />
<br />
Everyone else.  Settle down a little.  People are just giving there opinion on a sword.  This has nothing to do with you personaly. Celiritum can try to make this personal but I refuse to.  <br />
<br />
I will say this again for the people in the way back.  The epic 2.0 clicky and focus are listed on Lucy if you have not looked yet you should.  Then when you say &quot;This is our weapon THE CASUALS!&quot;  You will realise epic 2.0 will probably have the same worthless clicky and focus.<br />
<br />
peace I said my opinion and I am back to questing for epic 1.5!</div></div><hr />

I honestly dont belive they would make a 1.5 epic better then DBoW or Brutish Blade....why should they when its aimed for post time guilds....just do the damn quest, keep it in your bank and wait for the info for 2.0 to come out. <br />

<br />
Here, try hard to follow I know it might be hard. But try real hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone who is defending this sword please speak about the clicky and effect.  Give examples of when you would need these effects and what you think the clicky will actually do for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really couldn't care less about your opinion. I couldn't care less about putting words into your mouth; in fact, I didn't. Here's what I said to you:<br />
<br />
<br />
Pappee;<br />
<br />
Prior to your post, at least two seperate people defending the weapon spoke to the strengths of the clickie and/or focus.<br />
After your post, another person added a third post defending the weapon speaking of the strengths of the clickie and/or focus.<br />
<br />
So you either read very selectively, didn't read the thread, or are blind. Which one is it?<br />
<br />
<br />
So let's review, since apparently this is a difficult concept for you to grasp.<br />
<br />
a) At least two people, if not more, defended this weapon based on THE CLICKIE AND THE EFFECT, prior to your post.<br />
b) You then proceed to post asking the people defending the weapon, to present arguments on why THE CLICKIE AND THE EFFECT are good. <br />
c) Then, after your post, yet another person posted concerning THE CLICKIE AND THE EFFECT.<br />
<br />
I'm so sorry for pointing out people had ALREADY done what you in fact posted they should do. If you feel this is a personal attack on you, boo hoo. Try reading next time. Or try responding to what was already posted, instead of asking it again~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furo</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">QUESTION: (in a follow up to Bigchest's post)<br />
<br />
From a strictly aggro standpoint, Mainhanded will this generate more hate than a BF? If not, then is it really better than everything Pre-Time? I'd say no. I recall alot of convo about &quot;hey i don't care what the stats are on my weapon...make it negative stats...but if it is a pure aggro weapon i'm going to wield it&quot;<br />
<br />
I tend to agree with that. Gear is for stats. A warrior's weapons should have one job: to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
So, based on the initial dmg/del and 2 aug slots....will this beat a BF's hate generation? The BF still has a 60% proc mod right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The proc mod only affects the weapon proc, not any auged procs. So, this weapon with 2 anger augs will only proc a little bit less than a BF, but has a far superior ratio which will generate less ripostes, as well as a boatload more stats including a nice chunk of AC and HP. Not including any of the focus effects or clickies I would say that this weapon would generate equal or slightly better aggro than a BF with 2 anger augs, but with the added benefit of less ripostes, more dps, better stats, a unique look, and a stepping stone to a (hopefully...) far superior weapon once we figure out how to do epic 2.0.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then again, if you were asking for more opinions, then you should have taken those given thusfar into the context of your original post or at least acknowledged them.

<br />
Get the weapon, use the click, if its as useless as you say (remember the point of it, though, and don't complaina bout OMG THIS EFFECTDOESNT HELP ME TANK BETTER).Newsflash: It's not just about you. You didn't solo the quest, you don't gain all the benefit. Does a click res on an enc 1.0 only effect them? It's supposed to supplement your group when necessary. I can think of a half dozen instances that this effect could have prevented ,or even postponed deaths in the past week.<br />
<br />
If you can't, I'd estimate you've pushed yourself into the cookie-cutter role of &quot;I take damage and keep agro that nothing more. We're warriors, we're the backbone of the group, and as such it's pretty damn nice to be able to help out more than just keeping a single mobs attention long enough for the group to live.<br />
<br />
The effect definately could just some tweaking, however the general idea of a group vie is FAR from useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 the bov part ain't really all that great, was kinda disappointed about it. the one thing i like about the clickie is the chance to resist spells, which is self only, gogo resisting hard to resist spells.<br />

the focus tho, imo is completely worthless. i can bazu bellow every 28 secs instead of 30 secs now, oh wow... that helps a ton...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theese 3 weapons seem to be the only one to beat out this sub epic quest weapon if prober augmented. Quest is extremely easy for its reward. <br />
<br />
As for offhander. I dont see any offhand weapons better than this at all in game atm. <br />
<br />
Basically adding a  second augment slot into the epics makes them beat the hell out of far most weapons on the market. It is going to be easy available for sup time and probably also sub elemental warriors, i even see casual players getting this. <br />

This is not the 2.0! Damn you people. If you are uber... bag it and shut the fuck up. If you are casual, stare at it and beat off... I don't care what you people do with it, just quit bitching about what it should or should not be. It's not the final epic. <br />
<br />
Also, we kind of have a track record of weapons that get retuned. Darkblade did, Epics 1.0 did, and I would have to say they might re-tune the 1.5's if they feel it's necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reduce the cast time to instant because we have to rely on luck and getting missed to get even a .8 off in a fight.  This is not bad in old places but in zones where mobs have a high attack rating its gonna get old.<br />
<br />
The focus effect is absolutely worthless.  Who uses more than one incite in regular groups before mobs while chain pulling?  If it had an endurance regen mod or also reduced the cost of incite it might be worth it.  Even a focus effect that amplified incite's hate mod would do better.</div></div><hr />

Well said. However if the only thing SoE ever hears is Warriors blowing kisses in their ears saying 'Oh yes Mr. Developer, sir - Warriors will LOVE that Vie effect, so-Warrior class consistant!!&quot;, then there isn't a ghost of a chance of any change.<br />
<br />
Yes, it' not Epic 2.0. But, it's very likely to be as close as I'll get to Epic 2.0 for a year or more - I've been this road before. When players are telling you that Epic 1.5 will be a great Offhander, then I'd say SoE may have possibly missed at least by a little bit.<br />
<br />
Maybe comparing how the Warrior Right click (what were they thinking??!!) and Focus Effects mesh with the Warrior class compared to those effects on the Cleric Shield (perfection!!) and the Dmg/Dly ratio with the SK weapon might seem uncalled for by some. But, if it's ever to be adjusted such comparasons need to be made.<br />
<br />
This is not a casual Warrior only weapon - it's for ALL of us.<br />
<br />
btw, expect them to blow off the scaling problem with small races. This has been the case with many weapons for years. They know it and it doesn't get fixed.<br />

 Picking and choosing spots it's 'weak' against all the other epics is great, if your intention is to make a shopping list of the 'best of the epics' weapon.

I've only got the LDON points to stick Anger 2 on it atm but it held up passably well vs a Blade of War (using Blade of Ornate Symbols in offhand).  I imagine it'll be much better with a Force of Ykesha/Anger 3 combo but will find that out in a few adventures time.<br />
<br />
I dunno, for the effort this sword takes to get, it's got an absolutely stunning RvR.  Sure the incite timer reduction is a bit meh, but I can't see the complaints about the clicky as valid.  Used in a named fight, it's essentially a 750 spot heal and is a very nice bonus.</div></div><hr />

Im a casual player, I get to log 3 to 4 hrs a day between work and University. Im on a family guild, I really dont like raiding on a daily basis, I do work on my gear as you can see on my magelo, and this weapon presents a great oportunity to look for something on the future. The stats by themselves blow anything I have ever put my hands on, the focus, well, if its not there it wouldnt make any difference, the clicky sounds cool at least.<br />
<br />
I can only see 1 (one) potential problem with this weapon... augs... why? Augs were introduced by LDoN, right? So far, I havent seen any droppable A3 augs, so you can only get em from LDoN merchants. The Epic doesnt require LDoN, you dont have to travel to any instanced LDoN zone to get it. So, why someone who doesnt have LDoN cant take full advantage of this weapon? He bought OoW, he bought all the expansions to get the Epic, but cant make full use of it. Noone else brought this up, but sounds like total BS than to take full advantage of a weapon you got out of an expansion, you need that expansion. Its like getting a BoC and since you dont have Kunark, it only procs half it's Hate.</div></div><hr />

It was an honest question about the epic, since I haven't personally used it. There seems like an awful lot of complaining about an effect that couldn't have been available to as many people as are bitching about it.<br />
<br />
If it is truly as bad as people say, then by all means complain -- but &quot;predicting&quot; how bad something is without first hand experience isn't nearly as strong of a complaint as someone who has the epic coming here and saying &quot;This effect doesn't do very much for me&quot;.<br />
<br />
Conctructive criticism about the game does improve it, obviously. It's the radical all-encompassing complaining of jaded players, who have no facts to back up their complaints that don't help at all.</div></div><hr />

Make the buff last 10 mins or until 750 dmg has been mitigated.  This will be more usefull to the group.   Make the buff icon one icon.  Give the group the mitigation and resist.  Or make it self only and up the mitigation.<br />

I think the right click should be instant cast though.  I don't really see how it possibly adds anything for a channel-less class like a Warrior to keep on click your epic until you manage to slip it through a mob's melee round, since the right click only make sense while we're tanking.  <br />
<br />
The resist self buff part I think just gives you a flat chance to resist anything, even if it's unresistable, like the Paladin disc.  It'd help quite a bit for Warriors who aren't loaded on resists/spellshield to allow you to brute force most dangerous procs.  For the high end warriors the resist don't really add too much because your resists + spellshield already take care of most of that, unless unresistable FD procs become way more popular.<br />
<br />
For the incite faster refresh, it's not that it's useless but Warriors are hurting for endurance as it is.  As useless as Savage Onslaught/Rune of Auras are they still give us extra options that will help more than a 3 seconds faster Incite.  I think a focus like +5/10% hate (stackable with Echo of Anger) on Incite would make more sense.</div></div><hr />

My concerns with Savage Onslaught and Aura of Runes were borne out after I acquired them. Those of us with 4-5 years playing EQ can look at items and disciplines before acquiring them and form a useful opinion.<br />

Yes, the opinion of those who actually have an item or discipline should and does carry more weight.<br />

The Warrior Correspondent has suggested placing concerns with Aura of Runes, Savage Onslaught, and the Epic 1.5 right-click effect on the Warrior Top Ten list. I think this is evidence enough that in these cases there ARE some concerns and they aren't totally frivolous.<br />

Players expressed concerns, we discussed them, they have been brought to SoE's attention, and SoE will probably examine them. Looks to me that this is how things are &quot;supposed&quot; to work.<br />

<br />
This new tier of epics require all previous expansions to do them all. We're certainly not unique in requiring an expansion we may or may not have bought. Some classes have to go to LoY for their epics, an expansion considerably more (especially high end) people didn't bother buying. If you don't have LDoN and you're in a position to obtain this epic 1.5, then you're a freeloader who doesn't deserve this epic.<br />
<br />
Re: epic<br />
<br />
Once again. The ratio and stats rock. The effects suck IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER EPICS.<br />
<br />
If I can't keep agro on multiple mobs with a 30 sec incite refresh, I won't be able to do it with a 28 sec refresh. If a groupmember is hit for a potential 7500 points of damage during that 10% of the time a chain activated epic effect would be up, a 750 reduction in that damage won't save them. <br />
<br />
You want suggestions?<br />
<br />
Casters get stackable 4% agro reduction? Just change the incite timer effect to a stackable latent 4% agro increase. Balanced in line with other epics, has to be worn to be benefitted from, doubt anyone would complain. Stick epic2.0 at 10% and you're sorted.<br />
<br />
Change the clicky to a 1 min duration 200 range auto-/shield that covers the whole group. Damage taken reduced by 40% on the person getting hit, same damage applied to the warrior. Doesn't stack with discs. You fall under the protection of a powerful warrior. For Epic 2.0 change it to 60% damage reductions or whatever. Numbers subject to balance and exploitation testing. You're protecting your group</div></div><hr />

We all know Epic2.0 is touted as 'the best weapon this expansion', so no doubt I'll be using it for DPS at the very least. That doesn't mean the effects are up to par. Remove both effects entirely and I doubt it would disuade anyone from getting the epic.</div></div><hr />

The goal of the ORIGINAL EPICS, we're talking Kunark era, was stack. Every epic had to stack. That is why your original epic could 2h - so warriors could still use them on raids.<br />

Every. Epic. Must. Stack. That is the golden rule when creating these weapons. It was essential. Now you have 2 aug slots, able to do what you please with your epic. Sure, LDoN sucks, but you get the option to do ANYTHING. Want 2 DD augs? Great. It's a low agro dps weapon. Want 2 hate augs? (one anger one yak, just for you haass) go right ahead. Big delay makes it a viable 1hander with slippery attacks. It also has a good ratio for ele geared warriors who are likely to not get a Blade of War.<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5 is not for anyone time+ qvic+. I am sorry, it is not. Epic2.0 is for you. I disagree with the usefulness of this effect, I personally feel it needs to be doubled (amount absorbed) and recast cut to about 6mins, but the rest is awesome.<br />

Methinks its stats/ratio places it in a category far far above a BoW.  If i'm not mistaken, with 2 anger3's this would be pretty much the best offhanding tank weapon.  It's ratio is superior to the DBoTWL ... it just doesnt have a 1k hate proc on it with a proc mod.</div></div><hr />

The effects on this weapon are not its strongest points, clearly. And I read Flair's post carefully, because I give his opinions some weight. I just don't think that because you can imagine a more powerful effect that this therefore isn't a fine weapon for warriors.<br />
Not only is it a very good weapon, its characteristics show signs of having been designed by people who were at least considering some of the things that warriors were talking about when this weapon would have been in the design phase.<br />

That's the point sadly too many people on this thread are ignoring. I haven't seen anyone here saying either that the weapon's ratio or stats suck, or that the weapon as a whole isn't a great weapon for those it was designed foR.<br />

All that some of us are saying is that the effects (for EVERY warrior) are so weak as to render them pointless. Is the weapon awesome even if both effects were removed? Sure it is, none of us are disagreeing with you there. Our point is that if they went to the trouble of putting not one, but TWO effects on this weapon, why not actually make them useful?</div></div><hr />

0.8sec cast time shouldn't be a problem.  I've never had a problem casting the 0.5sec shielding off the Dain hammer while getting hit.  Even while running the Dain hammer goes off just fine about 80% of the time I've clicked it, and it wasn't interrupted.  The pre-nerf Circlet of Shadow is 0.5sec cast time and can be cast while full on running as well.  I don't see an additional 0.3sec hurting us while getting beat on.  It might stop us from casting while running with that tiny increase, but doubt we'll have any trouble getting it off while standing still between beatings.</div></div><hr />

2 things.<br />
<br />
Pre Nerf circlet is 0.1 cast.  It was changed from instant cast during the nerf.  It can still be cast on the fly, so essentially instant cast, but it's not 0.5.<br />
<br />
Second. I don't know of any mob with an attack speed of faster than 1 second.  If you're complaining about being able to click this, you're clearly misinformed.<br />
<br />
Third (yeah, I know, I said 2 things), you ubers need to quit whining.  It's getting old.  Wahh, we want this weapon to do this, wahh, this is underpowered.  Jesus christ.  I'm using a fuckin 13/20 and 12/18 for aggro, and they don't have any fucking click effects on them.  I'd be happy as shit if it even had half the effect of this weapon.

That was my point...there is so much whining about it being 0.8 seconds yet if they were actually paying attention it wouldn't be very hard at all to get it off.  Mostly it seems to be raiders complaining about it...and they're supposed to be better than the rest of us...supposedly.<br />
<br />
I'm getting sick and tired of people comparing the weapon to other epics, comparing the effect to a 7.5hp/tick regen, distorting the effect to make it seem worthless.  Paragon of Spirit for the Beastlords comes out to somewhere around 4-5 mana/tick total (if you use it constantly)...doesn't sound very powerful?  Yet, when that beastlord pops it off it's a decent boon to everyone because you won't be using it every chance you get...you'll be using it when you need to.  <br />
<br />
I fail to see how &quot;worthless&quot; the effect is when if you pop it off, everyone gains an additional 10% mitigation for a short time.  Think of it as /shield for the group, with a 10minute re-use.  You think the other classes have an incredibly powerful effect (Cleric epic is a combo Divine Arbitration and group heal...the heal still counts as agro, so while it's useful...it's not gamebreaking for them as they already have a similar ability that doesn't draw agro at all.  The only thing this epic does is allow them to do that DvA/group heal combo without using mana or having a paladin in group).  Maybe the amount of the rune could be increased (750-1000 for 1.5, 1000 to 1250 for 2.0), but as it is the sword seems pretty darn useful if you actally used it when you needed it instead of purposely making it useless by clicking it every chance you get.<br />
<br />
But then again, it's not what some people wanted in their over-inflated ideas of an &quot;epic&quot; weapon, they cannot figure out how an additional ability to protect their group could ever possibly be helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. It is *not* a &quot;buff&quot; which will protect your group due to the low duration.<br />
<br />
2. You really can only &quot;cast&quot; it when needed, which by definition is during a chaotic scenario, one cannot realistically reliably predict &quot;Hey, I have a feeling that this one's gonna get hairy&quot; and thus click the effect.  Sometimes you can (for instance, when you see 3 mobs inc instead of one, etc).   <br />
<br />
3. This click will *never ever ever* be used when you have a single mob attcking only you.   It's asinine to think that &quot;Hey, I can get it off while tanking any one mob&quot; simply because if you're tanking a sinlge mob who's attention is focused on you, you won't need to be clicking it.   There's no benefit to using it when a single mob is on you.<br />
<br />
4. The time when this will be best used is when there's 3-4 mobs around, you've used AE taunt, you've used rampage, you have a couple mobs on you and your enchanter is geting pasted, etc.   Thus the delay of a single mob isn't necessarily relevant, but the delay of several mobs is what is relevant.<br />
<br />
Insofar as the effect is concerned, at least the vie portion should EITHER<br />
<br />
1. Not fade in 1 min, but rather when the damage portion has been used up, thus it being a &quot;buff&quot; and keep the cast time... <br />
<br />
OR...<br />
<br />
2. If it's considered a &quot;combat effect for crisis management&quot;, then it should clearly be instant click.<br />
<br />
The recourse (spell resist portion of the effect) is fine and dandy fading in a minute<br />
<br />
This is my only real concern with the effect is that it seems to have the cast time restriction which is unrealistic to the situations it would most likely be applied in (in other words assuming it's a &quot;buff&quot; where planning can occur), but the restrictions inherent to a &quot;chaotic combat effect&quot; in which case, the cast time is unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the complaint with the clicky effect either.  It's not as good as the level 65 cleric version but it's a fucking clicky.  It's a pretty useful effect.  Also as others have mentioned it's very customizable.  Hell once you get a weapon you'd rather use for aggro in your offhand you can load it up with damage augs and make it a damned nice DPS weapon.<br />

Such abilities may benefit the Warrior Class. BUT, adding something on an Epic that's not in class character is going to be greeted with scepticism - you'd have to be totally out of touch with the Warrior class to think otherwise.<br />

I am sorry if anyone thinks 2 secs off Incite is a good thing.  Wait till you get all your warrior abilities.  I have found myself no longer even pressing incite so I can save up endurence for the new abilities.  I have 6.8k endurence.  And with the new abilities I run out alot.  <br />
<br />
I will say this again.  Epic 2.0 seems to have the same effects.  Instead of 750 mitigation over that one min time.  you get 1k mitigation.  So please stop this.  &quot;Dont talk about 1.5... 2.0 is the sword for you&quot; crap.  <br />
<br />
I am in a Time guild.  I am not deep in GoD in any means.  I do not know how hard epic 2.0 will be for me to get.  I am thinking its going to be extreamly hard.  Considering the dificulty of the Oow trials wich must lead to unlocking the one locked zone.  My guild is also on a PVP server.  So we will have to PVP are way through this expansion.  I wont see the end of OOW for a long time.  Hell I cant even kill Dragorn Champion yet with my Time guild because of PVP.  So please stop saying &quot;This is not my sword&quot;.  Because it is my sword.  It is all of the warriors sword.  Uber and non uber.   And yes it is a great sword.  But if we work together and just put the entire Uber vs Casual crap a side for one moment.  Maybee we can have a constructive debate about the effects on this sword.  One that SoE will read and realise a change is in order.</div></div><hr />

It seems to me that it was intended to be a badass weapon for casuals to use in their primary hand and an amazing offhand weapon for raiders to use until they get epic 2.0. <br />
<br />
It would be an awesome weapon for casuals, and I think its not bad weapon at all for the effort involved, even if it is subpar in both looks and quality to the other epics I've seen so far.<br />
<br />
But for raiders... I'll barely bag my EoE for it, and my EoE is one of my &quot;older&quot; loots.</div></div><hr />

ATM these effects .. well, arent useless, but i can live without it and i wont miss it, for me its like toy - u can use it, but not really need it.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion (or, what id like to see):<br />
<br />
Effect (clickie):<br />
1. Mitigate melee damage by 10%, 1000 total (10%, 1500 total for epic 2.0)<br />
2. Mitigate spell damage by 10%, 1000 total (10%, 1500 total for epic 2.0)<br />
Group, goes to buff window, duration 1 min (1.5 min for epic 2.0).<br />
Autocast:<br />
1. Reduce Healing Effectiveness to 110% (115% for epic 2.0)<br />
Self, goes to song window, duration 1 min (1.5 min for epic 2.0).<br />
(we are damn tanks, we getting damage and we need healing... give this spell resist chance to knights, they already have resistant disc)<br />
<br />
Focus:<br />
1. Reduces reuse time on DEFENSIVE disc line by 10% (15% for epic 2.0)<br />
(and not on provoke line - defensive,  this is disc we use most often, and sometimes whole raid is waiting till warriors have discs up to engage mob, noone waiting for incite to refresh).</div></div><hr />

<br />
and another thing.. why is it warriors always require a shit ton of multi group fights to obtain there epics.. while people  like Necro's , shammy's and other classes have it easy.  they need like 1 or 2 multi group fights.. <br />
<br />
How about you balance All epics to atleast requier the same amount of Multi group fights. <br />
<br />
I guess becuase we have the Most HP in game we should have the harder epic fights.. <br />

Broke it in tonight at Ikkiniz 3 raid.  Thought named was inc once so I clicked it.  Someone wasnt ready so we stalled for a min.  By the time I tanked the buffs were already down.<br />
<br />
2nd time I was hurried to jump in and tank with no defensive so I clicked the epic.  2 secs later effect was off. <br />
<br />
I will never use the epic clicky in a raid situation again.  I wont even worry about it.  750 hps would be like me telling a ranger to heal me a few times in the fight.  Or me equiping a Sews and letting it proc a few times.<br />

It is still a remarkably easy to obtain weapon for how good it is.<br />
<br />
I have no complaints with the RvR and completed all the multigroup encounters between the patch on Saturday (fought Girplan around 2pm) and 3pm on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Girplan and Krekk were overkill with 4 groups each, Dragorn Champion was overkill with 2 groups, Galuk Drek was overkill with 1 1/2 groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the whole point of having right clickies on epics is to NOT make them the best possible weapon ever.  Anyway, it's pretty obvious to me the primary use of the right click for raids will be the auto resist part.<br />
<br />
And looking at the way warrior itemization is, epic is doomed in offhand forever unless they make war only weapon usable in both hands.  I'm not horribly excited about stats or even shielding in my offhand, because if I actually cared about such things I would use a shield instead.  Given war only weapon tend to have the worst possible ratio, I don't see why an offhand weapon with a stun or AC debuff proc from endgame OoW can't outaggro epic 2.0 in offhand.<br />
<br />
I am guessing asking to be able to block with Epic in offhand is asking a bit too much? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daku</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all you people bitching about the epic, how many of you actually have completed it and used it to see how it works? Probably very few. Well I'm in a Time/Qvic guild and I do have it and I do use it and I love it. Before this I was using Darkblade/Aranini's Rage, and I still use that combo when I'm not tanking, but when I am tanking it's no contest I throw in epic 1.5 in my offhand. The Shielding alone makes it worthwhile. The ratio? Not much worse that Aranini's Rage... 28/26 vs 30/26. And I like the 2 aug slots. Lets me use an anger3 aug and a dps proc aug like Ykesha (love that resisted stun for even more aggro).<br />
<br />
Plus it's a step towards epic 2.0, and it's not a very hard quest to complete. The 1.5's weren't designed to be the end all be all for all high end warriors. These are items that guilds that aren't in Time/Qvic can shoot for that will be very uber for them. For all beyond that point it's possibly a nice offhander for some warriors that haven't been able to pickup better yet.<br />
<br />
As someone who had an argueably better offhand prior to completing the epic I'll say proudly that I love it for tanking. When not tanking I go right back to using Aranini's Rage. And I've never had trouble activating the right click during fights when tanking in Time or other big mobs. Learn to time your click with the mobs melee. Pretend you have a big spongy mass called a brain bobbing around inside your cranium and can do more than just hit incite/auto-attack.<br />
<br />
Plus you are forgetting the #1 reason to do the 1.5 epic... the new title that comes with it... Conqueror.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the other aggro weapons between time  fleshbiter, and fleshbiter and Tacvi weapon, are good... offhanders.. they have a medicore aggro proc, and pretty good dps.<br />
<br />
Sidestepping the A3/Yak debate, you can have a good Primary proc, (compared to Runic, Lifetap, whatever JoS is etc) and the standard augment proc.<br />
<br />
Solid weapon for anyone who missed those for primary,  pretty damn good offhanders for people w/o them, and pretty much blows away anything pretime..<br />
<br />
pretty good for an 1.5.<br />
<br />
Re Effects: sadly, most of the effects on melee epics simply arnt very good. its more of a problem with epics all together, rather then warrior in specific.<br />
<br />
the biggest problem i see with it, is that if warriors want to use it for their primary goal in weapons, they have to do more work (LDON's) for a primary aug, while other class's who just do DPS with weapon, while also need to do two ldons, the overall use of the weapon isnt so depedent on it.<br />
<br />
If your an MT in any Qvic+ guild, you would be pissed if the epic was really comparable to DB etc, cause of the ease of getting it. would cheapen your weapon...<br />
<br />
damned if you do damned if you dont.<br />
<br />
it could use a minor tune (maybe +1 damage?) and overall melee epic effects need a look at, but its pretty damn good all things considered</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you ask me, a clicky group buff of any type is an improvement over our current utility. Sometimes when we are ripping through trash on raids, mobs die every 10-20 seconds and I would be grateful to be able to use the incite line more often, although chaining it will put you out of endurance.<br />

Dont understand how anyone Time plus can say the effect is good.  Threw it on for a Raid mob.  The effect lasted agbout 3 secs before the whopping 750 dmg was mitigated.<br />
<br />
So next time I will just tell a chanter to rune me twice or a ranger to throw me a heal.  I will get the same effect.<br />

See this weapon ?<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68740<br />
<br />
When it came live it had a DD/Stun + KB.<br />
A Knockback of 15 !  (As a Reference Stronghorn= KB of 2)<br />
So it was absolutely useless, you would push shit all over the place.<br />
2 3 procs, and you had mobs doing 30 feet jumps.<br />
<br />
See this weapon ?<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68837 <br />
<br />
When it came live it had a 100hp heal.<br />
Does a 100hp heal  seem a rational choice for the best monk weapon ever ?<br />
Nope.  Changing the proc resulted in a 5.5 DPS increase.<br />
Did it become &quot;unbalanced ?&quot; too powerfull ? <br />
<br />
Good, now try to get this into your thick skull.<br />
-2 seconds on incite is absolutely pathetic.<br />
1 min 10 min recast  1sec casting 750hp LDoN rune, is absolutely pathetic.<br />
15% Spell Resistance, is indeed nice.<br />
<br />
Its not like we are asking for &quot;Instant Click DT&quot; or anything.<br />
<br />
But as always &quot;Hass is right&quot; &quot;Hass knows&quot;.<br />

1.5 or 2.0 or 2.5 or 3.0 or 3.5 Beta7<br />

The point isn't that the effect will be much better, it's that for the people it was designed for (italics added for emphasis), this weapon with the effects is a really nice weapon.  The vast majority of those complaining are, as Haass has stated, uber whiners that are above the level it was intended for.<br />
<br />
Like it's been stated, if you don't like the effect that will be on the 2.0...go to the 2.0 thread (you know, the weapon designed for you) and complain about it there.  At least then you'll be arguing about a weapon that's designed for you instead of people below you.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, reading this thread is like reading a complaint that a Fine Steel weapon sucks for a 60 warrior.  Of course it's going to suck, you're above the level where it has any usefulness whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

Such abilities may benefit the Warrior Class. BUT, adding something on an Epic that's not in class character is going to be greeted with scepticism - you'd have to be totally out of touch with the Warrior class to think otherwise.<br />

Group /Shield<br />

Some group shield effect.<br />
Whats the change ? Capless % transfered and no 750dmg cap.<br />

Instant cast, 10 min recast, 20 sec (?) duration.<br />
All Melee dmg done to the group is transfered as it is to me (in a non melee form).<br />

<br />
Generalizations are cool.<br />
<br />
I've said it before and I'll say it again, Casual and Uber are 2 of the stupidest terms used to describe groups of people ever. I completely understand that this is a 1.5 epic, and I know how  ramped up the stats on 2.0's will be. This is a pre-time, mid-time weapon, which is where it's intended to be.<br />
<br />
The click could use work, as demonstrated by people in the thread. 750 damage until it wore off would improve it quite a bit, as would simply making it instant click for an &quot;oh shit&quot; situatin. Having it absorb spell damage as well is another idea.<br />
<br />
However, if you've got sights on this click saving your ass tanking some boss mob post time you're delusional, and it's redicuous to expect that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
A second (and valid) complaint is that of the focus. If you chain incite to pull you're going to notice your endurance going down. A reduction of endurance cost, would have done loads more than a reduction in the incite timer.</div></div><hr />

I suspect nearly every server will have 30-50 Warrior 1.5's in the hands of EP+ raiding Warriors soon. Hopefully the right click effect and focus will be adjusted slightly so they are useful to those that will actually be weilding this.<br />

If enough people don't like the clicky, then in future expansions you'll probably see less of that sort of thing, just as we've seen less in the way of PoP flagging. But the chances that you'll get much of a return on the time you spend trying to get this weapon's clickies changed approach zero. The chances are much better that you'll get a decent return on your time by thinking about what it means that augments are apparently growing in significance and that the ratio of AC:hps on new armor lines seems markedly different from past armor lines.</div></div><hr />
