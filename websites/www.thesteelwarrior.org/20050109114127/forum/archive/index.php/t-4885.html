kind of like how we dont get manna back when cancelling a buff. it would have really surprised me if it were any different. too much complaining.</div></div><hr />

Well you do get the mana back, and you get the endurance back.  It just doesn't require you to wait 30-40 minutes to re cast the spell buff.<br />
<br />
I'm not meaning to sound like i'm complaining.  I have nothing to complain about, I haven't used a /disc except aggresive/defensive in years, now I use them alot.  <br />
<br />
I simply mean that it seems odd that we pay for abilities with endurance points and time.    Maybe it just me and this seems logically to everyone else.  Just seems we were given an endurance pool but still left on a leash (timers).  Why not get rid of endurance if were on a timer still.   Why not get rid of timers if were on endurance.<br />
<br />
Anyways, now I seem to be rambling.  I like the system, I like having 4 different timers.  My endurance pool never seems to be an issue though unless I try to use defensive/evasive every 7 minutes then I run out rather quickly were before this endurance pool I never ran out but still had to wait 7 minutes.<br />
<br />
See, seems like a contradiction to me.  Well anyways, did not mean to start a &quot;Fae complains about everything post&quot;.  My apologies.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
except we cant ...<br />
<br />
... because we dont have enough endurance.<br />
<br />
therefore we cancel disciplines to save endurance.</div></div><hr />

Fellstrike probably not.  Of course you got to budget your endurance a bit to get the 2 bubbles back while still using Incite but it's really not that hard.  Not like being able to use Charge as soon as pops amounts to anything significant in an XP group.</div></div><hr />
