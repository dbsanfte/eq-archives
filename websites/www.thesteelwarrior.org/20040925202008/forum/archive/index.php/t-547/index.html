<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Glad to hear you're ok Azlana.  I recently had a similar first.  I was in a wreck and had to get an MRI of my spine; never had a procedure like that before.  I'm a barbarian in and out of EQ, so my shoulders are so wide I got stuck in the machine. :)  I'm not claustrophobic, but that kinda freaked me out. If they hadn't gotten me out when they did I was on the verge of the 'ol  &quot;Beornegar goes into a berserker frenzy&quot;  :)  Oh, and if you want a job where speaking Barb is a plus, move further south, all the rednecks here will understand you perfectly.(I can get away with saying that because I was born and raised here) :p<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />
