<br />
I've got some pretty good gear for my level, and a friend that tags along as cleric (39).<br />
<br />
However, exp zones are seeming non-existant. Also, the Overthere and dawnshroud are out. I've spent like 70 levels over different characters in them. Anything but that. <br />
<br />
Dungeons are good, but they're pretty difficult without crowd control. Anyone know a good spacey level 40-able zone thats within Kunark, norrath, or luclin? Help please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Deep in Sol A, Low End Sol-B, Lower Guk, Maybe Kaesora, Highkeep, Deep in Paw, Rathe Mtns, Kedge Keep, Deep in Unrest. Those all will work.. Good Luck :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say sebelis/karnors/solb (efrety) I'd say thats about it for good xp spots maybe try out guk for a bit but probably wont stay long. Sebelis is very empty now days so bring your own group and ohh ya you need a key also if you can get a key Howling Stones is great xp place. Althought probably out of range of non twinked lvl 40 warrior but it and sebelis are the only places you can get to 60 reasonably fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There just aren't a great variety of places to level in your 40's.  LDoN is great, get it if you can.  Of course you need 4 to go into a dungeon, and you really want at least 5 if you want to win, so you will have to add some other folks.<br />
<br />
For Luclin, check out Hollowshade Moor.  I think a lot of stuff goes low blue or green around 40, but there are some great drops there and if you do the war it yields some super gear, 16% haste cloak, 11% haste belt, etc.  Grimling Forest also has some great drops, but is better for mid-40's.<br />
<br />
In Kunark the mines of Nurga are great, but they are more 45-55.  Also mid-40's is really the starting point at the earliest.  Some super drops there also and good xp bonus.  Sebilis really starts low 50's I think, but you may be able to handle the entrance in mid 40's, but you have to get a key.<br />
<br />
SolB and Lower Guk are also good, but again they are better in your mid to late 40's.  Splitpaw lair is a good suggestion.  I haven't been there in ages but I remember liking it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">City of Mist was pretty phat XP in the late 30's early 40's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I should think the dreadlands are also an option at those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly, unless you're planning to bring your own group, I'd get LDON asap.  Not only is it a goldmine for an untwinked warrior to get good gear, but it's where pretty much everyone hangs out these days.  Many of the old xp zones are empty.  (Took a group to PoN the other night and had the zone to ourselves for over almost an hour).  I'd say get velious and luclin too just for the gear drops you can get.</div></div><hr />
