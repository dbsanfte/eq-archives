I'm actually as much excited by the level of detail as I am by the improvements in gameplay.  When SOE is willing to give us such an intimate look into the source and resolution of bugs, it lets us see not only that they are working, but how hard they are working, to improve the game for us.<br />
<br />
Of course, this may just be my perspective on it as a programmer.  But I think it's a very encouraging step on SOE's part to show us this much behind-the-scenes bug fixing detail.<br />
<br />
And I can't wait until it's safe to corner or wall mobs again.  :-)<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with you, Gront. <br />
<br />
That's the sort of status report I crave to see as a dev manager. I am very encouraged. Let's hope the promising signs we're seeing translate into solid code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, it's good that they're posting things like this.. keeping us up to date on fixes. it makes us feel better to at least know they are working on it. <br />
<br />
plus that /corpsedrag thingy would be really cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep....those kind of posts are great to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">New bug this patch, most likely due to the collision fix.  If two characters port in at the same time and remain where the port places them, they'll be on top of each other and one will constantly take falling damage off of the others head.  And not normal damage either.  I port all over hell while looking for something to do sometimes... I 3-box, one of them being a wizard.  Upon almost every port, two of my characters start taking 122 or so damage over and over from falling damage.<br />
<br />
I've heard of a case where someone died because of this already, and it doesn't suprise me.  If I had hit port, then went afk, I would have came back to two dead characters.<br />
<br />
Be careful when porting and zoning.  I would assume that this would also happen while zoning into any zone that places all of the characters at the same point.  Don't go afk after hitting a zone or being ported, wait for it and move your character off the spot just to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On a related note, I recently worked on /corpsedrag and /corpsedrop commands which allow a player to drag up to two corpses automatically (one for each hand  ). The system can be extended to support more corpses at once if the design team decides they want it; I'm hoping it becomes an AA for classes that tend to do a lot of corpse recovery but please don't take that as a promise this will happen. It was sort of a backup plan in the event the real corpse bug (as described above) didn't have a fix identified. These functions are done and seem to work just fine but we didn't want to give QA even more to do since there was so much going into this update. We'll activate them on Test in a day or two and see how they do. It's pretty nice to just run around with corpses like that, no spamming /corpse keys. Look for them on the next update to live servers (not tomorrow).<br />

I like this guy</div></div><hr />

I've had this happen to me a couple of times over the last 2 years, so it isn't a new thing.  When it happened I /petition'd and eventuallu a Guide (or was it a GM)would come and give me a 100% rez.  This indicated to me that it was a well known bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah according to  Woodies EQ Summit write up (http://gucomics.com/news/summit_mp.php)  This guy is relatively new, young and pretty upset about all the code screw ups.  So, I have hope, it's small.. it's reserved.. but its hope</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, but what's new about it is that it happened every single time I ported (At least 10 times last night), instead of a couple times over the last 2 years.  Old bug that's been revitalized and happening very commonly now :(<br />
<br />
I wonder if it has anything to do with extreme height differences as well.  Two of my characters are gnomes, the 3rd a barbarian.  Though it was the barbarian and one of the gnomes taking it, what seemed to be falling off the head of the 2nd gnome for unusual amounts of damage for that high of a fall.</div></div><hr />

Wow ... /beer Grumbuk-Dev.  The kinda communication I always wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Had the falling thing happen twice in BoT the other night after group evacced to zone in. My Barb Shaman was taking like 90-100 falling damage every second or two falling off my big Ogre head until I went and moved. Thats not bad when the shammy has 5K HP but I imagine it could be a fast death to lower level folks or those that are AFK</div></div><hr />
