<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A while back, the Druids from EQDRUIDS forum got together and started a dialogue (I suppose via email) with developers or whoever and presented a case for improving their class.  They basically hashed out what they wanted on the boards and came up with a final draft to present to Verant and got some changes made to the benefit of their class.  Their basic case was, &quot;we aren't really necessities on raids and we can't heal worth a shit compared to a cleric&quot;...as a result they got two partial Cheals, Nature's Infusion (damn close to a cleric supernal), some better nukes, and some other things.<br />
<br />
I suggest warriors take a page from the Druids &quot;get shit changed&quot; Handbook.  Elect a leader, brainstorm, hash it out on the boards the things we want that won't be &quot;Unbalancing&quot; and try to implement change in a positive way.  If you are already over EQ and waiting on SWG and WoW then you probably don't give a damn.  However, bitching and whining and threatening to leave for the next game isn't getting it done.  I seriously doubt developers peruse these threads looking for malcontents or ideas.  Take the bull by the horns and go after them.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying unionize and every warrior cancel their account for thirty days to try and impact the sony pocketbook, what I am saying is make a detailed &quot;list&quot; of what will make the warrior class better and then figure out how to start a positive dialogue.  We don't want warriors to be the ultimate God class of EQ (well I do, but I'm a bit more realistic), but I think we all are hoping for some tweaks.  Let's not wait for the next expansion and pray something good happens, lets go after it...<br />

One of you Overlords step up and become a leader, or nominate someone and get started.<br />

<br />
   Second yes druids do have alot but they also are probably one of the most played class in the game. You will not hear the druids say this but it is because of there easy of play. I believe the reason that the druids got the attention that they did is because there are so many of them. Plus the fact that when a druid gets tired of playing he twinks another class and goes on. When a warrior quits youll probably find that most of us truly quit.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I do not believe the devs will ever do anything for the warrior class anyway but we can always try anyway. Fact of the matter is they are trying to get away from the point where you have to have a certian class to be succsesful and lets face it all warriors have is tanking. To help us is to move away from the direction they have started down which is to make every class feel more usefull. Pallies SKs are now tanking in exp as good or better then us. Druids and shammies are healing almost as well as clerics. There are no more niches for any one class and unlike our rogue or monk counterpart meeles we have no other niche to take beacuse other then tanking we suck.<br />
<br />
  Ok got that off my chest what I mean with all that is I think verant knows we suck and they just dont care hell only time absor ever posted here was to inform us of stormm</div></div><hr />

Im not familiar with all of them, but the fact that we arent wanted anymore to do our main job comes to mind.  Every day we log in, we /feedback  (said message).  If we all say the same exact thing, they may realize that were uniting to help our class.  Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then everyone can cut and paste it and email it to developers forum everyday.<br />
<br />
to be honest, i dont think our wish list will be anywhere near that monumental list that the druids have come out with. prob something like - <br />
<br />
a. better aggro control - with a few suggestions on how to do achieve this.<br />
<br />
b. Better mitigation/hps - nuff said.<br />

c. Itemisation?<br />

<br />
Seriously though, whatever issues the druids have it's much easier to come to a conclusion about things as they have hard numerical data on healing/nuking strengths which they can compare, plus balancing can be easily messed with with new spell lines etc. Warriors problems and how to fix them are not so easily quantifiable. There is also a far greater likelyhood of unbalancing  things between us and our tanking brethren and/or the PVE encounters whilst messing with things. As such coming to a conclusion about what we want is harder to determine and the effectiveness of suggestions is harder to 'prove'.<br />
<br />
Personally I think to really make things right tank aggro lock should be removed and knights and warriors should be rebalanced so that each can tank and each can feel comfortable of their use to a group in a secondary role. Plenty of people here will disagree with me and i realise that the likelyhood of SoE putting the manhours into doing this right (if it is indeed possible :P ) is pretty low... but can you be sure I'm wrong?<br />

omg, untill there is a druid in EVERY GROUP then they won't be broken. But untill then, they are broken as fek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">frodlin comes to mind to alot of people. because he is the following:<br />
a) a overlord who worked hard to where he is <br />
b) knows a hell of alot about the game for warrior class and in general<br />
c) convinces people very easy<br />
there is also another person i'd like to suggest named Fulorian C. he doesn't post alot here anymore but on the old steelwarrior boards he was quite popular and good. some of you oldies probably remember him. now back to the subject.<br />
<br />
i actually do think druids should get animal slows it's like necro's with undead.<br />
<br />
I think the devs are thinking... dunno how much but i think we need to see what happens with Lost Dungeons of Norrath. but alot of us don't want to wait that long. including me. almost all the classes have had changes.  druids clerics shamans mages wizards paladins shadowknights enchanters monks rogues. I mean every class has had something. it's time for us to have our upgrade. If SoE was planning to make hybrids be better tanks in groups they did that. too well. paladins easy aggro with a 5 sec cast make it so their the ench/shm's cast slow on incoming so they take less damage throughout overall. While us warriors have to attack the mob get slowed let the shm/ench take a hit or two and pray that taunt works. if it doesn't then taunt again or pray our dps/weapon procs does the charm. For raids where usually tank due to mobs being less likely to slow and we have multiple wisdom classes healing. we also have time there to get aggro.now back to grouping situations. there are HUNDREDS of ways to do this. i'll give the 3 best(or what i happen to think are the 3 best)<br />
1) when taunt fails it's a 2 second repop (or 3) this makes it so the ench do not get chomped over it is easier to keep aggro but again it's not 100% like the knights this causes it so our hp/ac bonus will even it out with aggro and we will still be able to actually keep it over a aggresive hybrid or melee<br />
2) make the knights spells cast twice as long and 50% more mana. with FT 15 kei and all the other bs mana regen they'll still have great aggro just not 100% this will cause knights to complain so i suggest 1 over this one<br />
3)do something like both of this. cast twice as long but not more mana. and 5 second repop. just something to help with us and make it a little harder for knights because anyone can press a button to cast a spell.<br />
Without hearing from SoE about their ideas for warrios taunt problems isn't gonna tell us much.<br />
there are problems with all classes. the feature is very greyish we will not what will happen without it happening. I doubt your idea will work but it was worth a shot. <br />
Making aggro so it's not 100% was a good idea for warriors but it should be the same for sk's and paladins too. the hp difference should be trivial with the aggro like i said above. if they do that all would be good. this should be our main concern with disciplines being later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids are nothing but whiners and complete asshats. <br />
Every class has their fair share of these types.  Druids certainly are no exception, especially since about everyone has a druid alt to port.<br />
<br />
They want and want and never get nerfed.<br />
Harmony, charm, to name a couple fairly recently, ch also got nerfed a slight bit a while back.<br />
<br />
Did anyone read what they want. They want the ability to Rezz becuase they say that Clerics have a monopoly on it. They want an animal only slow also. <br />
Once again most druids do not want this, yes there are some random dumb ass people that believe that is what they want, while most druids that have any sense understand how unbalancing that would be.<br />
<br />
They are ridiculus they are already the most easiest class to play and they want more. All classes got hit with the nerf bat at one time or another when was the last time druids did.<br />
  Oh yes a druid is the easiest class to play, nevermind that we have more to be capable and proficient in then just about any other class.  Granted many druids cant play very well at all, but a well played druid is nothing to scoff at.  While 95% of druids are someone's gimped out alt there is still those 5% that can actually play their class.<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually most druids feel that more or less we are about as balanced as we are going to get, while there are still some issues with the class, VI would probably end up breaking more then they would fix.<br />
<br />
With that said I return you to your regularly schedualed postings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I over looked the Harmony nerf,  Charm wasn't nerfed to the point of not be able use druids have a MR debuff, the class that got it got hit the hardest was Necros they have no way off debuffing MR on the mobs. SO dont cry about that.  Complete heal why the hell do you need a CH spell in the first place you are a druid not a cleric.  Basically it comes down to this Druids see what other class have and they want it they are like that spoil girl in willy wonka chocolate factory if they don't get it they cry and whine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah, I certainly didn't intend this thread to be about druids.  I only used them as an example because they have found a way to get a decent hearing from VI on their concerns and I think we should do similar.  Enough druid bashing or discussion and enough, &quot;nobody will help us :confused: &quot; crap.<br />
<br />
I envisioned three people stepping up or getting nominated to create a thoughtful thread (a new one) and paste various ideas that have been presented in different threads and come up with what we feel we need and get it presented, whether it be email, direct mail, in person at a fanfaire, etc., to a developer who agrees the class is due for some positive revamping. <br />
<br />
It can be done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thought:  Here is an easy way to improve dps and aggro issues in one shot that would have a great impact while making the war class more fun...<br />
<br />
As a 61 Warrior I almost never use an offensive disc.  Why?  Well, shit, who wants to get caught in a situation and not have Defensive up.  The only times I ever use these are when I'm aggro kiting or in an encounter like Behemoth when I am 4 or 5 tanks deep.<br />
<br />
--Make every disc a 10 minute refresh with a 400 hate plus for offensive ones excluding Furious and Fortitude which should be 30 (so as not to trivialize encounters by setting up DA warriors back to back)--<br />
<br />
This change could be made in a day or at least tried on test right away to see how it affects wars.  Cmon, who here doesn't like to berserk??!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">doesnt matter all they are going to to &quot;Fix&quot; melee is add more weapons that 10% of the population can get and a new discipline that has a 60 minute reuse time and last for about 10 secs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is there a &quot;but&quot; in that statement? It just seems like an odd transition. Would read better if it were an &quot;and&quot; instead. And NO I'm not being a grammar nazi.<br />
<br />
I just think changing the word to and, changes the meaning of the statement to make it more logical with what you're trying to say.<br />
<br />
Druids are a class that gets attention from SOE AND they are the most played class in the game. Which would mean the two points are linked together, or have something in common.<br />
<br />
Gah, I'm overanalyzing your sentence way too much. Sorry.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will not hear the druids say this but it is because of there easy of play. I believe the reason that the druids got the attention that they did is because there are so many of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I see what you're saying, I also think we need to keep in mind that warriors are a very popular class as well. For mains, for twinks, for whatever. At least on my server, Povar. There's a bucketloads of warriors, everywhere. I get the impression it's a popular class choice on other servers too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus the fact that when a druid gets tired of playing he twinks another class and goes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh, two druids I know both twinked WARRIORS. <br />

<br />
Actually most the druids were against the ch idea originally, we didnt want to be clerics, just needed better healing, of course we wern't about to turn down a solution to make the class better, and it certainly has helped dramatically in the means of class balancing.<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to this Druids see what other class have and they want it they are like that spoil girl in willy wonka chocolate factory if they don't get it they cry and whine.  <br />
<br />
So your saying that other classes dont have anyone that plays it that want to be in god mode?  We all no there are no warriors out there get jealous and whine. /sarcasm off.  Im not saying druids are perfect by anymeans, im just saying dont judge a class by the idiots that play it.  We all know not every warrior out there knows his class, and that is a fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ isn't a hard game. <br />

Also if EQ isn't hard then all druids must be played by tards.  Hmm there are some here I wonder if a story at www.tardblog.com is about them.   Like I said before no matter what we say the devs will only fix melee by adding more weapons that 10% of the warriors can get and adding a disc that last for like 10 sec and recast time of 60 minutes.  Please try to keep up with me here.  It is apparent that they are done with melee since casters get retuned every patch.  I haven't seen one patch that didn't go by that a caster update was not part of it.   Druids are balance maybe too balance I am just trying to figure out why in god name their snare need to last for so long.  ALso their bitching about CH is ridiculus I was grouped with a 58 druid as our main healer (not my choice) it was healing me for 3k.  You telling me they want more than that they want the cleric complete heal.  You know what they shouyld all get into wolf form and chase a car off a cliff it will make my day.</div></div><hr />

True that makes it somewhat less of an issue, however I do notice there are alot of casters that purposely position themselves away from the tank.  While I can make a &quot;helpful suggestion&quot; I do my best not to &quot;tell&quot; anyone how to play their class.  While I have no doubts I can work around it, I just hate losing taunt when the target is too far away.</div></div><hr />
