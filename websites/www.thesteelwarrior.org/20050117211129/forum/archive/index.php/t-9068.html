<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcast12</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had my 66 shaman and 65 warrior in fungus grove last night PLing my bot afk cleric to 56 (we were doing the caller cycle with an earthshaker). I had been constantly clicking my 5 line /pause x, /cast x hotbutton on the cleric to raise his skills. The zone was empty for at least 4 hours when all of a sudden &quot;sentinel soandso&quot; turns up, he looks at my cleric for a good 2 minutes then leaves without saying a word. <br />
<br />
Did the GM show up because I was using the earthshaker, because my cleric was leveling so fast (43-56 in 4 hours) or because I was using the hotbutton macro?<br />
<br />
I'm confused, don't really want to get banned lol, I'm beginning to think it was the earthshaker?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvak</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most likely, since you were using the same in game hotkey, they thought you were mq'ing...<br />
<br />
When they showed up, and you turned to them, they problably realized you were not, and left.</div></div><hr />

Some system of their's probably flagged the cleric because it was using just one command over and over and it was leveling pretty quickly.  Likely a small combination and they just came over to see if perhaps someone had left it to sit there and macro for a while.</div></div><hr />
