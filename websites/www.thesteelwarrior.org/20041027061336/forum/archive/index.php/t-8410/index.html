<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after reading some of the advice from the guys around here I took our guild and a few from another guild ( 3 groups total ) to ToV. Well we did the HoT area and cleared every named except for Dozekar. Doze was not up and to my understanding is pretty much perma killed. I left my druid there for tracking purposes. What I was wanting to know is that if we did NToV would this ruin our CoV faction ? Also would like to know the same about WToV. Thanks for any info.<br />

BTW I now have 2 of the 4 parts for the haste bracer =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes it would and very quickly.  I can't speak to WToV, we were always on Giant faction back then except for a few rare people.  Those on Dragon faction though suffered really, really bad hits from even a few hits.  Life was much simpler once we went to kill-em-all faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Years ago on my first trip to NToV, I went from max ally to max kos to CoV in about 2 hours. Memory's a little hazy, but I remember WToV being negative CoV faction, but positive Kromzek and Tormax. NToV does not give positive giant faction, just negative CoV and Guardians of Veeshan.</div></div><hr />
