<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deadmark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did anyone know if Fabled items will poof after the event or so ?:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL, that would be classic.<br />
<br />
I find it appropriately classic as well that upon the 5 year anniversary of Evercamp they created the worst Evercamps ever to be camped.  What would have been super cool is if they had made random spawns which dropped these kinds of items, rather then forcing people to sit on lists for hours and hours as should have been apparent that is what would happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If they did there would be a lot of pissed off people that spent hours camping those items and sold stuff that they upgraded after getting them.<br />
<br />
Nothing is really overpowered though so why would they take them away?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the definitions of fable.  Source: dictionary.com.<br />
<br />
A falsehood; a lie.<br />
<br />
Hmm...  A fable is normally a tale that is told that is untrue, made up, a lie.  So wouldn't fabled items not be real?  What is the purpose for using the word fabled?  Maybe SoE didn't really know the meaning of the word...  and they thought it sounded cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if they poof my fabled darkpaw paw i'm gonna lose it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, that or you don't know the definition of &quot;fabled&quot;. From m-w.com: 3 : RENOWNED, FAMOUS</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hah, only fabled item we've gotten is a fabled dagger of marnek, total pos we came across when checking out for fabled drops in Befallen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd call that 'zerker with the fabled exe axe one hell of a kiling machine :D<br />
than i'd call me jealous. that thing is pretty neat. When I got my first exe axe and saw that sucker proc I thought I was the Lord himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, well sorry, but it even takes some digging to pull that meaning out on m-w.  First thing it pulls up is -<br />
<br />
3 entries found for fabled.<br />
To select an entry, click on it. <br />
  fable[1,noun]fable[2,verb]beast fable   <br />
<br />
Main Entry: 1fa·ble <br />
Pronunciation: 'fA-b&amp;l<br />
Function: noun<br />
Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French, from Latin fabula conversation, story, play, from fari to speak -- more at BAN<br />
: a fictitious narrative or statement: as a : a legendary story of supernatural happenings b : a narration intended to enforce a useful truth; especially : one in which animals speak and act like human beings c : FALSEHOOD, LIE <br />
<br />
Then if you really keep digging you can actually find the meaning of renowned, famous.  But that's not normally the context the word is used in.  But props to SoE, it does sound cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If by &quot;digging&quot; you mean, clicking on the word &quot;fabled&quot; and pressing &quot;go&quot;, then yes, I suppose you have to dig. Since that was evidently too difficult for you (since you didn't post the def for &quot;fabled&quot;, but for &quot;fable&quot;), here is the correct definition:<br />
Main Entry: fa·bled <br />
Pronunciation: 'fA-b&amp;ld<br />
Function: adjective<br />
1 : FICTITIOUS<br />
2 : told or celebrated in fables<br />
3 : RENOWNED, FAMOUS <br />
<br />
Def 3 is what I immediately thought of when I heard the titles, and is what I usually think of when hearing the word &quot;fabled&quot;. I blame public education for the lack of vocabulary skills that is giving rise to this rumor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LOL, my education is just fine thank you, I was an honor student at a prestigious catholic university, and I was consistenly an A student in English.  So you can't blame public education, mine was private.  But if you feel the need to insult me for some reason, go for it, I suppose I deserve it for a weak attempt to bash SoE.  You sir, however, in my opinion, are an ass.<br />
<br />
Main Entry: 1ass <br />
Pronunciation: 'as<br />
Function: noun<br />
Etymology: Middle English, from Old English assa, probably from Old Irish asan, from Latin asinus<br />
1 : any of several hardy gregarious African or Asian perissodactyl mammals (genus Equus) smaller than the horse and having long ears; especially : an African mammal (E. asinus) that is the ancestor of the donkey<br />
2 often vulgar : a stupid, obstinate, or perverse person -- often compounded with a preceding adjective &lt;don't be a smart-ass&gt; <br />
<br />
Definition number 2, didn't have to dig for it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks. I'm striving to be like Haass. I know it's not an attainable goal, but you've got have something to shoot for, ya know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ROFL, nice retort.  I take back my comment, anyone who can make me laugh doesn't deserve to be called an ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehe, don't mind me. I'm just getting back into playing my warrior again, and after staying up until 3:30am getting a FSSoY, FExe Axe, and FFBSS, the mere suggestion that they might poof has got me pretty cranky, especially on 3 hours sleep :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow, you got all three?  That is kickass.  I am sure they won't poof the items.  I think I may have to trek to Guk, but I'm guessing on a Friday night it's going to be pretty bad.  Weeknights just don't work, I used to do the stay up all night thing and try to work the next day, but my current job is too demanding for me to get away with that.  :mad:<br />
<br />
Edit:  Well except for today, my boss is out, and my co-worker that I share an office with is also out.  I should have stayed up all night last night.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I wish I had that much time to devote to getting a fabled exe axe.  If it looks anything at all like the original I'd never use anything else.  Like Shik,  I thought I was the almighty himself when I first got mine.  <br />
And it's hard to beat the look of a barbarian wielding a double bladed axe as big as he is  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yup, same graphic as the original, looks great.<br />
<br />
The group I was in was pulling all of dead side, and was having MUCH better luck getting the other named to spawn than Frenzy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gimmel's title needs to be &quot;Haass in training.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kudos to Telen and Gimmel, for giving us all an example of how to fight well.  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The fabled no level req/rec bp in befallen is better then ornate bp's practically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You mean in Sol B?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Aye, I think the frog means the Mithril BP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah that would be the Sol B Breastplate, and while not better, it's a whole hell of alot cheaper.</div></div><hr />

.... add to that we've seen more than the usual amount of greed, KSing and bad mouthing.<br />
<br />
WTG SOE.... celebrate the last five years with all the things EQ is reknowned for!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I just saw that Rangers, 'Zerkers, and a whole host of other tards can use that Mith BP. <br />

I DEMAND JUSTICE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I can tell most of you weren't around when Drelzna actually did drop Jboots.  The lines are about the same and there are less people in Guk &quot;evercamping&quot; the drops now than there were when it was one of 2 places you could get exp/equipment.<br />
<br />
And a level 10 Berserker with a Fabled Executioner's Axe has a 14/50 weapon with some stats.  Whoa!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">They should have called them &quot;Legendary&quot; or &quot;Infamous&quot;.  I dunno who came up with Fabled, but &quot;Legendary&quot; suits these camps better.</div></div><hr />
