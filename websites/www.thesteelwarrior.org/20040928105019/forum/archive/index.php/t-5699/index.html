<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I handed in a rune from Kod'Taz to the guy on the boat and got a &quot;Tome of Bellow of the Mastruq&quot; and went to give it to a guildmaster. He told me to use my new skill wisely, but I didn't get a new skill.<br />
<br />
Reported and Petitioned, but with all the zone crashing who knows what'll happen. Anyway, might want to hold onto runes for a few days at least until they get everything worked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">so the new skills we get with GOD release are dropped as a rune then turned in to someone....kinda like EP, SP and Runes for spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To get Bellow of the Mastruq, we hand in a Rune, the same kind Casters use for L65 spells?<br />
<br />
Woohoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, a different kind. A teleosian geomancy rune i think is the exact name.<br />
<br />
Mine dropped off some gimp named in Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That blows Raaj =/ GMs do anything about it or blow you off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah i got the skill back today - everythings gravy~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Behemoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">got the skill back, or the rune back, or the scroll back or what?<br />
<br />
be specific</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Who do you turn the runes into to get tombs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The better question is:  Is there a noticable difference between BoM and Incite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just had to camp for it to work, zoning didn't fix it.<br />
<br />
And yeah, there &quot;seems&quot; to be a noticeable difference, but according to lucy it shouldn't be much different. Who knows, i'm happy with it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oogagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">By number's it doesn't seem big, but it is 10% increase still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Taelosian Geomancy Stone (no drop, looks like a rune) to Reyfin Malakwa in Abysmal.<br />
<br />
--- loc p220, p280 along the west rail of the boat. <br />
<br />
Got one yesterday from the first trial in kodtaz and turned it in for the new bellow.<br />
Everything worked fine so seems like they fixed the bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">good to hear.  I'm looking forward to getting to GoD and snagging some of this stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ZhaoVizier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Alright, quick question, since this would apply to all melee.  Was the stone droppable, or the book droppable?  In other words, are either of them sellable?  If not, I'm kinda screwed, can't get into those zones....  <br />
<br />
Also, know if casters have to use the same stones?  If they are like the PoP rune quests, possibly turning in a second stone may yield a different skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Same stone for any class be it hybrid/melee/priest or caster - from how I understand there may be more than one type of stone and each will always give the same reward, with reward being based on the class doing turn in. <br />
<br />
Both Stone and the reward - in our case Tome of Bellow of Mastruq and no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was wondering if there is any more information on where the Runes or whatever else is used to turn in for the new tomes drop from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kod'taz nameds and beyond only. <br />
<br />
Think of it as Ancient Incite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sowy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you can't get this tome because you can't in the zone it is likely you don't even need it yet.  :/<br />
<br />
The only reason why I say this is because pre-god zones keeping aggro isn't really a problem with pre-god tools/items.  But in God with clerics needing to SL more often and DPS needing to burst more often, warriors will need tomes like this :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>exeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have searched this site - is there any information posted yet on questable / droppable tomes that can be found in the game (beyond what we can buy at vendors)?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One thing to note here for those of you who have BoM overwrites Incite.<br />
<br />
As in, if another warrior is using incite and you use BoM the first warrior will get a overwrite message.  Also if a warrior is using BoM and another warrior tries to take over, as in for a tank change or something, the second warrior will be unable to land incite till BoM runs its course.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal really but since only a few of our warriors have this atm it became noticable fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This a huge issue, our ma has the new bellow, major PIA transition taking.  My workaround somewhat risky get a few wacks in for anger procs in case he goes down.  Aside from the upgrade benefit, Thats my major reason for wanting the new bellow, smoother tank tansition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The direct +Hate component lands, but the +Hate over Time part doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>fatbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I did this turnin as a berserker and got a vendor buyable tome in return. After petitioning for a week or so and talking to a variety of guides and GMs unfamiliar with the quest I gave up.</div></div><hr />
