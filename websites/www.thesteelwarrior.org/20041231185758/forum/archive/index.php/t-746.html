<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Barbarian Warrior of Rallos Zek at 33 I haven't played in 6 months.  I've taken my Druid as high as I could and would like to start again with the War.  My question is I would   like to spend 2k on  1hs and 2k on 1hb.  I last used a Jagged Blade of Mourning and Shaded Staff but will not  return to that.<br />
<br />
I am currently looking at a Centi Longsword and Club of the Ice Ocean.  Anyone have any suggestions on better options?  Thank you for any response.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Club of the Ice Ocean has a required lvl of 51 so you'll have to hold off on that one for a bit.  Jade Mace would be a nice fast mainhand 1hb but is lacking in stats.  The Bed Leg Club is a cheap 1hb but the recommended lvl may gimp it down a bit.  I defer to the more knowledgable for better suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">traxxap</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you will want speed (for skill ups) and decent dps, for 1hs i'd go with the centi LS, and put that offhand, and get a jade mace for your main hand.  You will have great dps for your level, and the centi's 8 str/sta makes up for the stat-less 9/18 jade mace.  You should be able to pick up both for 2k depending on the server.  That combination should last you into the 50's easily, untill you get some nice no drop weapons or make enough money to buy better.  Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions...  A quick addition here.  How does a Defiance or Lamentation measure up against the Centi?  I still think I'll go with the Centi though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lammy will give you more skillups and faster hits, but less damage. I actually liked my wurmy more than either of them when i was your level, the high damage gave me good aggro. Don't know about DPS, probably would be better with a lammy and centi in offhand. Oh, and unless you have spare money don't get defiance, some ac is not worth that much, get some armor upgrades instead.  Cheaper to get AC from armor rather then from weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After some consideration, I'm pretty set with an aim on getting the Jade Mace for primary and Centi L for the offhand... But now I see a 1hs called Frostbringer?  Is this one even worth considering?...  I want to maintain a 1hb in one hand and a 1hs in another hand.  Thanks for the responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At your level, Centi LS &gt; Lamentation and/or Defiance.<br />
<br />
The ratio is just that good.<br />
<br />
Frostbringer is very much worth considering. It's got a great ratio and at level 35 it starts to proc.<br />
<br />
It's just not usually in the 2k range, so was out of your earlier proposed budget range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll be back with my wish list of Chest pieces in a week or so.<br />
