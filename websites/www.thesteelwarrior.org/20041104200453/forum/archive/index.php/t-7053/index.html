<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dear Lords,<br />
<br />
A very long time ago I started playing EQ as a warrior, got to lvl 50 or so and at the time Seb was so over crowded finding groups was impossible (this was pre-Luclin).  Anywho, I converted to the darkside and made a druid (which is now my main).  Long story short, I've decided to bring my rusty trusty warrior back into action.<br />
<br />
I know lots has changed with the warrior class, since I've brought &quot;Thorix&quot; back to life he has recently reached level 57.  I'm noticing now more than ever that I just cannot manage enough aggro to feel like i'm doing my job properly.   I'm seeking wisdom, i've read countless threads dating back months and months trying to find the answers i'm looking for, but as times changed, so did the answers.<br />
<br />
I have a small bag of weapons, and thanks to a solo'ing main I had a pretty hefty bank account to get him caught up to speed on most gear.  I'm looking for all sorts of advice, from gear, to weapon combos, to proper use of augs.  But I won't be so general as that, my biggest concern right now is finding how to use the weapons I have and make them work for me the best.<br />
<br />
I recently obtained a BoC, it's a loaner, but i'll have it for some time i'm sure.  Prior to getting the BoC i've been using the standard SotBS and CHoS.<br />
<br />
My theory is that the best combo to be made here is to put the SotBS in my primary with a anger2 or 3 aug and use the BoC in my offhand.  But i've read a number of posts saying the CHoS is better than the SotBS, and I can't understand why.  Lower delay, a stronger stun, and from what I can tell it seems to proc more often.<br />
<br />
Why is the CHoS favored as a primary over the SotBS?<br />
<br />
Anywho, help me out.  I'm a newb on lots of warrior stuff, I don't wanna try and talk like i'm not.<br />
<br />
What would you do?  BoC, SotBS, CHoS, all un-auged at the moment.<br />
<br />
I have some other weapons as well, just peek at the magelo below, maybe there is another option.  I've been tempted to toss a anger3 on my War Marshall's Bladed Staff to make my own mini-BoW.<br />
<br />
If you find the time, any gear ideas and suggestions would be grand as well, but that isn't my main concern.  I don't see Thorix ever being the MT on a raid (specially since i'm in a post-Quarm guild, hehe), but I would like to see him tank in the EPs one day and make all of those Paladins wish they rolled warriors.<br />
<br />
Well that's it for now, hi everyone and thx in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First: and from what I can tell it seems to proc more often It doesn't. Same proc rate. The weapons are basically interchangable as far as I've heard.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
  BoC primary, one of the others secondary. 700 hate is better than the stun hate (rated around 400 hate). Augment the BoC, it'll last you longer.<br />

<br />
Don't do that. It's not worth it at all. Never augment a weapon without an aggro proc with anger or ykesha; two procs is ALWAYS better than one.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you find the time, any gear ideas and suggestions would be grand as well <br />
<br />
1ac = 6hp = 1 sta until you're sta is capped. Resists and other stats are irrelevent unless there is no other difference in two pieces of armor. Attack and regen are nearly irrelevent. Your gear looks ok, just keep running that route. I'd suggest camping some more ornate with your druid and some friends, maybe hit up the BoT towers for a BP mold and a GBoS. For a post-Time guild, it should be cake. There is a lovely guide to the towers up in the library too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if the BoC is not yours, then you need to buy it.  own the BoC then anger3 on the BoC will be your immediate goal.   dont mess around with a 10k weapon that you are going to throw away in a month.   get the BoC then put anger3 on it.  BoC will be with you for a VERY LONG TIME so keep it nice and augged.  i'd rather put points into 40hp augs then waste an ang3 on a crap weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great advice guys, I appreciate it.   So if I go BoC (Anger3), then which out of the CHoS/SotBS would make an ideal secondary?  I saw &quot;they are interchangeable&quot; but which do you think would be better?  I'm leaning towards the SotBS because of the increase hate on the proc?   Good logic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CHoS would be better offhander...slightly better ratio and more damage from the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">mainhand the BoC .. it shoudl be the first of your weapons that you augment<br />
<br />
offhand the CHoS<br />
<br />
<br />
as per the mini-BoW ... get a greatstaff of thunder and anger3 that.  its a piece of shit compared to a BoC, but it packs huge amounts of aggro btw the anger3 and the stun proc.  if youre ever overly concerned with riposte dmg (which you shouldnt be until EP's and beyond) ... its a cheap powerful aggro alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">personally I definately would not waste points into aug'ing any of the dropable weapons aside from BoC.   BoC is your bread and butter right now and can become an off hander when you get an upgrade to BoC.  save your points and get some NRo armor or 40hp augs for your nicer armor peices.  use the aug'ed BoC as your main and leave the offhand unaug'ed till you get an upgrade to BoC.  as for your mini-BoW idea,  wait till you get a greatstaff of 4winds,  put ang3 on that bad puppy and it should come close to an unaug'ed BoC.  as i mentioned before dont waste your points in the crappy 10kpp weapons you pick up in bazaar.  they arent going to be with you long enough to make the 1150 point investment.  only go with ang3 and only put it on worthy weapons.  otherwise, put your points into armor and hp/AC augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BoC lasted me 2.5 years. Just replaced mine today with a SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Appreciate all the replys, gonna grind out the last 300 points or so for my anger3 aug on the BoC.  Gear wise, snagged some earthen rings of resistance, now to save up for a Ornate BP.<br />
<br />
Thx again!</div></div><hr />
