<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terminator24h</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I've got a couple questions which relate to various areas of the forums but I'm going to put this post here because most of the questions relate to equipment.  First off, here's my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=340202  With raid buffs my HP gets up to around 7125 and AC up to nearly 1300 which is quite sub-par it seems.  Before school started I was focusing for a week on making 65 then grinding AA's, which I did a good job of.<br />
<br />
Now that school has begun, however, I am very limited on how much I can play EQ.  I generally can only play for about 4 hours a day, right when my guild is raiding, which I guess is good.  However, I have a lot to do for my character: grind AA's to get at least 50 so I can get the essential defensive and HP abilities, camp LDoN in EF for a while to get 2x Anger3 augs, upgrade my gear with droppable stuff such as camping Ornate stuff while exping, get flagged for stuff (I have almost no flags), and raid...  all things that will benefit me in many ways and all things that I must eventually complete.<br />
<br />
I am asking for help in the order in which to do these things.  Should I grind AA's before I get anger 3 augs?  Vice versa?  What about raiding? Should I forego raiding at this point and instead grind a couple AA's a night?<br />
<br />
What about gear?  I'm currently saving up my DKP to buy a Hategiver, BoC, or Bloodfrenzy if they drop.  My guild is REALLY big into Korocust, Innoruk, and Ssra mobs except emp.  We do these mobs whenever they pop and we have little competition.  However, it's very rare that I will get a hate weapon drop and I'm concerned that I'll be saving for a very long time.  There are quite a few decent haste items that drop off these mobs - Bone-Forged Trinket and Dreadscale Cloak come to mind.  If I were to spend my DKP on a haste item, I could sell my belt and upgrade other slots.  Should I save for a hate weapon first or should I go ahead and just go for upgrades to my armor?<br />
<br />
Basically all this comes down to allocating my limited time to things that will be more useful to me and I'd like some input before I throw myself into doing one thing or another.<br />
<br />
-Thanks</div></div><hr />

Unless you can complete them fast and get a group going very fast, you might end up getting 2 done in 4 hours, and have less than an AA to show for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would leave the flagging to guild raids. Don't pass up a freebie, but I wouldn't sweat it till guild is raiding PoP flagging mobs. (not sure if you guys getting Emp keys and doing VT but if you are then add that to your to-do list)<br />
<br />
I would combine your AA work with your LDoN whenever possible like Payn said above, and not sure what you guild policies are but would not skip raids if I were logged on.<br />
<br />
Even though some of the haste items seem tempting I would hold off on burning your DKP on one (I use tribute myself, you could sell belt and do that). <br />
<br />
As far as  weap-vs-armor I would say take whatever comes first. Some weaps you don't see that often, and to pass on one you have a shot at might mean you never get one (I'm thinking BF/Hategiver...BoC is pretty common once you start doing AoW).  Add BoT tower bosses to your guilds targets, and add GBoS to your agro weap list.  Try and spend DKP on things that will last you a long time, and/or things you can get at a bargain.<br />
<br />
Buyable upgrades obviously depend on your cash situation. Skip ornate unless you win it yourself. You can't re-sell it if you upgrade via raiding or LDoN.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thats my 2cp. Good hunting to you.</div></div><hr />
