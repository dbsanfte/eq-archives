Ok, that wasn't so bad.  I probably spelt a lot of it wrong but MS Word didn't recognize more than two words on the list, but it's all good.  So yeah, your input would be greatly appreciated, if you want to help me get some mob information, that would also be great.<br />
<br />
One last thing that would be nice if you could critique.  I was getting some PoTime info from the TSW channel last night/this morning, and I want to know if you guys agree that this is accurate information, this would also be a great help to me if you could take the time to read this.  Just as a FYI, I'm not time flagged as of right now, my guild is stuck working on Xegony, but it's a lot of fun.<br />

<br />
<br />
The Plane of Time:<br />
<br />
Phase 1:	1 hour to complete.<br />
In order to successfully complete phase one, you need to split your raid up into 5 sections, each simultaneously doing a ‘trial’ on their own. All trials must be completed within one hour in order to advance to phase two.<br />
<br />
The mini-bosses for each ‘trial’ are as follows:<br />
·	Kazrok of Fire<br />
·	Anar of Water<br />
·	Terlok of Earth<br />
·	Neimon of Air<br />
·	Rythor of the Undead<br />
<br />
The trials may be completed in any order.<br />
TIP: This will involve a ton of strategy and cooperation, in order to win everyone must be paying attention, and doing their job efficiently.  If you are unable to complete phase one, you have to wait 12 hours for the named mobs to spawn again.<br />
<br />
Phase 2:	1 hour to complete.<br />
Phase two is similar to phase one in terms of it has the same ‘trials’ theme.  But this time there is only three trials to do.  The group of 18 in phase one who participated in killing Rythor of the Undead, are automatically teleported into phase two, and they must successfully kill Ralthos Enrok.  The two other trials have twice as many people, but also must go up against twice as many bosses. It is a good idea to put your strongest players in the group who kills Rythor and Ralthos, although balance is key.<br />
<br />
	Each of the large groups will face a ‘trail’ with two bosses and lots of tash.  So if each large group faces off against two mobs… that’s… 4 excluding the smaller group.  Those four mobs are:<br />
·	Earthen Overseer<br />
·	Gutripping Warbeast<br />
·	Windshaped Warlord<br />
·	Ferocious Warboar<br />
<br />
 All three trials must be finished in an hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 3:	1 hour, 15 minutes to complete.<br />
I have been told that this is pure chaos.  The good thing is, your whole raid is back together, so you have 72.  In phase three you arrive in a very large room.  Waves of mobs spawn, all of them are themed to a deity.  There are 8 waves in all, each wave having around 15 mobs that hit for about 1000.  In each wave there are also 2 to 3 mini-bosses.  These mini-bosses hit for over 1400, but also have the possibility to drop some nice loot.  In total, there will be anywhere between 15 and 20 potential loot droppers.  When you are on the 8th wave, get ready.  Once the final enemy falls, two difficult boss mobs spawn. <br />
<br />
<br />
 A smart way to avoid getting demolished by these guys is to pull the final mob or two as far away from the frontal area as possible, because that is where the bosses will pop.  If you do this successfully, you can resurrect your dead, re-buff, heal, med, etc.  Once your raid is ready, prepare to face:<br />
<br />
·	Avatar of the Elements<br />
·	Supernatural Guardian<br />
<br />
After you split these guys, it shouldn’t be too hard take them down.  Finish them off and head through the portal to start Phase 4.<br />
<br />
Phase 4:	4 hours to complete<br />
Ok, we are done messing around, time to start killing the gods.  Phase 4 is home to Terris Thule, Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek and Saryrn.<br />
You are allowed to kill the gods in any order you would like, but I would recommend that you try the hardest god first, and work your way down the line.  This way you can get the hard stuff out of the way, have less tension and pressure, and if you do mess up towards the end of your time, you can still recover because the mob isn’t as difficult.<br />
I have been told that some gods are on an invisible ‘leash’.  This pisses off a lot of people because you cant position it to your liking, but it can also save your raid if someone accidentally gets agro.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule:<br />
She spawns some of her friends to help her at about every 20% of life that she loses.  She spawns about 10 mobs per wave.  So if you do the math, she’ll spawn 40 of her friends (80%, 60%, 40%, 20%) throughout her whole fight.  There is a slight chance that she could spawn some adds when she gets to 99% but I’m almost positive she doesn’t.  Doesn’t this sound a little to easy?  Yeah it is.  About half of the adds that are spawned will be unmezzable, so you need to get a lot of tanks and healers to work that out.  It gets worse.  The adds hit for 1000-1500.<br />
<br />
The best and most basic strategy you could use on this goth chick is to treat this fight like a (non-PoTime) Saryrn fight.  Whenever adds spawn, everyone gets off TT, and kill only the unmezzables.  Once only the mezzed adds remain, you can start killing her again.  One good thing to add is that there are separate names and models for which mobs can and cannot be mezzed, so it isn’t that difficult to tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok thats it I promise, thanks again guys =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm just off the top of my head, you could add Tagrin in Tactics, and in Torment you don't have any of the mobs needed for Saryn key listed and that's indirecetly part of planar progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of the top of my head... Have you ever actually done Time before? Theres no teleporting between phases until 4, you don't split up into 5 raid parts, you only split up into three, and two groups will be doing two trials.<br />
<br />
Do the math real fast. 18 people * 5 trials = Way more than the 72 limit!<br />
<br />
Also, you won't have 36 on both sides of phase2 and 18 in undead.. More like 27 on both sides and 18 in undead if your raid is full, then when undead is finished, 36 in both sides.<br />
<br />
On phase3. There are 8 waves in about this order:<br />
<br />
Zek<br />
Bertox<br />
Cazic<br />
Zek<br />
Zek<br />
Innoruuk<br />
Terris<br />
Saryrn<br />
<br />
Each wave contains exactly 10 non-bosses, hitting for around 1200, and 2 bosses, hitting for around 1400. There are exactly 16 of them.<br />
<br />
Avatar of Elements hits for 1400, snares your tank.<br />
Supernatural Guardian hits for 2200.<br />
<br />
As for gods.. I've never met anyone who would want to do phase4 without a leash. It doesn't piss people off, its a good thing. Theres plenty of good positions in each room.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah. On Terris, 10 adds every 20%? No sir. 4 adds at 90, 50, and 10%. Exactly half of them mez, yes. They hit for around 900 and are not a serious problem if you dont let them stack up. The only thing that makes her at all hard is her manadrain, which will not be resisted probably half the time, even at 500 MR.<br />
<br />
As a result of this, I hardly think your suggestion of doing the hardest first is valid. Vallon Zek is commonly thought of the hardest. To anyone, ANYONE who actually has done this, they would know this idea is somewhere between ridiculous and idiotic. At 50%, he spawns two splits at random spots in the Zek room. And of course, this will agro Tallon Zek, and your raid is a smoosh on the floor.<br />
<br />
Further, you need the experience of Saryrn to kill Terris usually, and you need the experience of killing both of those to work on the Zeks. Further, you probably will need the experience of Tallon to fight Vallon. So really.. Maybe you should not put out any elemental / Time info until you've actually zoned into either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To clear things up, yes I raid elementals every day.  I agree with Fulorian on me not having much of an experience with the eles, and no experience with Time.  I'm writing this merely because I want to help some people out, and make an attempt at creating something for my guildmates/friends and I to learn from and enjoy.  I appreciate all the feedback that I've recieved so far, and it would be great if you guys could help me out with some of the other patches I'm missing... I'll make sure to give credit where it is due.</div></div><hr />

You can always go again as soon as your instance 'ends'... The clock that times how much longer you have left. While phase1 bosses do not respawn for 12 hours, YOU CAN do the trials. The only difference is you will be fighting:<br />
<br />
Shadow of Terlok<br />
Shadow of Anar<br />
Shadow of Rythor<br />
Shadow of Kazrok<br />
Shadow of Neimon<br />
<br />
They are exactly the same, except you won't get loot. You don't get an effective 12 hour lockout to the zone if you fail it, you simply can't keep farming loot.</div></div><hr />

If someone could do me a HUGE favor and try to list the named mobs in Fennin Script, or listing the named adds on Xegony script that would help out a ton.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also: Triggers would be a great help, I'm often just a part of the raid mob and not really paying attention to what mob triggers what.  If you could list any triggers from any plane, it would be helpful</div></div><hr />
