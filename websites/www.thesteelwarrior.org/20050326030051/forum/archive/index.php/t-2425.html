<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnarian</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question, I am going to try and word this as good as I can so people don't get confused.  I did my flagging out of order, I did Behemoth, then AD, then HoHb trials, but I never did the PoJ trials.  So when we killed AD and ran through the tunnel below his lair when I tried to zone into HoH it kicked me back out to PoT with an insufficient message because I hadn't done the trials in PoJ yet.  Well, I completed the trials yesterday finally and I got my AA for that but my AD flag still doesn't show up at all.  I was thinking now that the trials are done I could go back into AD's lair and run down the tunnel again and see if it would zone me into HoH, but from what I heard that PP flag from AD is a temp flag and won't be there anymore?  I also checked with the seer in PoK and my trials, tactics, HoHb flags show up but not my AD kill.  Can anyone tell me if that AD flag was a temp one and whether or not running back down the tunnel now to zone into HoH will complete the flag finally, or do I have to kill AD again and reflag?</div></div><hr />

You still might have to run the tunnel and zone in from PoV the first time, but I am not sure since I didn't have to do it.</div></div><hr />

If you didnt get it from just zoning into HoH from the rock in PoT, you might have to redo :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnarian</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Wandor, your answer solved my problem.  Went and told her to unlock memories, got my flag, zoned into and back out of HoH to get my aa/charm.  I didn't have to run down the tunnel for it to work either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jziad MT</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not all flags show on your /key feature.<br />
<br />
Lower CoD does for instance but many sucjh as PoJ trials do not.<br />
<br />
To find out what flags you have, go to see the seer she is in PoK in one of the buildings near the soulbinder.<br />
<br />
Hail her (she isthe one sat on the floor) and you can then either ask for guided meditation or have your memories unlocked. Unlock memories is for if you have done flags out of story/plot sequence.<br />
<br />
Meditation will give you a list of statements highlighting what parts of the plot hence what flags you have. (some flags wont apear here, so then check /key)<br />
<br />
Note; the information seems to appear at least for me as a /tell. So if you have tells filtered, your flag info from meditation appears there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok now thats gay cause i tried that and it didn't work for me. You have to make sure that you have done any preflags that might be required before unlocking memories will work for you. In some cases, you will have to go back and forth getting preflags and unlocking memories until it finally works correctly. In some cases, you might have to have all lower flags before a higher level one will work. Multi part flags are notoriously a pain in the ass to get worked out as there are usually several preflags and several prerequisite flags you need to have before they work.<br />
<br />
And like Tinmari said, the bitch won't talk to you if you are not sitting down.</div></div><hr />
