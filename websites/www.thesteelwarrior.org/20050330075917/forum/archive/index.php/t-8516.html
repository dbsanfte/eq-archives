Kaesora is better than guk, because it has an XP bonus, and LGuk is zero still I believe.<br />
<br />
Check out the new hotzones.  Go there at those levels and go to town.</div></div><hr />

You will have to go down to Xalgoz to find mobs that are blue at 45.  In this sense, LGuk is better for Blayn's purposes: at least half of LGuk is higher level than Kaesora, and it's easy to reach those parts (i.e. just jump off the undead bridge).<br />
<br />
I have to think that City of Mist would be better than Kaesora for this level range.  City of Mist is another XP hotspot since last patch.  The mobs start around level 38 or so (which is at the very upper end of Kaesora's mobs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, you're probably right, now that I think about it, Xalgoz was like the lowest end of dark blue when I was camping the staff ot the dreaded gaze with my necro at 52 or something like that.<br />
<br />
Guk still is a shitty place to PL these days with faction farmers still rampant, at least on CT.  Plus once you get over about 35, it starts slowing down as the supply of Dar's and Zol's is much lower than the Wan supply was.<br />
<br />
But ya, CoM..go with that.  Or whatever the 40-45 hotspot is.  Guk is a great last resort, but I would try to find someplace more out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">City of mist rules for xp until 50 or so.  It is always empty too and with the druid you can kill a lot of named for some semi decent loots too.  Also you can bind right in City of Mist in case you accidentally die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendler</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the CoM suggestion!  I'm now lvl 44 and looking for a new area.  The exp really slowed down for me in there so I'm going to try some where else now.  Any suggestions??<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the advice it really helped!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out dulak's harbor or other loy zones, decent xp and chance of nice loot,<br />
with the new pok book to gulf of gunthak getting there is a bit easier, you still have to pass trough that long tunnel but i believe druids have fixed duration invis so should not be to bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dulak's harbor is a good idea, head to the eastern side of the zone for higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
Howling Stones would be a really damn good powerlevelling place at 44, the mobs are so weak for their level there, and they start right around level 42-44.  But you'll need to make two keys (trivial really, just takes a bit of time).<br />
<br />
The &quot;hotspot&quot; listed for 45-50 is Nurga.  However, you'll have to invis pretty deep to find the mobs that are good XP at this range.  Nurga has 4 tiers of difficulty, and the front 3 tiers are probably too low level for you now.<br />
<br />
The &quot;hotspot&quot; listed for 50-55 is Grieg's End.  You could try that now or real soon, I'd think.  Huge advantage there in that nothing runs, nothing sees invis, I don't think there are any traps anymore, and small aggro/assist ranges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendler</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again all!  Sassinak, I will certainly try Griegs End and see how I do.  I like that option first.  Thanks for all the help you guys have given me, it is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Griegs End is probably the best place to go. From what i remember the mobs there only hit for like 150ish max. Besides being a bit of a run to get there it would be great exp for PLing.</div></div><hr />

 No need to run port to DSP with druid and you are one zone away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to Grieg's end man. I recently PLed a toon in there and the XP is smokin. <br />
<br />
Just grab a DS from the druid and a Temp / Aego from the cleric and rake it in bro. Then head to PoJ or PoI (Depending on your gear) and you should be all set in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteniteslayer</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to disagree with going to Griegs. Went there yesterday with my 65 driud and 40 Warrior for some Pling and was sent running by 2 mobs. They were DB to the druid. Mind you tho I  may have just had a bad try of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whtiteniteslayer, at 40, Grieg's is suicide.  A druid should be harmonying those mobs to get singles, but even singles will be tough when the mobs are 12 levels higher than your warrior.  That's needless risk, and since XP is capped, it's pointless.  You want low reds or yellows, not 10-level-deep reds.  Mendler's warrior was higher level than yours, though, and Grieg's would be low reds to him, which is why people suggested it to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">grieg's as way too many HP's for my tastes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll agree with that. :)  Howling Stones is the ideal place if you want weak, low hit point mobs in their 40's and low 50's, combined with a good zone XP multiplier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendler</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the update.   I went to CoM and wiped the zone out  from lvl 39 to 46.  At lvl 43 i grouped with Druid and Ae'd everything while I beat on named or harder mobs with warrior.  This was not easy btw.  I lvled very quickly but at lvl 45 it slowed considerably so I went and tried Grieg's.  I got 3 mobs at once and almost killed us both because I lagged out while pulling.  They do hit harder and many more hps.   I'm going to try HS so I'll keep you updated on that prospect.  <br />
<br />
I have to say that these boards make we want to convert my main to a warrior because I hate reading the boards for Necro's.  They're a bunch of little whiney kids, for the most part.  Everyone that posts here gives each other respect even if they don't see eye to eye.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for having so much class all!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first wing of HS will be only a little better than CoM.  Take the time to build a master key, and then focus your attention on the south wing, and east wing if you need more mobs.  The mobs are perhaps 10 levels higher in those wings, and will take you easily through the long dark tunnel of 51-60.  By the time deeper HS slows down, you'll be at or near level 60, over the hump and ready for better places.</div></div><hr />
