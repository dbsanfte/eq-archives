<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious what you guys feel about which is better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">15 atk &gt; 10 atk... and the regen isn't really worth it IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Magon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also agree 15attack&gt;10 and regen is not that important at 65.  At least AoB regen is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Veng &gt; AoB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree on the V3.  And what's with making AoB a 1100 something cost?  It ain't that great...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">5 ATK vs 2hp regen?<br />
<br />
I don't see the reason why 5 ATK is better..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">because when killing mobs that hit for 500+ 2 points every 6 seconds isnt gonna save ya.  Thats why we dont need to worry.<br />
<br />
Necros and Shammys are truely the only classes that benefit from the regen in AoB, because it helps with their mana regen.  And monks i guess, who like to solo, but thats a dying trend.<br />
<br />
2 points per tick regen means exactly dick to a tank whos fighting high end.  Even in normal EXP groups, the 20HP you regen durring the course of taking 4k+  melee damage isnt gonna matter.  <br />
<br />
Attack however, increases your DPS ... which does matter.  As more DPS helps build more aggro.  <br />
<br />
I'd take the DPS over 20hp a minute, which means absolutely dick to me when ive got a cleric landing full value CHs on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can just as easily turn it around and say that 5atk means exactly dick when a mob has 20khp too.<br />
<br />
i've been using my goblin earring for years now..and to be quite honest, if I was just looking at my damage, I couldn't tell you when it wore off, and that's 13 atk as opposed to 5.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can definitely make the argument &quot;Well it adds up,&quot; but you can also make that argument about regen too.  With the advent of more XP zones with mobs that have a much more reasonable max hit, regen once again helps quite a bit.  It's a far bigger deal on a goblin that hits you for 100 or so than it is on something that is smacking the crap out of you for 900.<br />
<br />
The answer is &quot;Personal preference,&quot; unless you're going to be putting the effects on a mass amount of gear, in which case 5atk times 10 slots or so is going to end up being a pretty nice chunk of attack.  Of course 20 regen is too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Which, of course, begs the question about what to do when you toss Regen V (5 hp tick) into the mix.<br />
<br />
Anyone seen anything higher than 5? Listed up to 10 on lucy</div></div><hr />

thats if you want to go full defence.<br />
<br />
if you only got one item with a type 3 slot then get whatever you get the points for. no point locking youself in one theme for 5 attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, AoB gives 13 worn attack, not 10. Observe:<br />
http://members.cox.net/mondo/aob.jpg<br />
<br />
So it's really a matter of 2 attack (veng 3 being 15 attack) or 2 regen. Which would you rather have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gerald, Veng3 will also give 19 or 20 instead of simply 15 too.  The raw atk is multiplied by 1.3 for most classes.  Comparing the raw number is a lot easier though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I noticed there is a regen V for chest only and for 560 points, I believe. In this case it sounds like I would rather go with the regen than spending twice as much on AoB or Vengence3. I could see the case for another 40hp aug for slot 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ah. I honestly didn't realize it was multiplied :p. I don't have any vengeance items, so I don't have experience with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">From what I've read O believe there is also a 36pct haste slot 3...for the poorer warrs out there you could move your haste to a slot 3 item and sell your CoF etc netting a nice amount of PP for your points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've heard that the Luclin mods, like 8% dodge don't stack.  Is this true? Or do 2x 8% dodge items = 16% dodge?  Anyone got a parse proving this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i dunno splaktar it was jus something that popped into my head. would be nice if it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Look at it this way.  <br />
<br />
ATK=I hit the Mob more which is even MORE important on a 20kHP mob (the benefit is only really noticable over a long term).  You would be surprised at how much difference 5 ATK can make.<br />
<br />
2HP regen=worthless.  I'm getting a CH every 7 or 8 seconds anyway, 8 or 10 points of health will not save me.<br />
<br />
Lets say your tanking.  At 30% health your cleric starts to cast CH.  At the same time, a druid casts Chloroblast on you.  The chloroblast lands first and heals you 5%.  At 20% the CH lands and you are fully healed.  Now explain to me what exactly the Chloroblast accomplished?  Nothing.  If it handn't landed the CH still would have fully healed the Tank.  Regen is the same.  It might be semi useful for healing a little AE damage, but it would take alot more than 2HP/tick to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the truth is neither 5 attack or 2 regen is worth stressing over</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo.  Get whichever one sells in a camp you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ATK &gt;&gt;&gt; Regen<br />
<br />
1) When Main Tanking regen is totally utterly useless.<br />
ATK gives you more dps, so more agro   ATK <br />
<br />
2) When not Main Tanking you are here to provide dps.<br />
While regen helps lessen the need for heals.<br />
It does not enhance your dps.   ATK <br />
<br />
3) When XP Tanking .... You are here to provied DPS &amp; Tanking.<br />
Both ATK &amp; Regen will help you in those roles.<br />
But in XP tanking agro is often an issue regen wont help agro<br />
while atk (by dps incease will)   TIE with advantage for ATK <br />
<br />
4) XP dps .. you are here to provide DPS since someone<br />
else does the tanking ATK<br />
<br />
5) Faction/Soloing  .... Killing the mobs faster is a bonus.<br />
But beeing able to solo for long periods is the must <br />
 TIE with advantage for REGEN <br />
<br />
Look at it any way you want. ATK is clearly superior to regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">ATK=I hit the Mob more <br />
<br />
Nope, ATK = you hit the mob FOR more on average.<br />
<br />
ATK affects your distribution of hits from min to max and has 0 bearing on your hit/miss ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ATK=I hit the Mob more which is even MORE important on a 20kHP mob (the benefit is only really noticable over a long term). You would be surprised at how much difference 5 ATK can make.<br />
<br />
As sarelin pointed out.<br />
<br />
ATK effects (buffs+Vengeance) , help you hit HARDER not more often.</div></div><hr />
