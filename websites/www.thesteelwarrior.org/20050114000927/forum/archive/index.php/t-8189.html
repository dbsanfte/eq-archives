I just bought a boc for my lvl 37 war, ill be leveling him up soon and he will be able to proc it shortly. In the process of buying it i had to sell some of my fierce heraldic, and basically im wondering, what type of cheaper upgrades are there now than getting another set of fierce heraldic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sell the BoC; buy some FH armour again, go buy a CHoS and a SotB....you'll be set and have more than sufficent aggro even without them proccing until the requred level .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apotwo</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe i just bought it, actually ill probably keep it forever, dotn see a reason to sell.<br />
<br />
ps:i hate the chos/sotb combo, ill use probably the sword with the boc, but i cant stand the 2 items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but i don't agree with the sotb/chos combo being more agro than his current combo at his lvl because there reccomended and will only be like 7 or 6 dmg each for him atm</div></div><hr />

Course, what good is aggro, when you have about the same defensive capabilities as a paper bag... but, that being said, heres the advice I'd give to you...<br />
<br />
<br />
Take whatever force you can and get yourself a few nice long days in ToV: HoT.<br />
<br />
If you get people who just want to help you w/o any need for ToV gear, sell the MQ's of the other stuff for some bigger upgrades (Crystalized Acid Bracers ect)<br />
<br />
Take all the plate and put it on your little war once he gets of level.  its seriously the easiest way, since it only takes 1 grp to do HoT now-a-days... if that.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some bored bard one day will prove me wrong by soloing doze  :p</div></div><hr />

PP is not hard to make and FH armor is not very expensive.  You're 37 ffs ... you dont even need armor yet.   While i agree that your money is better spent elsewhere, i know that BoC's arent too common in the /baz on my server.<br />
<br />
go fill the weak spots with crusty and spider fur shit for now ... get a decent haste item asap and enjoy your toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell the Black plated collar ffs ... should fetch 100k or so depending on your server .. then use that to buy a CoF and as much FH armor as you can starting with the BP.  There are several decent very cheap neck items out of LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apotwo</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im thinking of going tribute for haste, my main gets ALOT of ldon items from doing adv's and i have enough tribute on him atm. Yeah im going to be farmign for the next week or two and my friend is a gm smith who will cover my FH needs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssuruss</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I'm an Iksar I didn't have the advantage of FH armor and had to look for other items. For a BP look at an Architect Bejewlers BP, think that's the right name, LDoN drop if your main can get it, but shouldn't be more then 5K if you have to buy one. For haste, just go camp SCHW, they'll work for now and while you are there you might get a SCWB to replace that champion's bracer. Sell that Hiero cloak and grab a crimson werewolf cape or whatever it's called, 12ac 80hp or something like that, and use the exta plat to improve your earrings. <br />
<br />
Look at crusty armor if you have to short term, but don't get rid of the BoC. For a nice agro and cheapisf offhand there is a cultural yak, RZ only, that is good agro can't remember the name offhand but it has 10ac on it which is nice, no HP but very solid agro with a BoC. Should be cheaper then a CHoS.</div></div><hr />

It will help keep you alive longer as you run away from the mob at 1% HP...</div></div><hr />

um, was that supposed to be funny?</div></div><hr />

I don't think Sven reads all the posts when he comments tho heh. :)<br />
<br />
PS Don't get me wrong Ap.This is a good place to come for questions and twinking's fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svan</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no i read them. i just thought it was dumb to make fun of someone who really didnt know. you dont need to know anything about what a warrior should be wearing in order to buy a boc and slap it on a twink. damn near everyone knows that boc is great aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apotwo</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i know alot about warriors, i played one to 52 way back pre velious, but im outdated. I mean i COULD go and grab a bunch of crusty and go around with terrible gear on, but what i meant was, are there any quests or not rec items i can use my shm to farm for my warrior? Last night i got him a sotb from droga. The main reason i got him a boc, is because its just a badass item, 100hp 15/20 and EB proc, what more could you want from a non rec 1hs war wep?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just bustin on ya because IMHO selling off gear to buy a weapon leaves some rather big holes to fill.<br />
<br />
overall; worse case go hit up kael for some thurg armor to hold ya over. or hit up some LDoN's and rack up points.<br />
<br />
but i'm just funny like that; to me buying a BoC and losing armour doesn't help much...sure you got a king aggro weapon but in one hit or so you're a melted cheese puff because you're half naked....unless you like naked tanking in a sadomasochistic way :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well not sure how your shammy is set up.Champ stuff is pretty kick ass for your level imo hehe.You could farm fh components if you find a good smith.I had a guildy do my combines ,worked well for me.You can take a group with some good dps or charm to wack the shade in pon he dropped 35 ac 65 hp shoulders and a neat cloak I think.If you're shard farming in me one of the named close to the 3 spawn straight out from dsp zi near the wall dropped  20 ac faces we slapped on our twinks.Velious dragons otw to tov drop good twink gear,although you might be looking for better stuff.I woulda been overjoyed to get champ stuff pre 50's though hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssuruss</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember correct it's 35 to be able to quest Champ's, have MQed several pieces for friends alts in the mid-40 range.</div></div><hr />

The usable effects on the items is a different story.  I think its either 35 or 45 before those work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apotwo</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the effects on armor works when you get them, i have a lvl 4 wiz with thurg robe, 20some sec cast time on the 400 nuke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not always the case.Not all effects are usuable at the level you can equip the gear.ie cobalt or 100hp heals on bp's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apotwo</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i know that, im saying thurg armor...</div></div><hr />
