I know loyalist shield would be an upgrade, but anything else that doesnt involve a huge amount of people? http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1084210</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear is pretty solid, i assume you are using tribute haste cause you have no haste item equipped.<br />
<br />
Upgrades from bazaar:<br />
- get a Neck item<br />
- get a bow with some stats (HP/AC)<br />
- Helmet of Rallos Zek if you have the money (seems you have it, about 140k on my Server)<br />
- Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates (about 30k on my server)<br />
<br />
I would take a second weapon too, but thats your personal preferance :)<br />
Otherwise, i wouldnt bother about gear for the next 10 levels. Your equipment is superb. Maybe get some ornate when you hit 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there is some gear the VT group could get for you.  Droppable items in LDoN hard missions come right to mind, the gloves and boots.  It is also possible you could get the Boots of Storm.  Once you leveled to 60 you could actually do the missions and get the earring, cloak, rings, neck, etc...tho maybe you can do them earlier.  <br />
<br />
If the group was really solid, maybe they could drag you along if they did Vxed or Tipt and get you the earring and bracer, tho Im not sure if there is a level restriction.  <br />
<br />
Other items that come to mind is the neck from Veksar, the neck from any dragon in WW, the Flawless Steel mask in Sirens Grotto, the chain mask from CT (I forget the name) , Heavy Rubicite Girdle from CT...etc...<br />
<br />
Lots of choices if you dont mind gear from the Velious Era.<br />
<br />
One other thing, I hope the Shield is in your magelo just for eye candy.  You wont hold agro very well with it if you are in an exp group.  To solve that problem you could get the Copper Hammer of Striking or Sword of the Bloodsworn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apotwo</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the quick replies! Aye i do own a CHoS, but i won the shield last night and put it up there for the hp gain. Ill probably end up using it on ldon bosses ect, but yeah sticking to the chosd 90% of the time. As for the vxed/tipt gear, the stuff rots all the time on my server so probably i can sneak in and grab it when its rotting, was thinking of doing the hard missions to get me some gear from there, that is probably my next step, thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since when can you zone into Vxed/Tipt at level 51?<br />
<br />
Vxed loot is required level 60, and Tipt loot is required level 63-65.<br />
<br />
LDON hard loot is recommended level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apotwo</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">even rec lvl 65 on the warlords steel gaunts at 51 are better than helanic tundra. And afaik you can zone in at any level to tipt/vxed or by the time you can wear the gear at least ( 60 ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of the hard LDON items listed in the hard LDON loot thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8113&amp;highlight=hard+ldon), two-thirds are no-drop.  For the kind of loot you are looking for, I recommend that you focus on gaining 10 levels or so. :)</div></div><hr />
