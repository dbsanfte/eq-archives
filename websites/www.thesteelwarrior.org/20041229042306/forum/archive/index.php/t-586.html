<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jecht</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow am I glad I found this site.  I looked for a good warrior site forever and was starting to think one didn't exist.  At last.<br />
<br />
Okay.  Here is my problem.  My weapons suck.  <br />
<br />
Weapon Choices:<br />
<br />
Club of the Ice Ocean<br />
Black Blade of Tormenting<br />
Wurmslayer<br />
Barnacle Covered Axe<br />
Bed Leg Club<br />
Venemous axe of the velium brood<br />
<br />
I am the MT for my guild so I need better weapons.  Both DPS and AGGRO.  And yes, I still use the Wurmslayer.  That thing has got to go!  I just got the barnacle covered axe and haven't even used it, I was thinking of trying out the following combo for now:<br />
<br />
DPS:<br />
Barnacle Axe / BLClub<br />
Barnacle Axe / WurmSlayer<br />
<br />
AGGRO:<br />
Barnacle Axe / Veno Axe<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 55 so I know I should have much better weapons.  What should I look at for upgrades?  I was thinking:<br />
<br />
DPS:<br />
FrostBringer / Defender's Lightblade<br />
<br />
AGGRO:<br />
FrostBringer / Barnacle Axe<br />
<br />
How does this sound?  And I probably only have money for 1 weapon so which should I buy first, the  Fbringer or the Lightblade?<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be appreciated.  Thx!</div></div><hr />

It is good DPS and very good aggro.  The new smithed Ykeshas are supposed to be good for aggro as well, just never seen one for sale on Tunare server though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defender's Lightblades are so common now on Innoruuk they've dropped down to 500pp or less at peak Bazaar times. Watched 3 rot in HoH last night too.<br />
<br />
Sure that would be your quickest and cheapest route to an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balthizar</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly i would use barnacle in main and use the frosty in the offhand will generate nice aggro especially when hasted. That would be my pick for the selection you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sell all your crap besides a BCA and buy either a) frostbringer. if possible sell your BCA and buy a sarnak warhammer<br />
warhammer/frostbringer will be a good combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the folks on this board advised me well.  I saved and got lucky.  For a week now I've been wieldin a frostbringer in my main and snowchipper in my off.  I owe the advice to the folks on this board.  Thank you all very much.<br />
<br />
I find with this combo I have no trouble maintaining agro, at all.  A friend of mine plays a 55 monk and was all gloating over how he can hold the aggro (I'm level 51).  Then I got my new weapons.  He can't gloat no more :)</div></div><hr />
