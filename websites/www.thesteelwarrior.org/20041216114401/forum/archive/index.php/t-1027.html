<br />
Anyone have any info on Rolandal (a dragon in WL).  I have a Druid friend that needs to do some turn-ins to Rolandal to complete a quest and we have yet to be able to find him.  Ala does not have any info in terms of loc or spawn time.<br />
<br />
I doubt he is killed much since he does not seem to drop anything, except maybe for faction.  Of course when I do find him ill probably wanna kill him just for pissing me off. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

If you are coming out from kael you would keep your right shoulder to the wall and follow it till you saw the dragon, and reverse (left shoulder) from skyshrine.<br />
<br />
As for not being up, there is only one time since the dragon was added that I have ran by without seeing him up.  That was when the resident uber guild wanted to kill him to check for drops, once it was established it dropped nothing I have seen it there everytime.<br />
<br />
One more possible reason it wouldn't be up when you ran by, I remember awhile back an enchanter using Rol to &quot;solo&quot; Wuoshi using charm fighting.  Didn't follow the thread through to see if it was nerfed or not but it is possible if it was not nerfed that a charmer is playing around and killing off Rolandal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you've ever run from Kael to SS or vice versa tho I'm not sure how you could miss him.  He's right in the way that most people go thru that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool and thanks,<br />
<br />
I had a feeling that maybe he despawned after the turn ins.  My guess is we just happen to try to find him when he had not respawned yet.  Also my server had recently suffered 2 rollbacks that day which might have screwed up respawns.<br />
<br />
Anyhow hopefully this isnt a quest that people do all the time :(</div></div><hr />
