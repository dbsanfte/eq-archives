I am going to predict LSU vs. Oklahoma for the championship and since I live close to Baton Rouge I will say LSU wins it all:) (it's been a long time since I could even possibly say that so spare me the hate:))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tennessee moves on to Cotton Bowl after trouncing LSU.<br />
<br />
OU goes to Sugar Bowl (Air Force could beat this schedule! (http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teamsched?teamId=201&amp;year=2003)) to play OSU (real weak schedule against overranked teams).<br />
<br />
OSU comes out on top again more than likely.</div></div><hr />

Almost right, but FSU wins big.  :D</div></div><hr />

VaTech wins<br />
<br />
&lt;this reply is a stab at Raaj since Arkansas beat Texas and well i like to think that my home team Texas A&amp;M gave VaTech one hell of a game in Blacksburg, although i was disgusted with our play against TexTech last weekend&gt;<br />
<br />
oh and also i picked these two teams b/c i think they are a little underated and would be better imo than seeing the perrenial OU FSU Ohio St etc go to the big game...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, I don't see my beloved Buckeyes being able to contain the OU offense for long.<br />
<br />
Close one at halftime, OU comes out fired up 2nd half to win.</div></div><hr />

As an FSU fan, I hope they beat Miami this year...:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
the WR they knocked out(literally) was 6'5&quot;<br />
his back up was 5'10&quot;   <br />
<br />
<br />
the last pass of the game was missed by finger tips.........</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
on a side note i'm a student at LSU and am all about seeing a jan. preformance in the sugar bowl, but its MUCH less feasable now. yes, i think there is still a chance of LSU getting in there since a TON of undefeated teams lost this weekend, but to be honest, OU scares the hell outta me. Tigers are pretty much gone :(<br />
<br />
i'm looking for OU-MIami for the big one this year... GO 'CANES!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My wife (who's from Norman) drug me into being a Sooners fan when the sucked. No, not sucked. S U C K E D!  I watched them rebuild themselves from a team that had been in a LOT of trouble, no tv, no bowls, etc.<br />
<br />
It's been pretty cool being an OU fan, starting when they really sucked, and watching them climb to the top.<br />
<br />
Honestly,  if I never see one of the Florida teams up near the top again, that would be fine by me.</div></div><hr />

Although I'm a big FSU fan, I have to admit I almost wanted to lose to Miami so we didn't wind up playing OU for the championship...OU looks like a pro team this year...  (oh yeah, and as an FSU fan it really hurts to talk about OU :p )<br />
<br />
As to the 'why all the hate for OU?'...you've got a gator coach that's beaten FSU twice in national championship games...<br />

Yeah, I went through the same thing with FSU when Bowden came here in 76.  It was a blast reading the headlines in the local paper...&quot;FSU gets highest ranking ever at 13!&quot;  :D   I really miss the startup years sometimes.  Back then every single game was exciting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, what do I know?  I'm a Kentucky fan and all I know is our QB could probably eat more than yours can.  Also, it's Midnight Madness this weekend and after that we don't care about football.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Buckeye fans, there's only so many time you can get lucky and pull a win out of your arse :p Oklahoma will win it all, and it won't be close.  However, the only thing I really care about this season is to see RON ZOOK get FIRED.  My worst nightmare is that Foley will have another brain seizure and extend Zook's contract at the end of the season.  You did us NO favors Kentucky and LSU!!!</div></div><hr />

I was at the UF UK game a few weeks ago.  It was the best 3.5 quarters of football I've ever personally seen.  However, I knew UK would lose as soon as the security guards came out to guard the goalposts at the beginning of the 4th.  Karma is a bitch for UK, espescially after the LSU miracle finish last year.<br />
<br />
Also, Ron Zook should write a thank-you letter to all the UK football players for losing the game and letting him keep his job...for now.</div></div><hr />

When all is said and done someone from the PAC 10 will be in the Sugar bowl after the New Year and it won't be the over-rated Trojans.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashbomba</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so whats gonna be the results of the BCS with OU losing this weekend?<br />
<br />
will be interesting seem OU has recieved their invite for the championship bowl already if they dropped to #3 on the BCS.</div></div><hr />
