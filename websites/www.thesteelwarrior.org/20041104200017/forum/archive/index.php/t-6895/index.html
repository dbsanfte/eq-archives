<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hows cornering for you guys atm?<br />
<br />
I'm mostly doing Ssra and VT atm and can't corner for shit as a max shrunk barbarian.  You need to be a halfling or a gnome, or have those illusions to corner effectively there now?<br />
<br />
Just wondering, havent seen any posts on the subject lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">KT, vindic, statue, idol and AoW = NO corner :/<br />
<br />
i used AoN max shrinked<br />
i used AoN max shrinked + DMF<br />
another tank used gnome illu shrinked<br />
<br />
in any case we could not corner shit in kael<br />
<br />
(sebilis server : we are at the 04/14/2004 patch)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haven't had any issues corner tanking as a max shrunk half elf. Even corner tanked Velketor on a &gt; 90 degree corner.<br />
<br />
Had shrunk barb corner tank Bert in CoD and all 3 zeks (including fake ones in Rallos script) in Tactics without any issues.<br />
<br />
I can corner tank in all of the old world dungeons (solb, guk, sebilis) for my rogue friend when powerleveling him as well.<br />
<br />
So maybe Velious/Luclin are the  only expansions where corner tanking is messed up? I haven't tried corner tanking in either, but will try tonight with cleric bot stunning to push mob into corner on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have found that ssra cornering is all screwd up, but now I can corner mobs in bot at normal size. For me kael seemed normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ive noticed quite a few places where the mobs get pushed thru the tank in the corner and its driving me nuts. anyone got a workaround for this other than flip pushing the mob back and forth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A fellow dorf warrior, halfling and gnome could all corner emperor Ssra where I could not as a max shrunk barbarian.<br />
<br />
Anyone else kinda feel screwed here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i tanked general reparm with illusion darkelf and shrink and he cornered just fine in fire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">VT seems give or take, using a shrunk dorf, one of the thalls just wouldn't corner so we ended up flanking him, but the Diabo did just fine with same said tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I managed to corner AOW as shrunken wood elf but only after running away from the fight and getting summoned by him INTO the wall.<br />
<br />
Most annoying things I cant seem to corner:  First 8 kings in the bert cycle. <br />
<br />
Its pretty lame.  Best approach seems to be to have an enchanter in the group, gnome everyone, and pray.</div></div><hr />
