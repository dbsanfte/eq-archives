<br />
Hand of the Meistro           =&gt; not so common<br />
Red &amp; Green Dragon Scales =&gt; the rarest thing, and hightly wanted by other classes too<br />
Spyroc Wingblade             =&gt; the easiest to get since you can chain kill the spiroc lord untill everybody has its own <br />
Ancient Blade                  =&gt; lol<br />
Ball of Everliving Golem       =&gt; hightly variable, you can have more than one the first attemp, or still waiting after 15 Hate clearing<br />
<br />
cause those are the only items i need for me epic and i am wanting to get it...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
=&gt; all in all, you should just forget about the 1.0 epic and buy CHoS/SotB and GSoT. then start to think of epic 1.5 and 2.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hand of the Meistro<br />
Red &amp; Green Dragon Scales<br />
Spyroc Wingblade<br />
Ancient Blade<br />
Ball of Everliving Golem<br />
Hand of the Maestro - Go to Hate, Hand of the Maestro is almost always up.  Kill him.  Think it drops every time.  <br />
Dragon Scales - Start tracking dragons.  Or the bazaar.  Norclav the ScaleKeeper in the Hole still drops the red one.  Think there's a way you hand in a red and get a green? <br />
Spyroc Wingblade - Need a guild capable of getting to the spiroc island in Sky.  If you're all level 55, then it may be a challenge. <br />
Ball of Everliving Golem - If you can break the entrance to Fear, you can take a Golem.  <br />
Ancient Blade - If you have a group of 65's the Queen of Chardok is single groupable.  (Drop into king room and PBAE!!! wheee!! ) If you're all level 50-55, bring a raid force.  The Queen fight isn't actually the hardest part, IMO, its getting through the entrance hall of the palace.  Something like 15 low 50's mobs that you could get all at the same time.  <br />
<br />
If you're going to do this, I suggest you spend some time trolling around on the web looking for write ups on all of these encouters.  Each of them has a bunch of stuff to them that you can't all cover in one message board post.  Depending on the level of your raid force / group / whatever you may need to pay attention to every last detail. <br />
<br />
So, sad as it is, Yoda has a point.  Guess it depends on how much 'credit' you get for your first epic when you go to do epic 1.5/2.0.  If any.  As well, if you're in a younger guild maybe the new epics are out of reach for now and you want to get it done 'just because'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for the info.  Im near the bottom of my guild level wise for lvls, most of my guild is 65, so it shouldnt be a problem getting most of this stuff now.  It will only be hard to get people to help me, everyone is always busy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how do i do epic 1.5?<br />
<br />
BTW, atm i use a SotBS and a Zek Crested Buckler for tanking, and a Runed Lance of Gryme for when im not ma.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no epic 1.5 nor 2.0 have been found. for now, it's rumored that the epic 1.5 is an intermediat combine of the 2.0 (like BiC with its 10 intermediat).<br />
and since nobody got the 1.5, the epic quest for the 2.0 on the board should lead actually to the 1.5.</div></div><hr />

ive been playing since fall of 99 and i JUST finished mine about 3 weeks ago because of how much of a pain it is to do Queen.  <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
yes the quest is still in place. it will convert a red scale to a green asuming you have soem other quest componenets. quest giver is in Nro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have been 3 years needing the Spiroc blade. I am also the MT of my guild that is about to break into VT(grr people that wont shard) I got lucky at lvl 52 and spent 90% of my DKP in a differnt guild and got the hand. Then got lucky on a fear run and got ball. (was just a fear raid and it happend to drop same with hate) Then on my 5th cleric epic run in Chardoc i told guildleader we were pulling queen or i was never doing another cleric epic and probably disbanding guild.  Thats how i got my queen drop.<br />
  That was  a year ago. I am a creator of the guild I am in now and have been in it for a year. I got 2 parts for epic from them. One was a threat other was i got feking lucky. Only thing I need is PoS..... Yes I am bitter becuase I have tanked every cleric epic all the shm epic's and even a few druid epics..... yet when i say lets go to PoS for my epic.... <br />
*crickets*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would say PoSky is hardest part of epic, just for fact you have to fight all the way up there to get it.<br />
<br />
Once there, can farm for awhile to get more then 1 drop though, when I got mine, think we had 3 drop that night.<br />
<br />
However, haven't been to sky since keys attack to key ring now, so not sure if a necro with keys could speed up process.<br />
<br />
Entire Epic1, except queen drop from Chardok, is MQable, so also good idea to post on server boards that you are looking for MQs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not worth getting anyway unless it gives you a big boost on the 1.5 quest.<br />

Ahh... the council rooms.  I love pulling the whole mess at once.  :)</div></div><hr />

Don't mean to imply she's a joke.  But the entrance room to the castle is harder.  <br />
<br />

Can't remember if the spiroc isle itself has a safe spot.  If it does, you can pivot the entire raid up and just go from there.  (CoH doesn't work, but you can use body summoning and rezzing to move up to different spots)  If it doesn't, you can certainly go right to the pegasus isle and proceed from there.</div></div><hr />

lol i have 2k pp, i have NO money for scales or MQs lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Niclet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm in spock's guild on Xegony :)  <br />
<br />
My advice would be to skip epic 1.0 also.  The epic pieces are a timesink and it's pretty mediocre to boot.  <br />
<br />
Spend 10k on CHoS and SotBS and aug em.  Then get WA1 and you will be pulling aggro just fine until you get a BoC etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If all you want is a weapon, then you should skip the first warrior epic quest. As has been proven with parses that you can find all over this board, the CHoS and SotB combination are far and away better aggro weapons than the two swords. (I did this in my late-50's.)<br />
<br />
If you want to undertake a quest that is truly epic in scale and class appropriate, then you should do the Coldain Ring quest! It's a hell of a lot more fun, and if you &quot;general&quot; the final battle, you've proven yourself to be one hell of a warrior. Also, you'll have no trouble getting people pscyhed to fight the Ring War. In fact, you'll have to turn people away once you trigger the war in Great Divide. (I won the ring war last night on Stromm and am STILL stoked.)<br />
<br />
If you want to do a quest that requires you to take reluctant guildmates to annoyingly difficult places (Sky, Fear, and Chardok), then you should start epic 1.0. Be warned, though, that you will probably get stuck on those last three drops along with the vast majority of epic-questing warriors. (I am stuck on those last drops.)<br />
<br />
Let us know what you decide!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">so far i have decided to stick with my SotBS and Zek Crested Buckler, the agro has been working out nicely, and there arent many times that i need the 'extra' dps as a tank that i put CHoS in secondary.  And the lance is great dps especially with my soulscream belt and a haste song/spell for when im offtanking.<br />
<br />
so yea...holding off on the epic 1.0 for now...will look into 1.5 tho when info becomes available for it somewhere, or i read the epic 2.0 post :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you click up, you show up on the east side of the island if I remember right..  Just follow the island edge to the south until you're at the southernmost point.  It's safe to drop invis and pull to there.<br />
<br />
Of course, the whole island usually comes when you pull to there because of the way the vanquishers and the other spirocs are linked.  It usually chain aggros everything on the island except the nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I got all my Epic pieces for V1.0 I was lucky. I would go to tank for another classes Epic drop and got all of mine in turn. Never did I try to go to a plane just for my Epic drop. PoH was helping a Ranger, PoF was helping a Shaman, PoS was helping a Necro and Mage, Chardok was helping a Cleric. The Hole was helping a Ranger and Shaman with turn-ins and we went over and did the Scalekeeper. Guild was on the was to Seb one day and Sev was up on a Ranger's track, took him down and got my Green Scale. After I had all that I went to Perma and got the 2 pieces from there then went to DL and got that piece. A little shopping in EC got me the Reabreathers and the 2 gems. Then it was just a day of running around and got the Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">UPDATE!  <br />
<br />
I got my red and green dragon scales, and my Ancient Blade.  All i have left are Fear, Hate and Sky.  Were gonna raid hate next weekend i think to do my epic and a ranger one.</div></div><hr />
