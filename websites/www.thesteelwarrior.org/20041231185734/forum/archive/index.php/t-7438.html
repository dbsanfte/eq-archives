<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shirmar</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lastnight i got invited to a nro adv and everything went ok except the clr saying he was lom all the way though it which i could not believe seeing how it was a normal and i have 8500hps and when i 2box my clr and my wife a shm do them by ourselves the cleric rarely goes below a bub of mana. But anyway my question is this why did i only get 34 points from a win? normally i get 51 and i dont think i have ever got below that on a normal adv. Now the grp broke up right after the adv and most of them were anon but the 2 others besides me were 65.<br />
 <br />
Do you get alot less if you have others in the grp that are not 65? I didnt get a chance to con the others that were anon so to be honest i couldnt tell you if they were below 65. I have done adv's with friends and have had one that was lvl 58 but i still got 51 points unless i missed it saying i got less.<br />
<br />
I know you get less points when you are lower lvl but i have never notice myself getting less than 51 when i had one or so below 65. Is it an average that decides how many you get no matter if you are 65 or not?<br />
<br />
Might sound stupid but i have just started doing adv's not too long ago to get ft items for the wife and the clr mostly so i never really looked into what points you would get if your not 65 mostly because i am 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as you dont have more than one or 2 folks that are lower, and they arent much lower, you'll still get the usual numbers.  If you group with a bunch of 58's the points will be disappointing though.  It isn't unusual for me to have 1-3 folks in the 62 and above range in my groups and still get 51 points.  And the lower folks will get more points than they'd get in a group their own level because there are 65's in the group.   All 65's does make for the surest way of getting the points, and for higher avg mob level and thus better AAxp, but it also makes it that much tougher for folks in the hell that is the low 60's to get groups and xps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You actually did a level 60 adventure instead of a 65.  The average level in your group was low enough that the system kicked you down a tier.  Level 60 adventures award 34 points per win.  34 points is the max you can get from one of those.</div></div><hr />

So does 51 points  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get a 65 adventure with a group that would normally be getting a 60 adventure, select Hard for the adv.  That bumps it up to a 65 adventure.  (Hard 60 is a Normal 65, AFAIK)</div></div><hr />

level of dungeon is set before entering zone.  having highest level go first doesnt do anything.</div></div><hr />

I fall asleep during normals, I try to stick to hards. The explanation about the cleric being sigificantly lower in level then you maeks a lot of sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you drop to a lvl 60 adventure, it's pathetically easy beyond even a normal all lvl 65 run.<br />
<br />
As for being low on mana, I don't have complaints about being lom unless it's a weak group with a lot of adds and quick heals.  Maybe cleric didn't have c3, or was nuking along with healing?<br />
<br />
Hard to imagine anyone getting lom on an 8.5k tank on a lvl 60 run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 65 gives you +2 levels. 5 65s give you +10 levels. A 58 is -5 levels. With one 58 and all 65s you are still +5 levels. 2 58s will drop you (-5x 2= -10, 4 65s = +2x 4= +8. Add the two and you are -2 levels froma 63).  Either you had 2 58s in the group, or 3 people who were not 65.</div></div><hr />

It goes higher than that, and Omens is going to outdate LDoN enough to make it require a revamp. A hard adventure for a group of 65s is actually a level 70-base adventure, and so a normal for a group of 70s will be what hard is now. If there even is a level 75-base template set for a group of 70s that picks hard, I'm curious how difficult the mobs are. My guess is Kod'Taz without the Chaos Claws, and without the insanely wide spike damage.<br />
<br />
If cleric was LoM a lot on a level 60 adventure, odds are cleric was the low level weakest link.<br />
<br />
Or just a dumbass. Assuming zero FT, the cleric would get 33 mana per tick from meditate + Armor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2509&amp;source=Live); Alteration-speced CH (without SCM) costs 360 mana. About 1 CH per minute, sustained. Some of that would be lost during cast times, etc, but not enough for a decent cleric to struggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geltwip</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, this gets me thinking... Is it possible to get a 'medium' difficulty adventure, by doing a hard, but with like a level 51 in the group too?  <br />
<br />
If that dropped you down to a level 60 hard, that would be pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cant get a lvl51 with a lvl65, because of the 7 lvl difference rule.<br />
<br />
I wish there was some kind of midlvl between Normal and Hard. With 8k+ hp buffed, Im not too good for Hard but Normals are too easy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish there was some kind of midlvl between Normal and Hard. With 8k+ hp buffed, Im not too good for Hard but Normals are too easy...<br />
<br />
That isn't possible without reworking the entire LDoN architecture; adventures are based on average level which is indexed by 5s, to add a middle ground they would have to add a second type of 65-base adventure which doesn't exist right now (and may not be codeable without revamping LDoN entirely).<br />
<br />
If I were a dev, when Omens pushes the level cap to 70 I'd change the level 70-base adventure (which is 65-hard, or a normal at 70) to the middle ground many people have been asking for (~600 hitters, 80ish points) and move the current 70-base template to 75-base, meaning what is now 65-hard will be the hard adventure at 70 (998 hitters, 105 points).<br />
<br />
That's one upside to raising the level cap, for all those that say there's nothing good about raising levels again; it finally gives LDoN a medium level without re-coding its adventure system.</div></div><hr />
