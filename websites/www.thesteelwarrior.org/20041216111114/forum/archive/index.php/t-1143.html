Kill Valdy :D . Only problem there is...Valdy is almost never up. I know that Heratius Grolden is the second toughest vampyre in TM, spawning on the balcony of the vampyre tower, with his own spawnpoint. Valdanof spawns on Heratius' spawn point the second Heratius is killed. However, Heratius is almost never up! I've camped the vampyre tower a number of times, a few of those we kept the entire place clear. I also check the balcony from the mountain a few times a day with an alt parked there. Still no luck...I've heard a number of rumors about how to get this to spawn, but they're all different and people seem to have proven all of them wrong. So, i was wondering, have any of you done this quest, or are on the same part of it as i am? Do you have any suggestions on this? :)</div></div><hr />

Heratius spawns on the far right corner of the highest floor if you are standing on the balcony looking in.  Druid in my guild says heratius seemed to have a ph in that spawn point.  I'd believe him seeing as he was farming the vamps when heratius spawned and got me and some people to kill Vald for me =).</div></div><hr />

What they have found is that Heratius seems to be interchangeable with other named vamps on the top level.</div></div><hr />
