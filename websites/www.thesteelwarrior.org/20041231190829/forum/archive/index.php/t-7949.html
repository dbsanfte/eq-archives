Does lower delay go in offhand or mainhand?<br />
<br />
Thankya for input in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mainhand. Lower delay means the damage bonus goes off more often, leading to more DPS and more aggro. Ratio is the important thing offhand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but don't put a 7/20 weapon in mh if you have a 11/22 just because it's faster.<br />
<br />
but do put a 11/22 in mh if the other weapon is 12/24<br />
<br />
how to make that make sence.<br />
<br />
it takes 2 damage or 2 delay to make a noticible dps difference. if you go up 2 delay you have to go up 2 damage to see the same dps. so with the 7/20 as the base the 11/22 gains 4 damage and 2 delay so dps up grade, but the 12/24 even though the same ratio only gains 1 damage and 2 delay dps downgrade.<br />
<br />
think that makes sence. anything less then 2 falls into rng error<br />
<br />
another thing to look at is paraseable min delay is 10. anything under 10 gets logged and parased at 10. 10 is acheaved by 20 delay at full haste. <br />
<br />
best thing is to post the weaps your looking at for dps make it much easer to say what is best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best answer is to LOG and PARSE your fights.  I log every fight I do and then after I logout for the night I parse it, I know the dps on every weapon combo I have. <br />
<br />
If you want a fast answer take a look here http://hem.passagen.se/grawn/EQDPMCalculator/<br />
this is an updated Copeland's Weapon Analyzer that some of you know about.<br />

I was also looking for an explanation as to why the lower delay went in mainhand.  Just needed some clarification.<br />
<br />
I personally don't parse or log any kind of dmg or anything.  Guess that makes me a &quot;bad&quot; warrior, huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I awlays loved using 1hs for a long time, then i got intrduced to 2hs, once you get the AAs down you for them its really hard to let go of it. Maybe something to think about it getting your guild to hit up Seru and get his 2hs from the looks of it your guild could prolly do him and he drops some phat items as well. BBB will do you some good in POP if you get to tank some. sorry /derail off..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The weapon with better ratio should be in the main hand.  With today's available gear damage bonus is a small portion of your total DPS and consequently aggro (it is not even clear if damage bonus even affects aggro).  When dealing with 2Handers, the weapon with higher delay should be used (1hander rarely has enough variation in delay to matter).  Why?  Let's say you have a 60/40 and a 30/20.  You'd think they produce the same amount of aggro, but actually the 60/40 is better, because assuming aggro is a linear function of damage, then let's say 60 damage weapon produce 500 aggro per swing, then the 30 damage weapon produces 250 aggro per swing.  However, on your first swing, the 60/40 starts with 500 aggro as opposed to 250 on 30/20, and the difference is considerable when dealing with snap aggro.  Also, since procs are scaled to delay, the 60/40 also has twice as high a chance of getting a proc on the first swing as opposed to the 30/20.  They may average out to the same aggro over time but the weapon with same ratio but higher delay actually produces considerably more aggro for the initial parts of a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parsing is the best way to go because it's hard data.<br />
but if you want to go with a priori score to help your choise, the best way is still to look at the 'modified ratio' to evaluate what YOU gonna do with this wepon.<br />
R = (DM + DB ) / DL     with <br />
DM : domage of the weapon listed (add the magical domage but not the bane)<br />
DB : domage bonus of this wapon, depand on your lvl and AA<br />
DL : dalay of the weapon listed, or maybe the hasted delay for very particular case (ie if changing of weapon setup will change your haste setup)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DB + damage way overestimates the effect of DB.<br />
<br />
At level 65 the max hit is about 6Xdamage + DB... so even if you hit half of that on average, that still gives you 3Xdamage + DB to work with.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the multiplier can go up or down depending on what kind of attack buffs you get, worn attack, and what kind of mobs you're fighting (mostly against Luclin mobs).<br />
<br />
If you assume you've a 20 delay weapon, max haste, assuming 50% hit rate (low estimate) and 100% double attack (high estimate to cancel out), you get 1 hit per second, or 13 DPS from damage bonus out of your entire dual wield DPS.  If you have Sinister Strikes, add about 6 DPS to a total of 19 DPS from damage bonus.  On the high end warriors can do 200 DPS easily so only 1/10th of DPS comes from DB.  So let's say you're not so uber so your weapon acts like half the ratio of an uber (i.e. 32/26 Demerix becomes 16/26, which is certainly obtainable) after factoring in all the non-uberness, that still leaves you about 100 DPS with DB attributing to only 1/5th the DPS.</div></div><hr />

Actually, that's probably true at any point after a warrior is able to DW.<br />
As you look at specific weapons, you need to factor in the innate procs on the weapons, too.</div></div><hr />

Thats incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's sortof correct, your logs will show the delay as 10, because your logs only update every second, but if you look you will have more weapon swings each second if your delay drops below 10,  ie if 100% hasted 20 dly weap avg's out to 2 swings per second, then the 10dly 100% hasted will still only show up once per second (instead of half second) but you will have generally 4 swings instead of 2 each second.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best ratio for both hands unless you have 2 weapons that are close in ratio and one is faster.  Then use the faster one in the main hand for the extra damage bonus DPS.</div></div><hr />
