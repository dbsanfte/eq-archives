<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nonosassy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, my name is Nonosassy and I am a Warrior on the Rallos Zek server.   I know most of you are not on PvP servers, and I'm hoping to start a conversation for us PvP warriors.<br />
<br />
Up till present, Warriors have not been a PvP class at all, due to our lack of any PvP oriented tools.  Most of us have learned to cope and can do quite well, but for me atleast - my edge used to be my invulnerability.  I could take quite the beating, resist many spells, take small melee damage and dish out a melee thrashing.<br />
<br />
The latest change to our PvP AC (which is now 80% effective, so a 2000ac warrior only would have an effective 1600ac) has hit us HARD.  400 AC loss is significant for this fellow, and I'm sure you've all noticed a big difference in getting hit as well.<br />
<br />
With the resist changes, our inherant class MR advantage is basically useless.  Well, lets face it, 33 extra MR wasn't a boon to us since Vellious came along - and it's effectiveness has creeped down ever since.  This was one of our special class &quot;tools&quot; we were given; and while all other classes tools have grown and been improved upon - this particular one of ours has been rendered insignificant.<br />
<br />
While the melee range has been increased (supposidely a significant change, and I do notice a little difference), I -atleast- have still been plagued with &quot;Out of range&quot; messages when the person appears to be right infront of you... extremely noticeable when fighting a bard for instance.  I am sure this is purely a lag issue, but it does have a significant measure of importance in PvP for all melee classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what would you other PvP warriors like to see?<br />
<br />
<br />
I for instance, have decided that our Incite line should have some sort of PvP usefulness.  I figured that a 1 second unresistable stun would do a world of help to our PvP state.  I do not believe it would be an over-powered ability, given that 30 second reuse for 1 second of stun wouldn't be enough to significantly alter any fight...  given our non-existant PvP tools, it would be an incredible increase of power for us.</div></div><hr />

First of all if you are a pure melee and you arent time+ geared you dont have a snowballs chance in hell of killing someone in pvp unless they are horribly geared or afk.  The major upgrade warriors got in the patch was the 20% mitigation nerf, its much much easier to kill casters, although priests can still tank me.  The range helped a bit but it still isnt much.  Basically what keeps a warrior at a disadvangage in pvp is lack of imoblilization or snare ability.  Monks for example can get ton pos from casino which once it procs is basically instadeath on anyone.  Rogues are pretty much SOL like warriors since their poisons still are fairly useless, although they do get tendonslice, albeit on a 14 damage weapon so its quite a sacrifice.  Warriors get nothing at this point in the game so you are basically stuck trying to chase people on horse if you want to really kill people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've won 3 pvp events on my server (2x Royal Rumbles, 1x Melee Rumble), i always ride around on my seru horse jousting people with bbb, once on a race wars (was 12 versus 8, woot Guides!) our gang of 8 was slaughtered almost instantly, and i led them on a goose chase for 10 mins on seru horse before the rangers finally got me down, woot for seru horse!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nonosassy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, a horse is no use in PVP.  Any stun knocks you off it - and with the resist changes - my 380 unbuffed MR hasn't been helping me against any stuns.  Also, I don't know who you were jousting on a horse, but the slow turn ratio and start up/slow down times make it really easy to dodge.  'Sup sidestep.<br />

I agree with the second poster, our lack of snare ability screws us.  I use Vanazir with 4 dmg aug... so I massacre anyone who stands still for me; but even with the 50% increased range, anyone who is actively moving around is still very difficult to hit.  Though they appear in range on my screen, the server says otherwise and gives me that out of range message.<br />

A rogue with Time Shirukens from Rallos Zek in time kicks butt though - i witnessed one own a very skilled bard yesterday.  His Deadly Strikes were great, hitting the guy at a distance for almost as much as I can do in melee range.<br />

Perhaps we need a ranged attack with some oomph.</div></div><hr />
