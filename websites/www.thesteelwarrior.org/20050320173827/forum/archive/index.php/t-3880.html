I've never harassed players, bugged GMs, or ninja loot.  I just do my job and move on.  I've been posting on Steel Warrior for awhile and started a thread recently regarding WoW and its warriors.  I'm not sure if that part is relevant.  However, this morning I got a tell from a guide and well...<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:13:36 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'Guide Jeoffrey here, do you have a minute?'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:13:42 2003] You told Jeoffrey, 'sure'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:14:37 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'Very good, sorry to bother you.  Your name as I understand is too similar to Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:15:00 2003] You told Jeoffrey, 'Its short for my name Cedric'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:15:08 2003] You told Jeoffrey, 'more like Cedric the Vicious'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:16:17 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'Well okay, I do believe you, but I am not sure the other players do.  I have received petitions on it.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:16:35 2003] You told Jeoffrey, 'hmmm...  not good i guess.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:16:40 2003] You told Jeoffrey, 'any suggestions?'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:16:53 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'The name rule is only one cap letter in the first name as well.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:17:03 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'Thats why I contacted you'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:17:40 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'This will be escalated to customer service at Sony and they will most likley change your name.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:18:10 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'I wanted to see if you had a preference for that, rather than let them pick it.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:18:17 2003] You told Jeoffrey, 'ok.  Will there be an option for a name I choose.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:18:48 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'Most of the time they try to keep it close to what you have,'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:19:16 2003] You told Jeoffrey, 'I'll let them choose.  Thanks for the heads up though.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:19:50 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'But so it does not resemble the name of a famos person.  That can bring law suites for them.  I know that is silly, but it happenes.'<br />
[Sun Oct 26 06:20:13 2003] Jeoffrey tells you, 'Your very welcome, and have a good eq day.'<br />
<br />
I've been playing CedVicious for a year and a half.  He's only level 44 but I've used a mule and a druid to armor him up which took some time also.  Now with this news, its kind of a blow.  I'd suck it up but running around without CedVicius is like playing an ebay warrior.  So.. I'm closing my EQ account.  I've accumulated 75k of pp that I have not spent.  &lt;sucks!&gt;.  This I will be giving to an associate.  However, if you're a Rallos Zek warrior on Brell, send a tell to Icefossil if you see him.  He's my mule and I will give him RZ armor and weps (CHOS, WMBS, Frosty and some others).  If I have any items I will give them out, just mention CedVicious' name.  Account should be closed by Wed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a Sloot McTeabaggins and a Krack Dhealer on our server :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That truly sucks Ced :/   Cases like this are where I would love to see a SOE policy of posting who &quot;petitioned&quot; you.  And I gotta agree with Iskandar... very classy exit.<br />
<br />
But one other thought... I dunno, how about trying for a name something like Cedric Da'vicious ?   Maybe there's something like that that will appeal to you, and keep you playing.   I don't like to see the loss to the EQ and warrior communities of a positive influence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, that sucks. How did you get CedVicious in the first place?<br />
<br />
There is a druid on my server named HpOne or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found tons and tons of stupid named characters (&quot;Muahahaha&quot; is one of them) and instead of nerfing those names, totally out of any RPing reason, they pick a good name like yours?? Its totally nonsense :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
A while ago I petitoned to get my Warrior the same last name as my cleric.<br />
I was told the name is too similar to Firiona`Vie and I couldn't have it. So I explained that my cleric (who I made twice and both had the same last name) has had that last name for labout a year and they said they'd most likely have to take her name away too. Hasn't happened yet and not sure if I want to push my luck asking for the last name again. <br />
Her last name is Fiona`Var... I don't think it's that similar really and I definitely didn't have that in mind when I named her. <br />
The naming policy sucks. There are tons of toons out there with terrible, rude etc names. /sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah well yours is too similar to a certain giraffe mascot of a large toy chain. Seriously if they want to name nazi they should be consistant. Personally I would have invited him to the bazaar and told him to have fun, plenty of names there to change. If my name were ever changed for any reason I would petition every questionable name until they banned me or gave me mine back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Name Policy on SOE board (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp) <br />
<br />
But, I could have sworn they lifted the name policy and allowed anything this side of vulgarity.<br />
<br />
About a year ago, when they dropped this absurd policy, my husband got his last name back &quot;Diduconit&quot;.  It took us an email to SOE to get the name back.  But out of irony, the same GM that removed it, Tilol, was the same that added it back.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it a girlfriend got her alts toon last name added back also.   Maybe the name change policy drop that i'm thinking of is last names only??<br />
<br />
Anyways, try sending an email to SOE, can't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that doth sucketh..ruined the game over trivial BS liek that :(<br />
<br />
SoE should come over to Terris and have a chat with Portbbittch....i guess that doesn't sound lie Sid Vicious so it's okay.<br />
<br />
Oh, about the D' thing...violations there too. D'Apocalypse wasn't acceptable for Shikarii to have put back when I moved to Terris.<br />
<br />
surnames though should be no problem unless your server GM is a complete dick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I admit I have petitioned a name twice. One was a guy called Starving Africanbabies. His surname was changed the next time I saw him. Other one was a lvl 18 warrior called 'Raex'.</div></div><hr />

Or they just don't care...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chagen</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few years ago I was playing an ogre shaman.  At the time i was a member of a lowbie RP guild and i had RPed the hell out of this ogre as being &quot;an ogre cleric&quot;.  His name was Clurik, when i hit 20 id intended to surname him Da'Clerik De'Clerik, Der'Cleruk or some such. <br />
<br />
/petitioning for it (due to the ' in it) i was told by a guide that i could not have that as a surname.  I assumed there was something about having a class name in my surname in their naming policy, however the GM continued that since I was not a cleric i could not have something resembling the class in my surname.  When i noted that i had RPed this  ogre as a cleric he told me that i COULDNT RP A CLERIC as an ogre.  That that was outside the realm of possabilities for ogre RP.  After demainding to speak to a &quot;real&quot; GM, i waited for 7 hours with no reply.  Typical.<br />
<br />
Before and after that day i petition &quot;non-rp&quot; names, mostly the Froddo's, Tokey McBonghitz' and Supernugs Weedsmokin types. <br />
<br />
The naming policy is hosed, and the people that enforce is can be retarded. I'm sorry you got caught up, Ced :(</div></div><hr />

Amazingly someone would petition you because of your name and let people curse, discriminate or try to sell thier accounts in publice channels without even thinking of petitioning.</div></div><hr />

Our guild was fooling around in Mistmore one night and of course i got killed. When i landed at my bind i ported to misty thicket to be a little more safer and i landed right in the middle of 3 Gm's. I lost my lvl and my last name. From that day on i haven't had the desire to play him :(</div></div><hr />

I never could play him after that at all.  I feel your pain.</div></div><hr />

if they do i will explain that being an ogre, his parents were not very smart, they just called him Da Oga and it stuck.  he does have a brother, Daudaoga who is a beastlord... =)</div></div><hr />
