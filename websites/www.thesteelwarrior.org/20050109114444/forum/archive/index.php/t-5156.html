<br />
(with the exception of we didnt know where to position him he got pushed into the organ and summoned me and took a while to get out) <br />
<br />
we are now looking into doing innoruuk revamped but i was just curious how hard exactly is he? im not asking for a strat or anything just a comparison of his melee to other mobs and how hard is event (if he has one) is compared to others in say PoP?<br />
<br />
just for reference recently weve done: ring of vulak, maestro, aow, aerin'darr, behemoth, tallon zek, terris thule and some other junk like grummus and ntov and ST. would inny totally blow us away? reguardless of if he will or not we will probably try, i just wanna know our chances :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new Inny is in an entirely different league than Maestro.  I've seen guilds who rocked Maestro hardcore fall flat on their face to Inny.  That's not to say you can't do it.  No way.  He's just entirely different than Maestro is all.<br />
<br />
Inny starts off in merchant form.  This is the fake one.  By killing him, you start the true Inny script and he will appear in the pit behind you.  The fake Inny has the same damage output as the real one, however he will completely dispell your main tank.  He quads for 800's very quickly and AE rampages.  I'm pretty sure he also has the Avatar of Power AE (Dispell + Gravflux) as well, but it's been a while.  <br />
<br />
Thing to take into consideration:<br />
<br />
-Inny can be pulled so that no adds will come.  This is not a rumor as my guild has done it.  He is tethered though, so you need to figure out where that correct place is. ;)  If you pull past the tether, he despawns.  :(<br />
<br />
-When the revamped Hate first came out, it was considered an outdoor zone.  It was then later changed to an indoor one.  Inny has an annoying AE, but the zone is indoor.  Just put two and two together here.  :D <br />
<br />
-Inny is an age old mob and shares one drastic thing in common with them.  It's kind of annoying at first, but your *cough* debuffers *cough* and casters *cough* need to be *cough* in melee *cough* range in order to *cough* land spells *cough* on him.  *cough*  Gah!  It's dusty in here.  :p <br />
<br />
Other than that, it's a pretty long fight.  Inny has a ton of freaking hitpoints, but overall really isn't all that hard.  Good luck!  The loot rocks.</div></div><hr />

Inny has an annoying AE, but the zone is indoor.  Just put two and two together here.  :D  You know, I'm pretty good with math and EQ spells and stuff...but for some reason I can't seem to put those two together.  The only thing I can come up with is make him face a wall (corner) or put lev on everyone, but don't think that's right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was a really worthwhile post.....<br />
<br />
Indoors mean hide around corners, so time his AE's, have someone ooc them and everyone able run and hide till after the AE lands. Pull him to a corner giving the Casters and DPS a handy hiding spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sardaan</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we tried Inny about a week ago and severely underestimated him.<br />
<br />
Basically this how it went<br />
<br />
- Pulled Inny. He's AE Rampagin and Knockin ppl around with his frontal AE. So it's kinda like TZ + Fennin. Although he don't hit as hard, the AE ramps hit for around 600-ish. It's that frontal AE so corner him fast or he'll be blowing ppl all over the dang place.<br />
- Fought him for a short while and then he poofed. <br />
- This giant DE Cleric of Hate (or something) appeared untargetable and started walking out of the throne room bawling about how great Inny was or something.<br />
- Inny comes back full health again, hittin a bit harder, and brings a crapload of adds with it.<br />
<br />
At this point we're tryin to get a handle on it and he's blowing clerics around so heals aren't landing. We wiped and he poofed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Things to remember:<br />
<br />
1.) It's very similar to the RZTW script. <br />
- You fight Inny, he poofs and comes back harder with a bunch of adds.<br />
- You blow it, you get no second chance.<br />
2.) Upon poofing it'd be prudent to pack the raid into a corner of his throne room. IIRC Inny respawned outside the thoneroom in that balcony area. <br />
<br />
Good luck with your raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sardaan</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh btw... given your list of accomplishments, you should be fine on Inny. Ya might wipe first time while you learn the script. We went in with zero strats as usual =P But after that it's easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We wiped our first and third time figuring out some tactics, but never wiped again.<br />
Give it a few shots, that'll help you to understand the tactic some more $$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
<br />
This is how we do Inny it is alot like Xegony fight for us which is probably why she was cake.<br />
<br />
Kill fake inny at bottom of stairs in main room at like 5% everyone but MT/ST get out.<br />
<br />
After real Inny spawns get him into corner near the exit (the one behind the table sharing wall with stairs and door). Corner tank Inny here with clerics behind wall for healing in the other room. Only have like few numbers actually on Inny. If a melee on Inny gets low have them leave and ask for heals.<br />
<br />
As for adds, use pallies, sk's or watever to pull them out of the room as the spawn to the other room. Have enchanters ready to mezz ones that can be and pallies, sk's extra tanks offtanking the rest. Always make sure to have someone in Inny's room ready to pull more adds. And enough healing outside to deal with.<br />
<br />
At about 25-30% the Evangelist of Hate becomes targetable and runs down the stairs. Have def tank ready and Enough healers to handle (he hits harder than inny and lalot less hps.) Burn down the evangelist after he dies no more adds spawn and you can burn down inny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The type of adds and number that spawn initially is random.  They can all be mezzed except for the rock golem thingies.  Kill those. . .but leave the rest mezzed.  You'll need 4 ench/bards to be safe.  You *can* kill some of the mezzable ones too, but if you kill too many, they'll just start respawning.<br />
<br />
Inny himself is quite easy, much lower dps than maestro for example.  His AE rampage is annoying especially to casters, though at least once it was kindof buggy for us (hitting some people but not others).  We usually did mostly ranged attack on inny, especially in the first half of the fight where we're locking down adds, and trimming the number of adds down a bit.  Basically, if you can protect the MT and clerics from the adds, it's a done deal.  The evangelist that becomes targetable at 25% or so is quite easy (with alot less dps than inny to my experience. . .a couple druids can heal a /disc tank fine).<br />
<br />
If done properly, inny could be taken out without much trouble with 40 non-elemental geared people.  It is very chaotic until the adds are locked down, however, and can easily turn into a giant goat screw.<br />
<br />
By the way, we never cornered him, as we like to use rangers throughout, but we did have clerics healing from the other side of a wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">tried inny first time today, we whiped at 90% due to some bad positioning on our part as our offtanking/CC team was in aggro range and eaten by inny first then the adds ate our healers. <br />
<br />
inny himself was a joke, we got about 10% of his life in like 30 seconds of fighting. his melee was pretty weak as he rarely quadded, most just tripples doing like 700 hp a round off me. i wasnt buffed to resist his AE (didnt have bard playing song for me) and i resisted 5 out of 6 of his AEs with only 280 MR. the ae seems to be a proc as i got two resist messages during a quad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dbyx</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, just a little background info:<br />
We went after Innoruuk in HateB last night for our first attempt at him. Took 54 people. A fair amount of tanks, about 8 clerics. <br />
<br />
There were 3 basic areas for the fight, that I want to illustrate for clarity's sake. <br />
Throne Room - This is where Innoruuk is orginally standing and the big room leading right up to his throne room. <br />
<br />
Dining Room - Before taking the two sets of stairs up to his throne, you're in a big room with various tables in the corners. <br />
<br />
Outside - Before you enter the Dining Room, there is this large hall outside that has some normal Denizens of Hate. This is the area just outside the Dining Room. <br />
<br />
Ok, so I researched him as much as possible beforehand, (This very post was a great help) but I wanted to see if you guys could help me out with a bit more info and some questions I had about the fight. <br />
<br />
When we were ready to start, I moved the raid down to the Dining room. MT pulled Inno to the NE corner of the Dining room (North wall is the wall with the door in it leading to the Outside, East wall has the first set of stairs leading up to Inno's Throne Room. So its the corner that is the intersection of the wall with the door and the wall with the stairs), the CH Chain started, and everyone burned him down easily enough. <br />
<br />
At this point, I moved the majority of the raid, except for the Healers which stayed Outside, up to the Throne to wait for the real Inno to spawn. I was under the impression, for whatever reason, that Inno's spawned adds would be coming from the Throne area. So I had the CC-Team (Few groups of mezzers + tanks + healers) positioned there ready for them. <br />
<br />
Inno and gang spawned maybe on the balcony (I didn't really see), but he ended up in the Dining Room with his friends. My initial plan, since I thought the adds were going to spawn in the Throne room, was to to have the CC-team pull the adds up to the Throne room. <br />
<br />
Anyway, so the MT engaged Inno, and tanked in the NE corner again,  and despite the off-tanks best efforts, just about all the adds went straight for the clerics Outside. Some of them got mezed Outside, and the tanks were all down there fighting. So I told the entire CC-Team to move Outside and start killing some of them. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in the first few seconds of the fight...I think we lost 2 of our clerics. The first 30 secs, things were running around everywhere. Regardless, after a few minutes things were finally getting under control as far as CC was concerned. About this time though, all the healers were OOM and people started to die rapidly. We got him down to 45% before wiping. <br />
<br />
Ok, so now my questions....<br />
<br />
A) As we were fighting him, it seemed like the adds were spawning right from underneath Inno in the Dining Room. The whole fight, tanks were pulling things out of his room and fighting them Outside. Do the adds always spawn in the Dining Room regardless of where you fight him? Or do they always spawn right underneath Inno regardless of where he is being fought?<br />
<br />
B) After the Real Inno spawned with friends in the Dining Room, would it be possible to use pacify on his friends and pull him single?<br />
<br />
C) I read that he is tethered, but how long is it? Can he be pulled Outside? Can he be pulled up to his Throne Room? Can he leave the Dining Room at all? Where, if you please, can he be moved to?<br />
<br />
D) Like I said, I had the healers positioned Outside (so they could heal the MT through the wall) but some of them were saying they were still taking Rampage Damage. Is there another good spot that the clerics could stand to avoid the AE spell *and* AE rampage? Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
E) We didn't quite get to the point where the Evangelist would spawn, but I have a few questions about him. Does he have any special abilities like Rampage or any AEs? Can he be slowed?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I would like to try him again soon. Thanks in advance. <br />
