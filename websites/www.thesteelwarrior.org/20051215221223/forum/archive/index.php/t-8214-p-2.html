<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made the magelo before I made the list, so it's not quite the most hp/ac possible. I had already done the buff calculations when I saw the cloak from Vxed, that I decided a few more hp wasn't worth doing the math over again. With OoW buffs and 305 stamina though, that optimum setup would be close to 11k hitpoints.<br />
<br />
what level does this single group need to be?<br />
<br />
Since the zones vary so greatly in difficulty, you can progress in those zones. Qinimi is easier than Riwwi is easier than Barindu is easier than Ferubi is easier than Vxed is easier than Tipt. Sewers difficulty varies from about Riwwi to about Vxed. The real value in this lies in the fact that if Tipt or Vxed is too hard for you (or your usual group, if you have one), you can gear up in Ferubi or Barindu. If Ferubi is too hard for you, you can gear up in Riwwi or Qinimi. There's 6 other expansions worth of other upgrade paths as well, but Gates provides options everywhere from bazaar gear to post-time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Curious what sort of HP/AC I should shoot for tho, to have a shot in hell at PU groups, as my guild has avoided GoD like the plague. (When I quit playing to enter CoH beta, I was the only one in my guild who had bought it, and I haven't heard of any folks buying it.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends what you are talking about ... if you have all your defensive aa's then i'd say you put up a fighting chance in the sewer trials but will have difficuly in the mountains.  Ferubi is rather easy as long as you bring good crowd control and dps ... none of the monsters put out that much dps until you hit the yellow/white cons.  Named, on the other hand, are quite a different story.<br />
<br />
If you can do hard LDoN without too many problems then you should do fine in the sewer 1-4 trials.  If you can do Hard LDoN very easily then you should put up at least a fighting chance in the mountains.<br />
<br />
As always, though, a talented healer and a great group can make up for any short-comings on the gear side.<br />
<br />
*edit- just looked at your magelo.  At under 5k hps and 0 aa's you will most likely have some serious problems in GoD trials, though you still will probably do just fine in qinimi and on mini named and xp crawls through ferubi (as long as your group is good).  I would shoot for another 1k hps, another 300ish ac before you delve into the trials.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice list, but just as a side note, I don't see Whimsey of the Masters getting used a whole lot if a warrior has, say, 4 or more PoP flags, or journal of the vagabond with good begging/alcohol tolerance skill, and a decent ldon charm aug, since you'd have to pick one charm to aug with adventurer's stone, and many people would probably aug the one with static stats, even if theyre lower that the maximum whisey stats.  I'm guessing that stats reset whenever you die or get rezzed, so could be a real pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A glance at your magelo, Partha, and I'm thinking you should probably be okay through Barindu, but you'll definitely need /discs for the nameds. It'll be a definite challenge, though. I do reasonably well in Ferubi at 5.7/1500 ish unbuffed + Full Defensive AA, but it's rough going. Of the sewers, the Crematory is the 'medium' LDoN that everyone wishes existed, and the pools and lair are somewhere above BoT but beneath the Eles, while the Purifying Plant is just an asskicker. As a warrior, I'd want 6k/1400+ AC to work with even bare minimum comfort in the Plant. I can't comment on Vxed/Tipt, other than to say that the two times I went to Vxed, I hid behind a guild warrior, and she took a royal beating at a buffed 9k/1600ish AC.</div></div><hr />

If you follow the progression that Ciae outlined, you will be equipped well enough to fight in KodTaz and Ikkinz and pick up even more upgrades.Exactly. If you follow the progression and pick up the various augs that are available, you should be able to get more gear out of the Kod'Taz trials and random named in the zone. You would pretty much max out here, but you would still be able to build a pretty stout warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to thank Ciae for putting this list together.  I'm a SK but most of the information is still applicable to me and I can piece the rest together myself.  My group is still farming LDoN hards but I'm sure we will be moving on to GoD soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difficulty in getting some GoD upgrades is the extreme rarity of drops.  For instance I'd love to get that shoulder item from Ferubi but it's incredibly rare.  I've done numerous grind groups there and only ever seen one drop that way.  Since all meleers can use it, all 4 meleers rolled on it and I didn't win.  <br />
<br />
We also had 1 drop during a small raid there, of which I've been on half a dozen such raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saniri</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh the drops are extremely rare, i have been wanting the face item from Vxed trash, have done about 20 runs and over 70ish hours worth of grind in there and still havent seen it.</div></div><hr />
