<br />
Max Hit: 266<br />
<br />
Max hit while shielding:<br />
2hs w/ 50AC: 199<br />
No shield (HG/BoC): 199<br />
5 AC: 197<br />
15 AC: 197<br />
25 AC: 193<br />
35 AC: 191<br />
<br />
199 = 74.81% of 266<br />
197 = 74.06% of 266<br />
193 = 72.56% of 266<br />
191 = 71.80% of 266<br />
<br />
Damage reduction %:<br />
2hs w/ 50AC: 0%<br />
No Shield (HB/BoC): 0%<br />
5 AC: 0.75%<br />
15 AC: 0.75%<br />
25 AC: 1.5%<br />
35 AC: 1.01%<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't have any shields over 35 AC to test with.  But if you want to do some testing to add to this here is what you do...<br />
<br />
Root a blood raven in PoN (near river, near zone in just to right).  Put warrior just out of melee range of raven.  Take other PC and put them in melee range and make sure they are aggro.  Shield the PC.  Have the PC sit down.  When sitting the NPC will always take the exact same damage (max hit).  Try this with each shield and without a shield.  Post results.<br />
<br />
If you are feeling more adventurous you can try something that hits harder...<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The AC of your shield DOES effect the damage taken while shielding.  <br />
<br />
Your AC does NOT effect the damage taken while shielding, only the person tanking.  <br />
<br />
You lower the damage from shielding by approx 1% per 10 AC of your shield.  Thus 10AC = 1%, 20AC = 2%, 30AC = 3%, 40 AC = 4%... etc<br />
<br />
This is supposedly capped at 50 AC from shield for an approximate damage reduction of 5%, which means you take 70% damage while tanking, and the shielded PC takes 50% of the damage.  This still needs testing though as I do not have a high AC shield to test with.  This 'cap' may be a rumor/myth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Commentary:<br />
In order to make this make enough difference to actually be useful, the % of damage reduced by AC needs to be increased.  Doubling this % would make shields considerably more attractive than they are currently.  In it's current state this % savings can be considered near unless or unnoticable.<br />
<br />
A current example:<br />
NPC that hits for 1000.<br />
No shield: 750 Damage<br />
30 AC shield: ~720 Damage<br />
50 AC shield: ~700 Damage<br />
<br />
Assume you take 8 hits on a /shield.  This results in a total damage reduction of:<br />
No shield: 0 Damage<br />
30 AC shield: 240 Damage<br />
50 AC shield: 400 Damage<br />
<br />
And a damage taken of:<br />
No shield: 6000 Damage<br />
30 AC shield: 5760 Damage<br />
50 AC shield: 5600 Damage<br />
<br />
<br />
Using shield on any NPC that hits for 2000+ can generally be considered suicide w/o a special setup just to heal the /shield'er.<br />
<br />
Doubling this % would result in the following:<br />
NPC that hits for 1000.<br />
No shield: 750 Damage<br />
30 AC shield: ~690 Damage<br />
50 AC shield: ~600 Damage<br />
<br />
Assume you take 8 hits on a /shield.  This results in a total damage reduction of:<br />
No shield: 0 Damage<br />
30 AC shield: 480 Damage<br />
50 AC shield: 800 Damage<br />
<br />
And a damage taken of:<br />
No shield: 6000 Damage<br />
30 AC shield: 5520 Damage<br />
50 AC shield: 5200 Damage<br />
<br />
<br />
This doesn't seem overpowering, but certainly does make this 'gimmick' closer to being useful than it is in it's current form.  Increasing this even beyond this would be desirable, perhaps to 5% per 10 AC.</div></div><hr />
