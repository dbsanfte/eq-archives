<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jemort</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well whats the best armor out there for say a unguilded, but has a few 65 friends, iksar warrior about lvl 40-49? Not a whole lot of cash...but some lets say...ohh little over 20k total maybe? and we can just go for some peices not a whole suit for that much.<br />
<br />
lets just go for bp arms legs wrist and feet and maybe helm or just a couple of these or whatever, just want some suggestions =)<br />
<br />
and anyone know the names of their cultural armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go thurgardin /kael /skyshrine MQ's, depending on your faction.<br />
<br />
there is no iksar warrior cultural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jemort</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're an iksar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taggen of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hey cmon whats wrong with iksar? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Race means nothing in the end except for matters of frontal stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaziganthi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for one, do not waste time on champ armor. as an iksar, its crap. Your hate armor is almost on par with thurg. Yes thurg has more ac blah blah blah, but at 51, I had better ac and stats with my hate armor over a level 60 ogre in full thurg (yes i had some other gear thats better than the non visible slots he had at the time) and this was a while ago. The best way for you to go gear wise, is hate, then either hot or kael. Its what i did :). I'm a 65 iksar warrior. One of only 3 on our server to get that high (ayonae ro) and the first to get epiced :) (about a year or so ago)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jemort</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was under the impresion that Iksars get a natural ac bonus, and with the same aa's an iksar will have a much higher regen rate.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaziganthi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They do, but not past 60, and the regen rate is all well and good at the lower levels, I've rarely relied on my self regen since 60. And about the frontal stun bit. Even that is negated with stalwart endurance. Sure, its not as surefire as not being able to be stunned from the front, but it makes other tanks as desirable as ogres. Once you get the aa's and higher end gear for an iksar, we can be really top notch :) (hell any race can be).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes, iksars have cultural...it's just it's made for shammies, not a warrior.<br />
