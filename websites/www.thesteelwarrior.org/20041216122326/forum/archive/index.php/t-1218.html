Race help, Im open to all races! Stats, what stats to look for. Gear, the ever lasting gear question, Can anyone gimme so cheap twinkie ideas. no more then 1k pp plz. Quests are cool and Im up for them. Anything esle you can think of I would love to hear it! Thanks and if anyone can help me I would love it thanks and good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to the class that all others are measured against.<br />
<br />
Race: Does not matter, and I mean really does not matter. There are some benefits and negatives with every race but a warrior is gear dependent and race plays little importance. <br />
<br />
Stats: I would go all stamina but I know some ogres who wish they had put some starting points in agility as well. And with the aa's you can fix any base stat that you &quot;screw up&quot; at creation.<br />
<br />
Tips: Max out all of your weapon skills (1hs, 1hb, 2hs, 2hb and piercing). Don't let any skill fall too far behind. Keep invis potions on you. <br />
<br />
Play in dungeons! Learn how to pull in a crowd. Make your chanter work. You will be grouping your entire EQ life as a warrior, learn the strengths and weaknesses of every class in the game. <br />
<br />
Good luck to you, you will not find a finer group of players than those on this board.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rahwain</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a warrior you'll be in touch of the entire fight.  A lot of times you're pulling, others just tanking.  Quite often you'll find yourself directing the group based on your knowedge of their classes.  A good warrior can keep the group xping, without panicing everyone on every pull.  Get to learn join keyboard/mouse strafing, use 3rd party camera angles often, and get comfortable with them, learn how to position mobs where you want them, based on other melee in the group (is seldom you can rely on other people to understand mob positioning in pick up groups, especially pet classes).  <br />
<br />
Practice all of this when it's not needed and you'll be a better warrior when it is.<br />

oh and Vavid, definately listen to these guys, I found this board way to late in my warrior carreer they help you a lot, and explain everything in a way a true warrior can understand it</div></div><hr />

The faction is supposed to hurt but I never noticed anything drastic when I was lower level. The upside is your cultural armor is quite impressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I were to re-roll (currently agnostic barbarian lvl 65) I'd go ogre rallos zek. Why?<br />
<br />
1) Ogres have better vision<br />
2) Can't be stunned from the front<br />
3) Best starting stats for a tank, high str/sta<br />
4) Can load up on RZ armor...some of the best droppable in the game<br />
5) Cause KoS means nothing now, can train, buy, etc all your stuff in SH, PoK, bazaar...<br />
6) Tradeskills? I wouldn't with warrior...much cheaper to make an alt with maxxed int or wis. Sure they can smith using their str, but still early on you won't have str maxxed.<br />
<br />
I'd invest in shrinker, either cobalt bracer or tinkerer made, being big can suck at times.<br />
<br />
Race and starting stats makes the biggest difference early on the our careers...later in life you'll find your important stats are all maxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some general cheap twink items, would be a pair (mebbe one, but for sure ditch the serpentine bracer for something with more then 1 AC) of crustacean shell bracers (100p), the greaves (150P) and boots (150p) are good too, I would recommend a coterie general cape (50p) for back, Chitenous belt (200p) for waist. <br />
<br />
Arms, CHEAP you can get lightcrawler Vambraces (40p) but these are only 11AC, 4DEX so statwise, not that great. Breastplate, look for the highest AC you can reasonably afford. I went statwise at first and I really think I couldve done better with a higher AC. I started with Beer Stained coldain tunic, and recently changed to Ry'gorr, but I still feel like I need better, basically holding out for Champion's for now (Thurgardin BP)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope some of this info has helped.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I totally agree with what was posted about halflings. I have never leveled so fast. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where to put your starting points depends entirely on what race you pick.  If ogre, put most of your points into dex/agi, 'cause your already beefy enough, and you cant raise any stat beyond 150 at creation.  If you're a high dex/agi race, put points in sta, and maybe str, dex, agi, depending on where they are. And never forget large races get racial slam. :)   Personally I'd go either large race or Iksar for the racial benefits. (and I cant stand being small 'cause I cant see over anyone)  For twink gear, a good mix of crafted/crusty (get pieces with best stats of each), and there's so many good, cheap weapons out there I can't even begin. Get something for each weapon skill that has a good ratio, look at some of the gear posts in other threads on this board, and buy or camp accordingly.  Oh, and get ready to learn how to play everyone else's class, and manage everyone else's aggro, 'cause you're gonna have to coach people on it constantly.<br />
<br />
Beo<br />
<br />
And if you're barbarian worship Tribunal or RZ (some tribunal pieces are better than RZ, but rarer too), any other race, worship RZ if you can.</div></div><hr />

HALFLINGS FOREVER  <br />
<br />
AFAIK there is no longer any class xp bonus/penalty in EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Previn</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, they removed class Penalties, racial penalties/bonuses are still VERY MUCH in game.<br />
<br />
Also, they did not touch the Rogue and Warrior exp Bonus, they only removed the Hybrid xp penalty.  I play both a rogue and a warrior, and on a kill to kill basis I make more exp than others in the group, halfling being my rogue.  If I remember right the warriors get a 10% bonus and rogues get a 5% bonus.  I know I level up from an empty exp bar faster than my human monk friend, fighting in the same group. :)  Which is kinda nice, considering rogues and warriors are shackled to a group while other classes (cept clerics from what i've seen) have some respectable form of soloing for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They actually didn't remove the penalty.<br />
<br />
What has been reported by the people over at ShowEQ (which I don't USE, they just are good for getting the skinny on stuff) is that the penalties are still in game. What the server does though is artificially inflates the amount of xp that is given to each player after it is split to match the amount needed to compensate for the penalty.<br />
<br />
For example, it takes a Human SK 140% the amount of xp that it takes a Human Monk. So if a Human Monk and a Human SK are grouped and kill somethine worth 100 xp, the xp is split (leaving group modifier off for simplicity) 50-50. Since the Monk has no penalty, he gets 50xp towards his level. Since the SK needs more to level (the penalty spoken of before) He used to still just get the 50xp, now he gets 50 * 140% = 70 xp. This may seem unfair, but it just means that class no longer makes you level slower. Race however, still does. <br />
<br />
Now, on the other hand, you would think that since the Hybrids and others got their penalties removed, they would remove the warrior and rogues bonus... not so it seems.<br />
<br />
Logically since the warrior needs 95% the xp to level as a baseline xp class (monk) They should reduce the xp that a warrior gets by 95% or on the same 50-50 split, the SK would get 70 and the warrior would get 47.5. This however is not the case, and Warriors still get the full 50. This combined with a Halfling Racial bonus (another 5%) Makes Halfling Warriors level very fast.<br />
<br />
Hope that wasn't too much all at once. Any questions, just let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Race:<br />
Halflings level fastest, and can worship Rallos Zek (some of the best cultural armor is RZ, only comparable is Tribunal).  Problem though, is that you're an assling =\<br />
Dwarves are the best looking race, and have good starting stats.  Biggest problem, keeping the women off you.  And no RZ.<br />
Wood elves can also worship RZ (but dorfs will kill you), but low str / sta and you will be asked for ports / sow / if you're a ranger all your career (doesn't matter if you're in full plate, two swords, word marshall or veteran in front of your name, not /role or anon, you will still be asked for ports).<br />
Ogres can worship RZ, high str / sta, but are large which can be annoying in dungeons (cobalt can't be clicked til 45 or 46, other shrink items have to be recharged).  Also get frontal stun immunity (nice, but not huge), and slam (somewhat better than kick and stuns since lvl 1, instead of 55 like kick).<br />
Trolls are a lot like ogres, but without the frontal stun immunity.  Have upped regen though.<br />
Iksar have the regen, and an ac bonus, but can't wear certain plate items (won't be a big deal in the end, but earlier on it can hurt).<br />
Barbarian has slam, good str / sta, can worship RZ, but is a good race.  Large size and no night vision though.<br />
Dark elves are a lot like wood elves, but evil.  No problems with people thinking you're a druid though.<br />
Half elves, see wood elves.<br />
Vah Shir are large, but don't get slam.  Will be considered a pl'd twink by many simply by being vah shir (which shouldn't be the case anymore, but I still see people who think that often)<br />
Frogloks I don't know much about, but some of their newbie quest items are very nice.  Good race, not a bad decision.<br />
<br />
As for other advice.  Learn everything you can about every class.  As a warrior, knowledge is a huge bonus.  Know which spells are high aggro, who uses them, when and why they use them.  Watch for who is casting, when they are casting, what the spell says when it lands.  Since I don't have particles on, it's good to know what spells sound like what (so you know when to try to stun the mob so it can't get off gate, heal, debuff on you, etc).  Imo, a good warrior can play any other class well, simply because they watch for all these things, and learn all they can.<br />
<br />
Hps are huge, as is AC.  The RNG (random number generator) is your god, pray to it often =p.<br />
<br />
Donnel's advice for equipment is very nice, I'd listen to what he suggested.  Make sure all your skills are high (even 2hb), except hand to hand, don't have to worry about that one.<br />
<br />
At newbie creation, try to have stamina over 100 as a minimum.  Under 100 and you lose stats when your stamina bar runs low.  Agi should be at 75 minimum, other than that it's not really important.  Str is not a big deal, it comes easily later on.  Dex is somewhat helpful, but not too important either.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you need more help, simply ask.  People here are very helpful.</div></div><hr />
