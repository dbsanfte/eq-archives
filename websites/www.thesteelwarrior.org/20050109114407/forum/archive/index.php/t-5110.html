<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard 2nd hand recently, guildie talked to a member of a top guild when he was in BoT the other day, that top end players are still taking out tower bosses with 3 people like charmers were before it was nerfed.  Or maybe charm is still the way it's done and i just don't know it?  <br />
<br />
&lt;rant on&gt;<br />
Anyway, flame me for being jealous or whatever if you want, but if true this is complete and utter BS.  You should absolutely no way in hell be able to walk in there with 3 people and take out these mobs.  I don't care how you do it or how uber you are or think you are.  It shouldn't be viable.  Period.  End of story.  The rewards are too good to justify it.  If you're &quot;uber&quot;, then maybe you're handing those rewards to your twink or selling them in the bazaar.  Whatever.  It shouldn't be doable.  I suspect charm is involved in which case having 3 Time geared people or some such isn't even necessary.  You just have to be the right freaking class and SCORE!  You win!  'grats on choosing the correct class for getting phat lewtz with as little effort as possible!  If this is still remotely viable just by having a damn charmer around, that spell needs to be nerfed all to hell and back or mobs anyways near this type of encounter simply made immune to it.  But it shouldn't be viable with 3 at all.  Ever.  It makes it far, far too easy to take content that mid range guilds could really use and actually have some challenge in getting.  They can't if 3 people go gank it for the loot.  That's Sony's fault for poor design.  And charm? hah... Sony was smoking some bad crack when they put the PoP charms in, that's all I can say.  Uhh... yeah, one charmer should be able to do as much DPS as 2 to 3 full groups.  That makes sense!<br />
&lt;rant off&gt;<br />
<br />
so what 's going on here?</div></div><hr />

It was kinda funny in a way because someone spent an hour or so getting a raid force together, only to find 2 toons taking out the boss when they got there.:p   (I was only xping...so I was listening to the OOC's, but wasn't directly involved)<br />
<br />
One was a chanter (charming) and I can't remember the other class...cleric??<br />
<br />
Charming is incredibly powerful.  I was in a BoT grp a week ago and our mage decided to charm and buff a regular elemental in US.  I parsed it at between 600 and 700 dps on average.  It was unreal.  We cleared US, MSL, and MSR with no problem (the zone wasn't very full, so those camps were open anyway.)  At one point the puller brought back 2 named and a regular mob...no problem.  The grouped handled one named until the pet took care of the other named and the add...then helped us on the last named.  Woulda been interesting if we could have gotten our chanter to charm also...;)   (we didn't because we didn't want to risk both breaking charm at the same time)  By the way, we kept going for an hour plus with the charmed pet...just gotta be careful and redo snare and charm every now and then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see the tower lords being done with that few, or at least Eindride.  Eindride's dps is spikey, but one cleric can actually heal a decently equipped MT for him.  Warrior tank, cleric heal, enchanter petting.  They have a lot of hit points, but honestly, they're not that hard.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way though.  They're on a 6 hour respawn.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That I would have to see proof of... I find it highly unlikely that a warrior/cleric could duo a tower boss.<br />
<br />
As for the charms, yeah, the above posts are just proving to me that charm is still WAY, WAY.... WAY overpowered.  I don't care how risky people say it is.  The fact is you can still do it and apparently even keep a group going for over an hour while doing it and get the incredible benefits of 600+ dps from one character.  That's wrong.  It's always been wrong.  I don't give a crap how &quot;skilled&quot; the player claims to be who's doing it.  That kind of dps from one character should be absolutely impossible.  Period.  I thought with the resist nerfs on it that they fixed that problem.  Apparently that's not the case.  Why Sony allows such crap to exist in the game, I don't know.  Why the hell haven't they prevented something so clearly unbalanced?  To keep a few people happy who are reaping massive benefits from it?  That's stupid.  <br />
<br />
If they're using charm, this isn't an uber guild envy thing.  Those charmers don't have to be uber guilders.  They don't even have to be as well equipped as I am, which isn't very, or even have as many AA or whatever.  They just have to be the right class and pick out a few AA skills that help their charm.  And boom... you win.  You can now do with 2-3 people what it takes other people at your level and gear 3 full groups to do.  Enjoy farming your phat lewtz, courtesy of Sony's utter lack of ability to balance anything well.</div></div><hr />

Man you'd be done in 15 minutes, just need 4 enchs, 1 cleric 1 war.  And you're good.</div></div><hr />

Charm breaks, and breaks often ( max duration is about 8 minutes for enchanters ). Where the uber gear comes in is having enough hp, ac, defensive AAs to survive the mob turning on them unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
Running a hard ldon group with 4 charmed pets would be stupid - the benefits increase linearly, the dangers increase exponentially. For example in a group with 1 healer if 2 pets break at once in combat it becomes almost a certainty that one enchanter will die.</div></div><hr />

I was stupid enough to tank one once in BoT when charm broke and things went to hell.  I lasted about 5 seconds.  There is alot of risk for people who charm...folks are only focusing on the up side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's dps after hasting and give them pet toys (haste muzzle and procing swords.)  Also, the one time I parsed it, I didn't parse it for hundreds of fights...probably only 20 or 30.  So, it wasn't enough data to make absolute statements...I was just amazed at the damage I did see.  If I remember correctly, the low dps was around 450 and the high was a little over 800.  (but, yep...that's dps...and it was incredible)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that it is just not good to have 3 people killing Tower Bosses, something should be tweaked just a little to make that not able to happen. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, there will always be players trying to become better and do things in a Game that makes people say, &quot;Whoa, I didn't think that could be done.&quot;(Sleeper anyone?) <br />
<br />
So basically, you just have to hope, that those that *CAN* do things like that, hopefully aren't very inclined to do such things, and are ocupied with more advanced zones and such.<br />
<br />
As far as the charm issue? I was always under the impression, that if a Chaming class, is trying to move in on a group or raid's named mob or such, then a simple Annul Magic once or twice on the charmed mob, is enough to make the Mage/Enchanter have a very, very bad day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the risk is what exactly?  They die, wait 15 mins for their corpse at GY, get a 96% res, then try again.  That's not risk.  There used to be risk in EQ, before corpse summonings, before graveyards, when you went deep into a dungeon or plane and the only way to get your corpse was to fight to it.  Risk is a multi hour CR with multiple corpses that are older than the rez timer.<br />
<br />
The reality is when people can do such things as kill tower bosses with 2 or 3 people they will.  In my opinion though, this is ok, because if 2 or 3 uber players can do it then a single group of well equipped players can do it.  Thus, single groups can get very nice loot.  But let's be realistic, the loot of BoT tower bosses is good, but it's not anywhere near great or unreal.<br />
<br />
But I really think that if there are two or three people killing a tower boss and a lower level raid wants that boss, that there should be an alternative for them.  There should be something else up they can do.  Problem is that sometimes there just isn't anything else up.  I think there should be more named mobs with more nice loot, but in most cases it should all be no drop.  Having no drop gear will help keep the 2 boxers away as there's a good chance the drops will not even be useable by them, and certainly they won't be sellable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And for an enchanter that has spell haste (from buff and item) the danger is not as bad as you would think, even more so if you have the LDoN AoE stun. Will stun up to lvl65 mobs. And with spell haste, you can re-charm even before the stun wears off the mob.<br />
<br />
Toss in rune and if needed AA rune, and the ench may not even need a heal on a charm break that gets to him.<br />

I am just happy the tower bosses are on a 6 hour timer. I remember hitting them twice in one day :)</div></div><hr />

1.  This is not specfic to pet classes; it impacts the whole game (there is no real risk anymore) and I agree with you.  My point was that there was a downside to charming.<br />
<br />
2.  I started playing eq with this char in March 99.  I don't need you to elaborate to me how dangerous the game used to be.  I remember sweating getting a body out of the old CT before there were Necro summons (hell I remember before people actually used resses).  The game was alot different back then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no one should have this kind of power.<br />
<br />
I don't think even ubers SHOULD be able to take out something like a bot tower boss with 2 or 3 people, regardless of class.  Design the encounter in some way to make that too hard.  It can be done without making it impossible for several groups of a mid range guild to kill.  <br />
<br />
I've seen no proof of a war/clr 2 boxing a tower boss.  I'm not saying it didn't happen, but it still seems highly improbable.  IF it happened, they were Time geared at least.  As I said before, you don't have to be Time geared to pull it off with a charmer and a couple other people.  You just have to have picked the right class.  'grats on your class choice.  Enjoy your loot.  You also have to get lucky with the charm breaks.  If it breaks at the wrong time, you're probably dead.  Oh well, the reward is well worth it.  <br />
<br />
As far as risk goes, get real.  So there's a risk of charm breaking and you dying.  Big deal.  The possible gains far outweigh the minimal risk of eating some extra deaths.  It's risk versus reward (reward being both loot and exp) and in the case of charming, even after the MR nerfs to the spells, some areas still have a reward possible that's far more worth it than any other class combo can hope to obtain without a charmer.  Other abilities still don't even remotely approach the power of charm.  Face it, they ramped up the dps of mobs like mad starting with PoP and this grossly imbalanced the charm line.  Sony tried to fix it somewhat, but it's still ridiculously powerful.  A friend was telling me about his LDoN Hard group the other day.  They were struggling but ultimately they pulled it out because of... you guessed it, charm.  The chanter kept charming mobs that hit for 900s.  That was the only reason they had any chance of making up time lost to assorted screwups.  It let them make a huge amount of time by having insane dps.  <br />
<br />
AA skill proposal to help balance warriors with enchanter charm ability:  <br />
<br />
Skill: Pwnage -- a warrior's hit points are tripled (still no ways near charmed pet hit points in BoT, but warrior mitigates better) and his fully hasted DPS is set to 700.  The bad side?  Forget this crap like mez breaking where you might have some hope of surviving it.  Nope.  Every tick the warrior has a 2% chance of having a heart attack and dying.  This chance can be reduced to 1% per tick by maxing out the AA skill &quot;Total Pwnage&quot;.  I'm feeling so generous I'll make it a suicide skill.  At the end of 8 minutes, if the warrior is still alive, the warrior will immediately have a heart attack and die.  <br />
<br />
Maybe we can work something in there about the warrior going insane before the heart attack and trying to tear up the chanters and healers for a bit, so you have to try to mez him or park him.  Play with the numbers some.  That's just a rough estimate.  I can assure you that even with guaranteed death as described this would still be a hugely popular skill.  :p</div></div><hr />

It is simply unbalanced and unacceptable that any encounter may become trivial for anyone, ever. If a druid can solo orc1 using what some might call an EXPLOIT, then the charm line of spells needs serious evaluation. Consider the warrior that can't solo orc1, and all of the splintering clubs and rusty spears that are being denied to him by this ridiculously powerful line of spells. What's worse, is that the druid is very likely destroying EACH AND EVERY CLOTH VEIL THAT DROPS. Something has to be done about the fact that certain classes under certain circumstances may have clear advantages over another class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To charm kill takes quite a bit of skill and luck mabey a tower boss could be killed by a charmed pet but I would bet the chance of it being successfull are very slim, with charms duration and chance to break on BoT mobs (all but elementals) your insane if you charm kill in bot.</div></div><hr />

A chanter prolly just need luck to pull it off. Say 250k hp and a 1000dps pet he just need to keep the pet alive for about 4 minutes with no charm breaks.<br />
<br />
As for ''risk' and charming. Let me think, a chanter/cleric 2  box plows through tacics at least twice as fast as a normal xp group and since it's about 2 box and up the risk can't be losing xp.<br />
If something can be 'overpowered' a charming chanter would qualify under that imho but without charm chanter would be a quite boring class I guess.</div></div><hr />

Bah I got a Wizzy friend and this week he has been soloing in Fear... Whats the best crit a wizzy can get uh?</div></div><hr />

If the 300k number is accurate than it would take a top-geared warrior (who got buffed before they left) maybe 25 minutes to kill him, so the cleric would have to be healing at a rate that they could sustain more or less indefinitely.  I don't really know what kind of dps that dude would do on a time-geared tank or how fast a time-geared cleric can heal without draining their mana, but it doesn't sound totally impossible to me.</div></div><hr />

I killed him with my box cleric and myself.  If you think this is about a choice I made at the charater creation screen over 4 years ago your very mistaken.  <br />
<br />
My cleric (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=225297) and myself (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=132256) have spent a HUGE amount of time working on this.  How do you know little effort was involved?<br />
<br />
Just try to get to his room with just a warrior and a cleric, that in itself is very hard.  Killing Eindride Icestorm is a son of a bitch.  I went through 7 disc cycles and have had to make quite a few other adjustments to pull this off with 1 person and 2 characters.  Their were no enchanters or anyone else present.<br />
<br />
While I can simpathize with you about taking lower guild raid targets lets remind ourselves that it is a 6 hour spawn.  I'd bet he is up more often then he is down on most servers.  Their are targets that are up 24/7 on almost all servers that drop nearly the same loot(Tagrin Maldric).  Going to take you a while to figure that one out but it is one groupable, I have done it.<br />
<br />
Insted of complaining on TSW message board go find a target. get a cleric or two togather and go kill stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a huge rant going on about this on the Prexus boards right now, both BoT tower bosses and &quot;bottom feeding&quot; in general (each have their own thread, the latter being up to 20 pages at this point).<br />
<br />
Tower bosses can indeed be done with 2 or 3 people, and in fact in many ways it's easier to do with a much smaller force as it's easier to sneak your way up with less people. AoW, Tormax, Klandicar and many or the old world mobs that have droppable, high plat, loot are being killed almost as quickly as they come up, and the lower powered guilds are complaining rather vociferously.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is, everyone has the same right to these mobs, and there isn't a helluva lot for a time enabled guild, who clears time in one evening, to do with the other 5-6 days before they can go back in and do it again.  There's also the issue that servers like Prexus are maturing, and a much larger percentage of the population's mains are at 65 with quite a few AA's. For those who are in guilds that do not have the personnel or the guild culture to raid 4 to 6 nights a week, they are less further along in PoP content because that type of content takes committment to get it done. It doesn't make their gameplay any less valid, or them any less accomplished than &quot;raiding&quot; guilds, but it does put them behind the 8 ball. Things will continue to get worse on this until some more content comes out. Once it does, this content needs to have either a ton of difficult high end mobs, or, as much as I hate to say it, some time sinks that slow down the high end guilds so that they don't conquer everything and start hitting the old content again in a couple of months. This is going to be difficult with instanced high level content. Right now, you have quite a few servers with multiple guilds on exactly the same level...nearly totally equipped with time gear...and multiple guilds not far behind. This is somewhat unique in that alot more guilds will be starting off on equal footing now, and with instances, they won't be getting in each other's way. So they are likely to stay pretty much neck and neck. Meaning things are likely to be conquered more quickly than in the past unless they do indeed put time sinks of some sort in the way. Flagging, for instance, was a serious bitch. It caused a helluva lot of strife in mid level guilds as the more focused characters quickly got into areas out of reach of the more casual player, but by the same token, it let there be some seperation between guilds getting into Time, and slowed things down.<br />
 <br />
Now personally, I like instancing as I really don't like to have to participate in the grief play that always comes about when you need to block content to make sure you can progress at your own pace, but in terms of keeping the devs from having to come out with whole new expansions every 2 months, instanced play isn't a great idea. But it sucks having a flame fest with people from a rival guild that your membership has alot of friends with and the bad feelings that always stirs up.<br />
<br />
I do sympathise with the lower end guilds. It wasn't that long ago that I was a member of one, looking up at the 2 or 3 high end guilds on our server, and getting pretty pissed that I had nothing to raid because they were busy filling thier coffers with plat because they were bored (or in the instance of one of them, paying their guild leader's rent). But at the risk of sounding mean, thems the breaks...trite as it is, we pay our 12 bucks a month too, and want something fun to do. Noone is more worthy than anyone else, but the more focused, raid oriented players are always going to have the edge over the casual player.<br />

I dont follow your logic in this... You say that you want to progress at your leasure, but you are against instanced content beacuse people kill some old content mobs that isnt instanced and blocking your progress...<br />
<br />
Forget about Kael nameds since they are really easy to get to now days and drop sellable loot meaning that they will be killed as soon as they are up no matter what one does. Well untill that gear will become &quot;shitty&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesnt happen, even with dual weild and a muzzle, plus attack buffs. I never see it.<br />
<br />
Now, to get max DPS you have to use a giant instead of an elemental, which means you either get a caster, or one that summons. The casters DPS drops some, and they have much higher magic resistance then an elemental.<br />
<br />
If you use the elemental (which sometimes are simply not present) you might manage 400 DPS under real ideal circumstances (say you grab a muzzle from a friend) but you have no avatar or anything else to help, so 400 DPS is prolly gonna be a wet dream against Eindride (and if you want to argue, post some parses, cause I can post mine too if you like).<br />
<br />
Lets say 250,000 damage you need to do, and of course no uber damage shield on pet, and not a very good chance of seeing cleric reverse DS landing. Thats 10 and a half minutes to kill him. This of course means you somehow manage to survive one charm break, which I guess is doable, but we are talking some way uber chanters and cleric teams here now.<br />
<br />
Can it be done? Sure. And people can survive 30,000 foot freefall. Good for them.<br />

<br />
They just need more similar level, difficulty mobs, with similar quality loot.  More instanced content that has similar difficulty and quality of loot.  It is oftentimes extremely difficult for the more casual guilds to even find a target nowadays.  It sounds like the uber guilds also don't have enough challenging targets as well otherwise they wouldn't be doing lower end content.  The amount of players, especially high levels, just continues to grow and grow.  We need more content.  Not just expansions with a measly 20 zones, they need to have like 50 zones or 100.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree 100% too. People that complain about uber guild people killing lower level targets need to get off their asses and do something about it. There are so many targets out there there is always something on Norrath to be killed.<br />
<br />
BoT towers every 6 hours<br />
Phinny can be solo'd by many classes, lots of epic drops<br />
Kunark dragons every 3 days<br />
Make the flute or what ever the hell it is you hand to the UBD to spawn epic Trak. You get it back and can reuse it I think every 24 hrs.<br />
WW and other CoV dragons<br />
ST is usually empty on my server<br />
VP is usually empty on any server<br />
Dain is up often and can be triggered<br />
Coldain war can be triggered<br />
Velk every 3 days<br />
Vindi every 8 hours<br />
THO up all the time as is Grieg<br />
IV and Shei up a lot<br />
Umbral named up every 3 days<br />
Paffa<br />
Xenamech<br />
2 triggered events in PoN<br />
Gnome walk in CT<br />
Ring of Slime/Fear in CT<br />
<br />
Those are just the ones off the top of my head, the list goes on and on and on. Anyone who is motivated to kill named can track kill times and be there for the next kill. With the amount of good tradeable gear available, there are tons of targets available to even the most family oriented casual player guild.<br />
<br />
I for one miss racing to targets and the competition before instanced zones. That was half the fun! I guess it's all part of the dumbing down of EQ.</div></div><hr />

Congratulations that ranks up there with one of the more impressive feats I have heard of - my estimation of his DPS was around 230 DPS or so and I did not think a cleric could heal against him indefently.<br />
<br />
Did you use any faction tricks to aggro elementals on him, or just CH + warrior beatdown?<br />
<br />
The other thing about bottom feeding - while you might have a point about mobs like Tormax, Zlandicar being taken over for twinks/bazaar loot, BoT tower bosses are 6 hour spawns, nobody could 'hog' those even if they wanted too, unless they dedicated themselves full time to killing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutall, assuming you pulled it off, and I still don't see how it's even mathematically possible with only a warrior and a cleric, even Time geared, you're still one person on one server.  You don't see other people doing it.  It's too damn hard.  But you know as well as I do that far, far more 3 person combos with charmers do that kind of thing and they don't even have to be uber geared.  It's so much easier for them.  They picked a certain class with a certain stupidly overpowered ability, took the time to learn how to use it, and 'grats, the &quot;phat lewtz&quot; flow into their coffers.  It's either impossible or at least exponentially harder for any non-charm class to pull off a feat like that.  There's really no comparison at all.<br />
<br />
I guess what it comes down to, besides the fact that charm is stupidly overpowered still, is why the @#$@# is there droppable loot here?  Why the @#$# is there droppable loot on AoW, statue, king tormax, etc.?  Hell, my guild would love to actually be able to progress through Kael content.  We could actually get some useful loot to us off of it.  But nope, that stuff gets ganked right after it comes up by small parties that are way overpowered for that content and just want twink or bazaar loot.  The &quot;my dollar is as good as your dollar and i did nothing wrong&quot; argument from the high end players is all fine and dandy.... though it's still kind of bad form IMO if whole raids want content trivial to you and they can never get it because you're busy 1 grouping it for bazaar loots right after it pops.  But yeah, the real problem is with the game design.  The BoT tower bosses can drop ornate molds that sell for 300k or so.  Farm time.  At least they spawn a lot.  Those old Kael mobs only come up every few days and they drop bazaar crap.  Forget doing that great old guild accomplishment of killing the AoW.  Ubers just ganked it to sell the BoC in the bazaar.  :p  Make all of that crap NO DROP.  Then they'll only kill the mob if they're still really, really bored or they're outfitting twinks.  Hmm... guess we still may never see it up.  <br />
<br />
As far as high end content, why didn't they at least make better use of the Hard LDoN zones?  A lot of uber raid guilds don't have an organized raid every single night.  So it's probably the off nights where those people are looking for something to do in smaller parties and tear through old content.    Give them something better to do in small groups.  Put in time sink, progressive quests using, for instance, only drops from Hard LDoN adventures that can eventually be turned in for a piece of  truly valuable equipment.  Now the ubers spend more time doing Hard adventures instead of slaughtering some 3 year old boss mob.  Put in adventure merchants with better loot that can only be purchased with points off of Hard adventures.  LDoN adventure points are basically a huge time sink, but most of the loot isn't something the Elemental/Time geared player wants.  So offer stuff that makes it a good time sink for them too.</div></div><hr />

Huh? No...that's not what I said. I said I liked instanced content because I don't have to deal with the political bullshit that goes along with multiple guilds at the same power level attempting the same content. I don't find there to be any skill in being the guild that can get more people with no life together early in the morning during a weekday to take down gateway content.<br />
<br />
The downside to instanced content is that there is nothing to slow down the more active and talented raiding guilds. Which means they finish it quickly, putting you back into the situation where they are doing old content out of bordem or to just make scads of plat.<br />
<br />
Noone is blocking my guilds progress. I just prefer to not have the kind of grief play that nearly always ensues when you have to compete with an evenly matched guild.<br />
<br />
As far as high end content, why didn't they at least make better use of the Hard LDoN zones? '<br />
<br />
LDoN was poorly thought out. Causing guilds to ramp up to a capability of 72 person raids in order to beat time, and then stupidly cutting the max raid size for LDoN raids to 36. People tend to get a little pissed if you award DKP to people on a raid they can't go on even if they show up at the right time. <br />

Sorry no chanters charming elementals in to BoT tower bosses is not the chanter that is enabling the kill, it is mostly the warrior and cleric with good mitigation and effective mana usage through AA's and focus effects.<br />
<br />
Charm as it stands now for viability is around 50/50. And yes I know that all you can be out is the 4% that rez don’t cover (same as raids) but you are also out time more importantly, all total your likely out an 1.5-2 hours or so with a getting buffs most of an attempt death and waiting on corpse to pop rez then medding. In that time the same duo could go to Sol Ro start killing the loot mobs right away and likely get 100-200k in ornate they can sell with an almost 100% chance of success unlike killing a wing boss at around 10-20% chance of success or so (I would guess) means that the pay out per attempt and hence pp / hour is way better not killing it.<br />
<br />
It appears you have no idea how hard charm killing is and have not witnessed its lackluster performance first hand. You seemingly had one experience with someone killing a mob and now want your shot at mobs free and clear unlike those that came before you that had to put there time in competing for mobs. The truth is that most of the old world mobs are up a lot longer then when they were the raid content, there a lot of viable mobs that are almost guaranteed to be up that you don’t kill because you want the PoP &quot;phat lewtz&quot; yourself with out putting in the time to track when a 6 hour pop is up.<br />
<br />
If you don't get there in time it is your fault for not mobilizing fast enough not there’s for killing an unoccupied mob that may not be killed for days.</div></div><hr />

Some time in the next few weeks I am going to try this:<br />

2 people.<br />
4 characters.<br />
<br />
War-Clr Combo, 6k unbuffed war w/ all defensive AA. Clr with only FT3 and a horse.<br />
<br />
Ench-Druid Combo, Chanter has VoQ, but no Charm AA's. Both characters are low-AA.<br />
<br />
Getting to Einride is going to be challenging, but I'll get it eventually.<br />
<br />
Start out with a rot on tank, and see how it goes. Once slowed, I think 1 cleric can keep me alive.<br />

As it goes, if it looks like the cleric just won't have the mana, I'm goin to snare and charm a nearby giant.<br />

so you're saying a charming duo can go to sol ro and make 100-200k in ornate in such a short time?  And how is that REMOTELY fair to any other class that oh yeah, isn't so stupidly overpowered by one ability and can't take 2 people to sol ro and rake in that kind of money anyways near that fast if they can do anything worth doing in sol ro at all?  <br />
<br />
It appears you have no idea how hard charm killing is and have not witnessed its lackluster performance first hand.<br />
<br />
no, I'd probably take a 20% chance to kill a tower boss with just 2 characters.  Though I bet with practice the odds can get better than that.  Maybe someone in Plane of Time wouldn't, but some people who aren't sure would.  And you don't need the highest end gear to do it with a charmer.  People that whine about how risky charm is don't seem to understand how insane the rewards can be when you do succeed.  It's more than worth the deaths.<br />
<br />
The truth is that most of the old world mobs are up a lot longer then when they were the raid content, there a lot of viable mobs that are almost guaranteed to be up that you don’t kill because you want the PoP &quot;phat lewtz&quot; yourself with out putting in the time to track when a 6 hour pop is up.<br />
<br />
The TRUTH is that one skill, charm, continues to make certain classes stupidly overpowered.  Yes, it's a craps shoot in that it could fail and you die.  But the rewards are far more than worth that risk.  It looks like the main source of farmed tower boss loot has always been from charmers, whether before or after the charm nerf.  It just happened even more before.  It still happens and it's still retarded as hell.  Obviously it's exponentially easier to do with charm than with any other 2-3 person group.<br />
<br />
Ever try tradeskilling? Quite the large plat sink. Ornate BP can still be useful for the clicky if you exp often without a shaman. There's also the challenge of actually doing it.<br />
<br />
regardless, it shouldn't be doable with 2-3 people.  that's crap game design and mostly due to one skill.  On an unrelated note, one ornate bp can sell for about 300k.  You're PLing your tradeskills the quick but most expensive way if you're spending that kind of plat on it. :p</div></div><hr />

I'll take a good bard before a enchanter pet any day of the week.  Me too. The only thing the chanter pet does is shorten the fight. A good bard not only shortens the fight, he can get you there with much less trouble. Bards also give your team much more endurance to last longer fights when DPS is lower. Bards also don't turn on your group and slaughter them after 8 minutes. In the 100s od BoT tower named kills I have been on (farmed with some friends every night for a couple months) we have never once used charmed pets to get kills. It is just not worth the possibility of a wipe due to a hasted giant getting lose. Slower and safer is better than dead.</div></div><hr />

And how is that REMOTELY fair to any other class that oh yeah, isn't so stupidly overpowered by one ability and can't take 2 people to sol ro and rake in that kind of money anyways near that fast if they can do anything worth doing in sol ro at all?Before they put in the summoning mobs, I used to quad kite mobs in Sol Ro for ornate. Why bother with 2 people when you can do it solo? There have always been places that charming, kiting, fearing, &lt;insert situational skill here&gt; classes have had an advantage in getting loot/experience.</div></div><hr />

My mistake I meant trio (the duo was war / cleric) something that you may not know is that charming a summoning mob is very deadly and in Sol Ro they summon. Further more I did not say they would be charm killing in Sol Ro, they would actually be killing in the normal way. The only zones that charm is very viable are HoH and Tactics and even there it is not safe with all the casting mobs that can dispel, snare and dot.<br />

“no, I'd probably take a 20% chance to kill a tower boss with just 2 characters. Though I bet with practice the odds can get better than that.”<br />
<br />
How does one practice having charm not break? You don’t! Do you realize that means you will likely need to try 3-4 times at 2 hours an attempt? Round about 6-8 hours in you would likely give up having wasted all that time. Woot charm is great, er no wait no it’s not! Every time you double the number of pets you quadruple the chance to fail. <br />

“The TRUTH is that one skill, charm, continues to make certain classes stupidly overpowered. Yes, it's a craps shoot in that it could fail and you die. But the rewards are far more than worth that risk. It looks like the main source of farmed tower boss loot has always been from charmers, whether before or after the charm nerf. It just happened even more before. It still happens and it's still retarded as hell. Obviously it's exponentially easier to do with charm than with any other 2-3 person group.”<br />

You sir are talking out your ass, at the start you stated: “I suspect charm is involved” you did not know, you had no proof you simply suspected it and then made up wild flagrant claims as to another classes ability to do something knowing no more than they should not be able to do “this” because you can not.<br />
<br />
You have ignored repeated attempts by people to tell you that would not be likely in the scale you are suspecting and that the class you claim is slighted is in fact the one most able to trio tower bosses. <br />
<br />
If you think it is so easy go and get your self a chanter friend to charm kill in BoT with a Kriger or other high damage mob, it need not be in a tower you could do it near the zone in, that way it will be easier to get your corpses.</div></div><hr />
