<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, been wracking my brain thinking about this one.  I keep comming up with the defenders light blade as a decent option for my off hand for under 10k.  Though the Fleshgrinder camp (yay! =/ ) seems appealing as another option.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for something that I can use on higher AC mobs where DWing ends up out damaging 2h.  Since my attack very rarely gets over 1400, I'm thinking more hits will lead to more damage on a higher AC mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually on a high AC mob, alot of time the 2h dmg bonus is where the better damage comes from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're looking at something as slow as the defender's lightblade, might as well consider ye ole Long Sword of Ethereal Energy as well.<br />
<br />
Also, Sabretooth from Jaggedpine ain't too shabby offhand, for your cheap, easy to get, SLOWER weapons.<br />
<br />
Club of the Ice Ocean too.<br />
<br />
Gah, I just peeped your profile ... I think your braided thingie would outdo the Lightblade. Let alone the other things I mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defender looks good on paper, but i wish i had spent the cash on something with a proc or hate increaser. does it put out dps? yep. enough to realy hold agro when a group member gets frisky? no.<br />
<br />
EDIT: gah, i did the same thing. defender is a step off a clif for you. if you want to crank out dps just put the 16 delay in main hand, and spiker in off. when you need to hold agro swap back. 100% haste on that thing would be like 8 delay would swing so fast you might spam yourself LD. applying your db every .8 seconds=PAIN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt you can get an upgrade on the corrupted strands of mana for less than 10k - 12(13)/16 and 15 AC are hard to upgrade in bazaar.<br />
If your guild is capable of downing cursed cycle you should wait out on bbote or if you can kill XtC, High Priest on a Hategiver or Blackout.<br />
<br />
I was wielding Ichorflow or tunare braid for a long time in offhand and was rather happy until i could get my blackout this week.<br />
<br />
Btw especially if you fight in Ssra a lot, you will still see lots of min damage (1...1....1...1) on boss mobs regardless of the damage of your offhander.<br />
I'd save my cash and check for possible armor upgrades instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno the prices on your server, but Disemboweler seems to put out good DPS. It is 12/20 with +3 magic damage. So on XP mobs it should be equivalent to a 15/20. Its not that hard to get depending on your guild strength. Drops from a named in PoN. You have to fight through the Goblin caves to get to him though =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Longsword of Freedom off Tawro in Umbral is a nice dps off-hander.  Tawro isn't terribly hard to kill either.  The ratio is good and being no drop it doesn't cost you anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean a good DPS off hander for when I'm not tanking!  Duh me!  I'd like something to put my CHSD away so not to be pulling agro.<br />
<br />
But if the 2h damage bonus from the windblade will still outdamage DW'ing, then I can happily save my money until I get a lucky LSoF from UP.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response folks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For high ac mobs especially, windblade should out damage your DW combo.  If you still want a non aggro offhand, like someone mentioned, a disemboweler is easy to get.  Drops off Vhaksiz the Shade in PoN, he's usually up, and is very easy (1200(?)ish, double, can't be slowed but doesn't hit fast anyway.. been a while though).  The only annoying part is getting to him, you have to clear through a bunch of gobs (not lullable), and go through mephits.  For the mephits, regular &quot;a mephit&quot; is lullable, and you can run right past, &quot;a misery mephit&quot; is not lullable, and is a wizard iirc.  Lulling saves you a lot of time, just make sure no one steps on the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korak Sarathai</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;good dps&quot; and &quot;offhander&quot; don't belong in the same sentence until dual wield is upgraded some.  In the situations where you want to do max damage, for each level of price or drop availability, from argent protectors to stonebladed axe of dismay, to windblade, to TSBS, to SEWS, 2handers are superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoodTheDorf</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should just use that Windblade if you are looking for dps imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your guild is capable of doing Glyphed Covered Serpent for Strands, and tink dragon for CHSD, why not just pick up kreizenn's flame from NToV if you're hell bent on 1 handers.. or even claws of lightning or windspeeder... honestly tho I'd recommend GSOS or TSBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevian</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">uh, 2h all the way for DPS.  Offhand and DPS don't belong in the same sentance anymore hehe :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Danke folks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want to do as much damage as you can? Taunt procs not a priority?<br />
<br />
Purchase a Windblade as soon as you can. Use it until you get a better two handed weapon.<br />
<br />
Don't look back until dual wield is upgraded.</div></div><hr />
