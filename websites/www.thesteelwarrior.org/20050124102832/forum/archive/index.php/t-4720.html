<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The lifetap proc augment?<br />
<br />
Yeah it's worth it. It taps life and you get hit points back.<br />
<br />
It's NOT an aggro proc.<br />
<br />
But it's useful. I know a couple of people who have it, and a lot more who have the cheaper version. It's not too popular among warriors since they usually save their points for hate procs, like Anger or Ykesha.<br />
<br />
I guess to better answer your question, I'd have to ask two questions of my own:<br />
<br />
What were you looking to put it on? <br />
<br />
What type of use are you hoping to get out of it?<br />
<br />
If you're looking for some added DPS and some extra HPs recovered while fighting/tanking mobs then yeah, I think you'll find it useful and worth the points.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for an aggro boost, lifetaps probably aren't the best place to start.</div></div><hr />

The AE and damage taken from these mobs pushed me away from the life tap augs.  I proc often enough but 50-100hp doesn't help me all that much at 9k+ hp.  I might get back 100hp per reg mob and 1k on a big mob on raids...  It's more of a utility aug for me atm... duels etc...<br />

It's just not warriorish. You'd be better off with the poison proc from EC if you want utility.</div></div><hr />
