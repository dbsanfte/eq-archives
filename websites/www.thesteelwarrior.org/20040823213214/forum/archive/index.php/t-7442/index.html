All three of my sons started playing EQ in April, 1999. While I would ocassionally tend a camp or go to a Fear raid in their stead, I couldn't get enough traction in the game to develop and maintain any interest until February, 2000 when I made BB.<br />
<br />
After discovering there was a world of difference between playing an uber level 46 character and a level 10, I started to look for webpages. Interestingly, I believe I ran into yours. Snacko Bagodonuts and the achieves of the daily developer chats were my only other resources.<br />
<br />
To me the biggest surprise is that EQ has been fairly faithful to the original Vision (tm). The only real major change is that players have bunched up at level 65, while when I started, level was everything. I remember a 50 Rogue MTing a 2 group mini raid simply because he had 15 levels on every other melee.<br />
<br />
Anyone could grind out levels without raiding and become significantly more powerful. But, when players began to bunch up at level 50 and later at 65, equipment only obtainable on raids replaced levels as determining how powerful characters were. <br />
<br />
Often long standing in-game social relationships became strained as some players became driven to advance and see more of the game while others just wanted to have fun.<br />
<br />
Raiding and guilds became so important that I know any number of players that quit simply because their guilds imploded. I know others that quit because enough of their friends moved to raiding guilds, they no longer felt that they knew anybody.<br />
<br />
And let's not kid ourselves - the tension caused by real progess becoming only possible as a member of an active raiding guild and by &quot;gearing up&quot; runs deep even now.<br />
<br />
Many Knights resent the fact that at level 65 (and sub-7000HP's unbuffed) they are not near the top of the game - they might as well be level 60's.<br />
<br />
Casual players resent that a huge and ever increasing amount of raid progression content is apparently permanently closed off from them.<br />
<br />
So, not only do your webpages represent the best (but sometimes flawed) information at the time, but there is an undercurrent of charming naivete long absent from the game - or at least the game as I've experianced it since level 46.<br />
