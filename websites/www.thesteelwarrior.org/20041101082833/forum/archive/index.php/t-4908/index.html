<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My magelo is easily clickable, and you can see the equipment I have.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm looking for advice on how to upgrade my equipment significantly that is available to a small group.<br />
<br />
<br />
90% of my equipment has been bazaared, as I started the game only recently (to work w. RL folks)  and in order to gear up to effectiveness, I spent the massive amount of plats to mitigate the deficiency of time accrued equipment. <br />
<br />
Where else can I go for significant upgrades?:<br />
<br />
Neck:  Never have I seen a black Plated collar in the bazaar.  What other options are out there?<br />
<br />
Wrist:  Kizraks just doesn't cut it.  Crystallized Bracer is about 350 and i'm unsure if  I want to pump 700k into the wrists.  Any other options?<br />
<br />
Helm/Back/Waist==Currently I have CCoM/Crinose Cape.  Would I be better served going for for HoRZ + CoF?==Is it worth it?<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
2handers:  What one groupable/small force 2 handers are available if i'm looking for an Aggro weapon that is viable?  Greatstaff of Four Winds and.....(any other options)<br />
<br />
The shoulders Will soon be upgraded to Str of Elements (Yael away)<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Firstly, get a different haste item and put some AC and HP's in your helm.  I see you got ornate armor, why not get an ornate helm or helm of rallos zek.  sell the ccom and get a cof and you're back item won't be so hurting then.<br />
<br />
Secondly, get 2 bloodmetal earrings.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, get rid of the silver chitin wrist and the substandard arms.  Miniumum wrist replacement should be Bracelet of Fortitude, but the ornate would be better.  Also, trash the arms and go for ornate as well.<br />
<br />
Everything else seems not too shabby.  Next upgrade after that would be new shoulders (something with raw HP). Then a new neck item.  Maybe hold out for a new neck item or shoulder item on a guild raid or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Korgo, I have you beat in most item slots and higher level, not sure how you have so many unbuffed HP over me.  *boggle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Possibly because he have maxed AA's that gives HP.<br />
<br />
As for bracers, hmm .. Tak armor from LDON with a +40 HP augment would be good I think.<br />
<br />
Would also fit well with the one-group requirement and add some levels to you as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Korgo, I have you beat in most item slots and higher level, not sure how you have so many unbuffed HP over me. *boggle* <br />
<br />
Darkoan finally feels the sting of going offensive AA's first :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh - Well, as long as he is having fun though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Small derail, but the AA's and the levels don't jive.  Sure makes for a nice little HP boost at 61 though, even if it's not entirely accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yur kinda in my position, I'd advise what you see in my megalo.<br />
<br />
For wrists I got this today for 65K<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24017<br />
<br />
Should see more avaialable as time goes on.<br />
<br />
Ya I have only seen that collar for sale one time in bazzar and I snatched it ups fast, 60K I thinks...<br />
<br />
I had two blood ears but kinda thinking that the dex and agi on the other ear might be a bit more handy for procs and a touch of AC... not sure though...<br />
<br />
I think that the pernicity cloak cannot be beat and you should put haste elsewhere (there is a new item that has haste in the ear slot but I dont have link for it), thus haste in the head slot seems the best... Still HoRZ is super item also but then you have to move haste to the waist and lose out on the rubicite belt...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zilden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get another kizarks bracer and then go to MiR and get the 5ac augs for like 100 adv ponts apiece and add to your shoulder, neck, and back.  From there get lvl 65 and pronto your equip is way over your lvl atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would still kick his ass Haass.  I put out the hurt, no foolin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For level 61 you have pretty good gear already Korgo.  Without spending a bunch of money on bazaar upgrades your best bet would probably be to get a few groups of friends together and hit Ssra if your guild doesn't raid.  It's going to be tough finding better gear without raiding.</div></div><hr />
