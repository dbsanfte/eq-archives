<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a guildleader of Cruentus, an Aus/NZ playtime guild on EMarr. We have recently(thanks to server-screwups and the 5000 subsequent patches) obtained Vex Thal keys for over 80 percent of the guild and began to kill smaller named. <br />
<br />
My question is this: I have a keyed cleric that is a retired friend of mine, been retired for ages, and I want to use him as a coth link. Where should I position him for maximum efficiency in the zone?<br />
<br />
I have been told to clear our way into mini-Aten area and park him there for coth purposes. Would this be the most efficient spot? Allowing us to clear the majority of the zone with the least clearing possible?<br />
<br />
One other thing, since we are there and will be taking out serious named soon(inclusing AHR I hope). I was wondering if some of you VT experienced guys could take a look at my Magelo and recommend some pieces to be on the lookout for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigrr7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In the room behind dxxt.  You'll miss out on DXV and DXX, but it will save you hours clearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cleric at Blob1 (Dyek), mage at dxxt.<br />
<br />
Have rogues drag peeps to Blob1, rez with cleric then kill B1 to claim cycle (That's how it works on my server...whoever kills Blob1 will always win a GM decision if VT is contested...) then COTH to DXXT and continue from there.<br />
<br />
Definately interested in hearing about strats for this zone tho. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No reason to coth/rez to blob1 though...it really doesn't take that long to clear to him. Invis up to the palace, clear the  first 3 rooms and yer there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you're doing a full clear, every minute saved helps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No CoTH strats for fat ogres! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>chidder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Full clears honestly don't take that long anymore. Once you start might take 8 hours but once you get it down 4 hour clears are easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is best just to CoH to blob 1 and start from there like other's have said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We have a mage at blob1, and mage in the corridor outside dxxt...<br />
<br />
after dxxt we do tvk, then one of the wing named...dxvt or the bp of speed guy (tend to do him least) then mini aten, then blobs upstairs if we have time, then AHR...like some1 said earlier, we miss out the wing bosses...<br />
Usually takes 5 hours to do all that with no wipes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Now that my guild has left VT, I am more than happy to give you some info, Kogur.<br />
<br />
First, you don't really need to camp anyone anywhere.<br />
<br />
Put a Bard, Necro, and Rogue in a group together at the zoneline.<br />
<br />
Bard buffs necro/rogue with selos.  Rogue takes off running with SoS and heads to Blob1 room, opening doors on the way.  Necro follows a few seconds behind.  Long enough that he doesn't catch the rogue, but soon enough that the doors are still open.<br />
<br />
This takes a bit of practice, but is very doable.<br />
<br />
Necro gets to Blob1 room, FD in a corner, /q to clear agro.  Rogue drags in mage corpse.<br />
<br />
Nocro logs back in, rezzes mage, CoTH raid to blob1, kill.<br />
<br />
Same group, Necro/Rogue run to DXV area, to one of the &quot;side rooms&quot; up the stairs, on either side of DXV's pedistal.  There is one roamer mob in each room, however, these mobs do not see invis.  Necro fd, /q in the corner of the side room.  Rogue stays in room,  and watches the roamer.<br />
<br />
Necro is in communication with rogue, either on an alt, or via IM or phone or whatever.  Necro gets to char select screen, waits till rogue sees the roamer pathing away, then logs in.  Invis, med up, watch pathing.<br />
<br />
Rogue drags mage corpse.  Mage should already be in VT, so rez is just a &quot;same zone&quot; hop, with no load time.  Mage should have a mod rod, and invis spell memmed, as well as be fully geared. (ie: rez naked corpse)<br />
<br />
When necro sees mob pathing away, pop up, rez mage, re-invis.  Mage pops in, eats mod rod, invises self, sits and meds.<br />
<br />
This will be a hot-CoTH.  Mage should have MA, slower, CHer in group, plus coth anchor.<br />
<br />
When mage has enough mana to CoTH three people in a row, and the mob is pathing away, he CoTH's the MA, the Slower, and the CHer as quickly as possible.  These drop group to make room for others, and the mage continues to CoTH in the raid force.  Get Enchie/Bard early on to help replenish mage mana.<br />
<br />
Roamer will path back right around the time the third person is CoTHed.  MA engages, slower gets it slowed, CH'er heals MA, slower helps with patch heals as needed.<br />
<br />
Once the entire raid is CoTH'ed in, buff and kill DXV (pull him into the side room and corner him by a torch)<br />
<br />
Move raid to DXV's platform, and do the exact same Necro/Bard run, to one of the side rooms by DXXT.<br />
<br />
Do the same &quot;hot-CoTH&quot; strat, buff, kill DXXT, again, pulling him into the side room and cornering him by the torch.  Healers can stand at one torch, with DXXT cornered by the other torch, and be out of Silence range.<br />
<br />
Move raid to the &quot;pole&quot; room behind DXXT, and deal with loot, etc.  Re-buff, have a rogue click the pole and pre-target the two mobs in that room for your MA and an offtank.<br />
<br />
Have the raid click up and engage the pre-targetted mobs.  Kill, pull and clear to TVK.  Pull TVK to the port up room (don't move the raid)  Corner AoW style (gnome MA if needed)<br />
<br />
Do loot fast, and move the raid into the hallway &quot;T&quot; where you decide if you want to go north to TXD or south to DXVT today.  Have this decision made in advance.<br />
<br />
If you have good dps, you can move the raid and be pulling the trap mobs that spawn in the n/s hallways behind the locked doors before the port-up room mobs respawn.  Your first few times, this won't happen, and ye'll have to spend a little time re-clearing from the port-up room to the n/s fork.<br />
<br />
Be prepped for about 2 hours of intense clearing at this point.  It will drop to 45 minutes as your froces get stronger and better geared.<br />
<br />
Clear to TXD or DXVT, AoW corner them right by their spawn points, kill, and put your rogue in a group with a mage.<br />
<br />
Send the rogue up to the third floor, where he'll be pre-targetting 4 mobs for your MA/OTs.<br />
<br />
He'll have to target a mob, then get CoTH'ed back to the raid force for them to /assist, then click up, get second target, etc.<br />
<br />
(If your rogue is skilled in using the &quot;toggle target&quot; key, he can pretarget 2 mobs per CoTH, speeding this up dramatically.)<br />
<br />
Once your MA and 3 offtanks have all 4 port up mobs pre-targetted, and slowers, healers have been assigned, have the raid force click up and engage.<br />
<br />
Kill these four mobs and then prep for mini-Aten.<br />
<br />
AoW corner Mini-aten in the portup room. Kill her, then move the raid to her room to distribute loot, as the port-up room mobs are liable to sapwn while doing loot unless you have a ton of DPS.<br />
<br />
Clear to the LEFT Aten-Blob, AoW corner him inside his room, then clear a path and PULL the right (Southern) Aten-Blob to the same room you killed the northern Blob in.  (An agro bug makes it possible that courtyard mobs will agro your raid if you fight the southern blob in the south room.)<br />
<br />
Clear to the pole, click up, and prep for Aten.<br />
<br />
We used a ranger to WS pull TVK, Mini-Aten, and the aten blobs.<br />
<br />
Individual boss strategies I leave up to you, but I've outlined the general path to take to clear VT in ~ 5 hours.  You miss DXX, and either DXVT or TXD depending on which path you take on the 2nd floor, but you only have one section to clear (the 2nd floor mobs) and save a ton of time, once your necro/rogue crew get good at the runs.</div></div><hr />
