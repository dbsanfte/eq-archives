<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyallag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since Wis/Int casters get AA that lets them bump Wis/Int up to 355. Wouldn't it be nice if Wars got the ability to bump Stamina up to 355 ? Granted it wouldn't be a ton of HP but More HP is always better.<br />
<br />
I would submit this Idea to the devs at SOE except for 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1) they wouldn't pay any attention<br />
<br />
2) they would pay attention, implement the change, and declare the War class as balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would rather see that the stamina points you get after 250 be equal to the stamina points you get pre 250. I mean after 250 2 points of stamina = 8 hp very lame. <br />
<br />
But if they did that I would like to see Str and Stam both going to 355. This would allow warriors only to get a bonus to attack and more hp. To give them a slight edge over the knights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KunabKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think both posts in this thread have good points. <br />
<br />
I myself believe that since WIS/INT casters get that AA, that Warriors should as well for the simple fact that we are supposed to take the hits, thus having far and away the most HP would...make sense.<br />
<br />
But being that the knight classes get so close to us in HP now, this would be a good step in giving warriors a hand in getting back what should have rightfully never been lost---the fact to be clear and away the leaders in HP (and AC) In PoP it seems anything plate has been thrust upon class: WAR CLR PAL SHD BRD instead of making some WAR only equipment with larger AC/HP, but that's for another thread I supposed<br />
<br />
Vack is right in that it would help, but also upping the sta AFTER 250 and maybe even then AFTER 305 to something that'd actually add more than 50HP if we just went with the 2 pts after 250.<br />
<br />
Either way it's something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This seems quite reasonable to me.  For that matter, add a DEX one to Rogues and Monks too.  <br />
<br />
Casters being able to raise stats while Melee could not struck me as unfair when I first saw it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Improved Body:[3/3/3/3/3]5 levels, each level adds +5 per melee stat.. max 355, requirement PP5<br />
<br />
I would go so far as doing str/sta/dex/agil up to 355 for PURE melee only at a cost of 3aa per point.. <br />
<br />
of course they need to fix the hps for stamina also...<br />
<br />
those would be a good start.</div></div><hr />

    wood nymph here and id love to see more Hp and Dex..can never have to much)) think for the job we have to do as warriors, it isnt enough...speed holds aggro but also be nice to watch mobs hp go down before yours..))  maybe someone will finally see the light))<br />

Nah, they already have enough useless AAs. They would pick up this one right around when they are picking up Acrobatics.</div></div><hr />
