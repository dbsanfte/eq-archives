<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainingvodka</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i noticed today my warrior having HUGE problems maintaning aggro on Hedge and Grummus raids.  (backflagging ppl for push into Eles).  It was so bad I popped furious and rage on the spider encounter in PoD to make sure i held aggro.  Trash was getting yanked all over the place...not your usual everyone lets it all hang out killing trash but serious serious yankage by SKs, wiz, shammies, enchanter -- no way EVERYONE has TRYING to pull aggro, but...every one was pulling aggro off me.  I asked another warrior in guild to MT grummus and HE had the same problems.  even after popping furious, rage, aet, EVERYTHING, he was losing aggro.<br />
<br />
I wield BF/GBoS (both a3).  he weilds BoW (a3).  we both had wunshi and maxxed dex.  I only have WA1 but it's never been a problem before.  <br />
<br />
talking in guild tank channel he and I were not the only two tanks having aggro problems as of late.  has anyone else noticed a problem lately?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But no ... no real aggro differences here.  While i was a raider i had nights where i couldnt hold aggro for beans inexplicably.  Bad night is all i guess.</div></div><hr />

What level were the folks who were drawing aggro? Maybe the mobs thought they could have a free lunch on the lower level toons first.</div></div><hr />

For most part kept them off GoD+ ranger/beast and the cle who was healing.</div></div><hr />
