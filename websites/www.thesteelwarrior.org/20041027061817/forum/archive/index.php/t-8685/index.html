<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dented</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am the epitomy of the casual player.  I started eq about a month after the game came out.  I was about level 12 when kunark came out, and about 20 when velious was out.  I slowly progressed up the scale, have had a few breaks, and am finally closing in on the late game.  I have never been in a guild that raided more than once a month, and I have never managed to have over 16,000 plat at one time (thanks to selling a lodi shield).  Over the years, I have lost all my gear a couple of times, and have made some bad purchases and trades.<br />
<br />
Anyway,   I feel like I have worked hard to get where I am, but would like to find some upgrades that a casual player can attain.  Here is my magelo:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1091544<br />
<br />
I already know the easiest thing to upgrade would be my earring, and probably the most needed addition would be haste or a clicky item.  What would you suggest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. LDoN North Ro Armor<br />
2. Soulscream Belt or Tribute if you can afford<br />
3. Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
4. Stat Foods like 10lb Halas pies and Liquidized Meat<br />
5. Quest in WW for Str of Elements, its 100hp shoulder item<br />
<br />
my suggestion since you mentioned you dont raid much and also taking that you can get at least 2 groups to tackle or get a good amount of groups for adv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back: Cloak of Greater Pernicity (Do the quest, super easy and very nice..)<br />
Finger: Another Valorium ring<br />
Ear: Blood Earring of Rage<br />
<br />
Dont go with tribute haste.. better to just save up for the belt, or maybe pick up a Runebranded Girdle if u happen to help a rogue with their epic in Kith? Well, depending on ur flags u could possibly get hte cloak for no money at all, just go out and get into some grps and get the 4 drops (check out allas for info). Hope that helps some =)</div></div><hr />

RBG drops in sebilis.<br />
<br />
1. LDoN North Ro Armor <br />
<br />
he said he is a very casual player. 40 missions at 65 gets you A piece of nro, and i doubt he has the time, plus being sub65, it will take him much longer. There are 3-4 sets of LDON armor for each type of armor, and for plate NRO is the best. However EF, and i believe BB are the two lower tiers of plate armor, those would be a good option.<br />
<br />
I would suggest going for the lower tier armor from ldon, or take a day or two and just level in POV or the like, once you are 62 you will be able to go to bastion of thunder, pick up some ornate patterns, and get yourself some cash/kizraks.<br />
<br />
As for the weapon, you are fine for now. Frostreaver isnt bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RBG drops in sebilis.<br />
<br />
AND, RBG drops in Kithicor.. Id imagine its much more easier in kith because of the rogue epic piece.. not many ppl go to seb on my server =/  here ya go tho, even alla's says it: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=969</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">true and i passed that part i guess but EF 760 and the BB 160 is not too bad to use and also at his lvl exp in LDoN is not bad and most times it is easier to get a group in ldon then lets say PoD, PoV, PoN where most his lvl would exp but i would suggest LDoN to get going on those armor peices he can upgrade to and augs he will need and also get some decent upgrades from there then just exp in lets say PoV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You might be able to get the souscream belt yourself, if you can get a group to go with you to Veksar. Rotted (rotting?) shopkeeper is your mob.<br />
You've fought in Kael, it looks like, so you might be able to quest Draconic Pauldrons (AC 15, STR 12, STA 12, FR 6, CR6) unless the Skyshrine folks really don't like you. You'll need some help with the killing part of it, but I've heard of 62 druids soloing the mobs you need to kill, so it's not like you'd need a huge force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First off, you've got a GSoT in your possession... agro weapons should not be an issue, nor your next upgrade. Use the GSoT over the Frostreaver, the dps might drop a smidgeon because of the proc, but the aggro is much much better. Secondly, your current cloak has 30 more hp than a cloak of greater pernicity, so that &quot;upgrade&quot; wouldn't help you much. Also LDoN points are still really slow at your level, so those really aren't too feasible for a casual player.<br />
<br />
I would say the slots you need to upgrade the most would be shoulders, neck, haste, and ear. There are already some good ideas here, I'd advise you to either keep checking the bazaar for deals, and try working up a decent amount of plat through hunting for gems/drops, or buying/selling in the bazaar. Your chest could possibly be upgraded as well, though I'm not sure what to look for since you aren't tribunal/rz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But the Pernicity cloak would give him some much needed Stamina. I'd definately look at getting the Soulscream belt and a better chestplate. Save you money and watch the bazaar closely for good deals. Let's see:<br />
<br />
Neck -- Amulet of mummy wrappings<br />
chest -- Architect's Bejeweled Chestplate<br />
ear -- Mosquito leg earring<br />
shoulder -- grand pauldron of study (single groupable in PoM chest room)<br />
feet -- steelslave bladed boots<br />
<br />
LdoN's are a slow go but you can get some really good stuff. Ef has a lot of good stuff for 760 points but the Tak stuff is nicer but almost twice the cost. <br />
<br />
/agree with Neksnappa: use that GSoT for your agro weapon or look into the copper hammer of striking <br />
<br />
I'd also grab run 3 and Sta 3  real quick</div></div><hr />
