<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read this and thought bonus for 2 hand delay was 28 + . Please educate me on this post.<br />

Post I read on Allah<br />

&quot;Hallelujah! All gods be praised! someone who finally gets the damage bonus! Check it out people: in all the recent damage bonus related patches, the only time verent ever said they were making a modification to damage bonuses is a while ago when they added an extra one for 40+ delay 2 handers. All the recent damage bonus is just making it display. That's right, the damage bonus showing up on all the toys is yer regular old level based damage bonus. Which for all us melee classes is (level -25)/3. Or: 1 one 28, 2 on 31, 3 on 34, 4 on 37. This formula only applies to 1 handers where delay isn't a factor. I don't know what the caster formula is (like you guys care anyway), but plug yer level in and find oout! bet it matches the bonus displayed on yer weapons. Point is, there is no new bonus, only new information displayed on weapons.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, that post you quoted had almost all the earmarks of the prototypical Alla's post:<br />
1. Arrogance and condescention coupled with<br />
2. Wrong information<br />
and bonus points for spelling &quot;Verant&quot; as &quot;verent&quot;. All that is needed is &quot;This is clearly a monk item.&quot; and the post would be perfect :p<br />
<br />
You are correct, 2 handers with a delay of 28 or higher get an additional damage bonus that goes up with the delay to a max of....40 delay? Not sure where it tops out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks,<br />
<br />
I thought it was 28+, but someone told me a few days ago in game it was 40 and saw this thread and made me wonder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">any 2h weapon equal to or above 28 delay gets a higher dmg bonus than a 1h weapon. the higher the delay gets, the more bonus. someone tried to make a chart one time, i forgot which board though.<br />
<br />
and, don't take advice off allakhazam's. looking up items and where they drop, fine - but don't read the posts below or you might get headaches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">typical monk reply :D  /snicker<br />
<br />
them alla people are awfully jaded in their replies; good for a laugh sometimes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">...And any weapon with a delay LESS than 28 has a damage bonus of ((level -25)/3)+1. Just thought I would add that little tidbit of information. :)</div></div><hr />
