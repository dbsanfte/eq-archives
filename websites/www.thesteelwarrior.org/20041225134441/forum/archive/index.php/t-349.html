<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turgan7th</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a little Warrior for the time I am not in caster mood. As it is not a primary I don't expect him to be in top gear. My problem is that I do not see where I lack AC. Sure there are slots for easy upgrades but I'd expect to be a little closer to 1k with my gear as I see other Warriors of lower level with gear that don't seem to be better that have at least 50 AC more then I have.<br />
<br />
Magelo is in Sig as usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boots ... 10 AC is kinda low. Cobalt would give you a lot more. You just lose the stats.<br />
<br />
Shoulders ... 7 AC is kind of low. Popular items are Imbued Granite Spaulders or Cultural armor, and either option would give you a lot more AC.<br />
<br />
Gloves ... your haste item is there. A lot of people have Cobalt there. Again, tons more AC.<br />
<br />
Sleeves ... 16 AC versus the 25 AC of yup, you guessed it, COBALT.<br />
<br />
Cobalt lacks the stat boosts of some of the stuff you're wearing, but since you asked about AC, and since boots, vambraces and gloves are really cheap cobalt items, I just thought I'd use them as an example of where to gain AC.<br />
<br />
Helmet ... well, Cobalt or the much better Raldukan Helm.<br />
<br />
In ANY EVENT, you are a barbarian who worships the Tribunal. You are now over level 45. Disregard Cobalt.<br />
<br />
Go for your cultural Helanic armor. The AC is far superior to many of your items. And will have oodles of STA and Hit Points, and just totally put you where you want your stats to be as a warrior in his or her 50s.</div></div><hr />
