<br />
I'm in a newly Time flagged guild.  We've been in Time about a month and got as far as downing CT, RZ and Bertie.  We're just starting Ikky raids.  For info, I'm usually fourth in MT order, behind our 3 BoW equipped wars.<br />
<br />
I was wielding a BoC in my primary and an Obsidian Scimitar in secondary, but tonight I got my Epic1.5.<br />
<br />
First question:  I've gone for Epic in primary and BoC in secondary.  Right choice or wrong choice?<br />
<br />
Second question: How should I aug the Epic? Should I move the Anger aug from BoC into it and get an Ykesha or go for 2 anger augs?<br />
<br />
Third question: What should I be looking for upgradewise to upgrade the BoC?  I know how rare DBoW is and I'll be unlikely to see one anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help<br />
<br />
EDIT: spelt wield wrong  :eek:</div></div><hr />

if you aug it for aggro, then it should be fine<br />
<br />
Second question: How should I aug the Epic? Should I move the Anger aug from BoC into it and get an Ykesha or go for 2 anger augs?<br />
 <br />
<br />
I haven't gotten mine yet, but if you want to throw anger on it or ykesha, either will do the trick. Personally, I like a mix of both anger3 and ykesha.<br />
<br />
<br />
Third question: What should I be looking for upgradewise to upgrade the BoC?  I know how rare DBoW is and I'll be unlikely to see one anytime soon.<br />

I use Edge of eternity primary and tank against Darkblade warriors all the time. I plan on using EoE/Epic for aggro once i get epic, since i went on break and missed out on darkblade. EoE is a nice weapon and if you don't see a DBotW in your future, EoE will do the trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest two ykesha augs on your epic weapon, personally...there's been a discussion somewhere around here discussing how much better ykesha is than anger3.<br />
<br />
For an upgrade to the BoC, EoE or maybe quarm hammer (but only if EoE is rare/being snatched up by other warriors too much).  You could also look for the elfshoe from Ikk2 I think it drops -- I've never seen it, but if you can get past wielding an elfshoe, it's a good upgrade to boc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ikk2 is the purple sparkle wand, aka, jagged onyx staff. the elf shoe from ikkinz is the darkglint blade, ranger only.<br />
<br />
or perhaps your thinking of the fleshbiter that drops in uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grunmore</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i personally would say either do x2 anger3 augs or 1 anger 1 ykesha.<br />
For an offhand there is Jagged Onyx Staff, Edge of Eternity, Hammer of the Timeweaver, and Dbotw isnt all that rare...if your a top 3 warrior or so in your guild you should get one within a few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DBoW *can* be very rare and streaky.  So far we have no drops in over 2 months.  <br />
<br />
I suggest going for the EoE and auging the Epic.<br />

Redleaf</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a Streak of 28 without any drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I second that, we had more double plate bp molds drop than dbows (4) in our 30+ (closer to 40+ by now) RZ kills in time.<br />
Only thing that was rarer (from the class specific weapons) was the bard one which we got 3 times.<br />
Staff of trancendance rottet several times by now so talk about luck... (every monk/bl main and twink got one by now).<br />
From my observations, Fleshbiter is the better agro weapon, but not that common either.<br />
When our first Fleshbiter dropped it almost rotted.<br />
Then one of our younger (young regarding having way less AA/AC/hp than the 2-4 main tanks) took it up and it was really noticable how often he stole agro from the dbow wielding tanks (they were using dbow/jagged onys staff combos at the time).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not doing the math right now, but I still think the aggro per minute of the epic with anger3 will surpass the bloodfrenzy unaugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pig</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Already tried both.  If you have dual anger3 on epic and AHR gloves and<br />
BF with anger3 and WA5, mainhanding the BF will give you much more aggro for<br />
the first 10 seconds of most fights when mobs are being debuffed, because you<br />
-will- proc most of the time and lock aggro.<br />
<br />
When i mainhanded the epic, most of the time no early procs so I lost<br />
aggro when mob was debuffed.  I'm through chasing mobs around like<br />
an idiot, so I mainhand the Bloodfrenzy and feel confident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theodian</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree. mainhanding the bf would be the better choice. since your in a time guild going for the eoe/hammer in main hand would possibly be a better choice instead of bf considering that you win it. having cleared time every week for the past 5 months i have seen one dbotw drop it seems that on kane bayle it drops very very rarely. course i've only seen rz drop the bp 2 or 3 times the rest has been the usual stuff. there is alot of different opinions on what you should use and what you shouldnt use. i myself would prefer anger augs over the ykesha aug just cuz im a fan of anger augs. i rarely lose aggro when i tank. atm im weilding eoe/boc  with wa5 and 315dex unbuffed. now..with the new oow buffs it puts most tanks over 400 dex..now with that much dex and wa5  lol it wont really matter which one you have in your main hand then..most likely your going to process like a crazy idoit lol. <br />
<br />
just find a combo that works best for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or perhaps you will proc about as much as you did at 305... or even less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theodian</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've noticed for me at least i tend to process a bit more. now i have heard of both from random people that they process less than if they had just 305 dex and then i've heard from others that said they process more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parse It, Slackers!<br />
<br />
Edit:  Boo. Filter killed my caps lock em-fah-sees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanette</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parsing scares me, s'pose I could get the fella to do it for me.  Am gonna try BF Main Epic Offhand see how it goes aggro wise.  If I like it, I'll keep it.<br />
<br />
Now, better get off and bully some people into LDoN for the 2%xp they'll get.</div></div><hr />

IMO... no, your not posting this in the right place.  PoTime is 2 expansions(real ones anyway) old.  Lets post some l33t VT infos here too while we're at it!~</div></div><hr />
