<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, newly flagged for EP and still learning. I have heard about all these PoE and Poair rings, would anyone be able to provide info how to start these, especialy the air ones.<br />
<br />
How about how to find them up. I tried to find info but couldnt find any. I have access to a rogue and ranger both so if there is a way to find with either class please fill me in :).. thanks in advance<br />
<br />
;tell xev.saniri   should work if you want to send me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Air rings - Take a tracker at the zoneline and look for the following yellow con mobs on track:<br />
<br />
 apparition of wind<br />
 apparition of smoke<br />
 apparition of mist<br />
 apparition of dust<br />
<br />
If those are up, then the Avatars are up.  To spawn them, you go to their associated island and complete the ring event.  For Wind, you kill the bee island.  For Mist, you kill the phoenix island.  For Smoke, you kill the air elemental island.  For Dust, you kill the spider island.  I could have Mist and Smoke backwards btw.  Don't bother with Dust until you've gotten some heavy gear under your belt.  It is by FAR the hardest and is the bottleneck of acquiring your Xegony Key.  <br />
<br />
As for earth rings, they always piss me off.  I don't think you can ever know when exactly they're up unless you're on the clock to when other guilds or yourself have last killed them.  They're pretty easy though.</div></div><hr />

You're correct on the Mist/Smoke island clearing order and I dont know a way aside from keeping up with when the rings were last cleared either to know when one is up. The Dust ring is the only one that has a trigger, the Dusty Warder. Pretty sure the ring is up when the warder is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Eraitha and Tima :). Yeah earth ones are easy we spawned the Arbitar thing after killing the Rings, now on to kill some air ones. /bows, thanks again guys.</div></div><hr />
