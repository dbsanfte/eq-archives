<br />
I was just wondering.  I was checking out EQrankings.com this morning, and it looks like the max attainable HP for a warrior is 11.4k or so.  On a side note, are all/most of those magelos fake?  Anyways, I was wondering...  If 11.4k was the current, pre-GoD max, what's the new max after the 500hp from sturdiness, and the new GoD gear that seems to be pretty nice?  Anyone hit 12k yet ?  Just curious is all.</div></div><hr />

Please, that's not the warrior way. <br />
<br />
You need to go the Samurai route. <br />
<br />
I can just never remember if it's across and down, or down and across.</div></div><hr />

<br />
B: EQrankings has one warrior profile that is totally fake, but is 11.4k unbuffed. It should be removed, but hasn't been. No warrior is currently and is likely to be soon at that number without buffs. 12k without buffs, we'll probably see at the end of GoD.</div></div><hr />

It should be removed, but hasn't been.Some of us faithful followers were pushing to kill fake profiles this weekend on EQRankings. The problem is people keep making more and adding them to the EQR database.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to make a fake profile to see how far you can get x stat with whatever class, it's another to add it to EQRankings with such a name, and sometimes, a guild name, to pass it off as real.<br />
<br />
What's even funnier is that the fake warrior profiles that break 11k unbuffed usually consist of multipul duplicate lore augments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

re: seppuku<br />

across from left, then up. if you're really tough, follow with stab into groin, up to sternum, finishing with side cut along base of ribcage.</div></div><hr />

Seems someone this deep into the game can pony up the few bucks to get megalo premium.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Certified magelo profiles can be altered and still show up like they weren't. They can be whatever you want them to be. The tag works either after purchase, or after the first upload I'm not sure which, but as long as you don't use the auto-syncronize from there on out you can save changes to the website and still have the seal. <br />
<br />
Ie. it's no indication of more than a valid premium account.<br />
<br />
edit: Here's an example, I'd like to thank Surlok for lending his Magelo to my point:)<br />
