<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>albyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering which weapon is better in terms of pure aggro? Will the Better Ratio on Blade of Ornate Symbols Make up for the lesser hate on its proc? I am trying to bank my BOC but its been a hard thing to do.... I have GBOS and OSOW. I could prolly get a BOS pretty soon because our guild seems to do Rondo a good bit.  The EB on BOC is hard too replace P.   I have two anger 3 augs and also have WA5<br />
<br />
Any Input would be great on deciding if BOS is worthing Getting and what I really need to bank my BOC<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">why are you trying to bank your BoC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>albyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why are you trying to bank your BoC?<br />
<br />
<br />
looking for better dps and stats particulary more Endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I am still pissed that the BoC and HoRZ never got any Endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Although 23/26 sounds good, it is actually NOT more dps than 14/18.<br />
<br />
When comparing weapons of the same dps, the faster weapons always have more &quot;natural aggro&quot;.  The BoS with its long delay suffers for this, and has no proc rate mod to make up for it.<br />
<br />
So you should expect BoS to be somewhat worse than a GBoS for aggro, which is somewhat worse than a BoC.<br />
<br />
Choose the BoS for the stats if you wish, but recognize the tradeoff that you are making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want better DPS use a GSoT4W.  Or you could take an anger 3 aug out of the BoC and put in a 125 cold dd.  Or just use the BoS.  But dont expect your agro to be close to what it was before.<br />
<br />
Redleaf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hummm the part bout the faster weapon being more agro is not really true IMO.  It is not the speed, but it is the RATIO that is driving the agro (if we are not considering the proc factor).  Here is a good example:  Before I had DBoTW, my combo was EoE (anger3/mainhand) + BBoTE (anger3/offhand).  A guildy warrior had JoS(anger3/mainhand) + BoC (anger3/offhand).  Now supposedly, BBoTE &gt; BoC so we counting off the offhand, and lets focus on the mainhand.    Here is the thing, when we used to do a lot of ikkinz raid trials, how come that this other guy steals agro from me a lot whenever I was MA?  When supposedly I have much faster weapons that him?  EoE is 20delay, BBoTE is 17 delay.....  JoS is 25 delay and BoC is 20 delay.. explain that?!   He wasnt even taunting :P of course cuz I was MA and not him :P   I used the 1hs combo rather than my BoW because they actually have better agro when you are just doing trash clearings.  BTW, we both also have WA5.<br />
<br />
BTW, BoS is not bad at all, you wont be disappointed, use it on offhand and anger3/Yak aug it, lesser delay means lesser reposites.  Then get an EoE or JoS for your mainhand, I assure you, its not worth keeping the BoC.  It belongs in the bazaar and good for twinks, not for a high-end raid tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tipoytm, I'm not sure what you're getting at.  Those two weapons are not in the same dps class at all, and their procs have different amounts of aggro.  You find it strange that a 30/25 weapon with AC debuff proc can compete with aggro from a 20/20 weapon with stun proc?  Why would you find that strange?  One has less dps and a proc with slightly more aggro, the other has more dps and a proc with slighly less aggro.<br />
<br />
Given two one-handed weapons OF THE SAME DPS, the faster one will produce more aggro.  The aggro theories posted in the Library have the damage bonus being very significant to aggro generation.  A slow weapon applies the damage bonus less often than a fast weapon, so it produces less aggro for the same dps.<br />
<br />
Your JoS/EoE example is irrelevant because those two weapons are nowhere close to the same dps.  The BoS/GBoS comparison is a far better example because they have the same dps and equivalent procs.  The BoS applies the damage bonus 2/3 as often as the GBoS.  That is a lot of lost aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd expect the BoS to have aggro similar to the CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, I don't care what the posts say bout it.. with all the theory and shit.  DPS is directly proportional to the ratio of your weapons and will also be directly proportional to the agro generated.  How the hell can you compare a high quality raid weapon to a bazaar weapon like the copper hammer? LOL to think that is like pretty much thinking noobish.    Are you basing your opinion on experience or mainly you are just basing it on theory.. because I personally have  one of my guildies who has BoS and eversince he got that, he sold his BoC.  He uses EoE + BoS (both anger3ed) and I could say he can hold agro even with fellow warriors who are using BoW, JoS, DBoTW etc. etc.<br />
<br />
ratios: (lower ratio is higher DPS)<br />
<br />
BoS = 26/23 = 1.13<br />
GBoS = 18/14 = 1.28<br />
BoC = 20/15 = 1.33<br />
<br />
BBoTE = 17/13 +1 disease = 17/14 = 1.21<br />
JoS = 25/29 +1 cold = 25/30 = 0.83<br />
EoE = 20/20 = 1.00<br />
<br />
<br />
So???  who do you want to believe.. someone who is just basing it on theory or someone who actually has seen it up close in action wielded by a fellow warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Whether the BoS + anger 3 can &quot;hold aggro&quot; is not an issue, and I don't know why you're trying to make it one.  Anything with anger 3 is enough to &quot;hold aggro&quot;.  I used a Rotting Fist + anger 3 to MT Fennin Ro, for heaven's sake.  Nobody's going to call the Rotting Fist a better aggro weapon than a BoC, but I held aggro over warriors with BoCs just fine, because they used their heads and so did I.<br />
<br />
If you want to judge weapons as if you were level 28 then I guess that is your choice, but at level 65 you have a damage bonus, and it affects your DPS and your aggro, and a faster weapon gets more benefit from the damage bonus.  A popular comparison is:<br />
<br />
BoS = (23*2 + 13) / 26 = 2.27<br />
GBoS = (14*2 + 13) / 18 = 2.28<br />
BoC = (15*2 + 13) / 20 = 2.15<br />
RF = (17*2 + 13) / 20 = 2.35<br />
<br />
Which matches my experience with the latter three weapons, for both DPS and &quot;DPS aggro&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit - look, I'll take back the CHoS comment.  I have no doubt the BoS is a good weapon, hell its stats are terrific.  But I think it is absurd to think that weapon delay has no effect on aggro, given that it's been demonstrated that it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dude, the bonus damage does not count on the ratio, LOL.  It is just extra damage that is added to the minimum attack damage (per hit).<br />
<br />
Say, at level 40 (where there is no bonus damage yet) supposedly you swing your weapon, and say you inflict 50 damage on one hit, but when you are level 65, you have by default 13 bonus damage, so instead of hitting it for just 50 you actually hit the mob for 63.  From what I heard, bonus damage doesn't even count in the equation for the agro generated on the mob that you are attacking, it is the ratio and the procs that count.<br />
<br />
Do some more research about bonus damage and you will realize that what you were led to believe isn't exactly correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tip, you are wrong. The formula reasonably modeling aggro does indeed include the damage bonus. The damage bonus is more often applied with faster weapons, thus leading to an increase in aggro from a faster weapon with the same ratio. You are using emotions in a logical argument, using &quot;I've seen&quot; and &quot;I feel&quot;. It doesn't work that way. Ratio is NOT king, it's just one factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fitemore already corrected your misconception, but just to add one more comment, unlike you I actually did do my research - please read this thread in the Library (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789).<br />
<br />
Quote: &quot;Summary: ... damage bonus is a significant contributor to hate.&quot;<br />
<br />
And yes, there is a damage bonus at level 40. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fit, I never said that ratio is KING, in the long run it is just not the ratio really, but it is also the procs.  When you are in a time/Qvic  guild, you will start to realize that your BoW isnt the king of agro because of its massive bonus damage against one handers... isn't that what you are thinking why I was wrong? :P  Why do you think that high-end warriors (10K+ HP, look at the magelos in EQ rankings)  don't use BoW anymore? Do you think because its only about the HP and stats and not really the agro factor?  Take a look at those warriors... they usually have  DBoTW + EoE combo, correct?  DBoTW has like a very high delay (35/38), but from my personal experience (and not just me, ask the other warriors who has one)  EVEN when I am not procing much, I could still outagro a warrior who has a bloodfrenzy on his mainhand (20/16)... why do you think this is?  certainly it is not because of the bonus damage , since they both have the same 13... and it is not the proc because its not a huge difference.. so what is it?  YES, it is the ratio... though let me stress that it is not king, but hey, we do know that it is a major factor in the agro equation.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the Brutish Blade of Balance (gratz Timok), why do you think they increased the ratio... still high delay (31) but damage is 42+1cold, a slow weapon like DBoTW really.  They didn't even upgrade the proc.. same shit but one thing they changed though... yes, the ratio.  SoE designed EQ and they know how the agro equation actually works... why did they design uber warrior weapons this way in the high-end GoD content?<br />
<br />
Even if bonus damage DOES have an effect in the agro equation of weapons, still it won't have the same weight as ratio and procs.  ASSUMING, that we are talking and restrict the topic to only level 65 warriors /wink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Uh, I know my BoW isn't the ultimate. It's the best I can get atm though. Anyhow, thanks for playing.<br />
<br />
  You are bringing up weapons whose ratios are tremendous. You're comparing apples to oranges. No crap procs matter. No crap ratio matters. You aren't understanding the damage bonus though, and until you hit PoTime and high end GoD, weapons like the ones you are mentioning don't even sort of exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if bonus damage DOES have an effect in the agro equation of weapons, still it won't have the same weight as ratio and procs.&quot;<br />
<br />
  You have to realize that the weapon in contention here has WORSE aggro procs than a BoC. Less aggro per proc, same proc rate. So what the discussion here is about is whether or not the better 23/26 ratio makes up for the 15/20 weapon being faster (more damage bonus applications) AND the proc rate difference.<br />
<br />
  Because you're asserting that damage bonus is nothing compared to ratio, I'm telling you that you're wrong. It matters, and it SIGNIFICANTLY does. You have to get an ungodly ratio, such as that of the DBotW or Fleshbiter, to start outweighing a fast weapon with a decent ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK, going back to the main issue:<br />
<br />
ratio factor: <br />
<br />
BoS = 26/23 = 1.13  vs.  BoC = 20/15 = 1.33<br />
<br />
proc factor:<br />
<br />
Boc = Enraging Blow (700hate) vs.  BoS = Force Shock (189DD + stun, maybe 400hate?)<br />
<br />
Hmmm tough choice....<br />
<br />
both have 13 bonus damage at level 65, yeah... okay... BoS doesn't look that hawt MAYBE, but in the real world like I said, I have a guildy who wields it and saw it in action for a good while... question is why do you think he ditched his BoC after doing extensive testing?<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, regarding your statement bout how out of line I was basing my examples on very high end weapons? DUDE, it doesn't matter what weapon you have, the SAME agro equation still works on ALL weapons.  Ratio, procs (and rate of procs), bonus damage, etc. etc. are still at work.   Low end weapons SHARES the same agro equation as the high end ones IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You're still not looking at the bonus properly.  Yes, they both have 13 bonus.  But the BoC and GBoS apply the bonus much more often than the BoS!<br />
<br />
Go parse this weapon with yalp or eqcompanion.  I think you'll find that 23/26 = 14/18 for DPS.  The ratio advantage is washed out by the damage bonus.<br />
<br />
As for aggro, the bonus matters more for aggro than it does for DPS.  That's not just a theory, that's been proven with aggro experiments.  Look at that library thread.<br />
question is why do you think he ditched his BoC after doing extensive testing?<br />
For the stats, or for vanity, I suspect.  Why not ask him? :) Only he knows for sure.  I know warriors who dumped BoC for a GBoS too, after using both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When you are in a time/Qvic  guild, you will start to realize that your BoW isnt the king of agro because of its massive bonus damage against one handers... isn't that what you are thinking why I was wrong?<br />
<br />
Alright, here's the problem, you're not seeing what they're saying.  First of all, BoW has no room for comparison in this discussion because it is a 2 hander and as we all SHOULD know 2 hander DB works differently.<br />
<br />
So, no that isn't what they are thinking why you were wrong.  What they are saying is that if you have a 20 delay weapon and a 26 delay weapon WITH THE SAME DAMAGE BONUS, both main hand, the 20 delay weapon is going to apply that damage bonus more often.  By applying that damage bonus more often the 20 delay weapon is going to naturally cause more aggro.  By the same token a 20/20 weapon is better dps than a 26/26 weapon.  Because the damage bonus is applied more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd take a BoS over a BoC<br />
<br />
/shrug ... with anger3 it's aggro is just peachy, and it's stats/ratio rival some of the best EP weapons.<br />
<br />
I'd mainhand the GBoS and offhand the BoS.  The dps and aggro on that combo would be surely nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In fact, that's kinda easy to explain why a faster weapon get more advantage of the amage bonus (1h only, 2h formulas are a little more complicated)<br />
<br />
Take Two weapons: 10/20 and 15/30 (dmg/delay) thses have the same ration (DMG divide per delay)<br />
<br />
lvl 65: dmg bonus 13.<br />
<br />
Consider you have a damage mod of x2<br />
<br />
Each 2s with the first weapon, you do a random number between 1 and 2x10=20 with is the damages you do (i don't know all the formulas but that's kinda random, just beeing more important with more attack and less if the mob have huge def). Add to this number the damage bonus, consider you have same chances to do 1 or 20, the balance is 21/2=10,5, on wich you add the dmg bonus: 13, then each 2s you will swing for 23,5 if you take the average number.<br />
<br />
For weapon 2 it will be between 1 and 30 then 15,5+dmg bonus average each 3seconds, wich mean 28,5 each 3s.<br />
<br />
Now take and interval of 1min<br />
<br />
-30 swings of the first weapon, basically withouth dmg bonus: 30x10,5=315 dmg<br />
<br />
-20 swings of the second one, withouth dmg bonus: 310dmg<br />
<br />
Numbers are basically the sames, but, now add the damage bonus:<br />
<br />
-3 swings of the first weapon: 705dmg, damage bonus add 390 dmg<br />
<br />
-2 swings of the second weapon: 570 dmg, damage bonus add 260dmg<br />
<br />
Then the first weapon, as beeing faster, take more advantage of the damage bonus because it's a static bonus for 1 handers. Theses numbers are arbitrary because they are average and not counting the attack and such value, they they are not exact but they are close to be, ne need to flame me on that :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tip makes my brain hurt.Dude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tipoytm, if the ratios on two weapons are the same (15/30 vs 10/20), then the faster one wins because it will have more DPS with the damage bonus being applied more.  Procs aside, it should also have more agro because of the increased DPS and increased swings (swings themselves increase hate too).<br />
<br />
Bpth the BoS and BoC probably generate &quot;enough&quot; agro though, so maybe your guildie friend ditched his BoC for more stats and some extra $$ for other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hrmm perhaps a different tack will help...<br />
<br />
Tip your argument for ratio on the surface looks right; hell its how we looked at EQ back in year 1 (1999-2000). However you are overlooking:<br />
<br />
1. The fact that while procs scale (so you see the same procs per minute regardless of delay), the damage bonus does not.  So with a faster weap with the same *relative ratio* you will see the faster weapon giving more consistent DPS agro.<br />
<br />
2. As far as those two procs go...I cant see with high WA the EB proc not completely owning the stun for agro.  The proc rate should be about the same (2x per minute or 4x with WA5).<br />
<br />
3. I can see the lower ratio weap gaining more solid agro *over time* than the Boc if the warr has a crap load of aa's.  The problem is that we live by a need for rapid agro...waiting for the dps agro delta to become large enough to make a difference just isnt going to fly.<br />
<br />
I dont know how to respond to your assertion that in the &quot;real world&quot; the Boc loses out.  To be honest I trust your assertion...mayhap there is more here than meets the eye.<br />
<br />
 I'd mainhand the GBoS and offhand the BoS. The dps and aggro on that combo would be surely nice. <br />
<br />
100 pct agree with Apo...it would a nice offhand weap...esp with increased damage AA fer off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ohh I see what the problem is here.. I never meant for the guy to equip GoS on the mainhand... and I kinda missed mentioning that myself cuz I kinda steered away from the main topic and instead focused on that statement where Sassinak said that faster weapons naturally have the better agro.  Because that is not always true. <br />
<br />
Anyway, GoS is a weapon that is best suited for the offhand... of course I know about if given a choice, you got two weapons and there is not much difference in the ratio, always put the one with the better ratio on the offhand and the lesser ratio on the mainhand.  THAT is if you didn't have Sinister Strikes AA.  If you have sinister strikes, then just put the faster weapon on the mainhand (constant 13 damage bonus) because your offhand will have a variable damage bonus (depending on the speed).  <br />
<br />
So if he does this, then he can chose between his BoC and GBoS for his mainhand... BUT, if he can get a hold of GoS, place it on his offhand and don't even think that BoC or GBoS is a better choice for the secondary slot.  Cuz GoS has the better ratio, has a decent proc, and actually is a better weapon for offhand:P   That guildy I mentioned who ditched his BoC used it in offhand, and EoE on mainhand.  Clearly, for offhand, GoS &gt; BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Anyway, GoS is a weapon that is best suited for the offhand... of course I know about if given a choice, you got two weapons and there is not much difference in the ratio, always put the one with the better ratio on the offhand and the lesser ratio on the mainhand.  <br />
<br />
Uh, no.<br />
<br />
Put the faster weapon in your mainhand.  If you have a 13/20 and a 16/20 it would be an extremely bad thing to do to put the 16/20 in your offhand.  It's funny how 'rules' like this get twisted by people who repeat them but don't understand why they are doing it.</div></div><hr />
