<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all know that Pallys and SKs are much better at aggro control than warriors, but of the two, which one is actually the best?<br />
<br />
All the time the class balance issue is put in such terms as &quot;warriors versus knights&quot; or &quot;warriors versus pallys/SKs&quot;, but I have a suspicion that SKs might be basking in the reflected glory of the superior aggro-control of Paladins in order to boost their own credibility as xp tanks and thus gain groups easier.<br />
<br />
From my experience of grouping with both classes, Paladins with their stun spells are head and shoulders above the SK line of aggro spells, but what do you all think?<br />
<br />
Are SKs not as good as Pallys?  If so, how much better are Pallys?  And how much better are SKs than warriors really?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently it's Paladin &gt; SK &gt; Warrior.<br />
<br />
 Ideally it should be SK &gt; Warrior &gt; Paladin.<br />
<br />
 SK have been slightly weakened in the aggro department, but are still head and shoulders above Warriors in the aggro lock component. Paladins have been vastly overblown in the aggro department past both of them, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, but which of these models depicting the relative levels of aggro-lock is most accurate?<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Warriors ------&gt; SKs ------------------&gt; Paladins<br />
<br />
2.  Warriors ------&gt; SKs ------&gt; Paladins<br />
<br />
3.  Warriors ------------------&gt; SKs ------&gt; Paladins<br />
<br />
4.  Warriors ------------------&gt; SKs ------------------&gt; Paladins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 looks most accurate to me.<br />
<br />
 Also, remember, Warriors CAN get aggro lock - it just takes much longer to do so, and they have no innate ability to increase their lead on the hate list, unlike Paladins and SK's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if you took an equally-geared paladin and SK and they had an aggro competition to see who could taunt off of whom, it would be a close run thing.  The paladin would probably win eventually, but it would be closer than you think.<br />
<br />
I also think that a competently-played shadowknight can hold aggro even if you have a slower who slows on inc and a group full of chain-nuking casters.  In other words, a group won't notice the difference in aggro holding; they're functionally equivalent.<br />
<br />
To the cleric or druid or enchanter who's making a group and picking a tank, either knight class has the desired effect.  They both guarantee that the casters won't be thumped.<br />
<br />
I think that shadowknights irritate warriors a bit less than paladins do, when you get warrior and knight in the same group.  Paladins buff the warrior's hp but shadowknights buff the warrior's aggro, so an intelligent warrior prefers the SK.  Besides, while both classes create a lot of aggro just from doing their jobs, the shadowknight can lose it again while the paladin cannot.<br />
<br />
Thinking casters tend to prefer shadowknights over paladins as well, because the shadowknight doubles as an FD puller and snarer, does noticeably more damage than a paladin, and also contributes a significant amount of mana regeneration (equivalent to FT10, roughly).<br />
<br />
65 SK's are relatively rare.</div></div><hr />

Warrior/Pal/SK<br />
<br />
Snap Agro:<br />
Pal/SK --------------------------------------------------------) Warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
War agro builds up slower and maybe exceeds pal/sk agro<br />
on the long run.<br />
<br />
After 2 3 procs, i know i got enough agro to let the nukers go berserk.<br />
<br />
My DPS + Taunt + Procs  is enough to keep agro locked<br />
(No chain casting SoS wizards, but even a pal/sk cant compete with that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the SK/Paladin balance interesting (and something that should be strived towards for Warriors).  The interesting thing is that both classes can accomplish the same task (solid agro generation) through different mechanisms (different effects and actions).<br />
<br />
The spells and consuptions and effects are all different but net the same effect.  This setup appears to be balanced between the two classes.  What would be stellar is if Warriors got skills so that there is a third way, with different effects and costs, to do the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not 'balanced between the classes' it's snap aggro = yes - anything thereafter is fairly irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Both classes have it relatively easy to hold aggro with minor mana costs and thus any difference is moot and hard to quantify.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet Paladins can get aggro equivalent to an SK's with less mana useage (especially when 'cheating the system' with low level spellcasting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm willing to bet Paladins can get aggro equivalent to an SK's with less mana useage<br />
<br />
however seeing as both classes can get &quot;agro lock&quot; using less mana than their mana regen rate the cost of it is pretty much irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Paladins are probably perceived as better because their utility helps them more in a tanking role - root, backup heals, group heals and stuns reducing damage.  SK's utility on the other hand makes them great pullers, gives them snare (not needed in much of PoP) and increases their DPS.  <br />
<br />
Also with voice lines and FD SK's are not seen competing with warriors so much as with a warrior and a paladin in a group together.  The paladin will steal agro from the warrior with their spells and have no way to mitigate agro, whereas the SK will help the warrior with agro and can FD if the draw too much themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll go on record as saying that it really doesn't matter, and any pissing contests that they have add nothing.   Most high end wizards claim the SK is the better at aggro because...<br />
<br />
DPS+Voice = already a substantial aggro advantage before casting a spell, add darkness magnified by VoT and you're pretty much on top of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im willing to say Sk &gt; pal &gt; war as for holding aggro.  Sk's on top with their voice line and hate spells.  FD also being useful to ditch aggro if they dont want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One Word. Fear.<br />
<br />
Thats one of the utility spells of the SK. Low mana High aggro and when it sticks while the mob is snared a damage reducer better than the high level stuns.<br />
<br />
The aggro of fear isnt really lower than the aggro of a cease or other low level stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;(especially when 'cheating the system' with low level spellcasting).&quot;<br />
<br />
The above poster beat me to it. Fear is an popular spell SKs use to get aggro on mobs, especially in light of the level limit on fearable mobs.<br />
<br />
SK's also have their darkness spells, which they use to pull and it creates a nice bit of initial aggro.<br />
<br />
Along with Debuffs, and DoT's with counters on them.<br />
<br />
They're not hurting for aggro tricks.<br />
<br />
As Frodlin says, it's really a pissing contenst not worth having. Both classes have a wide variety of tricks and spells available to them that allow them to get the mob's attention very fast.<br />
<br />
The only reason paladins take so much more heat from warriors around here is Paladins visit this board to troll more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That and the ratio of Paladins to SK's is about, what, 5 to 1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sk's are less visible than pallies, but no less viable for agro. Clinging darkness (20 mana), voice, debuffs, dot's, and those eb-like pure agro spells they have that cast in like a second. Well played sk's don't take a backseat to anyone in the agro lock department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, Paladins arent good at controlling aggro, they're good at getting it and keeping it, they don't have any way to ditch aggro if they need to.  SK's are really, really good at controlling aggro, they get get it and lose it as they chose; hopefully by dumping it all on a warrior and letting him tank. :)</div></div><hr />
