<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarevok Gibran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have a 2-hand mithril sword on my war which is 21/41 and has worn ability of haste, would the haste from that sword also stack with haste from an fbbs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarevok Gibran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">:(  ok thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To elaborate on that, one spell, one item, and one song.  Those things will stack together, one of each.  If you have two haste items you should get the best of the two, in this case, the sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zukobim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If the haste is not placed on the weapons then Beornegar is right.<br />
<br />
In this case he is wrong.<br />
<br />
The DPS ratio on the 2-hand mithril sword is 21/40 (0.53) unhasted.<br />
The effect is a 31% haste, which makes it (21/(40/1.31)=) 21/30.53 (0.69)<br />
<br />
A centi longsword with 14/27 (0.52) would nearly equal the 2-hand mithril sword if both were without haste, but its missing 0.17 to be equal with the hasted one  2-hand mithril sword.<br />
<br />
Buying another Centi longsword for the offhand would give you some additional damage.<br />
We do not really know how much you swing your offhand, but if we can calculate a break-even point.<br />
<br />
14/X= 0.17<br />
<br />
X = 14/0.17<br />
<br />
X = 82.35<br />
<br />
This means if your offhand is triggered in atleast half the swings of your mainhand then its better with 2 centi longswords than a 2-hand mithril sword and this is without haste on the centi longswords.<br />
Add haste from the FBSS and you could use centi shortswords and still be better off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You could buy another centi longsword for the offhand and the rate of this unhasted would easily beat the additional damage from the hasted  2-hand mithril sword</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How am I wrong?  As far as I know, if you have 2 haste items, you get the best haste of the two, which is in this case, the 31% haste on the sword.  I never said the Mith 2h was better than a fbss and dual wielding good DPS weapons, just that if you are using a Mith 2h and a fbss, you'll get the haste of the weapon, because it's a higher percentage.  They don't stack.  Which was the original question in the post.   Personally, I'd ditch the Mith 2h and replace it with a more damaging 2h like a reaver or widebladed greatsword if possible, or a PoJ halberd if you can't afford better.</div></div><hr />

 one spell, one item, and one song. <br />
<br />
The song however must be Battlecry of the VaShir or Warsong of Zek.  These songs truly stack.  If you have enchanter haste and an inferior bard haste, they do not stack.  You might get both icons on your screen but they are not stacking.  This concept is beaten to death here...<br />
