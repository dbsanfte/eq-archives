<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goatslinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i just got my Epic 1.5 and like a good warrior i auged it with 2 a3 augs right away. Then i hear that someone said having 2 of the same proc on a weap is bad or something. Can someone please clarify? I am so confused. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know and have heard, it should be just dandy. They were probably talking about hedging their bets and adding a stun instead of one of the anger 3 augs. I'm sure it'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If there is a bug, it will be fixed eventually.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i think an anger 3 aug and a ykesha aug would work nicely together.  both give anger, and then the ykesha stuns too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have A3 and Ykesha on mine(in offhand) works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There was never a bug. I had 2 anger 3 on mine since I got it. I parsed it for about 2 hours, proc rate was roughly 5.74 with WA5+CE15. There's no way in hell only 1 aug working could sustain that proc rate for 2 hours. In short, 2 anger augs work.</div></div><hr />

The only problem whatsoever that I could see with having two of the same proc in a weapon would be something like a Rune proc or a Guard3 proc etc, where if you had two back to back procs, then the proc is pretty much wasted, where if you had one guard3 or one rune proc and one anger proc, back to back procs would actually have an affect.</div></div><hr />

Ummm...except Anger3 isn't any type of buff, it's a straight 600 INSTANT hate. How could it not stack and have an effect even if it did proc back to back? o.O</div></div><hr />

He was giving an example of 2 potential augs that could be bad together.<br />
<br />
He never at any point suggested anger augs would not stack.<br />
