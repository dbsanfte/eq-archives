<br />
If you fall out of the boat you CAN get back into it.<br />
<br />
I can solo a light blue, but just barely.<br />
<br />
Berzerkers can't wear fungi tunics.<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn't wind up playing much in Beta 8)<br />
<br />
Oh, I did talk to one guy with a buffed Berzerker and he was wearing ornate armor that had exactly the same ac/hps as rogue and ranger stuff so that should give you an idea of their tankability.</div></div><hr />

I've heard they can, but I've never actually seen a link of one to check for myself.</div></div><hr />

I have a Fungus Patch vest and yes Berzerkers can wear them, only downfall is that it is Required level 51</div></div><hr />

<br />
but you could always get back on a boat :D .. you just got to get in front of it and it sweeps you inside</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoD boat doesn't move.  It just sits there, and you talk to an npc to port you to one of a few places.  But under it around the middle I think there is a platform that you can get up onto, with stairs up to the rest of the boat.  I don't really have much info to give about GoD other than basics though, shortly after joining Beta something had come up that took a lot of my time =\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They added boats the other day not sure if they will be live but they took the wayfayer translocator scouts out.<br />
<br />
If you like boats Cyan mobs that DD process for 550 and are wearing elemental or Time gear you'll like GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casca</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah, the scouts were taken out, not sure if it will stay that way as the boats a bit buggy.<br />
<br />
Starting out from the platform of Abysmal Sea to Nadaria's Landing, so far, I was never able to zone over in the same time the boat did, if the boat zoned over (or whatever) at all. Usually after zoning over, I ended up swimming to shore. From the platform in abysmal again, to the other zone the boat goes to (forgot name, sorry) you better be prepared to jump boat once you get near where you are going, as the boat only stops at the platform you got on it at. And to board the boat from that zone, you need levitation and good timing...as like I said,  the boat only stops at the platform in Abysmal Sea's.<br />
<br />
This should be interesting, totally caught me by suprise, wasn't expecting it at all:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Abilities <br />
------------------------ <br />
- Fixed some text on the Focus Will Discipline. <br />
- Assassins Strike should now work correctly. <br />
- Sneak Attack should now work correctly. <br />
- Thief's Vengeance is now working correctly. <br />
- Indirection should now work as intended<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see exactly what they all do. Indirection.....lull pulling for rogues? They have me worried about the chaotic stab being &quot;fixed&quot; so it no longer does full damage. Huh? I never got more then 130 per use out of it and I use it all the time. If it goes any lower then that, it's gonna be bordering right on my normal damage which makes it totally worthless to spend aa points on, so hopefully they give an AA refund. <br />
<br />
Some really cool looking mobs in this expansion and the trade skill window rules. You get recipies for everything, click on the recipie for what you want to make and it will show you in Icons what items you need and how much. I assume if you already have those items on you, it will automatically go into the combine bag where all you gotta do is hit combine. Should make for really fast skill ups, or at least a whole lot less clicking and dragging.<br />
<br />
Content without flags? I really didn't beta as much as I thought I would, so really don't know, but it will be a breath of fresh air to not have to worry about spending an extreme amount of time getting 'flags' so you can raid with your guild....or at least, only have ONE or maybe two zones where the elite uber don't mind spending 200 hours to get flagged people can go and not the whole damn expansion.</div></div><hr />

that'll cost you some more RL pics....  /ducks <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoD is pretty cool overall.   Kind of a mix between Luclin and LoY.   Encounters are fairly drastically different from what you're used to, they've come up with some seriously cool new tricks and others that are ultra gay (muich hate for low-life AC boosts), but for the most part, they're pretty cool.    Instanced zones are quite awesome, since the instanced dungeons aren't &quot;Adventures&quot;, but simply zones, there's respawn, and you can have someone leave and invite someone else into the instance.  The same is true for raid instances.<br />
<br />
The boat is gay, there's too much happenning on it.<br />
<br />
Kiters in Natimbi are going to hate the word &quot;Queen&quot;, I am going to be consistently amused by spending my free time watching kiters in Natimbi.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Sewers&quot; between zones are almost perfectly copied from the lower levels of Vivec in Morrowind.<br />
<br />
Demons invading the earth is pretty cool<br />
<br />
I got a nice 30hp/30mana/30endurance type 7 aug from a mini boss in one of the zones that took 6 people to kill pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Since most of my gear has type 8 aug slots, it sucked</div></div><hr />
