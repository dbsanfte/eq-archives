<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've checked the ferubi thread in the library and still don't see much about spawn times.  Is there some trick to getting the mini named to spawn more?  On my guilds last 3 runs there we've had horrible named spawn rates.  I have the map showing the rooms they spawn in and we clear those rooms.  But months ago I went with another guild a couple times and had much better spawn rates.  The worst now was last night.  We were clearing mobs for 3 hours or so and got 1 named the entire time.  And yes, we had rangers tracking for them.  The spawn rate is bad enough now I don't think I'll continue running mini raids there for my guild.  It's just not worth it.  We got 1 named who just dropped an aug and no random drops off the couple hundred mobs we must have killed.<br />
<br />
Someone said a guild went through to raid the smith earlier in the day and killed several minis along their way.  I thought that had nothing to do with whether minis would be up hours later though.  My understand was that the minis spawn in place of a PH and could spawn anytime the room respawns.  <br />
<br />
Also, just curious, anyone know if mobs back by the Smith/Packmaster area are hasted?  We've noticed the dps goes way up on the trash mobs in that part of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on which nameds you're referring to.  In my experience there are 4 different 'types' of nameds in Ferubi:<br />
<br />
1.)  Nameds with PH's  --  These mobs have actual placeholders and have a chance to spawn if that PH is consistantly killed.  Examples of these are Hexxt N`Vak Tkan, Pxet Vzanki Kzan, Hexxt Pzik Shziaak.  My favorite place to camp for nameds is just south of where the east and west routes converge.  It's where you make the turn either to smith rhondo or Zum Votal.  There are 4 PH's and 2 'master' spawns you can pull with 1-2 groups (1 group would need to have seriously crazy DPS to pull all 4)<br />
<br />
2.)  Nameds that just *shrug* spawn for some reason  -- These would be the various Pxet Elite XXXXXX's.  There are 4 places these guys spawn, and I've never understood how they spawn.  Basically, every so often, if you're in the area, they'll spawn.  I've seen them be up when I walk through, and I've seen them refuse to spawn after clearing their area for 3-4 hours.  They have no PH that I can determine.<br />
<br />
3.)  Triggered nameds -- Namely, Smith Rhondo and the Weaponmaster.  Raid combat, all the way.<br />
<br />
4.)  Raid nameds -- These would appear to have the standard 'raid mob' respawn time, require a decent raid force to take down, and the only two I'm aware of in Ferubi are the Packmaster and Zum Votal.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

the misc named are popped by killing mobs, no set time - if you look at the map, there are 5 small rooms on the way to the named rooms (pm/smith/muram) - there are 4 of them. In these 4 rooms, the smith parts drop.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm... well, we killed a hell of a lot of mobs with 30+ people in Ferubi on Sunday and only 1 of those named spawned the entire 3 hr+ time.  (elite spearmaster)  That kind of spawn rate just isn't worth it.  I was following a map I have that shows the rooms different named spawn in.  <br />
<br />
going in from qinimi, at the first intersection we take a right and that soon leads to a room where an elite can spawn.  If you want you can make a loop through 4 rooms near there that can supposedly all spawn a named.  I'm not sure if they each have just 1 PH or if various mobs in the room can be a PH.  Room #4 is a large room with a statue in the middle.  The map says a named can spawn there but I've never seen it in 6 or 7 Ferubi runs.  Deeper in the zone from there you can take a right for the Smith and packmaster or a left for... I forget.  Back right near Smith and Packmaster there are rooms marked #11 and #12 on my map where named can spawn.  We completely cleared those too, again not knowing if there's 1 PH or multiple.  That area is where the mobs are really a pain with very high dps.  <br />

The named you list are on my map, but again I'm not sure if each one has 1 PH or multiple PHs.  We just kill the entire room they're shown to be in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From what i recall the pixxt elite X are best spawned by killing stuff at random, they dont have traditional placeholders in that you kill something in their room to get them to spawn, but rather certain areas of the zone every mob is a placeholder for one of them.<br />
This is my experience and also what i've read from some &quot;official&quot; source in a patch note or on a forum somewhere. The &quot;official&quot; answer i think might have been in the patch note of the patch that changed it so you didnt get 15 or so pixxt elite stacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Callon, is that a map that you can share?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is this the map from the Library or something different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been to ferubi a couple times to farm parts for the weaponmaster hand in. So far I have the blademaster and the spearmaster parts. First time I went blademaster was up in zone already, easy enough. Second time I went to camp spearmaster, we were there for several hours and would have cleared his room out 6+ times and got no spawns. Last night I went back, we invised most of the way in then cleared to his room and cleared the room itself. Kept on going towards room #4 and he spawned behind us. Was very happy :) We then moved to the brawler room and cleared everything bar Votal and his two guards, spent an hour or so there keeping everything cleared and didnt get a pop. Whatever it is you do to spawn them, it's very random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vanidor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Elites are linked to clearing mobs in the rooms around them, not a timed or placeholder mob apparently. They did fix one bug which could have multiple elites stacked on top of each other. <br />
<br />
From what I've read you basically have to clear a certain number of pops linked to the elite's spawn code. For the Blademaster and Spearmaster its actually plowing north? of their spawn points. Since most raids come from Qinimi to Blademaster, he almost always gets spawned. But if a raid goes east from there to the Spearmaster point... they didn't clear north of Spearmaster. So they have to either go north for a bit till Spearmaster spawns and double back, or plow from Barindu to it. I'm assuming it is something like every mob linked to the elite gives you a 3% chance or some number to spawn the elite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The named you list are on my map, but again I'm not sure if each one has 1 PH or multiple PHs.  We just kill the entire room they're shown to be in.<br />
<br />
Using this map:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=376 <br />
<br />
I've found the best place to camp for nameds is just south of the room labeled 4 (at the inverted T).  The PH in 4 is the center spawn on the north wall (Hexxt Pzik Shziaak, drops the 36% haste augment and some other stuff, archer mob). <br />
<br />
To the east, where the hallway suddenly does a sharp dogleg left (enroute to room labeled 6), is another static PH (Hexxt N`Vak Tkan, archon mob, hits for 1500's but not all that hard).<br />
<br />
In the room labeled 11, the SW corner mob is the PH...not that you'll be able to pull it w/o clearing the room prolly anyway (Pxet Vzanki Kzan, bug-chick).<br />
<br />
The room with the Elite Brawler is extremely difficult to pull with a small crew...tons of roamer dogs and mobs along the walls...coupled with a stairway leading up into it.  That plus the water on the sides make it a mighty tough pull.  Beware.  The Elite Hammermaster's room, you're probably going to pull anyway, so it's a bonus.<br />
<br />
The Rav Ptvin PH is a wandering dog that wanders the north-south passage above the area marked 3.  The Hexx Gkon PH is in the SW corner in front of a pillar of the room marked 2.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I've never had the chance to observe exactly which spot is the PH for the named in 12...but I've heard tracking reports when they were up (when of course we weren't pulling them).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...I really like this area, though I really wish there were less wanderers and a slightly safer spot to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The map Aurthur posted is the one I'm referring to.  It's in the library.  We usually come in through Qinimi and go down to room #1.  Sometimes that elite is up when we get there, sometimes it isn't.  The last couple of runs it hasn't been.  We then usually go clockwise around to rooms 2, 3, and 4, clearing the rooms and hallways on the way to them completely and we've never gotten named in #2 or #4.  On the last run finally #3 spawned for us for the first time of probably 8 to 10 clears of that area, but it was probably almost an hour after we'd passed through the hallway SW of there.  We were down between room 11 and 12 when our trackers noticed the named in #3 up.  <br />
<br />
I know we always kill the mobs on the north side of room #4 as we're passing through, but we've still never once had the named spawn in that room.  We've also cleared 11 and 12 a number of times.  We got the named in #11 once or twice on the next spawn cycle.  The other 5 or so times we've cleared that room no named spawn.  And as I said that area is a pain in the butt to clear.  The mobs have very high dps.  Are they hasted?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.  I think we've been killing most or all of the PHs you mentioned except the one in the hallway on the way to room #6.  We usually go toward 11/12 instead.  I'll print off those suggestions and make sure we're hitting everything next time.  Just seems like the named spawn rate still blows lately.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vanidor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've seen the named in #2, we setup near his spawn point but in a corner and pulled the entire room a few times and he popped. Some ukun's patrol through along the walls there and like to jump you when your pulling from another way :) <br />
<br />
The elites in #1, and #3 don't have to just be linked with mobs north of them, but mobs around their room in a way, the example I gave was on how plowing from the zone in's through the mobs north will pop them. The same with #6, and #11.<br />
<br />
This was a thread where a developer posted Elite's were not timed or a placeholder spawn.<br />
