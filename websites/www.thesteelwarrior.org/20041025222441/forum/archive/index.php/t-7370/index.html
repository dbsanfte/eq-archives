<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">based on my magelo and assuming im not a complete fucking moron. should i be able to tank in any of the GoD zones or in any of the trials? I've tried 3 hard ldons, tanked one fine, the other 2 werent issues with my tanking as much as issues with no cc or bad pulling and they never got past the first room. I dont have any problems tanking normal ldon and i tank bot wing bosses ok, minis are no problem at all. so assuming a competent puller, good cleric, and a slower what should i be able to tank? i havent tried because i didnt know if i was ready and i hate letting folks down by splatting too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GoD zones up to and including Ferubi, yes, you can tank there fine.<br />
<br />
Sewer #1, no, not until you get more defensive AA's<br />
Sewer #2, probably<br />
Sewer #3, have not tanked this one but I have heard it is along the same lines as Sewer 2.<br />
Vxed, No. Not for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hardest thing about GoD trials is staying awake through them. GoD trials bore me to death</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">GoD mobs hit like mack trucks. =/<br />
<br />
The mobs in Vxed, for instance, put Plane of Fire second castle &quot;tables&quot; mobs to shame as far as tanking is concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Finish your tank AA abilities and Sturdiness. Put the 10AC LDoN aug in every slot possible and then do they same with the 40HP aug. At that point you will have the AC, HP's, and AA abilities to give it a try and have a chance of getting somewhere. Something like 6600HP's 1420AC and all your tanking AA's will make a big difference.<br />
<br />
GoD may be a new expansion and all, but at this point your best bet is grinding out AA's and doing LDoN.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are very similar in gear and AA to me. I can tank Purifying plant with no problems in my normal group. However, my normal group is war/cleric/druid/bard/ranger/misc dps. Having a backup healer increasses your chance of success a lot, and can make up for some shortcomings in gear or AA. <br />
<br />
I guess what im saying is that the answer to your question can vary depending on who you've got in the group with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMO your better off sticking to LDoN.  Your gear reflects a non-raider, and royal attendant is awsome armor for that classification. You can check out the sewer trials, but anything beyond that is going to be very tough, wether you are super skilled or not, warriors are completely gear depedant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There was a similar question posed about 1 week + ago on GoD tanking.<br />
<br />
This is a version of it:<br />
<br />
1. Natimbi - Qinimi - Riwwi are relatively easy, the mobs hit for 400+ max (Riwwi).<br />
2. Barindu - Ferubi are a bit harder, mobs hit from 500+ to 1k+<br />
3. Vxed - Tipt - Kod`Taz mobs hit 1k+ often<br />
<br />
The recent retuning patch did lower the difficulty level of the mobs, as they hit for max-dmg a lot less now. However, they still do hit for max dmg, so if nothing else, this has made for a more spikey pattern in the damage from the mobs, making it hard for healers.<br />
<br />
Considering a full 6-person Group:<br />
For (1), I'd guess 6 - 7k buffed hp, 1.3 - 1.4k AC is enough<br />
For (2), I'd guess 8k buffed hp, 1.5 - 1.6k AC is enough<br />
For (3), I'd recommend 9k buffed hp, 1.65 - 1.7k AC minimum.<br />
<br />
The above are assuming full defensive AAs btw. Although they do attack for max dmg a lot less now, you'd still want to avoid or mitigate as much dmg as possible, since you have to factor in the Chaos Claws proc, as well as the spikey dmg pattern.<br />
<br />
Based on your Magelo, I'd put you between (1) and (2), so that means tanking in Riwwi, Barindu should be no problem. Ferubi could be a good testing ground to see how you stack against the mobs there. Sewers, Vxed, Tipt are a definite no-no at your stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Although our stats are close I am tanking in first trial sewers cause of the 100 extra AA I have over you. I only have one cleric for healing but the mobs die fast cause I also have 3 wizards, and the chanter slow helps also most time (as does his color cloud heh)..... I get to the guy to hail with no problem as long as I don't pull 2 mobs at one time.... <br />
<br />
Its really about the AA, you need to get more defensive AA so you can tank. <br />
<br />
100 AA more is going to serve you way better then 1000HP more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10"></div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">looked for group for a loooong ass time today and finally took a guy up on sewer trials offer. group is me, cleric bard shammy mage and monk. did good til mob past the hail mob gated and started summoning :(<br />
cleric is dragging now, i think i might actually have a chance at this thing :)<br />
<br />
LR5 seems to help, altho i figgured i would get hit harder than i am-yaaay non max hit patch<br />
<br />
not really having any aggro issues<br />
<br />
playing around with diff disc's, i think i like evasive here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well we did fail but it wasnt a tanking issue, we had a runner while the bard was LD and cleric got killed this time so it ended teh attempt. looks liek with a good cleric (i think he was pretty good at least) i actually can tank the trials. altho i al gonna finish the CS and ID lines for sure.  i think doing the trial was a good step for me. i didnt have any aggro issues in there so im almost positive now that when i DO lose aggro to non uber beastlords and rangers that maybe, just maybe its not really my fault lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I sure wouldn't want you tanking for me when I play my druid if that answers your question.  Finish off your defensive aa's and get some good ac upgrades first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow nice answer......  He probably wouldnt want a damn druid healing him either  :rolleyes: <br />
I mean WTF.  You wouldn't have him tank a moss snake with you healing or you wouldnt want him to tank Tier 4 with you healing.  Constructive advice beats the hell out of assinine comments like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">He isn't far off the mark in recommending him getting the Defensive AAs and more AC though.<br />
<br />
He tried it out in Sewers, which, in a way, is very similar to Ferubi. I asked him to try out Ferubi to see if he was able to tank in there. As it turns out, barely able to, with the LD of a member or aggro of a cleric (killing the healer) being the reason for failing.<br />
<br />
However, this begets another question - How did the Cleric get aggro and get killed? <br />
a. More than 1 mob pulled?<br />
b. Cleric got heal-aggro on single pull?<br />
<br />
If it's a), then the puller needs some work, or the CC needs some work.<br />
If it's b), then you definitely need more aggro.<br />
<br />
Btw, you do not seem to have any Haste item. Why is this so? Are you depending on Tribute Haste? If so, then what happens if you die and get ressed back? No more haste at all? Pls try to get a decent haste item (even a Soulscream Belt is decent).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Since when do ya have to reapply for tribute stuff when you die?<br />
<br />
I think you got off track somewhere along the way there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh yeah.. it's when you click off tribute, that's when you need to re-visit tribute master to start it again......... nm, my mistake. Hehe, never used tribute before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow nice answer......  He probably wouldnt want a damn druid healing him either  :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
Please note, I never said nor implied that when playing my druid I would not also have a cleric there.  I said druid to illustrate when i'm not playing my warrior.  Let me quote back to you what you said here, &quot; Constructive advice beats the hell out of assinine comments like this.&quot;  My comment WAS constructive yours was not.  Don't be an ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ok, to start with i use tribute haste at 41 percent, full tribute hp and lv 4 tribute ac.<br />
<br />
tanking defintiely wasnt the problem in the sewer trial. it was lack of CC/snare<br />
<br />
we wiped 2 times, first time a mob gated and started summoning so the cleric camped and we recovered. the second time, the bard died in the water invising past some stuff and he went ld. we drug body to the other side of the water tunnel and  monk pulled and when mob got low on life it ran. nothing else up to this point had run and the couple i pulled out anklesmasher on to see if they would run said immune to movement speed change which means they shouldnt run. well liuke i said, this mob was different and it took off running and its friends got mighty pissed off and since the bard(who was back in game but not rezzed yet) was laying on the floor, we had no way to deal with the many adds we got and we wiped. those are not tanking related problems. we had an instance where bard got too close to mon pulling and got 2 mobs aggro on him, he went down incredibly fast but i was able to ae taunt and hold aggro on them both til we killed them and then rezzed bard and continued.<br />
<br />
if a competent cleric AND your druid couldnt keep me alive, its you sucking, not me bub. i stayed up just fine with cleric healing and shammy tossing a heal here and there<br />
<br />
need 1 aa to finish combat stability. after that the 15 to finish CA line will go fast. then the tanking aa's are done and then i MIGHT be a half ass worthy tank in your eyes right?<br />
<br />
i did add 10 ac aug to my neck, kinda hesitant to get it for other items because i know i want to upgrade them as soon as possible. will probably work on getting another 40 hp aug for my boots to make them last longer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While I agree that the entire group needs to work well together, do I understand correctly that you didn't even fight the boss at the end of the trial?  The boss is the only thing thats hard to tank there as he can 1 round most non-defensive toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Gorlab has gotten better at reading comprehension (2)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh I you want to be an ass you're welcome to.  You asked if you were ready for GoD tanking.  No, in my opinion you are not.  I have seen rangers tank GoD mobs before (after the real tank died of course) and live, does that make them &quot;ready to tank GoD&quot;?  No of course not.  But if you want to ask a question, get an answer you don't like and ignore it go for it.  Who cares if you are ready or not if you and your group are having fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Don't listen to Gorlab, he doesnt know what he's talking about.<br />
<br />
You're plenty ready for tanking in sewer trials.  You dont NEED all the defensive AAs.  You dont NEED X pieces of ornate.  And you dont NEED x ldon augs.  All you NEED is a competent group at your gear level.<br />
<br />
And Gorlab, you were the ass first, not him.  When he's telling you that the trash he tanked (which hit for 1k) were a breeze, then I'm sure that the named (what, like triple 1400?) will be difficult but not impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The named is not very difficult at all with defensive. I had moderately better gear/aa when I tanked him before the retuning and he was no problem with cleric and paladin healers. I would recommend 2 healers for him to pick up slack in a bad flurry, but you are more than okay.<br />
<br />
My biggest suggestion for the tanking the sewers is to bring a rogue for the rest of them and then you will hardly even have to tank at all since they can sneak through almost the entire expedition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How up to date is your Magelo?<br />
<br />
Comparing magelos for Gorlab and Ibithor I see a difference of 298 hps, 81 AC and 41 spent AAs. <br />
<br />
where is the threshold where Ibithor becomes able to tank GoD? You must know, because you speak as if you are capable of tanking GoD.<br />
<br />
Does he need 3 more hps or is it 5 more ac and 10 spent AAs?<br />
<br />
Enlighten us, please.</div></div><hr />

Without 120AAs and 10k buffed hp.107AA and ~9k buffed hp is not really that far off. :)<br />
 <br />
I am guessing that ibithor's magelo has improved since this thread started.  I didn't really pay attention to this thread at the time.  107AA and 9k is enough for the sewer trials.</div></div><hr />

You said he wasn't good enough to do it.  You told him to finish up his defensive AAs (he hasnt) and get some ac upgrades (i dont think he hasnt) before trying.  I said he could do it, and you laughed at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">You have a LONG time to complete Vxed. If you have a group that will stick together for like 5 or 6 hours you can pretty much win by default. The first time my group did this we were stubborn and kept trying to kill the named Ukun and we didn't have any sort of split pulling. It was a huge mess and we wiped at lesat 6 times. Not to mention countless random deaths along the way. We had no intention on trying to win as we were looking for the loot and sure enough we got the message that the quest guy popped and we won even after wiping time after time.<br />
<br />
Keep on trying and don't let anybody say you can't do it. My group of LDoN geared (now we have some KT loot) is working on the second Ikkinz trial and according to all the advice we were barely supposed to beat Tipt let alone get past the Diabolic Destroyer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Just wanted to toss my 2c in. I did this trial (sewers 1) last night w/7750hp and 1350 ac and only cs1 and ca2. We didn't finish, had to evac right before the stonemite room because a noc's rampage was eating the cleric up, but other than that we had no deaths and were able to continually move with zero downtime. We decided not to go back in adn try again since it was 4:30 am est.<br />
<br />
Group consisted of:<br />
<br />
me<br />
65 bard<br />
65 bst<br />
65 mage<br />
65 druid<br />
65 cleric<br />
<br />
None of us had VT or elemental gear. So I think the skill of the player makes as much of a difference as stats. We even did 2 named along the way and they were pushovers. I didn't try any of the trials before the re-tune so I can't say how hard they used to be, but a bazaar equipped warrior should be able to do the sewers just fine with a competent healer.</div></div><hr />

Its usually not a matter of what you can or can't do, but how effecient you'll be when you do it.  Tipt/Vxed mobs are down right nasty as all hell.  They beat the stuffing out of me for sure.  Its entirely up to you, and you're groups' confidence in you and ability to heal and keep you alive.  Its fair to say that non ep geared and without max def AAs and a certain amount of AC/HPs that Vxed/Tipt will be extremely hard on a tank and subsequently on the folks trying to keep you alive.  But not impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Dracillon:<br />
<br />
I'll second that. I successfully tanked tipt through the cragbeast event yesterday, with a cleric and a shaman healer. I was running maxed hp/ac tribute, and dinged ca1 during the event, putting my stats at 8144/1425 I think. It was brutal to say the least, but there wasn't really anything preventing us from succeeding, with some good charm luck for jhiru. FT6 cleric was oom a lot, so we ended up trying to do 3 mobs in a row with discs on, then med for mana and disc repops. I'm probably going to go do some more ldons and try the sewers before I go back to tipt, however. <br />
<br />
If you've got a solid crew that likes a challenge, give GoD a shot. The events all have graveyards, so it's not like theres any great risk if you wipe hard.</div></div><hr />
