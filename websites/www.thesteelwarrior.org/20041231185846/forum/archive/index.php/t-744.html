My guild Obsidan Coven made its first in house attempt on the Behemoth in PoI tonight. Not only did we have a record guild showing of sixty people but we took the Behemoth down to 4% before he ate us! The fight was a complete rush. The only guilds that I am aware of that have beaten the Behemoth are currently in the Elemental planes so it goes without saying that I couldn't be prouder of my guildmates right now for being so close to winning. It just another in a huge string of accomplishments and feats within the last month including in house AoW kills, our first Arch Lich and High Priest kills, and continued record raid attendance. Not to mention that we do this all while having a blast.<br />
<br />
We're coming for you in five days Behemoth, pack your bags for Freeport!<br />

<br />
We had 1 group of 5 people at each corner(20) handling adds, and about 50 total so we had 30 on behemoth.<br />
<br />
I was Main tanking, and had 4 clerics and a bard in my group.  We engage, people go full burn, guildies are dieing everywhere.<br />
<br />
I do a /who GUILD and get 50 people at the start<br />
<br />
Behemoth is at 75%, I do a /who GUILD and we have 40 people<br />
<br />
Behemoth is at 50%, I do a /who GUILD and we have 33 people<br />
<br />
Behemoth is at 40%, I do a /who GUILD and we have 27 people.<br />
<br />
The only people we had alive at that point were the corners, my group of me 4 clerics + bard, and 1 rogue that managed to resist the AEs.<br />
<br />
You know, me, the bard, and that rogue (who managed to continue to resist AEs) actually sat there and beat behemoth dead from 40% with 7 people.  It took like 2-3 more minutes.<br />
<br />
I died with Behemoth at 2%, rogue died with Behemoth at 1%, and the bard got the kill shot.<br />
<br />
Quite a rush :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW not sure if you meant on your server, but my guild has killed behemoth a couple of times and is nowhere near Ele planes hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, what he's saying is there is no inbetween elementals and down to behemoth.  'Nother words, once we get past this block (which I heard we dropped him last night, but I was at my bachelor party, that and something about flags being f'd up) we'll be the only ones at the time doing everything up to rallos (zek twins, mith, etc etc) besides ele guilds back flagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">grats fellas.<br />
<br />
 /mutters something about all the blockage for elemental flags on his server between nearly elemental guilds and elemental guilds :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye Brokkah I ment on my own server. On Cazic-Thule the only other guilds that have beaten the Behemoth to my knowledge are The Relentless, Shadowed Soul/Divine Alliance, and Cohort Chalybeius/Talons. I do not recall if the Nomads of Norrath/Verendi Arcanum alliance has taken the Behemoth down or not but they most likely could if not. The pride we're all taking in this is that all of these above guilds are Vex Thal enabled and in the Elemental Planes while we are just keying up for Emperor runs. We've come a long way in a short time :D <br />
<br />
And yes we were able to kill the Behemoth on our second attempt. Specials thanks to our many friends who helped fill out our attack force on this run. The Behemoth was down before I managed to load up in POK after taking a dirt nap (damn slacker clerics) Its a pity only a handful could get to the gnome in time to get flagged but we have the Behemoth's number now!<br />
<br />
/takes advanced booking for Vallon and Tallon Zek's trip to Freeport</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hahahaha! Vallon and Tallon Zek down! Fights were fun as all hell too. Tallon set me bouncing around that room like a gnome with a kick me sign. Plus one the best tanks I have in my warrior corp got a brand new Obsidian Scimitar! Welcome to farmed status amigos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surprises me a bit that only 3 guilds should be past behemoth.<br />
I know that we have 3 guilds in elementals on terris and another 4 who can kill Tallon/Vallon Zek.<br />
And another guild or 2 are close to killing Behemoth.</div></div><hr />
