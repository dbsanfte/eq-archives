<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just purcahsed ykresha.<br />
<br />
And I was wondring if there was an offical steel warrior dye combo?<br />
<br />
I saw a picture fo someone wiht their guiles warriors on these bads, like black with red arms, looked really cool.<br />
<br />
Anyone have suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mandragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just corrected the rather egregious oversight of Fierce Herldic NOT being dyed the same color as our patron ass-kicker, Rallos Zek...  Nice deep purple.<br />
<br />
Of course, there's a lot of posers around copying it, so I don't know how long my color scheme will remain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dark purple BP, boots, wrists, hands  <br />
silver arms, helm and legs<br />
<br />
Oh, you need to be a half elf for them to fit perfectly ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Black and red are BOOORING.<br />
<br />
Silver BP, Bracers, Boots<br />
<br />
Dark blue/purple Helm, arms, legs(to hide the lack of ass :p ) gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Eals almost had it right ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't dye your armor.  There are waaaaayyyyy too many color blind or stupid people out there making pink and lime green colored armor suits.  It hurts my eyes when I have to look at these abominations.  You are a warrior.  Warriors adapt to what they find to use in all situations.  Be happy that we are so versatile and can use such a variety of gear.  Leave it the way you found it and be happy that it provides protection for you.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of exceptions I would be willing to make however if they invent transparent dye.  Azlana should immediately dye all of her armor then ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mine was a nice dark blue/green (0 28 28) until I got my Champ's BP a few days ago I changed it over to match my BP (and arms and hands and helm) and it looks quite nice imo, however I seem to be mistaken for a pally more often now =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kritta Didymus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Clear dye? *drool* Hubba.<br />
<br />
As for colors, I'm still trying to figure out what color goes with grey on Kritta. Gnomes just can't wear some colors without being the rump of jokes.<br />
<br />
*mutter mutter* I know, I know. Jokes don't need color. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tasteless dyes are bad, Mmmkay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go with a classic, go indolcite color, I did</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have the same as Ealsur only dark blue instead of dark purple. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I also am a Half Elf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I saw a post on armor dye's once that had color codes for Indicolite, cobalt and a bunch of other combinations.  Anyone know offhand where it was?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am all navy blue except my dark red BP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went classic cobalt blue for my halfling warrior.<br />
<br />
Friend says he looks like bat mite.<br />
<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
For my monk I tried to combine dark green and black for the commando monk style look.<br />
<br />
It backfired, as I get asked for SoW all the time now. Human in dark green chain and leather is obviously a druid or ranger right?<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Then again I caught another monk in bazaar with green/black commando style.<br />
<br />
I felt violated.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I saw a post on armor dye's once that had color codes for Indicolite, cobalt and a bunch of other combinations. Anyone know offhand where it was? <br />
<br />
You can check Lucy for all those combinations for any armor.<br />
<br />
I also agree that dyes are bad..worst choice ever for the game.  I spent a long time being able to judge how useful someone was gonna be to my cause just by looking at them.  Back in the day, the uber warriors wore blue, the ones who had quit for awhile and just came back were wearing Indy brown, and the gimps were wearing orange.<br />
<br />
Guess i'm just old fashioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">115, 135, 200 if you want to be old school (Crafted blue)<br />
<br />
130, 70, 40 is a good one (Copper)<br />
<br />
My armor is all primer grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Here's a color chart if you'd like something to try to go by :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As I always tell people I am the First Bard of Halas, I went with a Lambent Blue look, with silver/white gaunts/bracers/boots/helm.<br />
<br />
The thing that gets me is there are 2 schools of thought on dyes: eyesore colour schemes and monotone black. I hate loud colours (although as one of my guilds MT's I try and use something that makes me stand out) and I'm not a freaking rogue...<br />
<br />
BTW Mekil joo sux0rz ughre :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I may be strange, but I like my armor BLOOD RED....but i carry around vials of dye in case I like to play Mr. Chamelion. (sic?) :D</div></div><hr />
