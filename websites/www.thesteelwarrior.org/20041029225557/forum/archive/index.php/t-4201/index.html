<br />
My guild leader asks me the other day &quot;how can we get you to 9k hps raid buffed?&quot;  <br />
<br />
If you look at my Magelo you will see about what we can do.  BoT tower bosses are easy for us, and we are working towards getting Emp keyed and eventually VT.  We have killed a few of the T2 boss mobs (TT, Grummus, Behe).<br />
<br />
With this gear I can get to 8620ish fully buffed.  Should I ditch some stamina?  Looking for any advice here on gear to raise the hps in the near future.  <br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xiliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Str of Elements for shoulders, easy quest... 50hps<br />
2. Helm of Rzek for your head 40hps<br />
3. Boots of Storm for feet. 20hps<br />
4. Look for a new neck item...~40hps<br />
5. add another CAB 55hps<br />
6. get a blood frenzy, 10hps..:)<br />
your looking at ~220hps with those upgrades with hp AA's you'll get another 20% to that, which should get you where you want to be...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koralak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your gear is pretty good, and if your guild is working on getting into VT, you will reach 9k for sure, especially if you pick up some other drops along the progression (say from Cursed and Emp):<br />
<br />
Cursed and Emperor Examples:<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy would give you +40 HP over your GBoS<br />
Torque of the Wyrmlord +55 HP over your Mummy Wrappings<br />
<br />
VT Examples:<br />
<br />
Umbracite Bracer +30 HP<br />
Belt of Mastery +40 HP<br />
Silver Steel Cloak +60 HP<br />
Earring of Battle +30 HP<br />
Leggings of Fiery Might +35 HP<br />
Crimson Runed Mask +40 HP<br />
<br />
That right there is +330 raw HP, add in ND3 and that should push you to 9k. Granted, getting all of these to drop and being awarded or spending the DKP on them can be dubious at best :D (Never saw a Silver Steel Cloak or Leggings of Fiery Might drop for us ever), but it is possible. From now on, most of your upgrades willhave to be from raid mobs, or possible Hard LDoN missions unfortunately, you have pretty much hit that cap imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do LDoN hard missions.  They drop 90-100 hp items for most slots for the random spawn named.  You should also try and get those +40 hp augs from the EC camp, very nice for increasing hp totals.<br />
<br />
From raid mobs pre-emp here are some things that you can get<br />
<br />
Boots: Boots of the storm from tmax or the studded yttrium boots from seru<br />
<br />
Cloak: Try to move your haste to another spot and try to get 41% haste.  Doz drops parts for a 100 hp 41% haste cloak or for a 100 hp 41% haste bracer.<br />
<br />
Arms: Arch Lich drops some nice 85 hp arms.  You can also use seru's torque in the arm slot for 100 hps.<br />
<br />
Hat: Tormax and Avatar of war both drop 100 hp hats.  Lots of other mobs do also<br />
<br />
Neck: Arch Lich drops 100 hp neck that is not too bad, seru also drops 100 hp neck that has very nice resists<br />
<br />
Belt: Dain belt is pretty nice 100 hps and AoB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have the same problem Dvorak, except my guild already is in VT. Koralak is correct, getting the items to drop and using DKP or being awarded that item is a whole different story. My guild uses a raid point system that still allows for random lottos among the highest raid point earners. That along with the fact we carry anywhere from 6 to 10 warriors at EVERY VT raid and the fact that we're also competing against every other plate class for drops has made it difficult to reach the 9k mark. I'm currently sitting at just over 8700hp if we buff with PoT9 and Symbol, just over 8600 with the virtue route.<br />
<br />
Check out my Magelo, I think I have a few items that you should be able to easily attain, Bile Etched Obsidian Choker for example, that might help you out as far as direction. Plus, any advice from others on my climb to 9k would be welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorz Muaddieb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">VaDynn Drops a 100 hp neck, so does CT.<br />
<br />
Tunare drops a nice 100 hp belt. :)<br />
<br />
Yelinak head yeilds nice haste guants.  Going to vt will get you better gloves though.<br />
