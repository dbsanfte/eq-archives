<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Ive finally gotten around to finishing up some quests.  One of which is the Strength of Elements.  The only Ore i still need is the one from Phinny.  From what ive read he seems pretty easy.  Can I kill him with a level 60 Druid partner?  <br />
<br />
Any tricks I should be aware of or just kill him the old fashion way.  I have visited his lair to get an idea and I can single pull the seahorses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't believe you're gonna be able to do that duo honestly.  Not cause Phinny's tough, but for the fact that the seahorses respawn at a rate of 6 minutes.  Another words, you've gotta kill 6 in 6 minutes... duo I don't think that's happening.  Take 1 group, just don't let any monks come, they be greedy for SoE too. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info.. I was afraid of the respawn time on the horses :(<br />
<br />
Ill probably gather up my usual EXP group (Druid,Pally,Ranger,Rogue) and take them on a little fishing expedition :)<br />
<br />
just don't let any monks come, they be greedy for SoE too. :P<br />
<br />
Fear not, I honestly cannot remember the last time I grouped with a Monk :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A Mage in my guild 3 boxed Phinny with his Lvl 60 cleric and 54 druid. From what he said if you invis and can get past the seahorses on top, down into Phinny's Lair itself, then the lower seahorses dont spawn and ya can have Phinny all by himself.<br />
<br />
Some of the upper seahorses might see through invis, but not all of them so ya just have to be careful sneaking in. Still I wouldnt try it duo with just a druid. Would at least want a cleric along in case of a death. And its usually pretty easy to get help for Phinny since he also drops stuff for the Mage, Wizard and Druid epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but that plan will get the boy killed in about 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
Phinigel floats up and down in his room. <br />
<br />
Your chances of absolutely being sure he is on the bottom when you find the seahorse that doesnt see you and happen to have two on the bottom that don't see you as well is beyond remote.<br />
<br />
Just take 6 people. The pull is actually pretty nasty. You can get all 4 horses at once very easily. They Complete heal each other, which makes life a royal pain. None are mezzable.<br />
<br />
Don't take the encounter for granted just because Phinny has like 14k hps :) You need to make sure people know what they are doing...<br />
<br />
Dying in Kedge = dumb :)<br />
<br />
P.S. Phinigel strips all your buffs, so wear perma EB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did it with Wiz, War (me) and Cle (also me).<br />
<br />
Have the cleric bind right at zone. Have the wizard cast TL to bind on the cleric, have the cleric swim down to pull. The cleric casts something that doesn't harm phinny to pull, dispell magic works great. <br />
<br />
Then once phinny is aggro'd, click yes on the TL box and poof, back at zone in, phinny should warp to you right away. Probably an exploit, flame me if you want. It was the easiest way for me to get phinny solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, wonder if the gate to bind would work using the Druid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He drops something for Rogue Epic too, iirc so there is some motivation there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He drops a lot of epic pieces. ;)<br />
<br />
Wiz Mage Rogue Bard? I think thats some of the ones he can drop hehe.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, wonder if the gate to bind would work using the Druid :)  <br />
<br />
The problem with using the druid to just gate is that it takes time to cast gate. Underwater+mob beating on you - the uber channeling aa's (snicker) = interrupted gate.<br />
<br />
Clicking yes on the TL box involves no cast time.<br />
<br />
Not saying you couldn't do it with the druid, it's just riskier :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't think those seahorses respawn every 6 minutes. I'm pretty sure it's more like 15-20. There are the 4 at the top that are completey MR, then 1-3 guards around phinny himself that aren't very MR if memory serves me correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think those seahorses respawn every 6 minutes. I'm pretty sure it's more like 15-20.

Unless things have changed since I used to do Phinny often, or my memory is just off, those 1-3 guards(&quot;a swirlspine guardian&quot;) are triggered upon the death of a normal swirlspine seahorse.  Each death has a chance to pop a guardian down below.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the recent pathing fixes have eliminated the easiest way for me to single pull Phinny, but it's still not a huge problem.  65 SK, 63 cleric, and 59 mage beat Phinny + 2 CHing seahorse adds.  Even THAT was with me mistiming my HT by a hair and having it blast him down to 1% just before a CH hit him /grumble<br />
<br />
Gaylon, just get some resists... Phinny is a wizard, and he will nuke(including ice comet).  Only hits in the 160s when he's not nuking, and my HT took off about 43% of his health, so he doesnt' have a lot of hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Couldn't you pacify the guards with a 62 chanter or 65 cleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ennya dragonsla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fiction:<br />
The upper 4 Sea Horses are unmezable.<br />
The upper 4 horses are uncharmable.<br />
The upper 4 horses see invis.<br />
The upper 4 horses dont see invis.<br />
Epic drop for druid drops off phini.<br />
There are 6 horses, not 4.<br />
The uper horse that sees invis spawns the Guardian horses.<br />
The uper horse that doesn't see invis spawns the Guardian horses.<br />
Phini's corpse lasts 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Facts:<br />
The upper 4 horses are Charmable and Mezable, they are just very resistant. Think Druid charm.<br />
Some of the horses spawn see invis and some spawn otherwise. There can be 1-4 of eitehr type to a max of 4 total.<br />
Killing the 4 horses up top will spawn 2 guardians deeper in the lair. Sometimes they will spawn on the 1st kill, sometimes on the last. Every time I have it figured out, the next one changes.<br />
Phini drops 4 Epic parts as part of his loot table. A robe for rogue, backbone for bards, Staff for mage, and a staff for wizards. there can be 2 of one or any two of 4, or more often then not, a research page and a enchanter/shaman wand.<br />
The druid epic drops off a corrupted horse which spawns ELSEWHERE in Kedge Keep.<br />
If there are 6 horses in phini's lair, someone attempted phini and failed.  The lower 2 horses are already spawned and 2 more will not spawn.<br />
Lastly, phini can spawn at a level that can leave a 30 minute corpse, but it's rare.<br />
<br />
So, here is some advice. Phini used to rush you when you pulled and he would swim past the horses not agroing most of teh time because he wouldnt' be in range long enough. Unfortunately when they changed the NPC casting rules a while back it drasticly changed Wizard mobs, and Phini is a WIZARD. he will cast like crazy, and if the initial Ice Comet he usually opens with doesn't land, expect Lures. For a lower level raid (30s-50s) spellshield the puller and pretent it's any tough mob. If you're a higher level party (high 50s can do phini if they are skilled, and a 65 of appropriate class can solo him.) just treat it like any Named encounter. If you pull horses, just remember that Complete heal takes a while to cast. Phini has 18k HPs and a high DPS group can kill him before it lands. <br />
<br />
As far as a 60 druid and warrior? I bet you can IF you can get a clean pull. Don't screw around, just pull 4 horses and then phini with the 2 guardians. I bet the druid can charm the top horses and grind down this way. (Charm animal.) If not, evac early cause getting a rez is a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">normally you kill the top 4, usually u can single pull these, but they can path funny and get 2 or 3. after they are dead, puller goes to the other side of the lair and pulls phinny up. if you get him solo, pull him in, if not, puller either FDs or sucks a death. normally you can single pull phinny off the FD as he just sits there while the horses go home first most the time.<br />
<br />
the top 4 are highly MR, maybe they are mezzable, but its so unlikely who cares, they might as well be unmezzable. if you have an enchanter you can pull phinny easy with 1 or 2 adds since the guardians in phinnys lair are mezzable without too much trouble. paladin/cleric might be able to pacify the guardians, not sure, never tried. if your cleric doesnt mind, can bind in the tube up to phinnys lair if things go bad for quick CR. just have to get to corpse fast for eb item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lul the horses with cleric/chanter/bard<br />
pull phiny and kill it<br />
<br />
you shouldnt have trouble killing phiny with 60war/druid its just you wont be able to pull him like that unless what you try is pulling phiny to zone.<br />
<br />
Pulling to zone - I'd send 60 war fully resist buffed since most of horses are clerics and will try to nuke ya instead of meleing. Agro horses Phiny and hope you make it to zone. Zone out war snare Phiny with druid and zone too then wait for horses to leave. Risks - he will probably try to gate and if he does he will probably summon ya pretty quick. I've pulled Phiny to zone before just didnt fight him there.</div></div><hr />

Would Paladin  pacify work also?</div></div><hr />

Probably a few levels to late but i finnaly have my Strength of Elements :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heh grats althought Phiny is definatley not the hardest/most pain in the ass part its Yael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, the druid pulling to zone idea is great ... if he/she has Exodus (insta evac AA).  Hell, they wouldn't even have to bind at zone in, cause thats the safe spot Evac takes you to.<br />
<br />
For that matter, a little cleric spell haste, and a focus ring from mage and the druid could just use egress.<br />
<br />
Grats on your shoulders man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If im not mistaken Egress/Evac/Egress clears aggro?.  Using gate within the same zone does not clear aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>shirmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Killed Phinny with me 63 war, 63 sham, 62 cleric wasnt that hard to do. The amount of time i spent there killing the sea horses i made an aa im always alittle unlucky on spawns. All i did was kill everything in the room Phinny spawned and had 2 adds all three dead at the end.</div></div><hr />

Mage went in and CoH'd me to the kill spot.  Bard pulled with his lull or pacify or whatever ae thing they got (hey, i'm a warrior, i dont' know bard things).   He came back to our kill spot and we waited, and waited.  Phinny warped. We killed.  Easy as cake.  Then ported out. It took more time for me to find Kedge entrance than it did to kill him.<br />
