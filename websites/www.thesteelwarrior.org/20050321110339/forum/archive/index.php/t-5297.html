<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Next Scheduled Update<br />
<br />
Our next scheduled update is planned for February 10th.  This coincides with the launch of EverQuest: Gates of Discord. <br />
<br />
Along with the launch of Gates, these changes are currently on Test server and will most likely go live with the update.<br />
<br />
Tradeskill Interface Upgrade<br />
<br />
Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface.  In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you.  This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it.  Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion.  Clicking the &quot;combine&quot; button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor.  The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination<br />
<br />
The name of the Berserker armor will be changed to Bladesman.<br />
<br />
The beastlord epic weapon will no longer &quot;proc&quot; for wielders below the 46th level.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
So they have no plans to add Endurance to items or do any other melee fixes/changes anytime soon, aparently...</div></div><hr />

Yes they do<br />

the launch of EverQuest: Gates of Discord <br />
<br />
Buy it and get +end items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now we see the gimmick for this expansion.  Hybrids should have to buy GoD to get + mana on their items too.<br />
<br />
They better not think that alone is acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One COULD be charitable and say that they may be reworking the database to add END to old items like they did aug slots.<br />
<br />
 I won't, but one COULD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">before we all get our panties in a bunch. , nobody reads the front page anymore?<br />
<br />
We are in the process of adding +endurance to existing items. It will be about as prevalent as +mana is for hybrids.<br />
<br />
The opening system as it was on Test will probably not return. The goal was to make combat more interesting and add some reactiveness, but the attention required and randomness of it didn't do much to help with the class balance aspect. We'd rather use skills like the Phantom and Incite line, disciplines, and innate abilities to define and refine the class' role.<br />

<br />
Sorry but this statement is NOT mutually exclusive from &quot;current everquest subscribers will need to buy GOD in order to receive said updates&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Note: &quot;GOD&quot; in caps to highlight the holiness of the NDA.  Why this is being brought up OVER and OVER again when this is the SEVENTH additional release to EQ is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantom Call is, as far as I know scheduled to go live with the next patch.<br />
<br />
That's part of Melee Rebalancing II.<br />
<br />
END on items is going to be retroactive, like focus effects being placed on things like Serp Bracers. So you won't NEED GoD to get em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That tradeskill interface sound pretty sweet... I'll have to check that out tonight.<br />
<br />
There must be an abundance of beastlords getting their epics (or having them gotten for them?) or something? Interesting.<br />
<br />
I'm almost positive that +end will NOT require the GoD expansion. It's likely that they will go in with the same patch though. It makes sense, as opposed to having two separate patches. As they are adding endurance to existing items though, it's not going to be specific to GoD subscribers though.</div></div><hr />

The beastlord epic can be done at ANY level provided you have some higher-level help. It made a great twink item.</div></div><hr />

Really...41% haste and a slow proc, decent stats, and awesome effect = win twink item.<br />
<br />
Too bad now =/</div></div><hr />

Although, i hear on the down-low that warriors will no longer go &quot;berserk&quot; instead... <br />

Soandso has become very agitated!! :D</div></div><hr />

I thought for sure the gimmick for GoD would be that you had to buy it to get the tradeskill interface.  I'm pleasantly surprised to see that it sounds like this won't be the case.  As for +END items, I bet they will retro it, if they didn't then that is just wrong.</div></div><hr />
