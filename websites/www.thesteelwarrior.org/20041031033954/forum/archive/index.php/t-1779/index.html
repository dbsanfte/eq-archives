<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings Steel Warriors,<br />
<br />
I just got my hands on a Great Staff of Thunder and have some questions (I'm afraid to try it out as MT on a raid until I hear some feedback here).<br />
<br />
I had been using CHSD in main hand, and blackout offhand when tanking (on raids when using defensive).  <br />
<br />
And in exp groups, when I'm not losing all that DPS because of disc, I've been bagging the CHSD and using Blackout mainhand, and Wraths' Edge offhand.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have experience with the GSoT and a DW setup similar to mine?  I read through a lot of posts talking about GSoT aggro, but didn't find any that compared it to something similar to what I'm using.  I know the proof is in the pudding and I can just test it on a raid, but I'd rather ask around a bit first... rather than risk losing aggro on a raid while I experiment with the aggro from a new weapon.<br />
<br />
If it matters any, I'm not really worried about the DPS (other than as it contributes to aggro generation) because I have a TSBS that I normally use when I am trying to just do DPS without taking aggro.  Haven't parsed the two of them yet, but would expect the TSBS to come out on top DPS-wise.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use the GSoT consatly in xp groups and do fine.  I use the staff to tank non disc during raids, and I'm fine.  I find that the staff puts out very consistant agro from the procs, the CHSD is a little streaky, or procs at like 20% health.<br />
<br />
The GSoT is good agro, but not sure how your other weapons than the CHSD compare to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is awesome agro.</div></div><hr />
