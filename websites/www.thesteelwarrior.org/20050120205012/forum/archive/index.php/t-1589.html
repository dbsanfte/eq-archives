<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My friends at work were talking to me the other day about some post I made way back in the day. So I thought I would repost it here cause it was lost off of the old boards.<br />
<br />
In light of all the interclass bickering, I was thinking about how hard balance really is...<br />
<br />
Just cause they are easy to pick on lets say Beastlords are upset and want um, a better mana regen spell cause chanters mana regen is way uber or something like that. Well then they end up getting a spiffy mana spell and they are happy.<br />
<br />
Well all of a sudden Mages get mad cause Beastlords now have a pet and a spiffy mana regen spell. So they want better pets. Then mages get Mega Uber pets and they are happy.<br />
<br />
This pisses off Wizards cause Mages now have Mega Uber pets and Nukes. So wizards place burning pointy hats all over SoE's front yard until they get better nukes. After three hat stores are laid to ash, Wizards get Gigga nukes and are happy.<br />
<br />
Druids look at the Gigga nukes and wonder WTF is up with that. Then they start another petition to get improved heals. After 1,000,000,000 signatures Druids get Nifty heals and are less bitter.<br />
<br />
Clerics smell something is up with the nifty heals, cause druids get SoW and over 50 billion other powers. Clerics go on a rez strike for buffs. Clerics get Happy feel good buffs after a Dev has to eat an un-rezzed death and looses his level.<br />
<br />
Some Shaman read about these Happy feel good buffs while soloing dragons. The shaman then write hordes of E-mail filled with big words about how the buffs are the worst travesty ever. Devs, confused by the big words, give Shaman Biohazard level 6 dots.<br />
<br />
Necros catch wind of the dots. Necros write long posts filled with more curse words than you knew existed. Necros get Super lifetaps after sacrificing a petting zoo to the dark gods.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights, cause of trickle down hybridness, also get the better lifetaps and shed tears of joy over not being stealth nerfed.<br />
<br />
Bards, however, are broken, and only wish to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Monks get pissed; write 10,000 posts about it and are ignored.<br />
<br />
Paladins have a few of their members write posts about hybrid healing and relative melee power that makes the shaman letters look like The Cat in the Hat. As a result Paladins Warriors and Rangers get better melee skills.<br />
<br />
Monks get pissed; write 10,000 posts about it and are ignored.<br />
<br />
Warriors log on the day after the patch and wonder WTF happened.<br />
<br />
Rangers, scared as hell of the nerf bat, say nothing but jokes on how much they die.<br />
<br />
Monks get pissed; write 10,000 posts about it and are ignored.<br />
<br />
Rogues write about it, get spammed by the SZ boards a few times. Then get triple backstab.<br />
<br />
After much effort, Bards finaly get fixed.<br />
<br />
Monks get really pissed, write 20,000 posts about it, get ignored again. Then they get even madder and in a rush of golden light go SuperMonkRageOfTheDragonIronPowerFusionLevel12 and beat some devs into giving them kickass chi mess-with-mobs-mind powers.<br />
<br />
Now Enchanters get enraged and go on about how monks are the ubarest CCing class ever with phat melee skillz. Worn down at this point in time the dev team give Enchanters better slows.<br />
<br />
This makes Beastlords upset~<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah memories~</div></div><hr />
