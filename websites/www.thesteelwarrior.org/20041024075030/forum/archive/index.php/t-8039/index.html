<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Who is the NPC who takes no drop armor and gives XP? And which sets does he/she/it accept?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The GM of the armor type youre turning in, ie any warrior GM (I think, maybe PoK only) if youre turning in indicolite etc.. I never turned in anything other than hate armor. Its not bad xp really if you go to hate and fight around maestro room its 3% or so per kill and fast kills + all the armor drops are xp. Elemental+ xp is still better by far though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No drop armors from Hate are turned in to Class guildmasters in Pok, To find the right GM Hail him and say &quot;What armor?&quot; If they are the right NPC they will respond and mention the type of armor they are looking for.<br />
<br />
They give about 4% AAexp and a gem per turn in, I myself have only gotten diamonds but other folks say they've gotten peridots as well so it can vary.  I'm thinking it might have to do with the type of armor since i've only ever turned in Warrior peices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can also turn in the no drop class armor from Fear as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Been awhile, but have gotten peridots. Also got no gem before as well, iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did this on Monday, as it turns out. We got periodts, diamonds, and a blue diamond in exchange for armor from Hate. I think it was mostly shaman and rogue stuff, but I can't recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea the gems are random. Have gotten anywhere from Peridots to Blue Diamonds. They also will not take the no drop weapons only the armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luczifer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya can turn in any classes armor pieces from old world planes.<br />
Ya need to find specific class's GM in PoK and turn in.<br />
Me as warrior has turned all Hate gathered armor and get gems from all GMs.<br />
Gems are mostly diamonds, a few blue diamonds and peridots happened to me too.</div></div><hr />
