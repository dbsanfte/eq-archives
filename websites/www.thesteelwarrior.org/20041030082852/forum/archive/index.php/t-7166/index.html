<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what combo do you guys would hold the best aggro &amp; what combo would put out the best DPS?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking GBOS primary  Blackout secondary<br />
<br />
stats are as follows...<br />
<br />
SOD 12/18 procs anarchy 288DD<br />
<br />
GBOS 14/18 procs force shock 179dd plus stun<br />
<br />
Blackout  16/22  +2cold damage procs 100dd plus stun<br />
<br />
also how would these combo's compare to a Greatstaff of the Four Winds DPS wise?<br />
<br />
GSOFW 41/31 procs 75dd<br />
<br />
thanks for the help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SoD = Useless, Overpriced, Collector Item (but decent dps)<br />
GBoS = Absolutely beats SoD in every possible compraison<br />
Blackout = Really nice weapon<br />
GSo4W = DPS weapon (its nice with Anger3)<br />
<br />
I'd go GBoS/Blackout , lets face it the SoD is a toy nothing more.<br />
And a FUCKING expensive toy (hello droga/nurga weapons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the quick reply Emilia, thats exactly what I thought. Looks like I'll go GBOS &amp; Blackout &amp; work on LDON to aug them out with anger3. <br />

i would have said the anarchy proc has pretty good agro. its a stun proc not just a dd. overpriced i agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Until I converted to Blade of Carnage, Bloodfrenzy, Acrylia Handled Broadsword line, I continued to use my SoD in mainhand, though GBoS came and went. <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but SoDs are very nice aggro, and dual wielding SoDs even today you're gonna have better and more consistent aggro than any non-EB weapons (I'm talking unaugged).<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that most people who knock SoDS have seen the stats in an list and haven't actually used them for any significant period of time. <br />
<br />
Overpriced?  Yeah, ok, maybe.<br />
<br />
As an unrelated side note, SoDs rock for dueling weapons, even today.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Copper Hammer : 13/20 DD179/Stun 65hp<br />
Bloodsworn : 12/19 DD75/Stun65 55hp<br />
<br />
Will generate the same agro, with a similar or a bit lesser DPS. <br />
For at best a fraction of the price.<br />
<br />
The only reason to have a SoD today is for showing off (Aka Collector item).</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Not true. A stun is a stun, which is why pallies can use their low level stuns to generate comparable aggro to their high level ones. A difference of 100 damage in the proc is NOT going to make up for the 2 damage difference between a GBoS and a SoD. There is not even proc modifier on the SoD. If you kept your SoD over a GBoS, you fell in to the age old trap of, well, being wrong. <br />
<br />
  Mind you, if price is no object, a SoD is better than the nurga weapons. Slightly better ratio AND more DPS from the proc is nice. Unless you have the best gear money can buy, though, and a BoC mainhanded with the SoD offhand, you're wasting your money. Nurga weapons will be *almost* the same aggro for much less money. Heck, the SotB even interrupts mobs up to 65, compared to 55 with the SoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone else comment on this weapon?  Its got a very nice ratio &amp; a stun proc I cant see how it wouldnt be very nice aggro. <br />
<br />
Btw I play on FV so everything is droppable the average prices on these weapons is as follows..<br />
<br />
SOD 120k<br />
GBOS  35k<br />
Blackout  70k<br />
<br />
in case anyone was curious the better aggro weapons go for an obscene amount<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy 700k<br />
BOC  350k<br />
BBOE  650k<br />
BOW 1.5mill hehe<br />

Mind you that the only people that say this are the people that don't have them.  Call me a show-off then, my SoD is badass :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GBOS 35k<br />
Best deal evah. This is by far the best deal on the FV no drop list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Blackout is nice aggro. Used one, off-handed with BoC primary, and it was nice.<br />
Not as good as BoC or higher, but better than droga weapons.<br />
<br />
Given price and aggro they produce, go GBoS and Blackout.<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy 700k<br />
BBOE 650k<br />
BOW 1.5mill<br />
 <br />
<br />
hmm .. well .. err .. glad im not on FV, and i have my BoW :)</div></div><hr />

Not trying to be rude here but have you actually dual wielded them?  We farmed about 15 or so back in Velious and frankly I still call it the most overrated item in all of EQ.  We used to have monks dual wielding them and having zero agro problems (without having to FD by the way).  Heck I used to dual wield them myself until I got my Jaelen's Katana.  <br />
<br />
When I did get my Jaelen's, I tested with another warrior in my guild on the dorfs in Thurg B.  We would have a 3rd person pull one, and the other warrior would attack with sod main, empty offhand and I would attack with jaelen's main, empty offhand.  We both had the same haste and capped stats.  The conclusion we reached was Jaelen's outagrod SoD.  Now nobody who was not there and saw it for themselves actually believes me because SoD is spoken of so well...but frankly its a shit weapon (today!) that you can buy better than in the bazaar for a fraction of the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fruitpie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If your on FV there is only one combo you should ever look at that isn't a &quot;hate&quot; weapon combo and that's the GBoS and the Valorous Qaurterstaff.  You can get a pair of two solid DPS stun weapons for about 65k if you look hard enough.  My opinion has always been never buy a one hander unless it is large agro cause two hadners are better DPS.  Anyways that's my two cents.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I currently offhand a blackout for agro, auged with a ykesha proc. I am very happy with the agro, and have been for about 2 months or so.<br />
<br />
I used gsot, then BBB, then looted a blackout on a raid because no one really wanted it. I borrowed a BoC, off hand the blackout. Eventually gave the BoC back and picked up a bloodfenzy a couple days later. I plan to upgrade it for soemthing with better stats like a hategiver, but it has served me very well. Very decent dps, I would say it is still a step below a boc, but it is nice if you don't have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">just curious why you think valorious quarterstaff is better than blackout?<br />
<br />
quarterstaff is 15/20  +1 magic damage  with a 75dd stun w/ a minus 200 hate proc<br />
<br />
blackout 16/22  +2 cold damage 100dd stun proc<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
seems to me the blackout would be about the same dps but with a much better proc? no?<br />

Well, no offense Gorlab, but haven't you ever heard of the theory that says lifetaps are next to no aggro?<br />
<br />
Current beliefs are that DD/stun are FAR more aggro than Lifetaps.  I would have a hard time believing anything of the nature that says a lifetap weapon is superior to a stun weapon.</div></div><hr />

Warrior of FVFYI - You should do some parses, you might be surprised. With equal offensive AAs, 1h combos on the same level as 2hers are doing very similar DPS and considerably more hate. A good example is the droga weapons parsing almost exactly the same DPS as GSoT/WMBS which were thought to have a big DPS advantage. With 15/20+14/18 1hers, you are going to have to get a pretty stout 2h weapon to beat the DPS.</div></div><hr />
