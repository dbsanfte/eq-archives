<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crayno</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried some trials in POJ last weekend.<br />
Started out with torture and hanging,they were trivial.<br />
Then we moved to flame and got our asses handed 5 times.<br />
<br />
Group make up was:<br />
Chanter<br />
Cleric<br />
Bard<br />
Shaman<br />
Ranger<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
All 65 with 100+ AA and gear close to Emp/VT <br />
<br />
I know the point is not letting any mobs get to the stake or it will trigger a nasty ae.<br />
Somehow all fights were very messy and pretty much every time a mob made it to the stake.<br />
Seemed we lacked the dps to kill them fast enough but still....<br />
I proposed to have one person at each spawnpoint and don't move from there.<br />
We somehow didn't succeed in that but I'm afraid that even if we  did we wouldn't have killed fast enough to beat the respawn.<br />
Did we miss something or is flame really that hard?</div></div><hr />

get a druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get 2 people that can Radiant Cure, there are 2 AE , one easy to resist one hard, with a bard you should always resist easy, and sometimes get hit by hard, Radiant cure every hard AE; 2 RC is enough or close to be cured from dot 90% of the trial.<br />
Then get a pet , malosinia + tash and you get a very reliable CoD pet for dps and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazak</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is slowly getting flagged for 7th Hammer.  I think we're up to around 16 people with the Trial of Flame completed.  We've had very nice results with the following group template:<br />
<br />
Tank (Could be War, Sk, Pal)<br />
Paladin (Could be other tank class, but Paladin heals were a huge help)<br />
Bard<br />
Cleric<br />
2 x Dps (We've used necro, mage, wizard, druid, rogue, monk, and rangers in these spots.)<br />
<br />
Admittedly, we use experienced people in a couple of the slots on each attempt, so we usually only get new marks for 2-3 people per run.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
Edit:  This weekend, we worked on the trials some more.  I was only there for a bit, but was a part of two successful Trial of Flame runs.  First was warrior, sk, enchanter, necro, cleric, &amp; mage.  Second group was warrior, sk, necro, cleric, wizard, &amp; ranger.  Doing this trial with no slow and no crowd control was entertaining, but we won with quite a bit to spare.  In the second run, only the ranger had not passed before hand, but he was also level 62, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Translation: Cray, you suck so much, even if you offered your first Trueborn to the gods you still wouldn't win that trial !<br />
<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone else posted, bring a mage with Command of Druzil along.<br />
<br />
In fact, have the mage enter Flame and grab a pet, then intentionally fail the trial.  Keep in mind that mobs in &quot;flame&quot; will lose agro and head for the stake if you get too far away from them.  This makes it extremely easy to charm one mob, then outrun agro and let the remaining three mobs sit on the stake long enough to fail the trial.  When the mage says &quot;return&quot; to the Guardian of Justice, he'll keep his pet.  Let charm break on the trial platform, malo/tash and recharm.  Now the mage can buff his pet (haste, summoned weapons) and take it into any trial, or anywhere in the zone.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you, a fully buffed flame elemental from the flame trial can kill other trial mobs solo faster than a high DPS group of 6 can.  Try it, you'll like it!<br />
<br />
Our CoD mage can pass pretty much any group through any trial just because his pet kills the trial mobs in seconds.  It's really insane.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is this an exploit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">99% sure they didnt mean for mages to be pulling those mobs out of the trial. :)<br />
<br />
It's not a sploit till they see you doing it anyway hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in Trial of Flame memblur constantly.  You pretty much either need to be hitting it at all times, have it rooted, or mezzed to make sure it won't get to the center.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, trial of flame is just a matter of having good healing/resists/DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used 2 different methods of beating trial of flame.<br />
<br />
1. With a VERY good cleric, who can keep you alive AND with low HP aggro, you can just tank all 4 and never lose aggro.<br />
<br />
That's how I beat it the first time.<br />
<br />
2. The easier way was...<br />
<br />
2 Warriors<br />
1 Paladin<br />
1 Bard<br />
1 Cleric<br />
1 Mage<br />
<br />
Drink Shaman potion and get DS'd up before going in.<br />
<br />
Warriors, Paladin, and Bard all stand at mob spawn points, aggro the mobs, and bring them back to the bard, who is tanking his own mob.   Do NOT slow the mobs, each warrior takes turns /shielding the bard, who is singing DS song and AE DoT song.   THe mobs will melt from DS damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen that done before as well Frod. <br />
<br />
It takes a really strong bard and really smart warriors but yes it does work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's one AE in Trial of Flame that does like 200/tick for a very long time.  Use Radiant Cure to cure that whenever it's up.  If you don't have that AE on the trial is a lot easier.</div></div><hr />
