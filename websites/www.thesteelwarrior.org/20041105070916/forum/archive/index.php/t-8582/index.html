<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niadnab Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody know of any good places to farm PP that give decent/good amounts ?.. I mostly only farm by myself, but certian days I can farm with me and box a 64 shaman, anybody have any recs. ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>malfowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Plane of Justice basement usaully seems to work, we usaully go down there with a group and clear two cycles of spawns and make some decent platinum, definately wouldnt reject a group there with an 56+ alt. Only problem is that its not soloable, I've tried doing it wiht 5600hp unbuffed with Focus of Soul and Kazaads and i didnt even make it too the entrance.  Acrylia farming in Acrylia caverns is always another option too if you've got regen potions.</div></div><hr />

And the armor they drop is worth some tributs ( 500 to 1k per item )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I farmed CT for money for a long time. Bloods, FG's, girdles, dragon raids, RoS, sewers, most can be done with one group or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ct is indeed a superb money making spot, but without pacify you'd probably have difficulty with most of the lizard places... but sewers is still easily duoable with shaman as you never get more than 2 mobs unless you go really deep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seb for quick pp solo.   If I need a few K pp then I run my butt to Seb.  Nice gem drops plus pp and tribute items.<br />

<br />
I dunno how you can farm CT for cash.  Maybe doing the rings, but no way camping normal nameds is profitable.  I haven't seen a fucking named mob with actual loot in...oh, I dunno about A LONG ASS TIME.<br />
<br />
I don't think I was even 65 yet when we stopped going to CT because the drop rate is just total ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is it true that they tuned down the amount of gems that bugs in Seb drop?  I know I used to see people at the gang camp all the time, now its completely empty.  <br />

Yes, and PoG too..it's bad.  They reenable the Protectors of growth and nerf the gem drops..that's fuckin wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Veksar...easy solo pulls about 6-9pp a mob, weapons you can turn in for faction/exp/pp and some solid pp loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes Seb bugs have been nerfed on gem drops.  I have seen substantial gem drops from random frogs though so thats where I go if I want quick cash.  I do Veksar too but for pure pp Seb is pretty good and extremely easy.....did I mention easy?  haha<br />
