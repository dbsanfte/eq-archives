<br />
Also should I got for CS ID or Offensive AA's?<br />
<br />
Already done Avoidence trying to figure out whats next...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the combat stability / innate defense line of AAs.  They are just as good as the avoidance ones IMO, and far better than the offensive aas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends where, how, and what you're exping on (as well as your role in your guild, if you have one).<br />
<br />
I did defensive AAs first except for two exceptions: AE Taunt (of course) and Tactical Mastery, because I was duoing a lot of experience with my shaman (thus I was a major source of the &quot;group's&quot; damage). From what I've seen Tactical Mastery provides the best &quot;bang for the buck&quot; DPS increase, although from the front only (not an issue grouped with my shammy, since I'm in front of the mob 99% of the time). <br />
<br />
I did TM1-3 after doing ND3, PD3, PE, CA3, CS3, and LR3 and don't regret it. If you do full fairly standard groups most of the time you should get all of the defensive AAs first IMO though.<br />
<br />
For order of offensive AAs this also depends on how you fight:<br />
<br />
Offensive AAs that work all the time:<br />
<br />
Crit AAs, Ferocity, Flurry AAs<br />
<br />
Only works with 2h (very nice if you have a good two hander IMO):<br />
<br />
Punishing Blade<br />
<br />
Only works with dual wield (good if you MT and use dual wield for aggro):<br />
<br />
Ambidexterity<br />
<br />
Only works from the front/sides:<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery<br />
<br />
Only works while tanking (note difference from just being in front of the mob):<br />
<br />
Stalwart Endurance<br />
<br />
Only works with procs (and other clicky effects):<br />
<br />
Ingenuity (mostly a toy AA from what I've seen)<br />
<br />
Note I also didn't include a few such as Planar Power, Double Riposte, and Rampage.<br />
<br />
Anyways, that's almost as broken down as you can get with warrior offensive AAs. It's up to you to decide which ones would be most effective for you. What's most effective for another warrior may not be most effective for you :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure you meant that it increases your hit percentage ONLY if you are attacking from the front side where mobs can block / dodge / parry / riposte you.  If you are instead claiming that TM increases your hit percentage from the back this would be the first time I have heard that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mbad</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be fair to say aiming for the offensive AAs that are indiff to weapon type would be 1st priority.(have done all the defensive ones). What i mean is, doing ferocity and crit/flurry before ambidex and PB for middle equiped tanks as myself? I for one really cant say what weaps ill end up with later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After I finished defensive, I went back and picked up CF3 and Flurry.  They probably won't give you the best DPS increase for your AAs, but I'm a halfling warrior, and there's just something cool about hanging out with the rest of the Marshals in Rivervale :)<br />
<br />
Working on Fero and PB now, then I'll probably get Raging Flurry, TM, SE, and finally finish off Fury of the Ages.  Steering clear of Double Riposte for a long while yet...36 AAs for an 80% chance to get an extra attack every once in a while but only when tanking....yuck.</div></div><hr />
