<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Len</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i have spent a bit of money bringing my 56th Warrior out of retirement and re-equipping him, unfortunately he is agnostic, so i couldnt get Fierce Heraldic  :( <br />
i still need to get a FEW things.<br />
<br />
Here is my Magelo: Lenander Stormblade (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1009265)<br />
<br />
Thats my exact gear too, i checked it over, cant be bothered to get the auto update thingy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'd lookfor different shoudlers; but overall..you're fine..might want to go look nto getting some draconic spaulders/pauldrons (name slips my mind; i see yo got champs and have some +cov faction...)<br />
<br />
or start getting them LDoN points and some augments/tak gear set up. tht will bring you right to the elementals. and you got a proc 1Her so you're GTG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/em agrees with Shikarii.<br />
Also, I wouldn't always have the CHoS bagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Full Mithril Platemail would be a good upgrade for you in a few slots (non-imbued high elf cultural).<br />
<br />
While not as good as Fierce Heraldic its still very good armour, in particular the bracers would be a good upgrade for you (25ac, 30hp, 6save v all).  Should consider Gauntlets (30ac, 30hps) and Shoulders (19ac, 30hps) aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what im seeing here is a warrior who used his alt to twink him and then asks &quot;is my gear ok&quot;.<br />
<br />
hmm. sad when eq has come down to the question of &quot;is my toon twinked enough to be ok&quot;.<br />
<br />
yeah he is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">5 minutes of fame bro...let him have his 5 minutes. :D<br />
<br />
you know as well as i do that 9 times out of ten the replies here aren't even read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Len</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info guys, and i didnt twink my warrior out, that gear is about average, i just used money to get his equip, i didnt go farm any of it, my Monk sucks.<br />
He can just solo in some places to get cash, and having a cleric duo i can get low amounts of money quite easy lol<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Man i use alot of commas  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd fletch a little bit too. No reason your only arrows should have just 50 range; I think thefletched 1-damage 150 range arrows triv at 36, so they're not hard to make, and really cheap. And, of course, you could make harder hitting arrows if you wanted to press on.</div></div><hr />
