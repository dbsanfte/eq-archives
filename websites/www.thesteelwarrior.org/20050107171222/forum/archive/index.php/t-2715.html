<br />
Also ear pieces need upgrade, wolf fang if you're broke or get the jagged hoop and solsctice (sp?) quested one if you have some pp.<br />
<br />
I have Crested Spaulders, they're a cheap upgrade for shoulder which you need...<br />
<br />
You're Rallo Zek so save up for the Fierce Heraldi Breastplate and leg pieces...<br />
<br />
That's about my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am in similar situation as you (now lvl 41) and my magelo (below hopefully or here -- http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=597241 ) -- reflects some of the advice of the various folk on the boards. I need an FBSS or SCHW like you have...<br />
<br />
Ciao,<br />

I'm also in the same boat... Check mine out.  I just can't seem to get rid of my Foreman's Skull Cap.  The light source is the best and it was my first upgraded piece of armor.  I wish there were more 30's and 40's magelo links to visits so we can get an idea of what we can afford to upgrade to.  In fact I'm going to start a thread now.</div></div><hr />
