<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zondelfinni</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been on my mind alot lately... I am a lvl 65 dorf warrior and I have had my AC at 1500, and then had it at 1100... I HAVE tested both many times in PoP and Old World... Have fought PoP bosses and so on... And the conclusion I have came up with is, AC really is not a &quot;vital&quot; stat... I hear alot of talk about people saying 1 AC=10 hp, I dont see it... AT 1500 AC a PoP mob hits me for the same ammount of damage it hits my 800 AC cleric... Same is true for Old World... I man really, do I have to have AC of 2000 to be able to notice a difference? Basically what i am saying here is, when my AC is maxed, it seems no matter where I am, MOBs hit me the same ammount of times, and do the same ammount of damage, and if there is a difference, its minimal... Lets face it, AC is a myth, most think, you are a warrior, you need ARMOR CLASS UP... Fact is, this is a game, you notice when you pump up HP, hell you can see the #'s go up... I think the calculation should go more like this 10hp=1ac or in other words, HP&gt;all... When I have 6323 hp unbuffed and 1252 AC, I tend to go thry more mobs and need less CH's then I do when I have 5500hp and 1500ac... Would love to know some of your opinions about this, because it seems most everyone follows the leader so to speak... I have never seen anyone say what I am sayin, however I do believe most of you have felt this way at times...</div></div><hr />

This shows (although the sample size is still a little small) that AC is still showing decent returns as your AC increases.<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot effectively &quot;feel&quot; if your AC is giving returns (which is what you're saying,) you have to parse it. And even then, the sample size has to be very large, to remove any inconsistencies. Even my above sample size is too small, and there will be variables altering the test results -- Such as how many times I managed to hit Evasive, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tasdamon</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on such a long fight like that, it is pretty acurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs will always have the same max hit, that doesnt change, but as your AC goes up, the amount of times they do hit for max decreases.  So in effect, higher AC doesnt reduce the max damage taken, it just reduces the amount of time you get hit for it, effectively making you take less damage over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time we fought Xegony, I tanked her to about 2% (/rude clerics).  With around 2150 AC she hit me for max hit (2420) twice in 33 minutes.  Thats 0.15% of all hits were for max. Id say AC works just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if Xegony is unslowable and you kept aggro the whole time, it's probably fairly accurate.  I don't know anything about the mob.  If it's slowable and it wore off due to resists from time to time, I guess that would throw off your results.</div></div><hr />

Max and Min hit %'s. With 2440 being max, and 612 being min:<br />
<br />
<br />
1886 ac<br />
<br />
Hit 2440 1.86% of the time<br />

2012 ac<br />

Keep in mind, this was with me Evasive, so Defensive mititation doesn't skew it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another interesting fact.<br />
<br />
My avoidance with Evasive was 40.11%<br />
My avoidance with Defensive was 34.22%</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyone know how much AC is obtainable via buffs  ? (without stacking issues)</div></div><hr />

There's a temp drood buff that put me over 2k on last xegony.<br />
But i think these are the temp ones (at least what i always use)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1886-2012 = 4.6% mitigation increase per 100AC<br />

2012 - 2248 = 3.72% mitigation increase per 100AC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parv</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys have quite amazingly the greatest luck with your parses.  Last night we did Xeg, I'm sitting at 2100ac for duration of the fight, and I get hit for max *3%* of the time, a very far cry from your sub 1%.  Hell I got hit 3 times for max in one round at that AC.  On the other hand, in all my parses of Xeg kills (15+) I get hit for min over 40% of the time, from 1800 to 2100AC, every time.<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder if there's some sort of racial modifier for AC.  That or I'm the RNG's bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think keeping all debuffs up play a pretty significant role as well. I know we previously slacked a bit on keeping stuff like the SK/Necro ATK debuffs on, but now that we do it does seem to help.<br />
<br />
Below the damage distribution on our last Xegony fight that took 50 mins. MT was a dwarf with between 1950-2000 AC for the fight. Average DPS was 815 which is as low as the example with 2250 AC above, perhaps some differences in debuffs? Or plain luck/randomness, dunno:<br />

I'm thinking the second, LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a Woodelf. If anyones gonna get beaten around like a little bitch, it's me.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, we do barely any debuffs on Xegony. We definately don't AC debuff or cripple, I know that.<br />
<br />
You use Evasive, or Defensive Parv?<br />
<br />
Also I don't use any haste tanking Xeg, I use a shield and EB proccer.</div></div><hr />

I really think its a combination of ALOT of little things that eventually add up. Adding ca3 isnt gonna all of a sudden turn you into Uberman . Adding ca3 , cs3 , flurry , fury , PE  , slightly better weapon , gaining a few AC adding nd3 , tatical mastery , ferocity , stalward endurace  will though. Unlike many other classes that get &quot;class defineing aa&quot; like rangers , wizards and shaman among others ,  warriors make all thier gains in small increments , but there are many many for a warrior to get and taken all together they DO add up.<br />
