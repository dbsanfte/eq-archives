<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bladesmith_tz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello new to the boards and am unsure if this is posted elsewhere as I couldnt find anything about it. I was wondering what if any changes where made to the warrior epic quest since LDoN was released. I know that you no longer have to combine the swords to get the 2-hander so I was interested in what one must do to get all 3 weapons now. Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With LDON there was a problem with losing augments to the swords, when you did the scabbard combine to get the other type of epic.  Now there is just a new guy in the old epic warrior camp in freeport that you can hand the red scabbard and 2hs version of the epic to, to lose the scabbard and just get the 2hs and two 1hs that are augmentable.<br />
