As a main tank in a 50ish LDoN dungeon, I didn't loose agro once.  In the next dungeon we had a Pally tanking, and he couldn't hold the agro stunning the whole time when the Wand proc'd.  He coulda been just a crappy Pally, but I think it was more the wep.<br />

The Guard II proc was awesome for agro when I'm near the highest in the group. Had to switch it out when a 51 Pally was tanking - he couldn't keep agro even with stuns. No problems with Rogues or any others until last night. When grouped with a 54 Rogue and 55 Ranger, I couldn't keep agro at all. Even with Shammy buffs, the proc didn't seem to matter. Just observations.<br />

To be honest guys in 3 weeks I have seen zip agro produced when the thing procs.  However, I really like the extra mitigation in LDON dungeons...by the time the proc has been chewed up by damage another one has usually popped up to take its place so in effect its almost perpetual (when that weap is main hand).<br />
<br />
Overall I am very happy with the 500 pt purchase</div></div><hr />
