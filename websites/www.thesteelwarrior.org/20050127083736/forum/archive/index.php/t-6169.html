<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malakhov</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a lvl 58 ranger and I've just spent the whole day looking for a group and all I got to do was one small LDON adventure. The rest of the time I sat on my ass LFG with no tells whatsoever. I even used the LFG tool to try to get groups that way but as soon as they asked the class and level wich I answered lvl 58 ranger, I never got a tell back.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of selling everything tonight in the bazaar and restarting as a warrior or a paladin. I'll be level 50 in no time with a friend's help and then I might be able to get a group and be able to play.<br />
<br />
What is easier to get groups with, a paladin or warrior? I enjoy being up front with the mob and I'd like to be the main tank as often as possible, what do you suggest?<br />
<br />
Or should I  stick my ranger? I don't know what to do anymore.<br />
<br />
Lvling up from lvl 1 to 50 would suck but I think I'd enjoy it afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlorr</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my opinion, but if you are running from an &quot;always LFG&quot; class I would recommend a pally. That way, you can solo a bit while waiting for the invite.<br />
<br />
I came to the warrior because I was tired of being always LFG too. I still get frequent invites because I fill a primary role in the group. <br />
<br />
Pally does that too, but can solo a bit.<br />
<br />
Either one will get you more invites than a ranger, so you are bound to have more fun.<br />
<br />
your mileage may vary as always...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malakhov</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate soloing though, I find it so boring. I love grouping but as a ranger, I get no invites at all.<br />
<br />
What's the pros and cons between a paladin and a warrior?<br />
<br />
I'd get as much invites as one or the other right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mala my dad plays a ranger, he has a hell of a time gettign a group up untill he had all his archery AAs, then BoT warshipped em lol.(and my bro plays a pally, trust me he gets alot of groups :D any time i call em up and get into class balance with my bro let me tell ya, it gets heated with some colorful lang lol)<br />
<br />
anyhow i think rangers as a whole could use a hand up but i do not see it happening so instead i just make it a point to try and invite em :)<br />
<br />
goodluck with whatever ya start</div></div><hr />

go roll a pally or sk. heck; i'd play a SK over a pally just for the sheer 'evil' of it all :D. plus, solo or grouped SK's are machines.</div></div><hr />

Go to the same zone regularly, get to know some people, and don't suck and you shouldn't have a lot of trouble getting a group IMO.  If turning on LFG isn't working for ya, go to the exp zones, find a group that has less than 6 people, and ask them if the need another.  <br />
<br />
It's definitely harder if you don't play several nights a week though because it's hard to get a regular group together.</div></div><hr />

I have a friend shaman but I just don't see how he could pl a chanter.<br />

I don't know yet, I might keep my ranger or I might switch to a warrior/pal or sk. <br />

I'm torned :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things are better now than they used to be, but there are A LOT of lfg tanks out there, so it's not all wine and roses for warriors and paladins either.  Warriors have it better now than in PoP (ala sitting lfg for 4 hours and then logging), but if you have to have a melee/hybrid class that's desired in groups, go BST.  They're very group friendly, they're closer to what you're already used to playing, and they can solo.  If you want to be a tank, I'd probably follow shik's advice if I were you.  All that having been said, these things tend to be cyclic so you might want to tough it out with the ranger.  Once you get EQ and AM, you'll be well liked for groups again, and it would suck to switch to another class, have either the game mechanics change or the nerf bat hit your new class, and be back in the same boat you're in now with your ranger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly. I think the last 5 groups (I don't exp much) have had the same person invite me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the best LDoN groups I was ever in was 3 rangers, a necro, a druid, and me.  We were doing very well on adventures and doing them in under like 30 minutes each.  I pulled a half dozen at once, no one died, the rangers rooted and snared to get them under control.  Rangers are awesome off tanks and crowd control for LDoN adventures in my opinion and I will always try to get one if I can when doing a group there.<br />
<br />
I would keep your ranger if I was you and just play a different one for a while and then when you get bored come back to the ranger and level him to 65.  Once you get to level 65 on him you will probably like him a lot better (as with any class) since the levels from 50 to 64 kind of suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, definitely keep your ranger. Strip him if you feel the need (but I wouldn't) and otherwise start a new character, but keep the ranger as a backup.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you'll be the third/fourth/fifth tank in a raid and they'll be asking for a distance DPS class instead; it happens all the time. :p<br />
<br />
With regards to a shaman PL'ing you, SK's make excellent companions for shamans. Warriors do okay too, but if you think you might be duoing or playing in smaller groups a lot, the SK will have more utility.</div></div><hr />

Just &quot;chanced&quot; on a 57 SK...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, there's a problem IMO in EQ. Everything is badly tipped toward level 65. Yep there are pockets of activity but afaik not 25 level 60's sitting in the zone in of Sebilis anymore. If you visit the areas where there is still lower level activity, you hear them /ooc for the same classes all of the time (sorry, ranjah isn't one of them).<br />
<br />
That being the case, any class that can't solo is subject to stalling. Enchanters and Clerics get groups easily. Druids are very self-sufficient (mine is level 56 and has grouped maybe 6 times). <br />
<br />
If you absolutely must start over and make a Tank, do not choose a Warrior.<br />

Then DO NOT make a tanking class, period.  Beastlord makes a good alt, good soloers, good groupers.  Same with druids, people just need to be convinced of your skill in the 58+ grouping scene.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neither.<br />
<br />
Play a cleric. That'll be your best bet. Easy to get groups. And no worries about being able to solo, as cleric soloing is woefully inefficient most of the time.<br />
<br />
As a 58 ranger you can solo for XP while LFG. And if you're STILL miserable and hate soloing as you state, then you won't be happy as a paladin or a warrior or an SK.<br />
<br />
So ... go cleric.</div></div><hr />

It may just be me but seeing a statement like that makes me feel like we (sk's) are the borg 8D.<br />
<br />
Resistance is Futile...You will be assimilated.<br />
<br />
Back to the orginal topic.  What time zone do you play in?  For myself being over in Korea has really screwed up my grouping alot.  90% of the people I normally group w/ are in bed asleep or getting up to go to work when I am normally on so I spend alot of time LFG also.  It may just take making some new friends that play during your time to help solve your problem.<br />
<br />
As for war or pally, I would say war hands down.  I have a 55 war atm and soloed him for about 3/4's of his levels.  This was pre LoY/PoP/GoD so w/ the gear you can get now it should be no problem.  It just takes a little thinging out and gear (go go regen potions/regen items!), and zone knowledge.  Old world zones are some of the best for soloing as alot are duengons and are usually only camped by the random PLer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
courage? no harder to level a caster than a melee. just different. i played a druid for 3 years before i finally started really pushing my warrior. why did i pick warrior over say a shadow knight? mainly because i wanted the most opposite class i could get so that when i was bored of one i could go to the other and not just have more of the same thing.<br />
<br />
rolling a warrior when you already have a ranger is asking for a lot of overlap. rolling an enchanter would be a world different. and you learn as you go so you dont need to worry that they are a mystery class at the moment. one big difference you would notice is you dont contribute much direct dps and yet people will fawn all over you. same goes for bard. same with cleric. druid wizard and mage are sort of a compromise because you do a lot of dps with any of them and so still feel sort of ranger-like. not to mention their spells are sort of similar.<br />
<br />
whatever you do dont canabalize your ranger for essence emeralds. you may be frustrated now but you may regret later you sacrificed him. i agree that you cannot judge the endgame by what comes in your 50s. they are just very different.<br />
<br />
one last bit of advice. form your own groups. dont wait for others to invite you. there are a lot of people out there who to put it one way &quot;have been bitten and inflicted by the shyness monster&quot; and will not start their own groups to save their lives. those who do start their own groups get very inflexible about who they invite. for example i always start my own groups and i am extremely partial to casters.<br />
<br />
here is a funny example of me starting a group a few months ago. my cleric gf wasnt on and there i was my crummy no-agro self as i was. there were a few other melees lfg so i invited them all into a sort of social &quot;holding group&quot; (all melees ..HAH) and told them anyone who got an invite do not hesitate to grab it. funny thing was in 10 minutes i invited a chanter to our holding group then a shaman. the ranger and rogue had found another group by that time so there were now five of us and what do you know? a cleric shouts &quot;LFG!&quot; and we snagged her. we had me two other melees shaman cleric and enchanter and everybody was glad for our great group. and it fell together practically by accident simply by starting with a &quot;leftovers group&quot;.<br />
<br />
which brings me to another conclusion from all this. discouragement breeds failure. when we are discouraged we break down socially. its a fact of human nature. and its self perpetuating. its hard to be proactive to get out of the rut because discouragement pre-empts us from taking the steps necessary. that group of leftovers that turned into such a good group in only 20 minutes started from me feeling discouraged. by getting the couple other melees into my group it got me talking and gave me the impetus to give others tells to get me out of the rut i was in that day. give it a try!</div></div><hr />
