<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Coirnav seemed way different to us last night. The mini adds did not assist each other last night, which meant we needed lots more pulling since our Sword proc'r wasnt on it worked to our advantage on Coirnav himself because hardly any agroed while we beat their daddy. The named when cothed away came back , which they never did. Lastly Coirnavs melee range was HUGE when pulling the mini's.<br />

<br />
We last did coirnav 3 weeks ago and was in nowaylike this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just did Coirnav and the mobs behaved as usual.<br />
<br />
2 things different though: <br />
<br />
We had 70 toons in lair and there was no lag whatsoever unless you where looking right into the raid (p4/1GHz).<br />
<br />
The 3 Nameds where not mouse clickable, I had to swim to them and Target with F8 to pull them. Yes, that hurt. A Lot. Lost a minute there but still managed to do it in 13 minutes (guild record 11.5 minutes).</div></div><hr />
