<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladymir</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, I have a monk with 40aa and I am tired of him, tired of being out dps'd by rangers, tired of having my cleric mitigate better while sitrting than I do facing, tired of having no practical function as a puller.<br />
<br />
But I didn't come here to whine! I came to join the darkside. I am going to PL a fatass.<br />
<br />
After adventuring in the bazaar to twink him, my biggest concern being level restrictions on gear, I levelled the ogre up to 3, weee :)<br />
<br />
Now, I don't want think about 450aa + TIME gear in mind, instead I want to think about the mid 50's to 65 with few aa game.<br />
<br />
I maxed sta and put the rest in agi, no points in str... it has always seemed to me that str gear is the easiest to get and sta gear the hardest... again keep in mind I am NOT and do not plan to be in a Time raiding guild, well ever. <br />
<br />
Please point out any mistakes you think I am making along the way!<br />
<br />
So my gear will probably get stuck where it is on my monk, highend velious with some newer stuff mixed in, thats all I can afford/have access to; I live with that.<br />
<br />
I bought him a RBG already and then loaded him up with high HP + STA gear, like crusteacean shell armor. <br />
<br />
For 35K, which is still a good chunk on the FV server, minus 25K for the RBG, I have 224 sta 214 str 90 agi. I am not going to talk about my actual HP or AC at this point since I am level 3 so its kindof pointless due to all the restrictions because of level.<br />
<br />
I also won't talk about dex, since it is a meaningless stat to me and will be and has always been the last to get jacked up, unless there is something I need to know... 1/4 of the % of my total endurance doesn't mean much to me, and since proc rates are a fixed number unaffected by dex, etc... I blow off dex in favor of the other 3.<br />
<br />
I am going with as much raw hp and sta boosts as I can get on him for now until I stop pure PLing in the mid- 50's. This is because I will be using a druid to PL him and will have unslowed yellow and red mobs hitting me against a damage shield.<br />
<br />
Later I will probably switch to cleric/shaman grouping (I have both of those classes too), and more traditional playstyle where I will actually need serious mitigation over raw hp.<br />
<br />
So... <br />
<br />
1) am I doing my starting stats right (remember I don't have unlimited access to TIME gear!)?<br />
<br />
2) anyone have any arguements about dex being the last stat to concern myself with?<br />
<br />
And the big question:<br />
<br />
3) When I stop PLing and start normal play should I go for AC over hp? I know there are other threads on this, and people call ac 1:4 hp up to 1:10 hp... but what about throwing resists into the mix? Wouldnt I be better off with +50 sv magic over +100 ac? Are there 'ratios' for resists:hps?<br />
<br />
I never had to worry much about ac or hp on the monk since I don't tank., I worried about: weapon ratio/procs, haste, str, resists - in that order. Now I have to change my mindset, please help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">STR and STA are sooooo easy to raise up for warriors, there really is not much point in spending your staring bonus points on those.  I have a n ogre warrior and I started with all my points in both DEX and AGI, if I recall I set them both to 85 with the bonus points.<br />
<br />
Now that was along time ago and I didn't know much about high end warrior stuff.  If I had it to do all over again I probably would have gone all CHA and AGI -- those are two very hard to raise stats.  In general warrior gear has no CHA on it at all, and AGI is probably the least available one of the 4 prime melee stats.  Why CHA you ask?  Well CHA is used for Divine Intervention and that will save your ass over and over again when you are tanking.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea, with mostly high end luclin-era gear with some pre-elemental PoP stuff mixed in my actual unbuffed stats are as follows (not accounting for stat caps):<br />
STR=359<br />
STA=323<br />
AGI=195<br />
DEX=229<br />
CHA=52<br />
<br />
As you can see I have an over-abundance of STR and STA since those are capped for me at 305, yet I still do not have enough AGI, DEX and especially CHA.  I max all of STR/STA/AGI/DEX at 305 with buffs easily.  If you look at my magelo you'll see only one item that has CHA on it -- that's how hard it is to come by.  I'm gonna have to get LDoN augs to raise up my CHA and spend 15 AA to raise it as much as I can.<br />
<br />
So for STARTING STATS I would go for either CHA or AGI or a combination of both.  Then once you start playing your char go with high STA gear until you max your STA at your stat cap.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about resists at all until you get to your 50s.  Then you'll want to make sure you can get over 100 to each resist unbuffed with resist gear as a good start.  Eventually you'll have goals of 150 and 200+ to each resist, but that comes much later. +50mr will NEVER be &gt; 100ac, your job is to tank and as such you will face a ton more melee damage than you ever will get from spell damage.  AC/HP &gt; resists just about always for warrior who is tanking.  When you are not tanking, then you can make some sacrifices for greater resists.<br />
<br />
As for AC and HP, you need healthy amounts of both, but shoot for about 1200ish AC and then focus on HP.  This is the &quot;soft cap&quot; around which most non-PoP mobs show diminishing returns for having higher AC.  When you get to level 60+ and start doing more and more in PoP you'll need to get that AC back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladymir</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Scargoth.<br />
<br />
I think I will remake him and put it all in agi and the remainder in cha, based on your advice... why not all in cha and remainder in agi? <br />
<br />
Well based on your logic, the cha is only important for the cleric death pact line, which I know alot of clerics on FV don't even have the higher level one (the lvl 60 one your talking about I believe), I am pretty sure none of the clerics in my guild do, I know mine doesn't at 62, but he isn't a primary char.<br />
<br />
However I find it hard to disagree that str items are easier to come by, and sta is easier than agi I believe.<br />
<br />
Since agi directly effects ac, I might as well put the points into it, cause I will get alot more mileage out of ac than death pact, then put the little extra into charisma just so I won't be completly kicking myself should I ever be grouped or raiding with a well spelled cleric :)<br />
<br />
Again, I never cared much about AC or HP with my monk, I did not know about the 1200 point of dimishing return, thanks for that info too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">get as much hp/sta and str as you can get for those early lvls. hp are always important, and str will raise your atk, more damage will help you lvl faster (duh). dex will only really effect how fast you max your skills for each lvl. before 50, procs wont really be important. the best agro at lower lvls is fast attacks and high damage. think monk during velious/luclin. agi, is garbage, nice to have, but wont make or break you. <br />
also, not many people consider it, but you should put a little work into magic resistance. warriors get an innate MR advantage while they lvl, but not getting snared or slowed, will help alot. <br />
<br />
after 50, you'll want to max out your sta, and then start swaping surplus sta for raw hp. the trick, will be to keep your str and dex up. at the 50+ mark dex will be more important, a good chunk of your agro will start coming from procs, and there are alot of nice agro weapons out now as well as augments. <br />
other than that, have fun :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The effect of having more strength is very negligble at lower levels.  Your attack simply isn't high enough to be hitting for your max often even if you started out at base strength.  Str only raises your max hit and what good does it do when you can't hit for max most of the time?<br />
<br />
When I was making a SK twink I found the LDoN tradeskill armor to be pretty good deals.  They go for around 100-500pp per piece (varies considerably) but they have good AC and decent stats (I assume you'd want to get the type with stamina, which I think is Gothic Steel) and they even have 2 slots to augment (not realistically helpful but sure doesn't hurt).  Acrylia Plate is also pretty good but that is a bit more expensive, and not available in as large quantity so the price fluctuations may be greater.<br />
<br />
I don't think you want to put your points into cha unless you're making this warrior to be a MT on an uber guild.  Cha is only good for divine intervention so if you're not a MT you pretty much will never see that spell cast on you.  It is still better to put your points into other combat stats.  Although agility is hardest to raise out of melee stats, it also has very little help as long as you've a reasonable amount of it.  I think stamina is the best choice if you don't have a set of uber gear ready to go since extra HPs will help you more while levling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladymir</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm mayby you are right. Mayby I should max agi and excess points to sta. Can anyone tell me what the agility to ac rate is at 65 to a warrior?<br />
<br />
At 305 agi (assuming I have PoP AA's for it) what will I gain in AC over 300, and over 275, or 250 for example.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dex ist important for learning many meleeskills and for procrates of weapons. Just for a powerleveler its Imho nessessary cause you do not want to be a level 50 tank with lousy skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to get a bit off topic but you might want to consider keeping your monk.<br />
<br />
EQ has never been about perfect balance. Not now, not ever. Instead, EQ has been about keeping each class wanted in the game. <br />
<br />
So abilities are added so that the general gaming public would pick a certain class instead of not grabbing a class and keeping a spot open for another class. <br />
<br />
Sometimes these added abilities makes one class more desirable than another class - so eventually the &quot;nerfed&quot; class isnt as useful as they once were.<br />
<br />
I switched mains from a wizard to a warrior about 2 years ago and then warriors got &quot;nerfed&quot; by adding triple attack to monks, and adding offensive abilities to rangers and defensive to knights. Also, the 2-hander upgrade put knight DPS somewhat in the same range as warrior pure melee - and then the aggro advantage of knights made them superior to warriors for experience groups (if equally equipped).<br />
<br />
So I went from a class (wizard) that couldnt buy a group to a class that (at the time) got a group within the first several minutes I went LFG. Then I slowly went back to the class that everyone was reluctant to group with.<br />
<br />
Now I have a lvl 55 SK I could have leveled but from my past experience I knew that something would eventually be added to my class that would make me a logical choice for the area I was struggling in.<br />
<br />
An incite and disciplines being broken up has gone a long way. You might consider sticking with your monk because I forsee some new and exciting abilities coming your way soon.<br />
<br />
If you want to start a warrior because its the most fun and interesting class to play as a main - then go for it. If your just tired of waiting for a fix, but otherwise enjoy playing your monk - I'd suggest sticking it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what you put your stats in will depend what sort of grouping you expect to do at high level. if most of it will be 3-boxing with your own toons for example then you  will have to consider what buffs you can give yourself rather than what buffs are typical for raids.<br />
<br />
having said that dex and agi are nice for powerleveling because they will allow your melee skills to have a fighting chance of keeping up with your level. but once you reach high level they will not be as important. this is especially true of agility. but again i agree with previous posts that if you train strength or stamina you will likely hit your cap so soon that you feel like these points have been wasted. i regret training 20 points into strength for example and very quickly hit the 255 cap without any buffs at all.<br />
<br />
agility has only a modest effect on armor class above about 75. agility falls fast when your hitpoints go below a couple bubbles and if its too low not only do you have a precipitous fall in armor class but you lose a lot of runspeed as well. most high levels never give this a second thought since even those who neglect agility usually are far higher than this.<br />
<br />
as for charisma ... well ...its very hard to get excited about this. for vendor selling i wouldnt even consider charisma augs since you can swap out charisma gear for that. and i mention the charisma gear swapping because i call to memory the times ive known clerics who buy a stack of periodots every single day with charisma of 80 and it never occured to them to swap in charisma gear to do this.<br />
<br />
magic resist ...  has an effect on reducing some kinds of spell damage as well as slows snares roots charms and so on. this is all well and good but there arent a whole lot of mobs that cast these spells and on most of them even if they did land such spells on you its rarely a serious enough problem for you to say 'wow im sure glad i gave up 100AC so that i could cut the frequency of this!&quot;. on those occasional times i have to tank a boss mob which is an enchanter or something grim like that i swap AC gear for MR gear and leave it at that. but MR will never be my main focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a couple quick notes...<br />
<br />
Dex and agi will help you keep you skills maxed (dex, really).  Beyond that, they (it) don't do much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Str and Sta are easy, as you've said.<br />
<br />
Never drop more than ~maybe~ one or two points of ac or more than 10ish hp for anything less than a very significant increase to all your resists, not just MR.  Resists, though, don't come into play as much until the end game.<br />
<br />
Cha...well, if you ever plan on raiding with this warrior, I'd recommend planning on doing something to raise your charisma.  Even if your clerics don't have DI now, that should be a high priority for them if you're any type of raiding guild.  It's also researchable now, so it's less difficult to get than ever.<br />
<br />
Basically, you seem to know what to do so far.  Just remember to work your weapon skills up once you finish plvling...nobody likes a warrior with shitty skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamiccolo</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would just do all stamina and maybe agi with leftover points, the other stats aren't really important enough to warrant the loss of hps until you can cap it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it has been over a year now since the mitigation nerf, it has been longer than that since the pacify/lull 'fix'. So I have a main who serves no role - I am not needed for pulling, in fact it takes me ALOT longer to split mobs than a simple pacify can do.<br />
<br />
I usually duobox my monk+cleric, then when my wife plays her shaman we almost have a group, but always need a true tank, my monk just doesn't cut it, and if we want to play with pickup people it becomes near impossible with no aggro control.<br />
<br />
I don't know, the monk looks cool but that is it. My Ogre looks cool AND he serves a role. Consider the combo of war+clr+sha at my hands - I now have a complete group minus the dps, PLUS *mayby* when he is 65 he will be desirable on a raid over my cleric... I know big mayby... but I guarantee my monk is never appreciated - ever.<br />
<br />
It is very disheartening to have a 61 ranger tell me his dps is &gt; mine and not have anyone defend me (65+40 monk with very good weaps/ and dps gear). Then I almost fear a parse between me and the 61 ranger cause I know it will be too close for comfort.<br />
<br />
Monks serve no role in today's EQ - even if they put in the single target refresh timed pacify disc for monks, why not just have your chanter or cleric pacify?<br />
<br />
Back in the day, monks were the bomb for pulling, not anymore...<br />
<br />
I didn't come here to whine about my monk folks, I just need some advice. But let me summarize by saying monks have NO role in the game today, exping or raiding. They are just decent melee dps - so why not make a rogue if you want that and really get good melee dps?<br />
<br />
I know what you guys are saying about stats but this time I am firm on agi (I jacked it to 100 for starting stats)... because even though agi might onlt have a 6:1 impact on ac (that's pretty crappy, but /shrug) it does seem to be the hardest melee stat to max out, esp as an Ogre, so might as well max it out.<br />
<br />
So that's where he is at. I am going by memory here (at work now) to build this magelo, and it is only partial... so have a good laugh, but remember this is just piecemiel stuff to push me up to 46 quick (I got 13 today in about an hour in FoB + Kurns).<br />
<br />
One more question, sortof a cross-post but what affordable weaps can I get to throw in my 'bag-o-tricks' for:<br />
<br />
- stun weapon<br />
- debuff (aka malo) weapon<br />
- slow weapon<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I am on FV so we can trade most 'no drop' gear.<br />
<br />
I already got a silken whip for snare :)<br />
<br />
I like to be self sufficient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&gt;&gt;  Str only raises your max hit and what good does it do when you can't hit for max most of the time? &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
str raises your attack which raises the damage on your adverage hit, not your max damage you hit for. max hit is only effected by your weapon. the max hit on my bloodfrenzy (16d 13db) is always 108, which i see more often when i have a  bard grouped, just as the max hit with my GSot4W is always 278 and max crit is always 455.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually have a couple decent weaps but their required or reccomended is well into the 50's or even 65 for one of em so its totally pointless using them so early. The 10 and 20 caps are still in place, thats a reason why the smoldering brand is a good twink/PLing weapon - its fairly fast, has a fairly good ratio and procs from level 1 - good to raise 1hb with, and blowing through levels fast while PLing you want the delay like you said for free skill raises.<br />
<br />
Thing is, even though you might hit the 40's with gimpy skill levels they start to catch up by about 51 since even with the best PLing strategy (and no I don't exploit like people are doing in Tactics now) it slows down... and slowing down in this case is actually good, gives you a chance to max up all your skills, so you are viable for regular groupage not long after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good post.  Every class has their ups and downs.  Monks were gods in Luclin.  Warriors were gods in Velious, Paladins were gods in PoP.  Switching to the &quot;flavor of the week&quot; class (not to say that warriors are there right now) chances are about the time you get your new toon leveled up a new class will be the semi-overpowered cool class that everybody wants to group with.  <br />
<br />
If you really think a warrior would be fun to play though, well there's a few people on this board that will most likely agree with you :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladymir</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first character ever, created about a month after release was a Halflink Warrior. I levelled him up to 21 before I had to take a 6 month break from EQ due to moving. I levelled him up the hard way, but was proud of my duel langseaxs, bronze BP, and Skull Shaped Barbute some uber l33t guk raider gave me. :)<br />
<br />
So in a sense making a warrior is going back to my roots. I have played nearly every class at some time or other; and I am not making a warrior because its the flavor-of-the-expansion class, rather, it is out of a plain old desire to play one.<br />
<br />
And if you ask me, whether people agree with it or not, Paladins and SKs are still the preferred tank class, esp for groups. But I don't care about that either - being able to duobox a cleric and/or shaman I can kindof make my own groups :)<br />
<br />

Rerolled when Maelin was introduced, went Barb (Rallos Zek) now 65 and slowly adding AAs (I'm powerputzer) <br />
<br />
RZ was the choice for the fierce Heraldic Armor line. (Which I still wear) The Fulvous line (Ogre Crafted Armor) has a few more stats over Heraldic<br />
<br />
I would definitely agree that Agi's are the hardest stat to raise with equipment vs Sta/Str/Hps. But that it also provides the least return on investment. (Just IMO)<br />
<br />
I havent checked the latest concepts and info thru parsers about Dex=Proc Frequency, but I've always felt and believed it does, but Dex is easy to cap with the Enchanter Illusion Spells (Garou/Pumpkin)<br />
<br />
Resists are what is currently killing me, back to LDoN I go. (/sigh)<br />
<br />
Lamentation/Defiance combination (if available at a reasonable price) is a solid pre-45 DW combo. Had few issues maintaining aggro. Post 45 Procs are your friend. I can't give any advice on solo-ing as its something I never expected to do as a warrior, but my personal philosophy is Procs to Get Aggro, AC and HPs to handle the aggro. The new incite line does help bunches towards that goal.<br />

Now, I have the world's smartest troll warrior, but basically threw away my beginning points.  Hasn't made a damn bit of difference.  Fully raid buffed, all 4 combat stats are maxed at 255.  W/ two augmented steins, my charisma hits 109 for selling and tradeskilling.  But my unbuffed intel is right around 100!  Not many warriors can say that...especially the trolls and ogres.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I was gonna do it again, I'd throw em at Agility...hardest combat stat to raise and the leftovers at Dex.  Agility is responsible for DEFENSE skillups.  Dexterity is responsible for OFFENSE skillups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of things ...<br />
<br />
1- With LDoN stat augments, stats really are a complete non-issue these days. You can max out any stat you're deficient in. Not only do they drop in adventures, but you can buy +10 stat augments for ANY stat for 310 points from the camps.<br />
<br />
2- At low levels you don't get much stat boost from ANY of the stats, except charisma for selling stuff. And dual CHA cups pretty much do the trick for selling stuff. The HPs you get from high STA at level 3 aren't worth stressing.<br />
<br />
That being the case, I'd go for raw HPs and raw AC. AC at the lower levels is GODLY because that's the level of the game where AC matters most. You CAN reduce the amount of damage you take against a blackburrow gnoll or a pickclaw goblin far more noticably than you can off of the avatar of war or Rallos Zek the Warlord. And raw hit points are great to add at ANY level of the game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck with your warrior.<br />
<br />
Some of your points about monks are a bit off though.<br />
<br />
&quot;it has been longer than that since the pacify/lull 'fix'.&quot;<br />
<br />
The monk mitigation nerf happend PRIOR to the pacify-lull fix. By about one or two patches.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is very disheartening to have a 61 ranger tell me his dps is &gt; mine and not have anyone defend me&quot;<br />
<br />
You should defend yourself in that instance, and not look to others to defend you. Parse it. Prove it. Rangers talk out their ass anyways. Monk DPS is pretty good. Always has been. Ranger archery DPS is pretty situational (for instance no rangers I know of are tearing it up in Mistmoore Catacombs). If a level 61 ranger was claiming to have better DPS than me, I'd certainly defend myself and get that ranger to prove it. Odds are the ranger would be bragging/boasting and not backing it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;even if they put in the single target refresh timed pacify disc for monks,&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not a disc. It's a skill. Just like incite is not a disc. It's a skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of what you say about monks ... having no role, doing bad dps, etc. ... it's all opinion and rhetoric. Which is fine. You're entitled to your opinion. If you enjoy the warrior class more, go for it, have fun. That's the bottom line.<br />
<br />
&quot;PLUS *mayby* when he is 65 he will be desirable on a raid over my cleric&quot;<br />
<br />
That will never happen. In the grand scheme of things clerics are always wanted at raids over tanks. The only time your warrior will be wanted is if there are NO other warriors available. The moment your guild has 3 to 4 warriors, though, the cleric will always be desired more.<br />
<br />
&quot; but I guarantee my monk is never appreciated - ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
That starts with you. You don't appreciate the toon (which is obvious by the way you talk about your downtrodden monk), how can anyone else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a bit surprised you went with being Agnostic, these days cultural armor is really good to have.</div></div><hr />

I honestly didn't know wtf I was doing when I started my warrior. Actually the first time I rolled him up I put a bunch of points into INT and CHA thinking, &quot;hm i'm a troll, i probably need those more than anyone else!&quot; There have been both advantages and disadvantages for worshiping Lord Agnos, but I'd probably go RZ if I had the choice again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, me too - Then again, there was no such thing as cultural armor back in '99, so I guess that covers that.<br />
<br />
I spread my points mostly in STA ans STR and a little in AGI and DEX .... so never felt a reason to remake, though I've been close at times simply because of lack of night vision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, NO NO NO NO.  Stop fucking telling Velious geared warriors to put fucking points in charisma people.  THAT IS NOT A FUCKING CONCERN FOR THEM.<br />
<br />
High End PoP Has zero influence on 90% of the warriors that come to this board.  Hell, most of them would even be lucky to be with a cleric who fucking OWNED divine intervention, much less cast it on them enough times for charisma to be a useful buy.<br />
<br />
Where you should put your puts still depends heavily for non raid warriors on who you're anticipating grouping with.  Friend have a 65 shaman?  Well then you're not gonna need any stats anywhere, put them where ever you feel like it.<br />
<br />
If your only grouping with a cleric or a druid, you may want to consider putting them all into stamina so you can ensure that you have 255/280/305 stamina at all times unbuffed just to lessen the HP hit not having a shaman around will be.<br />
<br />
Agility is pretty much a no no, unless you're really low and wearing a fungi to PL with, your agility is fine, and any points you put into this stat are basically wasted.  Dex is pretty much the same way.  If I had to do it all over again (And i'm talking from a velious geared warrior here), I'd max stamina, because right now i can only hit 283, and another 25 points would have me sitting perfectly at 305, with room to wiggle.  Since all the stats are more or less useless with a shaman around, go for the one that will save you a buff slot ---- Stamina.</div></div><hr />

LDoN is a blast, and no I don't always have a Cleric or Shaman there, and two boxing LDoN is a nightmare to me. Worship RZ, that is most important thing for you now. I started in 1999, picked RZ cause I felt thats what an Ogre would do. Boy, did it turn out to be good to roleplay that one a bit.</div></div><hr />
