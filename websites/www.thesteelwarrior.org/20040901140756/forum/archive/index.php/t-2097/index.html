<br />
Is it true that WAR (along with a ROG for that matter) still get a 5% XP bonus, as compared to other classes?<br />

Luna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wars get 10% exp bonus.<br />
Rogues get 5% exp bonus.<br />
<br />
They got these due to the fact that they have no soloing powers.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that the knights should have exp penalties still...what was it? 30%?<br />
<br />
That's why you see a lot of Gnome/Halfling warriors. I believe there's an exp bonus to both, not sure on the gnome, but 5% on halflings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">NT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Class based EXP bonuses/penalties were REMOVED long, long ago.  All that remains is Racial bonus/penalty.  Worst EXP penalty in the game is Iksar/Troll.  Only bonus is Halfling.<br />
<br />
So, an Halfling Paladin will get an exp bonus, while a Human Warrior is the baseline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They only removed penalties, I'm pretty sure warriors still get a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">- rogues and warriors get 10% xp bonus<br />
- all other classes lvl same<br />
- There are still racial bonuses and penalties<br />
- AA xp everyone gets the same regardless of class/race</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So knights: <br />
- get exp at the same rate we do (when looking at class)<br />
- double casting cost was removed<br />
- 2H damage bonus (making dual wielding pointless)<br />
- HP brought up to just barely shy of Warrior<br />
- not only get spells from their parent class, but unique spells of their own<br />
- got a boost to spell casting while in combat (swings queued)<br />
- instant summon top speed (+1) horse purchaseable with AA (free)<br />
- can wear 97.9 percent of the top Warrior gear<br />
<br />

<br />
Warriors get an exp bonus, knights don't<br />
<br />
- 2H damage bonus (making dual wielding pointless) <br />
<br />
We get the 2h damage bonus also.  Dual wielding is not pointless, just less attractive.  Dual wielding does have it's place, even though smaller, but thats not an issue with knights, it's an issue with itemization and mobs that hit hard enough that ripostes really hurt.<br />
<br />
- instant summon top speed (+1) horse purchaseable with AA (free) <br />

Heh, I would love a war boar mount (model like war boars in tactics, considering it's the plane of war, it would seem proper =p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, that's the biggest problem with knight/warrior balancing. They took away damned near all the penalties for playing a hybrid class.   They were underpowered at one time, and had a list of really harsh penalties in exchange for casting abililty.  The problem is that when they corrected it, they overcorrected it and took away their xp penalty, increased offensive and defensive ability, changed their mana pools, shifted spells around, added spells, totally screwed up itemization, and basically made them warriors that traded /disc defensive for a spellbook.  (for all the knights that are getting set to flame me for that statement, I'm aware of the fact that it's an oversimplification of the matter, but it's still not far off the mark).  Personally I do think there should be an xp penalty for playing a hybrid.  I don't think it should be as severe as it once was, and I dont think it should have an effect on the rest of the group's xps(which makes knights less attractive to groups, or it used to), but it should definitely be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You know that is one idea where I actually might not mind them adding that I had to spend AA's on.<br />

<br />
Oh well... back to work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been linked the old VI letter about XP changes and this is what I think it boils down to:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors get the highest XP bonus in the game at 10%<br />
<br />
Rogues are the only other class to have a bonus, and that checks in at 9.5%.<br />
<br />
Classes no longer have a true class-based penalty, making it easier for people to play the class they want to play, rather then the class that they feel compelled to play due to faster development.<br />
<br />
Race based penalties are no longer shared with the group, but still exist individually.  The following are the races with penalties:<br />
<br />
Troll/Iksar -- 20%<br />
Ogre -- 15%<br />
Barbarians -- 5%<br />
<br />
Only the Halfing has a bonus, which checks in at 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class based penalties came about as it was immediately apparant that some races and classes would be more powerful than others given versatiliy and other factors.  Subsequent to their initial evaluation, it quickly became apparant that he concept of &quot;more powerful&quot; quickly became dubious, as everyone capped at the same level.<br />
<br />
VI, after some heated discussions, then concluded that classes are roughly equivalent in power throughout the level ranges, and that versatility does not make up for that penalty.  As a result, they removed the class-based penalties.  Ironically, however, they opted *not* to remove the class *bonuses*, as the bonuses were deemed to not be so severe that they unbalanced the classes.  <br />
<br />
I guess, at the end of the day, those of you WAR who are screaming *Nerf the Knights!* to the &quot;Nth&quot; degree and such should prepare yourselves big time for the XP bonus argument. Im not necessarily making any conclusions whatsoever, but the fact remains that WAR *do* get a 10% XP bonus, whereas the SHD/PAL do not.  I have yet to see this brought up in *any* of these threads here, but it exists and it wouldnt surprise me that that argument will be made soon enough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, just a note: exp bonus' and penalties do not apply to AA.  Me (65 dorf war) and a 65 barb shaman were grouped once, and happened to ding an aa on the very same mob.  After a while of playing, we both got a second aa ding on the same mob again.  Barbs supposably have a 5% penalty, wars a 5% bonus, if it affected aa, then we wouldn't have dinged at the same time each time.  Not that I'm complaining, I've never been a fan of exp bonus' / penalties.  I think there should be innate bonus' that help the classes that get the boost, all these exp bonus' do is change how long it takes to get to the end, doesn't actually balance anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I noticed the same.  My warrior (half elf) and my girlfriends inky SK had synchronised XP for a couple of days (were always in the same group / always raid together) and we both dinged 2-3 AAs always on the same kill together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agree 100% Hussar.  I can further attest to the penalty / bonus NOT affecting AA XP.<br />
<br />
2 level 65 SHD, one an Ogre and the other an Iksar dinged AA at exact same time--then re-dinged at exact same time a little while later.  Both were at 100% AA XP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh, i wonder how many more times a warrior has died during his career than a support class he has been tanking for? Bet the exp would add up some eh? :)</div></div><hr />

Sure, give us the solo ability of monks or even paladins since this was the stated rational and you can delevel me.<br />
<br />
But... Gee I play an ogre warrior and if you are removing the class bonuses, shouldn't the race penalties go to, if we are being fair?  After all race penalties aren't there in the upper game.  Guess that would mean I get an xp bonus?<br />
<br />
Really, how many warriors play either ogre/troll/barbarian compared to paladins.   Probably 70-80% of warriors play one of these races, and ogre/troll warrior actually have an xp penalty.  There are no ogre/troll/barbarian paladins on the other hand.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and remove the xp bonus, the xp penalties and the solo penalty, I think most if not all warriors would welcome that.</div></div><hr />

No. If ogres/trolls/barbarians/iksar didn't have exp penalties, everyone would want to be one because they have wacked out stats...you'd be stupid not to.<br />

I'd bet against 70-80%, but about 40-50% would be reasonable. There are ogre/troll sks though.....same difference, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Penalties have already been removed.  Bonus's are still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You are mixing up race penalties with class penalties (bonuses).  They are two seperate things and you need to examine them individually.  Claiming that most WAR are races that have XP penalties and that they should get an XP bonus at the high-end of the game has nothing to do with it.  The race is generating the penalty, not the class.  By your rational, *ALL* classes that have a XP-penalty based race should get an XP bonus at the upper game.  I don't follow your logic I guess.<br />
<br />
Personally, I believe that dismissing the XP bonus because WAR can't solo well is a rather weak argument.  VI has never been shy about broadcasting that EQ is far more about grouping then soloing, and recent patches support that sentiment (XP for full groups is rather nice now).  Furthermore, no one is going to convince me that solo is a more risk-adverse situation to XP in then grouping.  In today's environment, in general, you'd be a fool to solo in any situation, save for you have absolutely no other option (especially melee classes).  I can say from personal experience that substantially all of my XP has come from groups.  I'm 65 with 240AA atm.  What does that mean?  I sure as hell would take the XP bonus over my ability to solo every day of the week and twice on Sunday..<br />
<br />
I suppose all Im saying is you don't have to like the benefit of having an XP bonus to recognize that it *is* a benefit.  You can do your best to dismiss it, as I did with the ability to solo above, but is *DOES* exist and it *IS* a benefit nonetheless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have not seen the penalties removed in any patch message.<br />
I still think the racial penalties and bonuses are in effect and the class bonus and penalties too.<br />
I know of the patch message that change the XP in groups, so class bonuses would not be in affecting other groupmembers XP, which was done by diving the XP from a kill evenly to all members and then creating extra XP to those classes that had a penalty, so they would recieve the same share of their current level, percentwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Here are some excerpts from that patch way back when...<br />
<br />
&quot;Summary<br />
<br />
The changes that we are making in the next patch should have a profound impact upon the game:<br />
<br />
&quot;Classes no longer have a true class-based experience penalty, making it easier for people to play the class that they want to play, rather than the class that they feel compelled to play due to faster advancement.&quot; <br />
<br />
Race based penalties are no longer shared with the group...<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
<br />
&quot;Class-based experience bonuses (which warriors and rogues get) are also not appropriate, as they cannot be so if penalties are not. However, we've decided to leave this as-is, since the bonus is not so severe as to be unbalancing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>djjinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So, you are saying that races don't balance, therefore racial xp penalties are ok, but classes do balance, so class bonuses are bad.  <br />
<br />
Well classes don't balance, and in fact races are alot closer to balanced than classes.  How many times have I died, or not been able to do a quest because I'm an ogre.  Well guess I could spend a week or so to up my faction, but that is time I'm not xping.  Then the cultural armor is useless for agnostic armors and trolls, I don't think this is true of any &quot;non-penalty&quot; race.  <br />
<br />
The whole problem is that classes don't balance.  If I said Paladins are out of wack, lets hit them with a +20% exp mod compared to warriors, there would be a great outcry.  Yet you say that the advantages of a troll/iksar over most other races is enough.  The only real advantage they have is some regeneration, while a paladin gets heals.  Yes paladins have some disadvantges vs. warriors, but then troll/iksar/ogre/barbarian have some disadvantages vs. other races.<br />
<br />
You are trying to maintain a double standard.  It's necessary that knights not have xp penalties, but necessary for racial penalties, since they have an advantage (and some extra disadvantages).  <br />
<br />
Another fact is that warriors are having a hard time getting in xp groups.  Much harder than paladins or SK at this time.  Regardless of why or what the solution is, it does exist.  Compounding this problem is the fact that warriors are probably the poorest soloers in the game and not only the most group dependant, but dependant on certain other classes being in that group.  A warrior without a healing class in the group is a sad sight.   An Paladin or Shadowknight without a healer in a group has reduced effectiveness, a warrior without one tends to become useless weight.  <br />
<br />
I would guess that if the average warrior could solo xp some while lfg, it would add up to that +10% bonus you are worried about.  I know it would have for me.  I have spent many nights tradeskilling or watching other people fight because no available group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">AA xp is same for all...<br />
Are there lots of people here who still lvling up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So, you are saying that races don't balance, therefore racial xp penalties are ok, but classes do balance, so class bonuses are bad.  <br />
<br />
<br />
RACES AREN'T THE SAME! YOU MAY GET THE SAME STATS IF YOU END-GAME RAID, BUT 95% OF US WILL NEVER GET THERE! Jesus Christ folks....<br />
<br />
For example: I'm an Iksar Necromancer. I have a 20% exp penalty because I have a regen/ac bonus. BUT I can last longer in Lich form so more mana=more killing=more levels. THAT balances.<br />
<br />
Now I'm an ogre warrior! Bash, kill, kill! I can kill more with all this nifty ass str and sta! Kill, Kill, Kill! But ogres have a 15% exp penalty, BUT they can last longer in battle....longer lasting=less rezzes=less lost exp=levels faster. THAT balances also.<br />
<br />
And NO, classes aren't balanced right now. Hell, if Manaburn wasn't nerfed, we'd still have AoE groups running rampant. I personally think that hybrids should have class penalties still...at the moment there is almost NO disadvantage to being a hybrid to a pure-melee.<br />
<br />
Yet you say that the advantages of a troll/iksar over most other races is enough. The only real advantage they have is some regeneration <br />
<br />
Yes paladins have some disadvantges vs. warriors, but then troll/iksar/ogre/barbarian have some disadvantages vs. other races. <br />
<br />
See above again. RACES WERE MEANT TO BE BALANCED! That's why there's race penalties. Like I said before, if there was no penalty to being an iksar sk back in the day, dontcha think EVERYONE would've been one? <br />
<br />
You are trying to maintain a double standard. It's necessary that knights not have xp penalties <br />
<br />
No, I said that knights SHOULD have exp penalties because they reap the bonuses of 2 classes.<br />
<br />
Compounding this problem is the fact that warriors are probably the poorest soloers in the game  <br />
Wrong. Rogues can't solo worth shit. Clerics solo like crap. Rangers pretty much solo like crap. But feel sorry for the druid over there who got all the trades, but all suck (last one was sarcasm)<br />
<br />
I hope next time you understand me fully before you post again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">To answer your question Casai, yes there are a lot of people here who are still leveling up.  Different people have different play styles and different amounts of time they can spend playing.  The assumption that the end game is all that matters for class balance, and that everyone is in the end game is the reason class balance is so monumentally fucked up now.  I created my warrior in 1999, and he's lvl 57 with 3 AA.  In that span of time I've taken time off from the game several times due to RL issues, and have leveled a shaman to 40 just because it was so damned easy to do.  (did that before they made progressing through the early and mid levels a joke)  My warrior is the only character I play now, has been for months, and in that time I've gone from 51 to 57.  I just don't have much time to play.  So, for those of us who aren't 65 with 240AA, this is a relevant discussion, and based on the facts here, beefing up hybrids the way they did in tandem with removing their xp penalty was a really bad idea.  One of the other would have been fine.  A little of both would have been fine. Doing it the way they did was just moronic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ninja is pretty much hitting the nail right on the head on the race discussion.<br />
<br />
One thing I would caution, however, is promoting a XP penalty for SHD/PAL.  The reason is that a penalty of that kind suggests that SHD/PAL are out fo balance with *ALL* other classes, which Im not sure is the case.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that many on this board are far more concerned with how a SHD/PAL stacks up against a WAR.  And, if it is true that a SHD/PAL is vastly superior to a WAR, then I would argue that a WAR should receive *more* of an XP bonus to compensate.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>djjinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I hope next time you understand me fully before you post again. <br />
Hmm, I think I understand you, you are either being arguementative for arguements sake or are just trolling.  (Really I don't think personal attacks should be here, that is a real sign of either a troll or poor arguement)<br />
<br />
 I am stating that if you are going to take away class bonuses for warrior/rogue, you should also take away racial penalties becuase the inequity is much greater there.  How many people who know the game are starting warriors rather than paladins/SK now?  Even with the uber +10% exp bonus.  If I play a Paladin I go normal xp.  If I go troll warrior I get +10% penalty.  That is not balanced.  If you take away the xp balancing of the classes it it hypercritical to leave in the racial penalties.<br />
<br />
<br />
You, on the other hand seem to be saying that racial xp penalties are fine, and in fact should be expanded to classes to balance it out.  Well to keep it relative what kind of xp bonus would balance warriors/paladins/shadowknight? Considering troll/iksar penalty is already 20% would it take 100%?  200%?  I don't see this as a ealistic balancing mechanism.<br />
<br />
Wrong. Rogues can't solo worth shit. Clerics solo like crap. Rangers pretty much solo like crap.  <br />
<br />
Guess you've never seen any of these classes solo fear kite.  All of them can.  Rogues aren't that great though, guess that's why they also have an xp bonus.  Still better than warriors.  Higher level clerics can solo fairly well with the hammer of outrageous procing, yaulp and pet.  Rangers are very good soloers vs. animal mobs.  <br />
<br />
RACES AREN'T THE SAME! YOU MAY GET THE SAME STATS IF YOU END-GAME RAID, BUT 95% OF US WILL NEVER GET THERE! Jesus Christ folks.... <br />
What do you consider the end-game.  I would say that alot more than warriors 5% will get to the point where buffs/gear bring them to max str/sta/dex/agi  regardless of starting race with good gear selection.  You don't need time-gear for this, you don't need elemental gear.  Most warriors post 60 will have these stats maxed on a raid.  Same goes for every class really, post 60 what they consider their important stats will tend to be maxed on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just cause you wanted it.<br />
<br />
But as a shadowknight how much EXP have you saved with FD?<br />
<br />
How much EXP do you think Paladins saved from their rez?<br />
<br />
I honestly wouldn't give a rats ass if this bonus to exp was removed from warriors; its not like it amplifies the amount of experience your group receives like it once did ( yes individual EXP bonuses and penalties used to apply to a group ). A class that can properly solo will gain more exp per unit of time than a warrior will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">how did this turn into another hybrid whine thread? the original poster only asked if there was xp bonus for warriors/rogue. It was answered with a yes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">the Racial penalties aren't related to starting statistics.<br />
<br />
Barbarians have a 5% penalty for the ability to slam as a medium size race as well as the being able to wear medium and large armor (back when armor size actually meant something)<br />
<br />
Ogres have a 15% experience penalty for immunity to frontal stuns.<br />
<br />
Trolls and Iksar have the 20% for regeneration.  Iksar also have an AC bonus but is countered due to the not being able to wear plate armor (of course the higher end armors are not affected)<br />
<br />
If I was to start my warrior again I'd make a halfling warrior, only requires 85% of the experience to level, have the small size for proximity aggro, good faction, and sneak/hide.</div></div><hr />

LOL.  You arent keeping things consistent.  For instance, if you played a dwarf warrior vs. a dwarf paladin, then what??  Picking a troll warrior and comparing to any race PAL (as a PAL cannot be a Troll) is inconsistent.<br />
<br />
You sure are having a hard time separating class issues from races isses.<br />
<br />
However, as Casai brought up, the whole point of this thread was if WAR get an XP bonus, which they do, and that that *is* an advantage to being a WAR.  That's it.  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Personal EXP multipliers used to apply to the entire group.<br />
<br />
That means is you had a troll Shadowknight in your group, the group had to pay the 40% exp penalty for the troll SK. They changed it and only the person playing the troll has a 20% penalty applied to their personal, normal EXP bar ( not AAEXP ).<br />
<br />
That make it a bit clearer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I believe it worked out to be something similar too:<br />
<br />
A troll SK took 140% of the exp of a normal group member per kill and only had 100% added to their exp bar ( Leaving the other members of the group with less exp to divide )<br />
<br />
You would have to ask someone that played that far back for the exact info however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Yes, it's clearer.  Unfortunately, I think you have it *BACKWARDS* from a WAR perspective.<br />
<br />
The way EXP used to be divided was based on how much *experience* each character in the group had.  So, if you had a level 30 Troll SHD and a level 30 Human WIZ in the group, the SHD would get more experience per kill, as he has more experience then the WIZ, yet the total experience for the mob didn't change according to the group's makeup.<br />
<br />
Under those rules, however, a WAR would actually be *penalized*, as WAR had the biggest XP bonus in the game.  By extension, that would result in LESS XP per kill in comparison to the rest of the group (assuming non-war that is).<br />
<br />
So, yeah, you're right--it was *NOT* as good for all NON-WAR classes before they *nerfed* it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Then play a halfling. Honestly you guys had what, close to 3 years of the perks with almost 0 downside other then higher xp requirement and a few faction issues. All of the high end gear was always war / all, only mid range items picked the small / medium / fatties appart. <br />
<br />
Just because you are deemingly no 'better' now then a halfing at the high end doesn't mean you had a harder route to that end. Even in the days of the higher xp requirement you sucked that up compared to a race without an xp penalty. 3 years of 3 race slam monopoly, one race complete frontal stun immunity coupled with high sta. Sorry, I don't shed any tears.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I would love a war boar mount (model like war boars in tactics, considering it's the plane of war, it would seem proper =p)=p)  <br />
<br />
no, not really. Plane of War is the very left stone at the 5 stones in tranq, it never got impleted. Manaetic behemoth was supposed to flag for PoWar and in PoWar you flag for tactics. they skipped it to rush release it seems.</div></div><hr />

HahahaHHAHhahaha :[</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Kellaen, try playing a fatty in places like SolA or B, Najena, CT, and Guk BEFORE twinkage, when shrink potions were incredibly expensive, cobalt bracers were nearly unheard of (or simply didn't exist), and there were no minimizing devices. I frequently could go places only with great difficulty, or NOT AT ALL, simply because of size.<br />
<br />
Now that everyone is a fatty twink with shrink-on-demand, it's a little different. But if you think there were no downsides besides the exp thing and the faction issues, then you don't have a clue. That size issue was a BIG DEAL back in the day. <br />
<br />
I like my ogre, but I certainly paid my dues for whatever advantage I got with him (which is now totally mitigated with AA and gear).</div></div><hr />

BTW: Ogre exp penalty is 15%. Subtract 10%, and you get like 5%....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, think in terms of group desirability. Having a member in a group that amplifies your share of exp would be quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Starting stats are definitely something to pay a penatly for in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
People who have gear that maxes their stats are people in raiding guilds and the entry requirement for most guilds raiding the end game has always been one of lvl60 pre PoP and lvl65 now days.<br />
<br />
We already know that the experience penalty doesnt apply to AAXP, so for most players once you are at the level that your stats are maxed you are no longer suffering the XP penalty anyway.<br />
<br />
As for the stats, as a Half elf I had 80 stamina nakid, an ogre who had also not put starting stats into stamina would have 132 stamina naked.  As you grind away those levels in Plane of Valor or where ever so you can get 65 to join your uber guild and get gear that will max your stats, the dude playing an ogre has a 300+ HP advantage over the dude playing a half elf.  He also has the advantage of no stun from infront and much higher strength (means more atk and dealing more damage).<br />
<br />
You can't tell me those races are balanced and that there shouldn't be an XP penalty for that free 300hps etc.  And before you bring up faction it is completely irrelevant in the days of the plane of knowledge and hasnt really been a penalty since the release of velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Ninja, my comparison was with halflings, who get a 5% bonus, while ogres get a 15% penalty. In aggregate that's 20%. Ogres might be 10% better than halflings; they aren't 20% better.<br />
<br />
Try leveling an untwinked, unshrunk ogre in only old world zones -- no Najena, no Sol A or B, no CT, Guk a huge pain, etc. Because people only exp in gimp outdoor zones *now* doesn't mean that stuff didn't matter. I lost a lot of ground to smaller race warriors because of size *alone* -- never mind the exp hit, faction, etc. I'm not saying ogres suck because they don't. I just think the fact that halflings, who are a perfectly good warrior race, get a bonus is stupid. They certainly shouldn't get a bonus over half-elves, who have both worse stats and worse racial abilities than halflings. Sneak, hide and a 5% bonus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I always thought halflings got the bonus by mistake and it should actually have been on humans as they get NOTHING for being human.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I got a LONG reply, so just sit down with me folks.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I think I understand you, you are either being arguementative for arguements sake or are just trolling. (Really I don't think personal attacks should be here, that is a real sign of either a troll or poor arguement) <br />
<br />
Sir, do you think that my 240+ posts are just trolls? No, no, and no. <br />
<br />
Higher level clerics can solo fairly well with the hammer of outrageous procing, yaulp and pet. <br />
<br />
When was the last time you saw a cleric solo 50+? I can't even remember EVER seeing a cleric solo past then. Anyway, my main WAS a cleric so I can easily vouch that clerics can't really solo all <br />
too well.<br />
<br />
Rangers are very good soloers vs. animal mobs.  <br />
Yet how many animal mobs are there? Last time I checked, a LOT of PoP mobs are classified under &quot;monster&quot;. (The frogs in PoS might be animals, not sure on that one.) And again, ranjas may be able to put out DPS, but they can't tank worth crap. Plus, bow kiting is too long to do and isn't really worth it in the long run.<br />
<br />
What do you consider the end-game. <br />
<br />
65 with 200+ AAs raiding the elemental planes or in Time.<br />
<br />
would say that alot more than warriors 5% will get to the point where buffs/gear bring them to max str/sta/dex/agi regardless of starting race with good gear selection. <br />
<br />
<br />
I believe Haass hit on the nail with this: <br />
<br />
...there are quite a few people who can't hit 255 stamina..either thru gear, or maybe they don't have a shaman around all the time. The deal is that the only way you're going to max stamina is if you meet one of the 3 conditions -- <br />
1) You rolled an Ogre.<br />
2) You have enough platinum to get the correct stamina maxing gear in the bazaar<br />
3) You're in a high end guild.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but I NEVER hit the cap for STA without buffs, etc. which don't count because you'll never have buffs on you constantly unless you 2-box a CLR/DRU/SHM.<br />
<br />
Most warriors post 60 will have these stats maxed on a raid. Same goes for every class really, post 60 what they consider their important stats will tend to be maxed on raids. <br />
<br />
There goes that &quot;R&quot; word again...RAID! Look, not all of us are in a raiding guild, so we all don't go crawling around with raid buffs all the time. As I mentioned before, I never hit the STA cap....I don't feel bad about it either....<br />
<br />
EDIT: Whoops I have MORE to talk about.<br />
<br />
<br />
 How many people who know the game are starting warriors rather than paladins/SK now? <br />
LOTS. I probably see 3 warriors to every knight on Cazic-Thule.<br />
<br />
Even with the uber +10% exp bonus. If I play a Paladin I go normal xp. If I go troll warrior I get +10% penalty. <br />
<br />
Other than the smartass comment about the exp bonus, trolls get an exp penalty because they have regen+stats comparable to an ogre. I gladly paid a 20% penalty with my iksars, and I'd do it again if I had to. Plus, you're comparing a class/race combo with no penalties against it to a class with a bonus half the size of the penalty. At least compare something equal.<br />
<br />
Considering troll/iksar penalty is already 20% would it take 100%? 200%? I don't see this as a ealistic balancing mechanism. <br />
<br />
Uhh...before the class exp penalty was removed, troll/iksar sks had to level 50% more than a class with no penalties. And you know what? People still did it. They did it for the love of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">While I'm on the subject, I'd like to point out that on raids nowadays, when all stats are maxed, SE AAs are bought, and kicks stun, ogres are *still* left with the exp penalty and a 37 starting score in the ONLY stat that's a raid-breaker -- charisma (not to mention no sneak and no hide). Trolls of course get boned even worse. <br />
<br />
The extra hps were nice growing up, but my halfling friend was 60 when I was late 57, with equivalent exp. Guess who was a better tank, extra sta and all? For me in Kunark/Velious, getting 58-60 took *months*.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the ranting. The magnitude of these racial exp differences has been bugging me for a while. Some difference might be justified, but not the size they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that, but the plane of war was scrapped, and Tactics is the one home of Rallos Zek, the God of War.  Maybe I didn't word it well, but it technically is the plane of war now, since there isn't the original, in my mind anyway.  But still, the war boars do exist in the home of the god of war, makes enough sense for me.  Not like I expect them to impliment it, and I'm not really fighting for it, just explaining my reasoning.</div></div><hr />
