I pretty much thought that he spawns in the middle and stays there until he is engaged.  Plus something about banishing anyone who gets aggro if they aren't in the raid that spawned him.<br />
<br />
Reason I ask is that when my guild went to kill RZtW the last time (only our 2nd attempt) instead of being in the center of the pit, he was moving towards the pig pen exit and jumped the raid force as we were setting up.</div></div><hr />

If he was walking, then hmm, that's pretty freaking wierd.  If he was sprinting, then it sounds like one of your raid members didn't float down the pit in the right spot.  :D<br />
<br />
I'd assume you mean walking though.  That's, umm, very weird.</div></div><hr />

I think it was a Triadica raid and not a Furious Pantaloons one though, but maybe the same thing happened during your raid.</div></div><hr />

You didnt see any of the several zonewide emotes that occur minutes before RZTW spawns? =P</div></div><hr />

It was only like the second time our little group had been there =/  All the mobs disappeared, and then the big guy himself was payin us a visit.  If that agro we got could position the mob badly and then screw up a raid, then the raid leaders should probably /ooc something about it.  We did ask what they were doing, but just get dumb answers like &quot;orc pawn&quot; and such...</div></div><hr />
