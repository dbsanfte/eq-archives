The best part of script was the reset so fast so you had to rush and be good to kill it, now it seems like they are gimping this more and more. Regardless we killed VZ WHO DIDN’T split, yes repeat did not split. Then RZ, then real RZ only summoned adds 2 times…………………. Please say it aint so<br />

Had a couple of Decorin elites add on the first pull that we weren't expecting, so we wiped at 17%.  Got rezzed and rebuffed, and RZtW still hadn't despawned so we pulled him again and killed him.  We got 20-25 adds though, wouldn't say he's completely gimped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A guild wiped on him last night..<br />

Apparently he's still up, thinking he's a member of the Wayfarer's brotherhood, TLing people on request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... we killed him today (kill #11, the other 10 were a bit, uhhh, tougher...). First wave of adds didn't spawn until he was at 40% - two minutes into the fight. Working as intended? My ass.  I've been emailing and petitioning for since day of LDoN release regarding RZ being bugged. Thursday morning I got my first non-automated response from a Guide, &quot;thanks for the concern.&quot;  Indeed.  Concern I'd kind of like to see them share with me.  A French guild had wiped to him about 6 hours earlier, our raid didn't even freaking spawn him.  He was sitting in the arena all day long.    Fake Tallon was up since yesterday when another guild wiped at him... French guild picked up from there today and wiped at RZtW... we finished it tonight.  They need to go around despawning Rallos (or whatever portion the script is hung up at) on all servers until this is fixed.  What a joke.  Sorry assed guilds on various servers, who otherwise would not stand a chance at killing RZ, are going to be lining up for the chance to gimp their way into the elemental planes. Is SOE going to do anything about it?<br />

Discussion with an officer of the guild that wiped on fake TZ yesterday:<br />

[Thu Sep 11 18:39:15 2003] You told *****, 'how long did you wait for it to reset last night?'<br />
[Thu Sep 11 18:39:17 2003] You told *****, 'on tz'<br />

This is obviously broken, and they aren't doing shit. Yet.  Send your emails, submit your bug reports, unleash the petitions... this needs urgent attention and it ain't getting it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed him last night. We triggered the event and didnt have any problems, first wave came at 80%. I believe there was 3 waves, but it may have been two. <br />

PS, Innoruuk's RZtWL likes to drop the BoW, some of ya picked the wrong server.</div></div><hr />

Of course we didn't fail to see if the script would reset... will leave that up to someone else. :)</div></div><hr />
