<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Come on then Paladins, would you care to try to count up how many times throughout your careers (yes even that terrible kunark period) you have made use of your spell book. How many times have your heals saved a party member/the group, how many times have you rooted an angry mob to allow yourself to make a clean getaway, how many times have you crowd controlled a mob, how many times have you pacify pulled, how many times have your cures been essential to keeping a raid force upright, how many times has a stun saved you from imminent death, how many times has your fast heal prevented the MT 's death, how many times have you broken a mez with stuns, how many times while levelling up could you solo/duo compared with an average warrior etc etc etc...<br />
<br />
What the fuck is it about you spoilt bastards that you believe that all those advantages were a fucking freebie? That they mean nothing, that you should be able to do all this, have a complete set of caster foci and Ft15 and still tank just as good if not better than a fucking warrior? <br />
<br />
I've allowed myself in the past to waver and say how maybe you do need to be as good a tank as me, after all you 'never' get groups /sarcasm off. What a lot of horseshit, Nowadays i see Paladins grouped every fucking day providing a useful input to group and if they have better equipment than me they get to tank also, even back in kunark I was grouping with your gimp asses. <br />
<br />
In short, I have no fucking respect for any of you whinging pricks anymore. You need a serious cocktail of reality and STFU.<br />
<br />
How the fuck can you justify this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The basis of his rant is correct.  Not much a Paladin can say to change his mind.  <br />
<br />
Currently, Paladins are preferred for experience groups tanking, and have made inroads on raid tanking as well.  If I played a Warrior main I would be frustrated too.<br />
<br />
The question is what to do about it…  The goal should be to make Warriors an equal choice for experience group tanking (taking EVERYTHING into consideration), while maintaining the traditional raid roles of each class.  A secondary goal should be to not encourage groups to find more ways to succeed without a plate tank at all.<br />

<br />
Warriors are equally as arrogant and agrivating as knights can be.  While, the snide remarks of some of you contribute nothing, I will say this.  Soe should pick a path for knights to go on.  I think the current trend isn't too bad, but obviously some things need to be worked out.  The question is, what do you &quot;fix&quot;.  The melee half, the caster half, or both?  <br />
<br />
My feelings are this:  Itemization and Spells are the main problems.  Knights (and every other class to an extent) should not be allowed the &quot;best&quot; tank-ish gear.  That should be exclusive to warriors alone.  Also, knights, and other &quot;hybrids&quot;, should not be given access to ANY FT or focus items.  Part of the &quot;hybrid&quot; penalty should be missing out on the big perks of gear for either side.  Furthermore, hybrid spellbooks should be far more restricted-now, they weren't out of balance before.  90% of their spells should be scrapped.  All buffs, aside from perhaps unique ones to the class.  Paladins should, imo, retain only agro spells (even if they need to be watered down to an extent), the paladin only heals, and *maybe* brells.  Absolutely everything else should be stripped from the class.  I feel, and there is a possibility I am wrong (I don't claim to have a perfect idea), that then things would work out better for everyone.  <br />
<br />
This &quot;philosopy&quot; of sorts comes from a melee centric view of paladins though.  Some people may say that they should dwell more on their caster side ( I don't think anyone really does though...).  The real contending idea is that they should be shitty combination of warriors and clerics.  I really, really don't want that role...and yes I&quot;m aware that my feelings don't matter all that much.  <br />
<br />
While many of you may not like the idea of the balance this would promote, is it unreasonable?  If you feel you should be the unquestioned best at tanking, in every way, it may be.  But, can you really justify such across the board perfection and still call it balance?  When you apply it to paladins...you say its not.</div></div><hr />

May I ask one question?  I registered here just to ask it, but how would this be &quot;better&quot; for me and my fellow paladins?  How would you propose we enjoy playing the game after that point?  Are we supposed to log in, look at our butchered characters and say &quot;Well, at least the Warriors will be happy.  That's what matters.&quot;?  Okay, that's three questions.<br />

I never wanted to be the best at tanking.  I don't want to be a guild MT on raids - our Warrior guildleader does that job far better than I imagine I would.<br />
<br />
This may sound naive and uninformed coming from only a 62 paladin such as myself, but do classes really have to see each other as enemies?  One might say the most vocal warriors don't want balance, they want vengeance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What dream is it we're denying you? If you wanted to be the best tank why did you not create a warrior? You chose to be less adept in man to man combat for the additional benefits of spells, why is it any surprise that a warrior should be considered first for the Main tank position? You do tank, rather a lot in most groups I've seen, but you covert the first among equals position?<br />
<br />
i'm sorry mate, we all get a little tired of our role sometimes, sometimes I could really go for having all that stuff you do but I CAN'T because that wouldn't be fair on you.<br />
<br />

[/B] <br />
<br />
No I believe everyone here would be perfectly happy if paladins had to make choices. If for every melee upgrade they had to suffer losses in casting power, and to balance that out...<br />
<br />
My contentions... <br />
<br />
no FT items should ever have high hp/ac/str/sta/agil/dex or Vengance ... EVER<br />
<br />
no Focus effects should be on melee gear... EVER<br />
<br />
no gear should EVER have focus spell effects and melee effects (Vengance,  skill mods, haste)... EVER<br />
<br />
no item should ever have 140 hps 130 mana.. WTF.. If it has both mana and hps one SHOULD NEVER be more than half of the other.. EVER<br />
<br />
The very best melee gear, ie hp/ac wise, that is all/all should have detrimental wis/int/mana, just as the best caster gear should have detrimental melee stats..<br />
<br />
The game used to have choices, it used to be a challenge to equip a character just right, you had to maintain resist gear and hp gear and different weapons, you did dps or you got stats.. Now its like shopping at EQ-R-US... every tank wears 90% of the same gear, almost every class wears the same rings and earings, everyone looks the same, has the same gear.. whats the point of 100,000 items if people wear less than a couple hundred?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If you followed what I said, it wouldn't destroy the paladin class.  It gets rid of the non-essentials of the class in order to balance the tanks better.  Is it the only way to go about it?  No.  But in my opinion it was fair.  Yes, I did mention nerfs, essentially.  Some things we *never* should have gotten.  Aura of the Crusader is a prime example of that.  30ish ac, 350hp and mana regen.  Its a caster buff that helps close the natural gap warriors and paladins have in hp/ac.  Its just not something that belongs with our class.  Furthermore, if you strip our buffs, we lose automatic preference when it comes to druid/shaman healers.  This is not an awful fate.  It simply promotes a fairer competition for a spot in any group.  <br />
<br />
My point was, at the VERY least, gear choice has to be a choice.  FT/Focus/Vengence items should come at a cost.  And if you want mana on an item, the mana/hp on an item should be equal, when added together, to the total hp on a comarable item-IE, 200 hp on Bp of uberness, 100 hp/mana on bp of compromise.  Though, perhaps abit more leeway is ok. Cleric buffs, root, proc spells are superfluous to the class.  They are perks that do not go hand in hand with our job and they provide additional, unfair advantages when it comes to choosing a tank.  If you lose them, but keep our agro (in some meaningful form, though, perhaps not &quot;agro lock&quot;) and our paladin only heals... you still retain a nice class.  Heals that are decent *when needed* but mana hogs, as they are now.  When you look at this type of paladin and compare it to a warrior, its not as out of whack.  Lack of undeserved buffs will help maintain a warriors damage absorption edge, while paladins can maintain some agro edge...creating a trade off in what a group wants for a tank...some kind of meaningful choice.  This of course has to be coupled with itemization.<br />
<br />
Now, you can scrap that.  And decide you want to keep all the spells that promote an unequal competition for abilities...and suffer in other ways related to that.  Thats just not my preference, so I didn't bother going into it.  <br />
<br />
This does not destroy a class.  And it is also not the call for vengeance some warriors would love to see.  You need balance though, in some form.  To me, balance simply means that there is equal, but different, incentive to chose one class of any type over another of the same type to fill a similar job.</div></div><hr />

Little advice from a person who plays a class that got assraped between luclin and PoP ... the GAME stays fun. <br />
<br />
Would it stay fun, if I can't contribute the way I could before?  One day, when I logged in, I got a call from some guildies to tank for them in PoN.  When I got there, they were pratically estatic to see me, because their last tank, a Warrior, has not only had trouble keeping aggro; he had trouble finding his /assist hotkey.  You could say they were happy to have me both for my playing skill and my aggro capabilities.  If you take away the latter from me, will the former make up for it?  I'd be surprised if you could answer &quot;Yes, 100 percent&quot; for all situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
It gets frustrating sometimes to log on ... but your friends, your guild the raids, the good times, they're all still there, no matter how gimp your class becomes.<br />

Nope. You're supposed to log on, send tells to your friends, find out what's up, and keep on playing.<br />
<br />
Or quit.<br />
<br />
As the risk of making an ad hominem statement, you're basically saying Knights should accept how Warriors think the Knight classes should be nerfed, or don't play any more. <br />
<br />
Or take the advice MANY a troll who visited monkly biz gave out to many a confused monk over the past year:<br />
<br />
&quot;STFU YOU WHINY MONKS AND ROLL A CASTER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't worry. If the bat swings ... you're more than welcome to ask around on how to deal with the fallout.<br />
<br />
Life goes on. Mobs respawn.  <br />
<br />
And if that happens, will you advocate Warriors giving up what they had just gained?  It seems to me the more vocal warriors are advocating removing a lot of what knight classes gained in the past few expansions. (I assume you wish for SKs to be nerfed as well?)<br />
<br />
As I understand it, a lot of the enhancements the knight classes benefitted greatly from, were put in place by Verant/SOE in order to not make one (or more) classes the only classes that could do certain things.  To break up the perception that the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; was the only combination appropriate for much of the endgame content.  I'm not saying they got it perfect (not hardly),  but those are a lot of things to just rip out from the classes that benefitted from them.  Therefore, I don't think it's likely that they will.</div></div><hr />

&quot;you're basically saying Knights should accept how Warriors think the Knight classes should be nerfed, or don't play any more. &quot;<br />
<br />

<br />

If monks &quot;DESERVED&quot; to be nerfed for being able to tank VT mobs as well as warriors, then knights certainly &quot;DESERVE&quot; to be TOLD they DESERVE to be nerfed for tanking TIME gods as well as warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems to me the more vocal warriors are advocating removing a lot of what knight classes gained in the past few expansions.&quot;<br />
<br />
What exactly did knights gain in the past few expansions that warriors want nerfed?<br />
<br />
They want knights to use their HIGHER LEVEL, HIGHER MANA COST spells to hold aggro reliably, so that it's a TRADEOFF?<br />
<br />
They want to be able to HOLD AGGRO like a knight, so that they can truly be interchangable tanks in XP groups?<br />
<br />
They want to be able to have an EDGE tanking boss mobs, so that they have a raid role, since they can't cast Brell's, or ATK buffs, or hate buffs, or group heals, or remove greater curse, or rez?<br />
<br />
How's that asking for a nerf?<br />
<br />
Oh wait, IT ISN'T!<br />
<br />

&quot;(I assume you wish for SKs to be nerfed as well?)&quot;<br />
<br />
Nope. Ask around, you'll find I want bards and chanters nerfed. But you know me, always being whacky!<br />
<br />
&quot;As I understand it, a lot of the enhancements the knight classes benefitted greatly from, were put in place by Verant/SOE in order to not make one (or more) classes the only classes that could do certain things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharing roles if fine. But the legitimate gripe melees have is that they received NOTHING while losing their roles.<br />
<br />
Monks are marginalized DPS, marginalized pullers, marginalized tanks.<br />
<br />
What'd they get to offset this? What roles do they get to now share?<br />
<br />
None.<br />
<br />
Warriors are marginalized DPS, marginalized tanks.<br />
<br />
What did warriors get to offset this?<br />
<br />
Nada.<br />
<br />
Zilch.<br />
<br />
Zero.<br />
<br />
There is no tradeoff.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;To break up the perception that the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; was the only combination appropriate for much of the endgame content.&quot;<br />
<br />
By creating a NEW holy trinity, you don't exactly break up the perception of not needing a holy trinity.<br />
<br />
P.S. If you actually read much of what I've said here or on MB over the many many months since PoP was released, you'd know that I'm actually in FAVOR of sharing roles.<br />
<br />
As a monk I don't mind sharing the pulling role with lull/pac/harmony classes.<br />
<br />
It HELPS the game to have to NOT use the same group makeup all the time.<br />
<br />
The problem is, as stated above, melees did not receive anything in return for having their roles marginalized.<br />
<br />
Melees can't CC. Melees can't heal. Melees can't buff, or add other little tidbits of utility to a group or raid.<br />
<br />
The job's only HALF done.<br />
<br />
And 200 innate sense heading is NOT a melee fix.<br />

Would it stay fun, if I can't contribute the way I could before?  One day, when I logged in, I got a call from some guildies to tank for them in PoN.  When I got there, they were pratically estatic to see me, because their last tank, a Warrior, has not only had trouble keeping aggro; he had trouble finding his /assist hotkey.  You could say they were happy to have me both for my playing skill and my aggro capabilities.  If you take away the latter from me, will the former make up for it?  I'd be surprised if you could answer &quot;Yes, 100 percent&quot; for all situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what makes warriors so damn mad.  This total willfull blindness on knights part.  This is EXACTLY what warriors have to deal with on a day to day basis.  If you don't like it why the hell should we?</div></div><hr />

It seems to me the Warriors don't want knights to be able to tank the boss mobs at ALL.  And most of the paladins I know agree that warriors need some kind of hate generation that doesn't rely on the RNG.<br />

People are STILL saying it to monks. Still.  As in visit MB, and notice how many people still post &quot;Well you DID deserve to be nerfed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, that would be a yes, then?&quot;<br />

Read what I said. You'll find the answer in it. I'm saying you deserve to be TOLD it.<br />
<br />
I can't nerf you.<br />
<br />
But I can certainly say, you know, if monks deserved to be nerfed then you certainly do too. Because you're doing to warriors the exact same things monks were.<br />
<br />
If in VEXT THAL, monks tanking better than warriors = monk nerf.<br />
<br />
Then in PLANE OF TIME, paladins tanking better than warriors = paladin nerf.<br />
<br />
Not hard to follow.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems to me the Warriors don't want knights to be able to tank the boss mobs at ALL.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well you obviously don't read the boards here. Warriors are pissed not because knights can tank boss mobs.<br />
<br />
They're pissed because knights can tank boss mobs, and can tank xp mobs, and can tank whatever, generate aggro, cast spells, buffs ... the whole package.<br />
<br />
And what do warriors do that knights can't do?<br />
<br />
With knights tanking the end-game boss mobs ... the answer is NOTHING. Zero. Zilch. Nada.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having to share a role isn't the same as losing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since melees have nothing ELSE but those narrowly defined roles ... it is the same as losing it.<br />
<br />
Answer this question ...<br />
<br />
If warriors are NOT needed to tank ANYTHING in Everquest ... if a paladin or a shadowknight can do the job ...<br />
<br />
Why play a warrior? Why have warriors at all?<br />
<br />
What is it they DO exactly?<br />
<br />
Sub-par DPS.<br />
<br />
Mediocre tank.<br />
<br />
No reliable aggro generation.<br />
<br />
They are a waste of server space.<br />
<br />
That's losing a role.<br />
<br />
&quot;FWIW, I disagreed greatly with the monk nerf. No class should have had an ability of their character marginalized like that. &quot;<br />
<br />
At this point in time, it's not worth much. The nerf happened. It's done and over with.<br />
<br />
IF a nerf happens to your class, you'll survive. Trust me on that one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you admit that the new &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; is now &quot;Tank, Healer, Slower&quot; instead of the previous Warrior, Cleric, and Enchanter? Sounds like nine possible choices (at least instead of three).&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not about admitting anything.<br />
<br />
It's about looking at the three classes that fit TANK.<br />
<br />
Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
What does a warrior offer over the other two to help them get picked to fill that role?<br />
<br />
Right now, nothing.<br />
<br />
So think of it as 8 classes. With one off in the side, fighting for that coveted PITY spot in XP groups and showing up at raids simply because DPS, no matter how average, stacks.</div></div><hr />

I never advocate the nerf of another class.  Advotcating nerfs of other classes only makes them enemies, and I think a lot of the issue is that classes see themselves as enemies, which doesn't help anyone.<br />

<br />
The same people who don't ADVOCATE nerfing other classes say &quot;Nooooo ... monks aren't intended to pull and that ability would NERF our pulling superiority.&quot;<br />
<br />
So a monk says, Well howbout upping our DPS to the top end of the game.<br />
<br />
Rangers, Mages, Wizards all stop by to say, &quot;Nope. That's not a monks' job either.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, finally monks say, &quot;well howbout we tank better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Here come the paladins and warriors to say monks can't do that either.<br />
<br />
You don't ADVOCATE nerfing YOUR OWN CLASS.<br />

But you certainly DON'T ADVOCATE IMPROVING WARRIORS.<br />

<br />
I think, at the very least, I have shown a willingness to admit problems and look for a solution (even if it is one that is not acceptable to some/mana).  That being said, this is total bullshit:<br />
<br />
&quot;What knights are willfully blind to is the fact that WARRIORS are the parent class. There should, NEVER, EVER be an instance where a knight is taken over a warrior for ANY group in a tanking situation. &quot;<br />
<br />
I would like to welcome you to the year 2003.  Parent class=meaningless garbage.  Rangers outdamage both warriors and druids (their &quot;parent&quot; classes) by substantial margins, omg!  I think that adhering to an archaic idea like &quot;parent/child&quot; class philosophy is ridiculous.  BUT, even if I accepted this idea, you would still be wrong.  There exist 3 types of classes in everquest:  Tanks, Dps, Utility.  Each class is given a way to fill that role.  When looking at tanks, you get this: <br />
<br />
-Warriors-Tank, pure melee, best gear (in theory) to augment their small focus.  They have an edge in stats/damage to offset what they give up, spells.<br />
<br />
-Paladins- Tank!, melee with spells to offset physical limitations.  Spells to help make up for the lessoned agro a 2 hander generates (I'm assuming that two agro weapons is better then 1) and heals/buffs to make up for the physical limitations.<br />
<br />
-Shadow Knight-reads mostly like the paladin.<br />
<br />
They provide the same roles, but have different strengths and weaknesses.  It is not that warriors are good, everyone else is ass.  Their spells are not utility, exactly, but to MAKE UP for what they trail to warriors in naturally.  A class that cannot tank and has poor casting skills and little dps is useless.  It needs to excell in atleast 1 of those areas through a combination of any of the avenues available.  <br />
<br />
Try this, less painful and cloudy issue:<br />
<br />
Dps classes-<br />
<br />
Rogues- Sustained, reliable dps.  <br />
Wizard-Good burst dps.<br />
Mage-Combo of both (including, interestingly enough, a caster/melee combination)<br />
<br />
These classes present different ways at doing the same job, does that mean one of them should ALWAYS be preferred?  No, because that is stupid.  <br />
<br />
It is clear, that you do not play a caster.  I will not sit here and tell you paladin &quot;utility&quot; is not useful.  But, it is best at augmenting the faults the paladin naturally has in comparison to the warrior, NOT to help the group/raid in general and provide a spot in a group through that.  It is simply not strong enough for that-and no one will ever take it into consideration, no matter how good it is.  A major hurtle in caster balance was understanding that spells (specifically buffs) are only truly useful to a class on paper.  Think:  If mages were given a buff that is basically 1/2 pot9.  Sounds very handy on paper, take it to the real world and... you find that it is meaningless for grouping because both Virtue and Pot9 overwrite it and how often do you really only have a shaman healer?  That is how much of our &quot;utility&quot; is.  Not to mention things like root, which are very powerful... but also a major pain in the ass to use correctly AND tank at the same time.  That job is always better left in someone elses hands.  <br />
<br />
What does that mean?  Fundamentally paladins get three spell lines that are useful: Stuns, Heals, Brells.  Stuns are our agro (whether you feel it is to much or not is not the issue...yet), Heals and brells offset our natural inferiority to warriors when it comes to absorbing damage.  A paladin is, generally, harder to keep alive then a similar stage warrior, our heals offset this by helping keep ourselves alive while the other healer goes at it with their slow heals.  Yes, it has the fringe benifit of being able to heal others, but it augments our tanking as much, if not more, then it does help others.  I'm ignoring Aura of the Crusader because I think it should never have been introduced and should be scrapped as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Any warrior saying that (a) warriors should be the ones people look for when it comes to tank raid mobs and (b) warriors should be a viable option (but NEVER the only one, ie-you only accept a knight if there are NO warriors available) are realistic and have atleast a minium appreciation for balance.  Saying warriors should categorically be the best at both absorbing damage and creating agro is assinine and does not promote balance at all.  Knights are a tank class that augments its inferior damage absorption through spells, NOT an asstastic tank and asstastic caster combo.</div></div><hr />

Why thank you for agreeing with me.  I love how people take quotes out of context to deliberately mislead and make the point they want to.

Would that possibly because neither of a ranger's parent classes are a DPS class, you silly twit ?  Rangers are a great example of a balanced hybrid class.  The love child of tank and utility classes finding it's own specialty/niche.<br />
<br />
  Knights are a tank class that augments its inferior damage absorption through spells, NOT an asstastic tank and asstastic caster combo. [/B] <br />
<br />
Which inferior damage absorbtion ?  Admittedly, the only parses I've seen on pally mitigation lately have been those provided from the AO warr/pally time-god encounters, where the knight took less damage.  However, it's been widely noted and reported for a while, that knights take virtually the same amount of damage as a warrior.  Prove that wrong.<br />
<br />
Normally, I don't get too excited about knights coming in and here and crying &quot;oh yous guyz are all whinerz, lolzzlolzz!!11!&quot; because, to be honest.. you're knights.   Or even when you say &quot;yous guyz are all stoooopid, here's wut we'll do!!1!&quot; . However, for some reason your lack of perception and of objectivity just annoy the shit out of me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After all of these changes, and Luclin AA's and PoP hybrids will be able to deal out the damage of a pure melee class, with the possible exception of rangers, who will get close to outdamaging two of them. The warrior, monk and rogue will still out damage hybrids, and by a noticeable margin until those hybrids log on, then, those hybrids can nitpick that we never meant &quot;outdamage&quot; to include non melee, even though we never said that. The fact that hybrids must now be logged in to outdamage warriors or in extreme cases be fighting undead to do so is in part what hybrids lose for the power of their spells.<br />
<br />
Also, warriors will not have the broadest selection of weapons and armor, unless everyone else not only has access to it, but gains more from using it than warriors.   <br />
<br />
Warriors will still have a significantly larger amount of hit points, as long as you consider half of one hit from a LDoN hard level trash mob, or one hit from an LDoN normal risk mob to be significant.<br />

<br />
Ranger spell damage doesn't even come CLOSE to its parent class.<br />
<br />
In fact, druids outdamage rangers when using spells by a SUBSTANTIAL margin.<br />
<br />
Druids also HEAL substantially better than rangers.<br />
<br />
Seems like ONE parent class is doing its PURE PARENT ROLE far better than its hybrid counterpart.<br />
<br />
Odd how the only &quot;parents&quot; gimped by hybrids are the melees.<br />
<br />
Could that be ... possibly ... because MELEES ARE OUT OF BALANCE?<br />
<br />
Nah ... couldn't be.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that adhering to an archaic idea like &quot;parent/child&quot; class philosophy is ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only think this, because you don't get the whole idea of class balance.<br />
<br />
The idea comes from dungeons and dragons. And was there for a reason.<br />
<br />
Applied to a video game, where one contingent of people who play it, play it like Red Mages, or in the M:tG sense, Timmy Powergamers, it will not make sense. Because you have to have the BEST stats, the BEST gear and BE the BEST.<br />
<br />
A billion expansions later, the idea of balance has been eroded in everquest.<br />
<br />
The idea of tradeoffs for added power has been eroded.<br />
<br />
The idea of hybrids having their BENEFIT being from the fact that they had both fighting AND the magic ... rather than having to have their own set of superpowers ... has been eroded.<br />
<br />
The game, I hate to say it, got away from the &quot;vision.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;BUT, even if I accepted this idea, you would still be wrong. There exist 3 types of classes in everquest: Tanks, Dps, Utility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not be argumentative, BUT ... I wouldn't proclaim someone wrong and then go make a completely wrong statement to follow.<br />
<br />
There exist more types of classes in EQ than tanks, DPS and utility.<br />
<br />
There exists:<br />
<br />
1- Tanks, or meat shields.<br />
<br />
2- Damage dealers.<br />
<br />
3- Healers (healing is NOT utiliity, at least not the way I look at it. It's a role all by itself).<br />
<br />
4- Crowd Control.<br />
<br />
5- Buffs/Utility<br />
<br />
&quot;Each class is given a way to fill that role.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem ... or rather the UNBALANCE ... is that some classes fill more than one role, and fill them BETTER than the competitors.<br />
<br />
Shamans, because their &quot;slow&quot; spell, and their buffs are so powerful are LESS ADEQUATE healers. That's the balance. The check to the other amazing role shamans fill.<br />
<br />
Paladins however, have no check. They tank as good as a warrior. They have utility far better than they ever had it previously.<br />
<br />
There is no tradeoff.<br />
<br />
They are no longer, by the very definition of a HYBRID, a HYBRID.<br />
<br />
They are their own super-powered entity.<br />
<br />
And warriors are a disenfranchised class, left with practically no role to fill, since their one, NARROW role was not only encroached, but surpassed.<br />
<br />
Why get X, when X+1 is available?</div></div><hr />

Hrm ... mebbe I'm the only one, but I kinda figgered that, as a dual wielding, chain wearing class that did good DPS and had some scouting abilites, that rangers were the hybrid of the druid and the ranger classes.  And a great example of a balanced hybrid class, with significant abilites that do not outstrip the abilities of either of the parent classes.  Whether the SOE class descriptions bear me out or not, these lines caught my eye when I checked:<br />
<br />
[<br />
*Rangers are primarily a melee class, able to wear chain armor and wield many kinds of weapons.*<br />
*Rogues are primarily a melee class, able to wear chain armor and use piercing, slashing and some blunt weapons.*<br />
]<br />
<br />
Obviously not conclusive, and only slightly indicitave.  But there it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
At any rate, rangers are a poor example of hybrids &gt; parent class, as a ranger is not better than a druid at being a druid, better at being a rogue than a rogue, and they are especially not better at being a warrior than a warrior.  Excellent hybrid class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I can see where you'd think that Dogg. Especially considering how good ranger DPS can get these days.<br />
<br />
But I'll give my perspective on it:<br />
<br />
Rangers are considered a warrior/druid hybrid moreso than a rogue/druid hybrid for a couple of reasons.<br />
<br />
1- They were described as warrior/druid hybrids in the old pen and paper RPGs where EQ sprang up from (D&amp;D specifically, where most of the classes in EQ and even the concept of classes and hit points and armor class all come from).<br />
<br />
2- The &quot;vision&quot; of a ranger is of them having swords, or staves, not really piercers like rogues. Swords and staves are more warrior like.<br />
<br />
3- From a technical standpoint in the game itself, rangers have kick. Which comes from the &quot;parent&quot; class of warrior. <br />
<br />
4- From another technical standpoint, rangers have &quot;taunt&quot; also a warrior trait that rogues do not have.<br />
<br />
5- Going back to those old pen and paper games, rogues were a leather class (and monks were a cloth class). But rangers always were a chain wearing (or more to the point, non-plate mail wearing) class. This is gotten away from in EQ, where the cloth class (monk) became leather, and the leather class (rogue) became chain. But Rangers still stick with their chain.<br />
<br />
Anyways, those are just some of the little bits of evidence as to why I always thought Rangers were warrior/druid hybrids.<br />
<br />
The taunt and kick thing being the strongest EQ evidence.<br />
<br />
The other stuff just being rooted in the lore of fantasy games like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Alright, I was unclear and for that I apologize.  First, I firmly believe that rangers are a druid/warrior combination, taunt/kick.  Their &quot;scouting&quot; abilities are druidish, not roguish.<br />
<br />
Next, I was trying to make a different point then the one you picked up.  Rangers are inferior tanks then warriors: True (unless you consider agro).  Rangers are worse casters then druids: True...maybe, unless you count the fact that they have 3 buffs that are loved while druids have one,situationally.<br />
<br />
My real point was this, and again I apologize for being unclear:  If what warriors suggest, that &quot;hybrids&quot; should be categorically inferior to their &quot;parent&quot; classes in EVERY way, a ranger should not be able to out damage a warrior or a druid.  While damage may not be part of a warrior or druids main job, it is still an area they are capable in and,therefore, rangers should be worse then them because &quot;parent&quot; always&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;hybrid&quot;.  The fact that you either ignored that or didn't pick up on it simply proves that you think its ridiculous that rangers should be like that.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion, the way to go about things is to never let any class be the best at everything to do with their &quot;job&quot;.  Different types of damage, different parts of tanking (Ie, absorbing damage and creating agro), different types of healing, etc.  A class can only be the best at one thing and still claim to be balanced.  This means that warriors can never be the best at absorbing damage, creating agro, and doing damage at the same time.  This is true of every other class.  A class can pick one and go with it.  Now, should all classes filling the same job share a roughly even parity when you look at the main parts of their job?  I would say yes, some of you no.  That means, the closer the damage absorption between the three tank classes is, the closer their ability to draw agro is.  The farther apart theya re in one, the farther apart they are in the other.  You can in fairness, ask for and get one of those direction.  Saying warriors must be better then knights at absorbing damage and at creating agro is not balance.  Saying that because knight damage absorption is so close to warriors, warriors agro should be close to knight's is.  Or the reverse.  I simply feel that, for example in an xp group, that seeing a warrior, paladin and shadowknight all lfg..you should have equal incentive to choose any of them.  Not that you ALWAYS pick the warrior or ALWAYS pick the knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I simply feel that, for example in an xp group, that seeing a warrior, paladin and shadowknight all lfg..you should have equal incentive to choose any of them. Not that you ALWAYS pick the warrior or ALWAYS pick the knight.<br />
<br />
Trilith, the question is how to accomplish that.  At the moment, there's a clear imbalance, and paladins are overpowered in a large number of respects.<br />
<br />
While I think that most people appreciate these facts, let me list the ways in which paladin is a broken class.<br />
<br />
* Tied for best taunt tank class in the game.<br />
* Within 500hp of an equally-equipped warrior - their parent class.<br />
* Considering the effect of stuns, better at damage mitigation than an equally-equipped warrior.<br />
* The only taunt tank which is also a viable group main healer.<br />
* Able to buff more HP than any other class in the game, including their parent class.<br />
<br />
Right now, in the current expansion, a paladin can do the jobs of both of her parent classes.  We know all too well how much better paladins are at tanking, up to and including end-game encounters; what most warriors don't appreciate is how powerful pally healing is.<br />
<br />
I can produce logs of me playing my cleric in LDoN and showing that in a group where the only other healer was a paladin, I never cast a heal.  Not once.<br />
<br />
Now personally, I've lost patience with the Paladin community.  I've sufficient reason to believe that it's a community which calls for nerfs on other classes and then completely declines to accept responsibility for those nerfs when they actually happen.<br />
<br />
Paladins need nerfing back to a state where a warrior is a situationally preferable tank, and a cleric is a clear benefit to the group - and that means nerfs in the following areas:<br />
<br />
* Aggro holding<br />
* Damage mitigation<br />
* Pre-level 60 pulling<br />
* HP buffing, particularly self hp buffs<br />
* Healing<br />
<br />
The aggro-holding and damage mitigation nerfs have to come from stuns, and there need to be two of them:  First, the high-level stuns need the kind of mana cost associated with them so that while a paladin can still stun a high level monster to interrupt it casting, they can't be relied on as an aggro-retention device over periods of more than a few minutes, and they can't be used to make a paladin mitigate damage better than a warrior over a similar period.  Second, stuns which never have any chance of affecting the monster in question owing to level should produce negligible aggro.<br />
<br />
The pacify line should be removed from Paladins in its entirety.  It's unreasonable for a primary tanking and secondary healing class to be an efficient puller as well, such things make a mockery of class balance.<br />
<br />
Paladin HP buffs are unreasonable.  They should have a self-only buff, in common with other hybrids, but the HP component of AotC is too high and is unbalancing.  Drop AotC's HP component significantly.<br />
<br />
The combination of Hero, Marzin, and BSS adds up to more HP than a cleric can buff, and that's broken too.  Remove the symbol lines from paladins completely.<br />
<br />
That leaves paladin healing, which is far too efficient.  Implement a blanket healing penalty of 25% on all paladin spells.<br />
<br />
Hey presto, you have a balanced paladin class rather than a dominant one.<br />
<br />
All this class balancing gets a lot easier once you allow yourself to call for nerfs - and let's face facts, if any community has brought nerf calls on itself, it's paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Eh, every single community has at one time or another deserved nerfing.  <br />
<br />
I am skeptical about your claim that knights can truly be a mainhealer for a group.  Granted, ldon normal is said to be painfully easy...so you could well be back in a luclin like era where healing isn't as important-that is a seperate issue though.  Look at paladin heals, mana inefficient (where you got that they were efficient is beyond me....it just doesn't pan out mathematically) and pretty expensive to cast for a normal paladin.  Our group heals are the shining star really and they are incredibly mana intensive.  This is not to suggest that they are bad heals, on the contrary they are very nice, but hardly efficient...and hardly the stuff of making a true main healer.  <br />
<br />
Aura of the crusader is not a balanced spell, it never should have been implemented..so I'll give your little rant credit there.  However, paladins buffing for more then a cleric...  At best you could make the claim that they &quot;outbuff&quot; a cleric by what?  30-50hp?  If you ignore the fact that Brells stacks with cleric buffs and our other hp buffs do not.  But, since I have already said I would not be against having all paladin buffs (except brells, though even that I could see going) I'll let the slight oddity of what your saying go.<br />
<br />
Now, are you honestly suggesting all of those nerfs at once?  Remove our agro and one of the ways we make up for our lack of mitigation compared to a warrior, break our healing, and break our buffing?  I've yet to hear anyone else seriously say that paladins encroach too much on cleric territory with our heals, though they do bring up that they are good enough to be taken into consideration when balancing the class.  The heals are horrifically mana inefficient while still working with (relatively) small numbers.  Again, they work wonderfully to patch heal yourself while waiting for regular heals... or I suppose in situations where the group so overpowers an area that healing is not really necessary at all, you could make the case that they are mainhealer appropriate.  <br />
<br />
My personal feelings are that paladin spells should be directed towards making up for what they lack in regards to tanking when compared to a warrior.  So, personally, I have little problem with the heals being self only (that would, hopefully, stop this complaint of yours....), though, it would be a pain in the ass.  Losing the buffs is not even that big a deal, because its a paper bonus anyway.  Its overwritten by better spells, so it doesn't come up that often, aside from Brells.  I'm unsure of how your server is, but on mine there is always someone in PoK selling Virtue, Focus, and Kei...regardless of who the healer is a tank will almost always have virtue..so the importance of a paladin having aego is not that noticable.  Its still nice mind you.;)  Understand that while defensive may not have real world (read:xp group) value, neither do many of the paladin spells.  Seriously though, paladin heals efficient, never in my life did I think that would be a complaint.  I suggest going to Lucy and looking at them.<br />
<br />
Edit: Almost forgot- the bit about paladins not deserving pacify is true enough.<br />
<br />
And, you realize you just said that they should nerf knight agro, buffs, heals, and mitigation... if all that is done, how will warriors only be *situtationally* preferred?  Unless you meant every situation.  The same argument used against paladins can be used for them:  You can be good at agro or mitigation, not both.  Obviously, all three tank classes need to meet a certain minimum for both, but taking both aspects from the knights is too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Trilith, paladin heals are &quot;mana efficient&quot; when a paladin can be the sole healer in a group without causing downtime.<br />
<br />
You see, once you can be the sole healer in your group and have zero downtime associated with medding, you are as good a healer as a cleric.  It doesn't matter that the cleric can cast Word of Redemption and theoretically get over 50hp per point of mana spent, because the group isn't taking enough damage - when your group is fully healed and you can still chain-pull, you don't need any more healing.<br />
<br />
I'm telling you that not just once, but on many occasions, my cleric hasn't cast a heal in a LDoN group because the group's paladin's healing was sufficient to do the job.  If you don't believe that, then I can only suggest that you go and try it.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm calling for nerfs to paladin aggro, buffs, heals, and mitigation.  All of these things.<br />
<br />
The aggro should be reduced to a level where a paladin can generate significantly more taunt than a warrior - but not all the time.  Hence, increasing the mana cost of stuns.<br />
<br />
The buffs should be reduced to a level where clerics buff significantly more hp than paladins, and where paladin self-buffs don't place them near warrior hp.<br />
<br />
The mitigation should be reduced to a level where a paladin who is stunning with sustainable frequency doesn't mitigate any better than a warrior who isn't stunning.<br />
<br />
The heals should be reduced to a level where paladin healing is a useful backup to a group but does not take over the healer position in a group.  Further, heals should cost paladins sufficient mana that they can't both heal and use stuns to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
The group roles for a pally should be:-<br />
<br />
* Group main tank.  Tradeoff:  less hp -v- able to hold aggro effectively in short bursts using stuns.<br />
* Group minor damage dealer/backup tank/backup healer (swiss army knife).  Tradeoff:  mana cost of healing precludes using stuns to hold aggro at the same time.<br />
<br />
The tradeoffs are what's missing, and therefore nerfs to all the aspects I've mentioned are necessary.</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU!<br />
<br />
On a side note.  When the Nerf bat swings it usually hits more then one class.  This isn't the case at all times but most of the time it is.  I can not for the life of me understand why anyone wants another persons char nerfed.  I've never wished nerfing on anyone that plays any class.  To me to actually wish for nerfing of any class is just childish.  Alot of you like to say knights just don't understand.  Understand what?  If we all called for wariror nerfing you'd be flipping out to.  Paladin's themselves have been hit with the nerf bat more then anyone else in the game.  <br />
<br />
Warriors will always be a chosen tank.  I'm a pally and if I can grab a warrior to be in the group I'm quite happy.  I even help the warrior when/if he looses aggro by throwing a stun at the mob and waiting a bit before engaging again.  <br />
<br />
What I see mainly on this board, not from all of you, is that you don't really want class balance.  You want the two other tank classes to go back to our days where we have LFG up for 3 hours before we decide to go to our soloing alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, when sane, non-drunk and non-pissed off. You'll find that 99.99% of the warrior population want good clean fair balance.<br />

Either knights realise that there is really a problem (some have already, not sure how many), and either support or not care. (Ya, really... knights are not forced to care about this situation you know...)<br />

What you have there is a problem of itemization and mana regen that effects all classes in the game.  Clerics are less desired because anyone that can cast a heal can be main healer for a group, even a ranger can do it in normal LDON adventures with enough gear/AA/buffs thrown on the group.  I do not in any way advocate knight specific nerfs because quite frankly knights are not overpowered compared to other classes.  I do advocate some pretty severe changes in the basic way that EQ works which would bring down the power of all casting classes though.<br />
<br />
Since most likely sony will not nerf spell casting as a whole the only real solution is to buff up monks, rogues and warriors in a major way.  It might not be whats best for the game but its the only realistic fix I see them actually implementing.</div></div><hr />

    I see a warrior as being a person who is drawn to combat because there is that unheard natural call to it.You have a gift for facing death face to face and if anything there seems to be a need to do so for that is what makes a warrior tick.You reconize fellow warriors at a glance for the bond that is build by those who have faced death and walked away is as hard and fast as the Steel contained within the blade at your side. Do Warriors in game terms need/deserve improvements to their Class? Your Damn right they Do!!! I think the warrior should be the parimount Melee class without question for that is WHAT they are all about its what makes them tick as I said above.<br />

   Now Paladins  what should happen to them what are they? Well in my humble oppinion they are this&gt; A Paladin is a warrior but in a much different direction. He/she also understands the call of the warrior but its not what calls to them for they hear but one thing within the hearts and that is the call of their Diety! Its a call that is as much a part of them as say the the Sword is to a warrior and his need to face Death again and again.This call from our Diety is where we draw our strength from.( I say we because I am a Paladin and have never played a warrior past level 11 because the class did not fit me, I think we all have a class we best identify with and in my case Paladin was it.) I Roleplay in small amounts and have always loved being a Paladin even when I was not wanted and let me say that was a great deal in the long past. I love it when a Warrior Roleplays as well and have several Warrior friends I would follow into the 9 Hells for they have my Respect as I have earned theirs. I say lets get warriors back to being what they are all about and offer Paladins new melee changes in line with what Rangers and Shadowknights Bards etc will get that are Paladin focused.Nerf no thats not an answer , fix the Problems with warriors and give them some new skills that bring the fun back to their class. In the end I doubt few will agree with me but thats ok , I Love being a Paladin and in the end will play as one no matter what SOE does for I Love logging in and Being Mandilloran the Paladin! I am not trying to analysis classes here in anyway and am only looking at Warriors and Paladins for lets face it the issue that seems to be of great focus on this board is that. I am one Paladin that repects and wants the Warrior class to be better so please read my post from that stand point.<br />

Where do Shadowknights, Monks, Rogues, and most importantly, BESERKERS fit into your analyses?</div></div><hr />
