<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I won't be doing a post when I am half asleep.  I used figures from a 3 hour and 20 min log but only used 1 hour for the breakdown.  LOL ok guess who caught it?<br />
<br />
Thanks Haass and Firth!  Thanks for catching that the proc rates were too high.<br />
<br />
Sorry again guys for the mis-information posted the first time.<br />
<br />
I went back and here are the correct figures based on a 3 hour and 20 min battle log.<br />
<br />
This is the new post with all updated material now.<br />
<br />
ferocity maxed (double attack)<br />
combat fury maxed (critical hits)<br />
flurry maxed (flurries)<br />
fury of the ages maxed (critical hits)<br />
raging flurry x 2 trainings (flurries)<br />
Ingenuity maxed (critical spell procs)<br />
<br />
Did a EQ log test over several hours but I broke it into an average of 3  hours and 20 min for the example below and these were the results using SoD (aug with 75 poison proc) and BoC (aug with 75 frost proc) and speed Vallons Quickening / Delay on weapons was 15.<br />
<br />
Total Damage for 3 hours 20 min 100%: 720000<br />
<br />
BREAKOUT ON DAMAGE AND AA SKILLS PERCENTAGE:<br />
573324 Direct Regular Melee Damage SoD - 280639 / BoC - 231357 and normal critical hits (61328) from SoD and BoC<br />
79.6% of Total Damage 720K<br />
<br />
*****30960 Damage from AA Critical Hits (1.69 per minute)<br />
4.3% of Total Damage 720K*****<br />
<br />
8760 Damage from Critical Blasts AA Ingenuity (1 per every 5 minutes)<br />
1.2% of Total Damage 720K<br />
<br />
The following was borrowed from another post by Wandor. Second set of numbers is actual procs I had.<br />
For Main hand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = 1.5 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 2 proc/min / 2 proc per min<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min / 1.17 proc per min<br />
<br />
Mainhand: SoD<br />
46396 Damage from Anarchy Proc (1 per minute) 6.44% of Total Damage 720K<br />
14400 Damage from Poison Proc (1 per minute) 2.00% of Total Damage 720K<br />
<br />
60796 (100%) Normal Damage from Mainhand Proc Damage<br />
8.44% of Total Damage 720K<br />
<br />
Secondary: BoC<br />
8250 Damage from Frost Proc (.56 per minute)  .01% of Total Damage 720K<br />
124 Hate Procs from BoC (.61 per minute)<br />
<br />
7508 (100%) Normal Damage from offhand proc damage<br />
.01% of Total Damage Done 720K<br />
<br />
So far is (5.5%) of Total Damage comes from AA skills listed at top of post.<br />
<br />
Another (5.28%) 38000 Damage from 217 Flurry's with AA flurry skills above (1.064 per minute) (With Raging Flurry Maxed out prolly be 8.5%)<br />
<br />
All that above = 8.24 additional DPS.<br />
But will cost you 72 AA points.<br />
<br />
So in total not including Ambidexerity (which I didn't think was worth training in for what it actually did unless they have changed it) A Warrior could gain around an additional 14% more in total damage if maxed in all the AA skills listed above.<br />
<br />
You need all of these skills combined and not just one or 2 to reach the above results (that is for using these 2 weapons).<br />
<br />
One last note: various stats and speed will affect the outcome in total damage but I believe the percentage of 14% of Total Damage will remain the same.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and thanks for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />

one ? if you wouldn't mind checking, did any of your flurries add 2 attacks or it it still just giving 1?<br />

only if you want to check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL..just checked lost vallons quickening about 1/2 the time.  Never use a bot enchanter in group.  Bahh so prolly with that spell on the other 1/2 of time would have been more dps like around 85 or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a problem.  I did some checking and yes Ferocity (adds 2 attacks), flurry and raging flurry happened at same time on a lot of the flurries.<br />
<br />
And yes at times I had multiple flurries in a row.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of date and time on flurries right in a row.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm slightly confused as to why you even mentioned Ferocity. It increases your already significant chance to double attack. Of course that leads to a chance to triple attack and to flurry but unless you compared a parse pre- and post-ferocity you have no way of knowing what impact it had on your dps. With your low delay it is also near impossible to tell if you had one or two bonus attacks from Flurry going off on each occasion. <br />
<br />
Also if the mob attacked you and you ripsoted on the same timestamp as your own attack you will confuse your data.<br />
<br />
Also since you didn't parse pre-Critical Hit AA's you have no way to remove the baseline dps of crits from your parsed crits.<br />
<br />
Further more, Flurry will increase dps for 2h-ed users by a greater amount that for dual wielding.<br />
<br />
Lastly, since you were in LDoN adventures your mob you were hitting varied in level and probably in AC and stat caps (riposte/block etc). And you admit your buffs changed through the parse - therefore your stats changed too (SoV adds Agi/dex).<br />
<br />
I appreciate what you are trying to show but this data is not a very clean set. You need to parse both pre and post certain AA's for any data to be reliably extracted and you need to parse with consistent buffs against one mob or a series of identical mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ROFLMAO<br />
<br />
Okay I have wasted enough time on this now.<br />
<br />
1.  That was the general idea.  There is NO WAY to break out what type of flurries they were.  NO ONE has a perfect FORMULA FOR WORKING OUT ANY OF THIS.  We WHO do try don't mind suggestions<br />
<br />
2.  I stand by my original statement that max training in all of the listed AA I mentioned before will produce 14% more total damage than what you have now.  I don't care what mobs you are fighting.  If ya don't like that answer then please prove me wrong.<br />
<br />
Better yet those of you who want to critique get off your butts and get some more offensive AA's and parse before and after AA and show us how its supposed to be done.<br />
<br />
I only hope that at least some of the warriors out there learned something and that is it isn't 1 offensive AA skill but a series of various ones that will give you the extra damage.  Same thing with Defensive AA skills.<br />
<br />
Lastly sorry Mr. Moderator for going off the deep end for a short time.<br />
<br />
Smile Cough Smile</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not how it works here tho, you have to prove yourself right, otherwise it's just another opinion.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I did parse ferocity.  3-4% DPS increase from that would be generous.  It's not a huge difference at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am SURE of the 14% and it takes the following AA skills to get that much more offensive damage.<br />
<br />
ferocity maxed (double attack)<br />
combat fury maxed (critical hits)<br />
flurry maxed (flurries)<br />
fury of the ages maxed (critical hits)<br />
raging flurry maxed (flurries)<br />
Ingenuity maxed (critical spell procs)<br />
<br />
But you will have to train 72 AA points to max out the above AA skills to get that 14%.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately I never got into it until after I already had all the offensive AA's so I am relying on people supplying them to me and trying to work out exactly which aa's provide what benefits (bearing in mind many of them are compound benefits) is like trying to solve 100 simultaneous equations, worse when you never quite now the veracity of each parse you receive and people's stats vary.<br />
<br />
So my model lies languishing in idle mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
For Main hand weapons:<br />
305 DEX = 2 proc/min / 2 proc per min <br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min / 1.17 proc per min<br />
<br />
Mainhand: SoD<br />
46396 Damage from Anarchy Proc (1 per minute) 6.44% of Total Damage 720K<br />
14400 Damage from Poison Proc (1 per minute/[B]) 2.00% of Total Damage 720K<br />
<br />
Secondary: BoC<br />
8250 Damage from Frost Proc ([B].56 per minute) .01% of Total Damage 720K<br />
124 Hate Procs from BoC (.61 per minute)<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Is the 2 procs per minute based on an item without an aug?  Because it looks to me that adding an augment doesn't give you more procs, but divides your procs up.  I hope I'm misinterpreting these figures.<br />
<br />
I read that &quot;2 procs per minute&quot; was a max figure...ie, max dex, max weapon skills, etc.  Does that also mean that one has put a proc aug on their weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay yes both weapons had aug's added to them.  Both weapons all ready have a proc so possibilities of 2 procs per weapon going off alternating between the two procs.<br />
<br />
I mainly broke them out to show total percentage of total damge from just procs and the aug proc per weapon.<br />
<br />
This is part of another post from above. Second set of numbers is actual procs I had.<br />
For Main hand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = 1.5 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 2 proc/min / (Second set of numbers 2 proc per min)<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min / (Second set of numbers 1.17 proc per min)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, the thing that bugs me is, I was told that proc is 2/min main hand when dual wielding, in general.  Was that with augmented weapons, or just regular procs?<br />
<br />
Because I had heard elsewhere that your procrate goes up if you put anger3 on a bow...but if that's the case, shouldnt there be 4 procs/min main hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay now I see what ya is asking about.<br />
<br />
Also for my post I did the opposite and used as I stated SoD in mainhand and BoC in offhand.<br />
<br />
Okay here is a post from Wandor I used part of in my post.<br />
<br />
For Main hand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = 1.5 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 2 proc/min<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
<br />
This applies for proc augments, spell procs, as well as innate procs. Augmented and spell procs are actually very slightly lower due to a weapon only being able to proc once per swing and innate procs getting the first opportunity to proc. Proc rates DO stack, a weapon with 2 procs will proc at 2x the rate associated with your DEX.<br />
<br />
The only weapons that have been show to have different proc rates are BBoE, BF, and DBotW, all of which have a substantially higher proc rate. There are also some caster weapons - cleric hammers, Greatstaff of Power, etc. that also have higher proc rates, but those are useless to a warrior.<br />
<br />
** All means every WARRIOR USABLE weapon you can think of. All of them. Even your snare whip, fleshgrinder, primal, frostbringer, wavecrasher, and uber proc weapon_03. All of them. If you find one that is NOT 2 proc/min then please post a parse because those weapons are rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is purely anectdotal but i believe maxing out all the combat aas will net more than a 20 dps gain. i never did pre and post parses, but i parse myself against warriors with maxed out abilities quite a lot. for example earth b against the trash mobs,<br />
warrior with all offensive aas,  standard exp group buffs hasted was doing about 120+ dps wielding a BoW.<br />
<br />
For myself i had at the time CF3, PB1, Flurry 1 and TM 1 and I was doing about just under 100 dps wielding SeWs from the rear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to add a little parsing data of my own about proc rates of a innate proc and an augmented proc:<br />
<br />
Test Description: Katta banker, 278 dex, focus only, 41% haste, from behind, SEWS + Anger 3 aug.<br />
Test Durration: 70m 31s<br />
Damage given: 381099<br />
DPS: 90.09<br />
Attack Delay: 22<br />
Max hit: 462<br />
Avg hit: 153.36<br />
Min hit: 41<br />
<br />
Accuracy: 70.44%<br />
# hits 2485<br />
# misses 1043<br />
<br />
# of &quot;A dark shimmer of runes surrounds you.&quot; : 150<br />
# of &quot;Heracus Helsin's face contorts with rage.&quot; : 131<br />
RUNE = 150 / 70.51 = 2.12735 procs per minute<br />
RAGE = 131 / 70.51 = 1.85783 procs per minute<br />
<br />
So, add those 2 together and I proc about 3.98518 per min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on the original poster's numbers, his data shows that an aug'd weapon in primary will proc twice per minute, if the weapon itself has a proc of its own. This is wrong. Almost all warrior weapons, when used in primary, proc twice per minute on average. Adding an augment to the weapon will NOT keep overall procrate the same. Your weapon proc will still go off twice per minute, and the augment proc will also go off, although I've seen different logs claiming different proc rates for the same augments. I'd say anywhere from 1-2 procs per minute on an augment is the most likely. Therefore, aug'ing a weapon with a proc of its own should increase total procs per minute to 3 or 4 or thereabouts.<br />
<br />
Also, go to http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=5570 for a thread on proc rates. The link in the first post is to a database where you can search for the proc rates for every warrior weapon. Some surprises to be found include GSot4W and Obsidian Scimitar of War, both of which proc at a higher rate than the 2/min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay then if all of this is true then I have to go back and check new version of Yalp and see where I am off.<br />
<br />
There have been some good points made here.<br />
<br />
Will run a brand new shorter log for about an hour and see what transpires.<br />
<br />
But personally hehe I went ahead and changed over to a TSBS and just using incite at the right times held aggro within a group not to mention a higher dps using 2h compared to 1h weapons.<br />
<br />
Strange..hmm also did a parse for the TSBS and came up with 2.11 average proc per minute on a frost aug I put on there for testing purposes.</div></div><hr />
