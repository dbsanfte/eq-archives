<br />
I'm a new poster to this forum, so I hope this is in the right spot. If not, set me straight.<br />
<br />
I'm currently level 58 (50% thru) and have no AAs. I was going to work for 60 before beginning to toss exp into alternate advancement and was wondering if you guys would suggest that or not.  I'm currently leveling in PoV (and at 58, those guys hurt like hell) and today I set AA to 100% to see how much I could snag off a single kill.  Was surprised to get a whole 2% and was wondering if I should take advantage of this while these guys are still very very red. <br />
<br />
Should I snag some AAs now or just wait a few levels (60ish) to start the AA exp, and what % would you guys suggest me setting aside for AA? Thanks in advance.<br />

Levels &gt; AA's is the general thought on these boards. but run 3 is a must.</div></div><hr />

Gather your friends and do PoJ trials (for the free AA).<br />
<br />
Exp in the PoS desert and gather the medallions you need for the PoTactics alternative flagging quest.  This gives you a 2nd free AA.<br />
<br />
Lead a BoT mini raid and flag yourself for the zone.  3rd free AA.  Back in the day, I tanked the minis with velious gear and 4 clerics, I maybe had 6k hp.  Can be done now with 1-2 clerics on me, adjust your numbers as needed.<br />
<br />
Also, if you can get in on anymore flagging raids (Grummus, TT, etc) those are also free AA's.<br />
<br />
If you're really wanting AA's, stop at 60 where you can go solo/duo in Velks for decent AA xp when you can't get a group.<br />
<br />
If you have friends who are compatible with you, hit up PoTactics pit and crank out the XP.  2% per AA is not a lot in PoV, you'll get that when you're 60 too.  In the Tactics pit you can get about 3% per kill.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frawdo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Suggested Upgrades:<br />
<br />
Ear1: Bloodmetal Earring<br />
Vambraces: Anything else<br />
Gauntlets: Try and find an MQ of the velious armor, Skyshrine is nice.<br />
Bracer2: Get another cultural bracer<br />
Shoulders: Mantle of Distraction<br />
Back: Cloak of Greater Pernicity or similar<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, all those items should be fairly accessible at level 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This actually depends on a couple things. If you have a regular group that you are with all the time. If you do and they are going to stay at 60 for awhile and AA, then you may want to also. If you do not have the comfort of a constant group, you may want to go straight to 65-70 then AA. I know on my server, if you do not have at least the Veteran tag over your head, you will be hard pressed to get a decent group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xiphos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did a straight grind thru 58 and 59 (just did 59 in one sitting - PoV). I'm now level 60, and weeks ahead of my normal group. I'm planning on replacing some of the stuff suggested (thanks for that) and maybe snagging a few AAs while I wait for my crew to catch up. Thanks for all the info guys. You're a big help as always.<br />

The prices of many of those items have plummeted after the release of OoW.  The earrings are now going for less than 10k, you can find some damn nice armguards of repentance for relatively cheap, less than 20k on drinal, and there are a couple pairs of nice gaunts that drop in OoW zones that are going for nice prices in the Bazaar.  <br />
<br />
I have found shoulders to be one of the hardest slots to fill for warriors.  You could always do the Strength of the Elements quest but the AC on them is bleh.  I prefer Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates but they're spendy if you can even find them for sale in the bazaar.  As for your back, I just bought a new Tainted Clock of Treachery for 20k.  They're going for 40k now, but maybe the initial flood of them dropped the price.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the levels..... it's a really sticky situation.  It's easy to say that levels are better than AA's, because they are.  But If you are anything other than a cleric, trying to get a group past 65+ without a title is gonna be a bitch.  Personally I stopped a bit at 62 and ground out 18 AA's just so I could get a veteran title.  It was really easy because I was getting 1-2 AA's per night in PoV.  After that it was never too hard, because once they see you have some defensive AA's under your belt and you've been around a bit more, groups will be more willing to give you a shot.  Good luck with your decision...... being a new warrior is never easy.</div></div><hr />
