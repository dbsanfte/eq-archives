All honesty though, I have a big stamina problem to try to correct.  How so? We have been doing sewer trials,tipt/vxed.  Without a shaman in the group always presents a problem. Monks click the stamina buff does not really get the job done.<br />
<br />
Any advice to get the stamina along with the hp/ac up?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

the only thing that i'm wearig that is out of your reach is the scalecracker because of how rare it is.  but that would give you an idea of what can help you.  looking at your gear, i can say that i'm not wearing anything that cant be bought or obtained by you and your friends/guild.</div></div><hr />

i think the doze comment was directed towards me:D<br />
<br />
but yes thats kinda where i was going with this.   doze would be a good direction for him to go towards if he doesnt want to spend dkp's and can gather 1 group of friends on a regular basis.  doze isnt farmed quite as much as it used to be so you can catch up on some of his lewtz.  factions are easily fixed by pharming PoZ's in the arena.  anyone who tanks in tipt/vxed would laugh at doze so the issue is if he wants to spend the time pharming</div></div><hr />
