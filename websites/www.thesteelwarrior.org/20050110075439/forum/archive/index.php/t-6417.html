<br />
How much effect does +dodge have on actually avoiding a hit? ie, in practice, would a 10% dodge aug net you 1% avoidance?  5%? Would it even be statistically noticeable?  <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard of parses showing the 8 percent dodge resulting in between 1 and 2 percent more avoided swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrkk</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a skill modifier isn't it? 10% more skill in Dodge...nothing to get excited about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might be horribly broken in that it doesn't work. The parses posted on this board showed an improvement so small that it could have easily been attributed to the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont bother with going for Dodge or Riposte as a factor in deciding equipment, hey if a peice has it then it wont hurt but its insigicent enough that it shouldnt play a factor in gear choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're both talking about +dodge, not +dodge%, correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm talking about the Mods from Drape of Agile, Speed BP, Helmet of Shadow Xegony Shoulder/Back thing etc. (Items are nice or decent by themselfs but I wouldnt factor the modifier in on them in equipment choice<br />
<br />
Is there +dodge equipment? ( I Know there is +Avoidance (Which is definately imo worth going for) but thats not called +Dodge..<br />
<br />
Or am I missing some modifier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Niafix must be referring to the &quot;Improved Dodge I&quot; neck from Ferubi. Seeing how SoE managed to initially screw up the Cleave I bracer, it wouldnt surprise me if they managed to botch up the Improved Dodge neck too. <br />
<br />
But since that one is not so common it will take a while before word reaches SoE about it, IF it indeed is overpowered too.<br />
<br />
As for the old &quot;Skill mod: Dodge x%&quot; items, I have never seen any good parses. But if you think about it logically it should at best be a very minor benefit. You dodge what, 2-4% of incoming stuff? An 8% improvement to that would hardly be noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya,<br />
<br />
Yeah, I was referring to the +dodge% augs.  I figured, heck, for a measily 300 or 500 points, if it can add 1 or 2% hit reduction, it's worth it...  but, the general feeling is that it doesn't do didly as, you dodge so rarely, that an extra 8% of 2-5% is practically zero.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The next time you tank a boss mob for a considerable amount of time, parse it, as that'll give you a good idea of a Warrior's Riposte/Parry/Dodge rates.  The bulk of a Warrior's active defenses comes through Ripostes, followed by Parry, then Dodge, so something like a +3% Riposte modifier will probably do you much more good than a +3% Dodge modifier.  In reality though, they all suck, but when stacked, like having all three modifiers present in your gear outfit, I hear they can make a small, but still sizeable difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could be way off here, but I heard that the amount of riposte/dodge/parry is modified by Race -- ie, a troll is going to dodge/riposte less than a half elf or wood elf.<br />
<br />
I never parsed it, but it seemed true, when a Half Elf tank friend of mine said he could practically guarentee himself 2-3 ripostes on a normal PoEarth exp mob fight, and I was finding myself lucky to riposte once each fight.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, your race would also play a role in the importance of dodge/riposte modifiers.  Personally, I haven't bothered spending points on Double Riposte yet because my riposte rate seems so low as a troll (i maxed all my other important offensive AAs, and have been focusing on GoD now)<br />
<br />
Is it just the RNG messing with me, or is this pretty much an accepted view?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only racial advantages in the game are no frontal stuns for ogres, regen for trolls and iksar, and better corner tanking for small races. <br />
<br />
I've never heard of race playing a factor in your riposte/parry/dodge skills because that's what they are: skills. A half elf and a troll with the same skill in riposte will both riposte just as often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up the Improved Dodge I neck and played with it for a bit. Was not a noticable improvement from eyeballing dodge rate per fight, though I still haven't had time to parse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed the improved dodge 1 neck off rondo awhile back and it was a .5% increase in dodges, could have been difference in mobs fought or statistical variance even, the parses were over 30 hours each on a wide variety of mobs.</div></div><hr />

For exaple if you have 15% ripoest mod off Bloodfrenzy and 3% ripoest mod off Helmet of shadown that would only come down to 15% mod not 18%.</div></div><hr />
