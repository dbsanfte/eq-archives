<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im currently working on my Guk Froggie Faction and the only piece left for the Crown of Deceit is the Reet Crown.  What kinda group would I need to do this?  Dont want to bother my guild for such a small raid and would like to do it with only a few people.<br />
<br />
Does the Reet Crown drop off the Jugs more or the Reet Frogs?  Any Help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You won't need more than 1 group. You'll need a good MT(60+ish), a FD puller that knows what he's doing, good 60ish chanty and cleric, an evacer/porter, and 1 more. The most important thing is to have a good FD puller and chanty, there is lots of mobs. Once you get out of the shroom tunnels, set up camp in the big room past the small gate/bridge type thing where 3 or so juggs sit. Try to figure out how often they pop there so you know when to hold pulls. To get into the room with juggs and reets, click the fire pot. When the FD puller is inside doing his work, he should intruct you when to open the door(can't be opened from inside)<br />
The crown only drops off reet frogs, and it's pretty rare, so...be prepared to stay down there for a long time. I'm not saying you'll get it in 1 day of camping though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not rare got 2 off reets in about an hour<br />
<br />
55 and below it would be tough depens on the gear and experience with zone of whoever leading/pulling ofcourse<br />
If you dont have anyone who been to juggs before I wouldnt recomend it.<br />
<br />
if ya group 55+ 1 will do fine any 55+ tank will do I'd bring 57+ mezerbard or chanter.<br />
<br />
mobs hit around 170 which by todays standards is low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Casai, I would say you got extremely lucky on 2 in 1 hour. The droprate is really random sometimes short, sometimes hellishly long.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dunno I been there a few times now since os &quot;revamp&quot; we always get 2-3 crowns some rot even. From my experience its pretty common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinilye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seems like it can be rare or common.  I went down there with a group the first night for several hours and we got 1 crown.  Next time we went, and 2 dropped within an hour of each other.  We also saw some guts off the juggs that day, those seem to be the rarity there.  As for what you need, 1 group should be fine.  I went down with 1 group the second time, all 60 except for my warrior, and we did fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, I believe the drop rate was nerfed severely from it's normal rate.  When I went there, the rate seemed to be roughly 1/8, but I was in the initial rush for them, as I caught the quest early and got lucky on the cloak, which inspired me to finish it up fast.  I had a friend spend 4 days there killing more than 300 reets before he saw a single drop, and that was a couple weeks ago.</div></div><hr />
