<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yari</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i was in a LDoN group lastnight with my warrior, group makeup was:<br />
<br />
50 Warrior - Me<br />
52 SK<br />
55 Enchanter<br />
51 Wizard<br />
52 Druid<br />
51 Cleric<br />
<br />
<br />
So im feeling pretty confident ive got a solid group and not a bunch of idiots but man was i ever wrong. I spent the entire goddamned time bouncing aggro between the wizard and the druid. Now ive got pretty good weapons and my taunt skill is maxed but jesus these two tools would not listen. Red Epic + CHOS could not keep aggro against these two morons. The druid would snare at 95% and the wizard would chain nuke ice comet and wonder why the mobs would come after them.<br />
<br />
Granted LDoN mobs dont hit hard at all but i take pitty on these two when they reach content that quads for 500 or 600+. <br />
<br />
Wanna know the wizard's response when i asked him to stop overnuking and making me chase the mob around?<br />
<br />
&quot;Taunt more and it wont chase me&quot; ... That shit right there is what pisses me off about this game. And the bastard continued to chain nuke so me and the SK just let it kill him.  I SOOOO wanted to rip this guy a new asshole for making a comment like that but instead im ranting about it here... sigh.. There are no good lowbies left. Id rather group with twinks and guildmates only.</div></div><hr />

They didnt bother to learn what spells grab aggro, or simple group ettiquette for their respective classes.

<br />
That's because they spent the same ammount of time getting to level 50 as it used to take to get to level 10, four and a half years ago.  We had to go out and work for our rusty weapons dammit.  Mino axes?  OMG, they were almost unbalancing in the hands of a level 5, yet everyone saved up their coppers for weeks to be able to buy one for 6 plat from a player.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yari</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, ironically i did try and &quot;help&quot; him out, having an wizard alt of my own i tried to get him to learn aggro management with no success. <br />
<br />
<br />
In this situation im not sure what the solution is. I think the problem is the re-introduction of dungeon exping after a good year and a half of neglect and today's player. having started most likely in luclin or pop era has simply not exped in many dungeons.<br />
<br />
When i first started EQ back shortly before Kunark exping in dungeons taught you a necessary skill. Granted i started out EQ with a cleric but even still. I learned when to sit and when not to and how to control my aggro with my heals. Now on the reverse side of the spectrum playing my warrior is just frustrating.  It may all be because taunt is broken but im leaning more towards player ignorance of their role. The &quot;l33t dude&quot; reason also comes into play here.<br />
<br />
Todays player being produced has 3 weaknesses<br />
<br />
1) Inability to take risks for greater reward<br />
2) Overconfidence in their ability to survive<br />
3) Retardation when it comes to accepting advice.<br />
<br />
Now thats not to say that every new player has these problems just an alarming majority. LDoN in itself is a great expansion because it brings back the things that made the game fun for me. Dungeons. The problems with LDoN as a whole have already been discussed so i wont go off into a side rant on that and keep on topic.<br />
<br />
I guess to sum up my feelings i feel that EQ is headed on a downwards spiral and these kinds of issues are going to continue to crop up unless Sony reverts all the things that dumb this game down and make it so easy to level up.<br />
<br />
Grinding to 60 pre-luclin took a long ass time for any class w/o PL and insured in that time you learned the ins and outs of your class thoroughly. Now you can get to 65 in under 2 weeks if you have the right skill to get there.<br />
<br />
<br />
/shrug. Im just disappointed entirely with today's players.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note lastnight i had one of the best groups i ever had with my warrior which does make me look on the bright side.<br />
<br />
Was <br />
<br />
51 Warrior: Me<br />
53 SK: Same guy from Original Group<br />
50 Monk<br />
50 Bard<br />
52 Magician<br />
50 Enchanter<br />
<br />
We did 3 adventures on normal and we cleaned house. Didnt have any aggro issues, no one running ahead exploring like an asstard, no one breaking mez, everyone assisting me, and very good exp/loot for the time put in. And every one of em got put on my friends list for ldon groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sad thing is that this same behavior would be efficient with a knight tanking.  So really they were being inefficient by taking a warrior in the first place, not by using the full potential of their classes despite the shortcomings of the warrior.  I'm not saying they were skilled players, they probably weren't.  But a group that holds back because a warrior is tanking is going to kill things MUCH slower than a group that doesn't with a knight tanking and be safer doing it.<br />
<br />
I tank all the time in LDON and do a pretty good job but I have yet to see a case where a knight wouldn't be able to do it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This 'group holding back' argument is getting old.  Unless you're beating your adventure in 20 minutes it doesn't matter if the casters in your group are doing their uber chain nuking mode or wimpy warrior aggro mode because they can still run out of mana either way.  And if you're beating them in 20 minutes you should not care who's tanking.  Anyway casters suck for DPS on long missions so you should not be the one begging for them to stay.  It should be the other way around.  All melee DPS group simply blow away any group that depends on casters, especialy on Hard, not counting charm pets, so I don't see why you as a melee needs to bow down to casters.  <br />
<br />
I finally tracked down a Paladin and the first thing that really stood out was that Force of Akilae alone lets him mitigate better than I do.  That is far more troubling than letting some random wizard able to nuke to OOM in 3 minutes when dealing with XP groups, especially an efficient one.  While the issue of aggro can easily be dealt with by having competent players, it is not quite so easy to get extra mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no its not. It gives them alot of mana but it certainly does not turn them into nonstop blasters. Clarity II is already 3 mana lower than KEI, and it doesnt either, does it? glad we agree here.<br />
<br />
Ice comet at 360mana with spec check, lets say 340 with a MP earring. this is as good as it gets at that level on mana preservation. <br />
so for 3 ICs per minute he needs 1020 mana per minute, which means 102 mana / tick. KEI 14, Familiar 15, Epic 18, and no horse?<br />
And 3 ICs per minute isnt really chain nuking, either<br />
<br />
I honestly just think you pulled slow like a snail.</div></div><hr />

Seriously wizards are the only pure casters that do not have a damage dealing pet that sticks around after one fight, its almost unfair to use them in discussions that involve others.<br />

Kinda like how bards are hybrids but follow different rules than the other hybrid classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think killing mobs in less than 60 seconds~ is pulling slow like a snail. I dont pull 1 mob and let the cleric pacify i usually pull around 3-4 mobs a swath. Read again before assuming such drivel. <br />
<br />
The wizard AND the druid were nuking the mob right as it got to camp giving me no time to establish aggro and get up on its hate list properly.<br />
<br />
Both myself, and the SK could not keep aggro because they were all out nuking and not listening to any requests to let the mob get to 80% at least before attempting to nuke it down. Hence once me and the sk got tired of that he died. And died a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no way a wizard can sustain that kind of nuking without running out of mana well before the adventure ends.  Not even an uber one can do something like that for long.  A level 65 uber Wizard can keep up chain SoS for how long?  5 minutes max maybe?  And yet somehow a level 50ish Wizard can cast so many Ice Comet nonstop with at best half the mana pool/regen/focus (and that's already way too generous).  <br />
<br />
And how does he get the mana back to overaggro again after dying?  You won't have any mana buffs after rezzed, and it's unlikely a wizard at this level has any FT at all.  So with his sitting regen of 20 or so mana/tick, where is this mana coming from?  Ice Comet is 400 mana.  That'd have taken 2 minutes of medding just for him to nuke again, let alone overaggro.<br />
<br />
Of course the aggro issue between Knights and Warriors is messed up but posts like this makes me think that people are just looking for the easy way out and/or trying to find a reason to blame for their own incompentence.  There is just no reason for most groups to even need Knight aggro in XP situations.  It buys you nothing when you're not uber (lack of mana pool, mana regen, and long mission times).</div></div><hr />

at 65, a standard suit of crap is like 1600hp. 1950 with self buff, and virtue is already 1300? <br />
no mob in LDoN is a thread to anyone, once slowed.<br />

with a wizard chaining ice comet from an infinite mana pool 1 mob / min is incredible slow!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because my warrior is 51 doesnt mean i dont know the ins and outs of other classes and what they are capable of. Ive been around a long time. Long enough to level a cleric to 65  from just before kunark to present and its safe to say ive grouped with enough wizards to know what they can and cannot do.<br />
<br />
With kei the facts are simple. A 50ish Wizard with no other form of mana regen other than kei was nuking the mobs constantly with very little downtime on his own part. For the majority of the adventure i used my shield ability on him to take the damage he was getting and the other part of the time the sk was peeling the mob off him after 2 or 3 hits in order to keep him from dying.<br />
<br />
This post wasnt about who was l33t or who was not. It was about the fact that the group i was in had two players who didnt take the time to learn their class and like you Trondir, could only come up with smartass remarks to make themselves feel important and show us all how big your internet penis is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ic = 1120/400 =2.8 ct 6.3<br />
dof= 643/215 = 2.99 ct 3<br />
rend= 784/280= 2.8 ct 6.3<br />
<br />
<br />
with mage bracer haste ring<br />
ic 1344/400 =3.36 ct 5.6<br />
dof 771/215 = 3.58 ct 2.7<br />
rend 940/280 = 3.36 ct 5.6<br />
<br />
so one ic = 1344 damage for 400man and you get agro<br />
2 dof = 1542 damage 430 mana and no agro<br />
<br />
1344/400= 3.36<br />
1542/430= 3.58<br />
<br />
so in same amout of time you get better damage mana ratio and no agro. ic is teh win for people who like big numbers rather then being better for the group. rend has the same ratio as ic if you need bigger number to show up the druid as well as less agro then ic.<br />
<br />
now if the druid was casting ice 612(734)/250 -50 fire it just makes dof almost impossible to not land. or fire 392(470)/260 -50 cold is almost pointless for helping ic land the ratio is just wastefull.<br />
<br />
in a nutshell ic is for flash and ohh ahh effect or killinig stuff in noob feild to impress the noobs or to see the perty effect or a flashy crit. although some call it the slush ball.<br />

of course they are. your group sucked and you blame your groupmates for it =P<br />
when the math tells me that pulls were ultra slow.<br />
but since I disagree with you, no need to take me serious? what way of discussing is that ?<br />
<br />
You say you have a clue? I clearly see you dont. Ice Comet uses alot of mana. statements like &quot;a 50 caster with KEI is nuking endlessly&quot; are so full of shit I dont know what to say. KEI is 14, C2 is 11.. casters went OOM with C2 easily as well, and now those 3 more mana make all the difference?<br />
<br />
<br />
btw Mokor, improved damage is random 1-20%, not always 20%.<br />
Also, 2 draughts chained right on inc will get you agro as well as Ice Comet.<br />
&quot;although some call it the slush ball.&quot;<br />
Slush ball is actually the Ice Meteor.<br />
<br />
<br />
ah and btw, if the SK cant get agro of a wiz, guess what. he blows as well. chained clinging darkness is the mother of taunt in these levels<br />

<br />
<br />
Yet you were not there. Consitantly there was an ice comet being cast at the beginning of the pull directly on the mob i was pulling in. This caused the mob to run to the wizard despite initial aggro and he would not cut it out. Hence what my rant was about.<br />
I never said he went oom. I said that he was chain nuking the entire time. There were very few periods where he sat and medded. He did not nuke every single mob though so i know he was medding at some points but the point of my post was his lack of ability to realize what aggro management is. By looking at your character(no im not trying to pick you apart) i can tell you havent been very far into the game, some pop zones it looks like mostly, but you should have a pretty good idea how detrimental pulling aggro away from the MT like this can be w/o a slower. A mob hitting for 200-210 max is still deadly to a caster in this situation, being that we had no type of slower other than the enchanter who was kept busy with mezes etc. Like i said i tend to pull 3-4 mobs at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
ah and btw, if the SK cant get agro of a wiz, guess what. he blows as well. chained clinging darkness is the mother of taunt in these levels<br />
<br />
<br />
Ice comet being cast at the beginning of the fight takes a few seconds to taunt off. especially when the mob is running accross the room consistantly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious how you are defining chain-nuking Yari? One of your most recent posts said that the wizard was chain nuking, but he also wasn't nuking some mobs at all. Here's the accepted definition of chain nuking: Casting a nuke spell, or various nuke spells, one after another as fast as you can. IE, cast IC, as soon as it lands and refreshes, casting it again, so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe that a level 50 wizard can chain cast a spell that takes 6.3 seconds to cast, while a mob is meleeing him for 200+ a pop.<br />
<br />
Do you perhaps mean that he was casting once on inc on every mob, and then spent the rest of the fight standing there, while the mob was beating on him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yari</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erm more that he was nuking yes on inc. mob would beat on him, get peeled off and hed do it again right after it was peeled off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how much medding is but if it's around 20/tick, then that means after the caster has died, he'd only be getting 20/tick henceforth (no more KEI or whatever mana buffs).  That means he can cast an Ice Comet every 2 minutes.  Even factor in possible mana focus/specialization that can't be more than one one Ice Comet per minute.  How is it possible you can't keep aggro off someone who's casting one Ice Comet every minute?  For that matter, even if you cannot, suppose you're killing a mob every minute, why isn't the wizard just casting it BEFORE the mob dies?  You can't get aggroed on something that's about to die because it'll be running (unless it's Undead) and even if you do it's about to be dead anyway.  Is he sitting down and medding for 5 minutes and then feel the need to make up for idle time?  A lot of pickup casters I've seen do this, and there's nothing that can be blamed except themselves.</div></div><hr />

this is not chain nuking<br />

he should get &quot;ONLY USE WITH KNIGHTS&quot; tattood on his forehead though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But according to Bracy, that warrior would owe all of his DPS to the mob that dropped his weapon, the haster that sped him up and the healer that kept him alive. :p<br />

Seriously, if you're going to bitch about the semantics of a thread, at least have the courtesy to once in a while get back to the main point. Let me recap again for those that may have missed it:<br />
<br />
A Wizard repeatedly nuking on incoming with a major damage nuke is stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What did your post provide? That's right, nothing.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to stave off the reply to this: I know this post didn't contribute anything, but feel free to flame anyway</div></div><hr />

By the way, just a warning in case you start to pick a fight with me...don't screw with me. I've stolen Shikarii's Mightytalk(tm) hotkey and I'm not afraid to use it. :p</div></div><hr />
