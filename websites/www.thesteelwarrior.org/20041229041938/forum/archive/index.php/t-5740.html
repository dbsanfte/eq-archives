Anyway, If I re-rolled I'd go Ogre strictly for the stun thing. The biggest PITA of Ogres is always having to be shrunk, so buy a tinkered shrinker or cobalt bracer cause you'll always need it.<br />
<br />
As far as HP go, no, 305sta is 305 sta and the same for all warrior races. The hardest stat to max is AGI, at least for me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it is... it's called 'warrior'. Just a formality I am sure, and I have heard that Ogres can play other 'classes' but I wouldn't know about that. <br />
<br />
I also heard that Warriors could be races other than Ogres? How cute that would be, eh? <br />

Ah, but there's nothing like an elf in plate, a wood elf in chain, an ogre in chain, a vah'shir with a huge cat as a pet, and a dark elf in a dress (okay, there's no way to make an inky seem tough or respectable)...all of them hiding behind a little girl.</div></div><hr />

I actually started out as an Iksar. But Iksars couldn't wear Cobalt or Indicolite... so I rerolled. Had no clue about the frontal stun immunity, or the 45 AC bonus of the Iksar, I didn't give it much thought.<br />
<br />
I have the wood elf crown, and a human illusion item. But those illusions don't last long enough and have far too long casting time to be worth using on raids... for me, at least.<br />
<br />
And now with the stun dodge AA, it get worse. If I could choose again, it would be Iksar. <br />

Cobalt bracer is 7.4 sec cast time. thats a lil price to pay for playing the best tanking race in the game.<br />
<br />
22.2 seconds to shrinkX3 <br />
<br />
Or you could get yourself an AoN for insta shrink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're not the best tanking race in the game. That's just an opinion. My opinion is Iksar. Some guy says gnome.<br />
<br />
And no, 22 seconds every time you zone, die, go LD, get illusioned involuntarily, every day you raid 4 hours+, is not worth it... You know trolls don't get stun immunity, or AC bonus, and they are as fat as ogres. Barbs have to shrink 3 times too, I think.<br />
<br />
And AoN is useless when you want to corner tank shit, and you still have to shrink once.<br />
<br />
They should just make a special version of shrink that is a long LONG lasting buff... like a horse. Alongside the old shrink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I do agree that having to shrink so often is annoying, I must point out that you actually get to minimum size with only 2 shrinks.  The third one doesn't do anything to you, you just probably see the spell effects and you're so tiny, you think you might've changed somehow.</div></div><hr />

Then create an ogre with 157 sta and testbuff him to lvl 25. <br />
<br />
Then buff/gear the wood elf to near 157 sta, and the HPs should be near the same. Sure Ogres will have more HP nakid, but what good is a warrior in his britches?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most irritating thing about being a non-ogre warrior is trying to get into (or worse, out of) the PoK bank when some idiot ogre warrior has decided that the bank doorway is only place in all the zones in all the expansions and all the continents that he could possibly choose to spend 10 minutes sorting through his inventory.<br />
Of course, if you have an ogre warrior, but are not the one standing in the doorway, then you have the same problem (yet another example of how, in the end game, advantages and disadvantages of different races tend to disappear).<br />
 I guess your advantage as an ogre in this situation is that while you are standing there waiting for the other ogre to move his fatness out of the way, you can be saying to yourself &quot;I'm immune to frontal stun! I rule!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, there are dozens of threads out there on which is the best race and they all say basically the same thing: eh, play whatcha like. Different characters will require different kinds of development, but they can all do the job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Good Starting stats. <br />
<br />
2. No frontal stun.<br />
<br />
3. Naked Ogre HPs &gt; All (Somewhat useful on raid encounters where spam rezzing is happening. Heck there are times when I have tanked a mob trying to keep a cleric alive as a naked Frog shortly after a rez(not that it happens alot heh). Course I am a couple hundred shy of 4k totally naked having all hp aa/ 500 GoD hps - an Ogre's huge stamina advantage would probably hit/exceed that 4k. <br />
<br />
4. A Zek Ogre up until the end game has some nice Cultural/Race armor option.<br />
