<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lifelike</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just looking for some advice on which setup to go with for best agro control right now. My current two options are an Ornate Greatblade with an Anger 2 aug or a Great Blade of Storms that I'm about to get an Anger 3 aug for + an unaugmented Windspeeder.  I have Wep Affinity 3 and am 2 AA points away from WA4. Love the AC/HP from the OGB but I've been having trouble keeping agro recently. Wanted to see if the GBoS / Windspeeder is maybe the way to go before grabbing an Anger 3 aug for GBoS.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice<br />

If you really want to go dual wield I'd get a copper hammer of striking, to go with the GBoS.  The ornate greatblade is a far superior weapon in terms of stats/hps/dps of course, so if you can keep aggro with it it is much better than your dual wield combo.  If it was me I'd probably upgrade the OGB to anger III and try that for a while.  You're not gonna be an aggro juggernaut, but I think you should do ok.  GBoS and Copper hammer with A3 would be an aggro upgrade for sure, but at the loss of a lot of hps and dps.</div></div><hr />
