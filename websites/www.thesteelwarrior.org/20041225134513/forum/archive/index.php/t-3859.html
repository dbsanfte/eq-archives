<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question...I use the othmir prexus totem in range. It has 20 stamina. I am thinking about auging it with 6 more next time up.<br />
<br />
Probably Str. of elements first, but otherwise Totem.<br />
<br />
The question is, given that it already has so much stamina, and that I can get it up to 156 stamina hit points in that slot, and the fact that I am <br />
<br />
1) Iksar and 85 starting stamina challenged<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
2) Casual only no raiding<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this a good idea? It seems like a great place to store lots of other stamina and it allows me to focus on pure hit points (missing in my armor choices for the most part) in a lot of other slots, since 26 stamina could make up for 4-6 pieces of other regular stuff at my level.<br />
<br />
Am I thinking the right direction here? I know I need my bow for a couple things, but can always switch the totem back in when necessary.<br />
<br />
It just seems like there are much more choices of switching out other slots than range, and given that it already holds so much stamina, and I am no where near maxing out my stam any time in the near future, that this might be a good place to squirrel away the stamina.<br />
<br />
I.E. first thing to go would be RBB (10 stam no hps at all) for better haste and hit points  and Champs Greaves (7stam no hps at all)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I put my sta augment on my haste boots, because I didn't forsee upgrading them for a long time. Next option would be my pants.<br />
<br />
I put a sv cold aug on my sleeves because I am actively seeking to upgrade my sleeves.<br />
<br />
In regards to swapping, well, as a warrior you get healed to full a lot in the course of an evening so swapping out 20 sta to shoot an arrow or two isn't that big a deal.<br />

It is just super annoying to switch out your range slot item for a bow everytime you want to pull something</div></div><hr />

<br />
But does that range item make good sense for now? I mean almost every other slot is buyable with LDON or has some sort of Bazaar purchasable upgrade.<br />
<br />
Finding more than 156 hps in the range slot might be tough LOL!</div></div><hr />

That should be the end goal anyway, since the totem is really just a makeshift substitute at this point for you.</div></div><hr />

Elemetal bows are getting pretty close to being next on my list I reckon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;How much do STA augs cost in LDoN?&quot;<br />
<br />
6 Stamina ones drop a lot, usually every 3rd adventure or so I see one in a level 65 group.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't buy a stamina aug unless I had a lot of points and nothing better to buy.  There are better things to spend points on like Anger III augs or pure hp augs or some of the nicer armor for example.  Pure hp &gt;&gt; stamina because a shaman can usually buff you to at least 255 and after that it is diminishing returns on stamina gained hit points.  I would probably suggest you spend 5 to 15 AA to increase stamina before you spent LDoN points on a stamina aug if feel you really must do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice all. Just going to take about 6-10 months at current Adventure pace to dig up the Platinum for an elem bow ha ha...<br />
<br />
But hey, 6-8 months = more exp, more AA's more new armor :)<br />
<br />
I figure for now the totem is an ok substitute, since the chances of getting the bow are probably going to come right around the time I have bought my last new piece of armor from Tak or Miragul :)<br />

<br />
Just keep in mind that the featherwood procs Ethereal Strike which has a 200 pt de-agro according to Allakhazam.  Not a big deal if you are pulling but sux if it procs and you're wanting to pull the agro off the puller on incoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll still get aggro.  Try it.  I've been using one for awhile, proc or no proc, it still pulls aggro off pullers just the same as every other ranged attack will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd try to rotate that STA out of the ranged slot...my thinkin is your goal should be to optimize your equipment to max sta with shammie buffs only (that magic number around 250 STA that yields 305 buffed).  The +100 hps on the bows is a nice spot to rebalance from (e.g move that 25 sta to other items and/or AA pts) and pickup the HPs.<br />
<br />
Hope this made some sense.</div></div><hr />

To rotate it out of that, you would need 4 augs on existing items. (which I would do anyway if I pick up 4 augs)<br />
<br />
plus I wont get that bow for a while heheh...</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL I completely forgot about that. Did I mention my Mom gave it to me when she stopped playing her druid?<br />
<br />
Guess I won't be doing that then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blah I was wrong you can add the &quot;All&quot; mods to a type 4 slot (I added a +sta to my bow last night).  Sorry just wanted to clear up my error</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that I pull way to much, especially in LDoN, to be able to justify putting anything in my range slot other than a bow.  The initial aggro generated by the puller is not trivial.  Also, even though I'm not always going to get a single pull, no matter how hard I try, it's easier for me to take a beating from 2-3 MoB's then a ranger, monk, etc....  Harmony doesn't always stick and FD doesn't always work.   Not to say that I always pull, I prefer to let those who are better at it than me do their job when I can.</div></div><hr />
