Anyhoo, back on topic. All high end gear should have 20-50 hp/mana removed. Lose some focus effects and FT too. Only warriors should break 10k, and even then only with augments, knights should max around 9k. Defensive should not exist, warriors should have more cinsistant agro and less DPS(5-10% above knights with both maxed AA) and a CONSTANT considerable mitigation(like baby defensive, all mobs hit us for less max/min than any other class. Period.) advantage at all times(maybe chip 25-30% off DI of each mob for wars). Hybrid offensive spells should give agro equal to their mana cost(or maybe 120% of their mana cost, pre-spec). Group heals should give considerably less agro. F*(%ing Aura of Hate should be able to be clicked off. Knights get a 2 minute discipline to get similar mitigation to warriors with a 25 minutes timer. Monks should get a tiered AA that ups their FD chance of mem blur til it's like 80%, and a less fails AA til a failure is a pretty rare occurance. Add some agro to bard songs so that twisting 4+ has some chance(not huge, maybe 15-25%) of getting them whacked. Magicians/Necros/Beastlords should be required to get the /pet hold discipline before levelling to 61. Most unresistable AE's should be changed so that at 500 resist you have ~60-70% chance of resisting. Paladins should get an MGBable heal similar to bst/cleric, 3 tier 175, 200, 225 per tick. Rangers should get triple attack, maybe slightly weaker than war version. Wizards should be able to buy Concussion, the quest is retarded. Shaman should get a poison based nuke and have it not take 2 weeks to cast(F Velium Strike). Neurotoxin(nec) should be upped to 1500dd base, mobs die too fast on most clearing for dots to do their job anyways. And anyone halfwit who calls my lovely kilt a skirt should be stabbed in the groin with a broken bottle repeatedly. And for the love of god put AoV on the Trydan's BP.<br />

NERF EVERYONE! Before it is too late! Nerf bards! Make them pull agro! Nerf heals, make them slower/more expensive! Nerf all high end items, too GD many Hp/Mana/Effects! Nerf mana regen! Nerf SoS for rogues, it's too good outside PoP! Nerf warrior DPS! Nerf mage mana regen, effective FT 300 is NOT RIGHT! Nerf charm, it's still too powerful(high end) without enough risk! SWING THAT NERF BAT WIDE AND SWING IT HARD! Otherwise the next raid expansion will need mobs hitting for 6500 just so warriors are the preferred tank. And fights will last Luclin length again! THE SKIES SHALL RAIN BLOOD AND A PLAGUE 'O LOCUSTS SHALL COVER THE LAND! Now, before it is too late, NERF like you have never nerfed before!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

 Sadly me stating quite clearly that I thought everyone, warriors included, should be nerfed was repeatedly taken as &quot;You just want warriors buffed and hybrids made useless!&quot; repeatedly.</div></div><hr />
