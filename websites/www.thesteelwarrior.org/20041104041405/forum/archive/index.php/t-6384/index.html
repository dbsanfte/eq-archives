<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nuldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit EQ during Luclin and recently came back. I made a new warrior and bought him some gear. I think I've done a decent job of getting the right items but I'd like everyone's advice and suggestions on where I can go from here.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to his magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=878798<br />
<br />
All the gear, AAs, and leadership abilities are correct. I have about 50k plat. I have some gear sitting in the bank that I've picked up that I could probably sell for another 100k if I really needed to.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm trying to make sure I haven't missed anything obvious. Any suggestions (about AAs, leadership abilities, or gear) would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You obviously do know what's good and what's crap, so just never stop looking for upgrades and you'll do fine.</div></div><hr />
