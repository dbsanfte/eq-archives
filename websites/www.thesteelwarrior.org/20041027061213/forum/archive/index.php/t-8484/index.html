<br />
I wont go into any specifics of the fight for obvious reasons, but we have beaten him before, and the fight has definitely been changed to unrealistic levels, as we discovered this evening.  Wondering if others are facing the same problems that we are, or if they've heard about it being a fuck up on Sony's end or anything like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard he was changed to an obserd amount of stupidity.  He's down for 2 more days for us.  Then its back to the encounter=/.</div></div><hr />

Can you confirm, categorically, that Zun respawn was uneffected by the last patch then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
His respawn is unaffected, we did Tacvi on Wednesday, then got owned by Zun yesterday. Yesteray was his expected spawn day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's very irritating to have to relearn this all over again, the encounter seemed fine to me even with the little work around...<br />
<br />
I also thought they we're changing it so you wouldn't have to kill Zun each time he respawned, but I've seen no evidence of it.<br />
<br />
The randomness factor to alot of these encounters is a real pain in the ass.  I like challenge, but having to sit there and pray a mob spawns before you get owned is a little much heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goddamnit, I KNEW it would be unaffected, but would people listen to me? We sat on our asses on Wednesday because someone said 'Oh gnoez! Patch will mean Zun is up again!' so we took the day off instead of waxing Xxeric grrrrrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's very irritating to have to relearn this all over again <br />

Theres nothing to learn atm, its just flat out 100% broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Andrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This encounter absolutely shouldn't have been touched at all. Even if guilds were beating it in a way that the developers didn't envision, it was still quite difficult and a worthy encounter. Now, it's just rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Still 92 vengeful apparitions up in jail on AB server hehe. Guess no fix until Monday? Unless they ninja fix it friday night US time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cordain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The teather code found in many Gates events is poorly thought out, and the implementation allows and even encourages exploitation.  It started with Ikk raids where you could kill a couple golems then teather.  In their original incarnation the golmes hit for substatially less.  Of course folks figured out that you could kill one and teather... but instead of fixing the encounter to prevent this, they just made the mobs hard enough sso they were a challenge for those that played the teather games.<br />
<br />
When a complex event teathers, it should force the entire event to instantly reset.  Letting you complete the event in &quot;stages&quot; is insanely cheesey.  <br />
<br />
Now granted compnents of the Zun encounter will need to be tuned a bit to make sure that 50 folks who are ready for Tacvi can beat it regularly as farm target.   <br />
<br />
If you want to make Zun a gatekeeper then he needs to drop a key/flag so that random folks who beat HP can't just waltz into Tacvi.   Of course with the current mechanic for zoning into Tacvi this forces Tacvi guilds to kill Zun, and would make him scarce for those that follow.  I think that Xxeric is the proper gatekeeper though.<br />
<br />
So in summary, to fix Gates teathering:<br />
1) If any mobs in the encounter are teatherd , the event resets<br />
2) If any mobs deemd part of the encounter are dead, and no other mobs in the event are agro, the event resets.<br />
3) Tune other elements of encounter to ensure the appropriate challenge for the intended raid force</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">2) If any mobs deemd part of the encounter are dead, and no other mobs in the event are agro, the event resets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would a good pull team constitute a failure of an event?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why would a good pull team constitute a failure of an event?<br />
<br />
Well, if the pull team is that good, they'd realize that they'd need to have another mob agroed before the current one dies.  I think this rule is part of the philosophy that if you design a multiple mob encounter, put some sort of limit on it so that it stays that way, instead of having people come up with a work around and then subsequent nerfs/upgrades to the difficult of individual mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">IMO they need to &quot;undo&quot; whatever quick fix they attempted to put in to avoid people playing with the tethers, at least until they have time to rethink the event completely. Personally I dont really have the patience to wait for them to fix yet another bug/cockblock. And correct me if I am wrong, but shouldnt the Txevu dev be busy with fixing Tacvi instead of fiddling with Zun? :D <br />
<br />
The entire event would need an overhaul/tuning IF you cannot somehow do it in stages. <br />
<br />
I cannot believe any guild so far have fought this event straight up all at once?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This is the part of EQ I find most distressing (other than grinding, which I try to avoid).<br />
<br />
I understand the desireability of having encounters that aren't simply kill the mob/s move on to the next. However, SoE has started doing puzzles with unclear solutions and kill tactics that are very arbitrary.<br />
<br />
When EQ wanders too far in the direction of &quot;figure out how&quot; you have 45 raid members sitting on their kiesters in a raid while 5 Rangers and 5 Monks spend hours checking trap rules, tether limits, respawn rates, etc. Fun for some, but mind numbingly boring for everybody else.<br />
<br />
GoD is for the most part wonderfully designed, I say this with the greatest admiration for the creativity of the designers. But, there are parts that frankly are aribtrary and a bit mistuned for the staffing of guilds that manage to make their way to them.<br />
<br />
There gets to be some sympathy for the view that if SoE is going to design unfair encounters (the more you fail at one, the more you perceive it to be &quot;unfair&quot;), then there isn't any good reason for players to be fair (short of exploiting) in beating them.<br />

<br />
has something to do with the way the pre-nerf fight was beatable :D  It's not a cheap shot at a pull team, just a possible correction to the way people were beating it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If devs wanted us to beat the encounter the intended way (ie tanking Zun + 2 goats + controlling the adds without ever leashing) then they have to tune it down drastically. <br />
There is no way in hell anyone could beat it with 50ish people this way, that's just too much healing power needed, too much luck involved (hello chaosslayer not poping, or key people getting banished at the wrong time) and wanton destruction won't ever allow a raid force to survive long enough to do it without leashing (even with neg300 rm check, people WILL get hit by the ae and end up oom before the end of the event).<br />
<br />
As long as they dont tune it properly for a 50 man raid force, I'll be fine with sploiting the goats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zahrdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well Zun is fixed now, and nerfed to hell too :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uthuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Its beatable....<br />

I think Zahrdahl was reffering to the fact that the encounter is alot easier now.</div></div><hr />

So was this changed? Zun wasn't supposed to be up until Thursday for us... people camped at his spawn spot, and are reporting that he is up today (server was reset last night) and killed them when they logged in.<br />
<br />
We killed Xxeric last night. And now apparently we don't get to push past him tonight as we'd planned, because Zun is up again. Which really annoys the shit out of me.<br />
<br />
They really need to change the way you access Tacvi. Just give us a damned flag and another place to zone in already. Having to kill Xxeric every 3 days is more than enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rampagious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree 2 gateway mobs is to much. Sadly i spoke to rashere about this and he said he intended to add dropped items from zun that allowed you to zone into tacvi from txevu zone in.

<br />
Atleast zuns not hard and his loots half ass decent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll know as soon as we form up the raid and engage, but I'm hearing rumors the Zun fight was beefed up.  I assume some change was made, since he wasn't supposed to spawn for two more days, yet he's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rampagious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just steam rolled him an hour ago. Hes alot weaker then he was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Not any tougher, not any easier. Exact same same stupid ass encounter.  Everything about the way Zun is designed (from the randomness bullshit to the cynosure-style method required to access tacvi) annoys the hell out of me.</div></div><hr />

if they havent beaten zun b4, going to tacvi on another guilds zun kill is lame imo /rude</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree, (not knowing his spawn randomness ahead of time).<br />
If one guild always gets the spawn during their raid times and hes not left up, theres not much more that you can do than zone in.<br />
<br />
Maybe they should make him give a flag or something (unless theres no randomness to his spawn time, then it would just get locked and would suck).<br />
<br />
And make another zone in elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">While I agree that it's kind of lame to access taciv without zun, maybe the highpriest is more of a gatekeeper mob than zun?  <br />
<br />
I think zun is a walk in the park compared to xxeric so if a guild can progress in taciv *in its current state with current levels* then it's pretty much a given they would own zun and his goat buddies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Maybe they should make him give a flag or something (unless theres no randomness to his spawn time, then it would just get locked and would suck).<br />
<br />

<br />
Maybe they should've figured this out 6+ months ago, too. If anyone in a guild who was going to be killing Zun by now had known how this was going to work at any time before Zun was actually killed, they could've immediately stood up and said &quot;HI, THIS IS STUPID AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED.&quot; How could they not see the design problem here? Could you imagine if every random Joe Schmoe in Luclin could zone into VT when Emp Ssra wasn't up, and nobody could if he was? Or the same with RZtW/Elementals, or Pantheon Gods/PoTime? What in the hell is going on here? The unfinishedness of GoD even at this stage still astounds me.<br />
<br />
And I just loved hearing the rumor that Zun/Tacvi might be fixed to give flags and give us an alternate zone in after OoW comes out.   If the Guild Summit taught these idiots anything, it should've taught them that players want this shit fixed before another expansion is rushed upon us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">While I agree that it's kind of lame to access taciv without zun, maybe the highpriest is more of a gatekeeper mob than zun?  <br />

<br />
Definitely, if a guild can get past xxeric they have every right to be in tacvi imo, and if they cant then the whole subject is moot since Tacvi is an instanced zone and it doesnt affect the other guilds.<br />
<br />
Zun is pretty easy once you pass the learning curve, ofcourse the luck factor is still there and very gay but hes nothing compared to xxeric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">the goat in tacvi is approximatly 5 billion thousand times harder than zun so who cares if people get tacvi instances without having a zun kill.  The single only good thing about the zun fight is the fact that it drops 4 loots...otherwise, while the fight does have that certain amazing combination of tedious &amp; annoying that soe seems to aim for so often, its really not a hard fight at all.</div></div><hr />
