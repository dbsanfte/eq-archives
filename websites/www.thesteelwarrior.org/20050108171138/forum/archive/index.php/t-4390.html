24 November <br />
------------------------------ <br />
** Class Issues **<br />
 <br />
<br />
- Two new warrior quests have been added. Similar in difficulty to the warrior epic, completion of these quests will grant the warrior the ability to change class to Paladin (&quot;Good&quot; quest) or Shadowknight (&quot;Evil&quot; quest). We hope this addresses the recent balance issue with warriors. Talk to a warrior guildmaster in any city for the start of this quest. <br />
<br />
- A quest for monks has been added, similar to the warrior quest. A monk may now choose to undertake this quest and become a ranger. We hope this addresses monk balance issues. Talk to a monk guildmaster in any city for the start of this quest. <br />
<br />
- The Norrathian Police Force &quot;Home Security Education&quot; project has been a major success. All doors in Norrath, Luclin and on the planes are now locked and require a key or &quot;Pick Lock&quot; skill to open. This should address some of the rogue and bard issues. <br />
<br />
- Necromancers and Magicians are out of balance with other Intelligence-based casters. Therefore Wizards and Enchanters will be given magician-style pets. To make up for this, the Pegasus Feather Cloak will be added to Quarm's and Lord Inquisitor Seru's loot tables in order to make it more available. Additionally, Necromancer pets will become mindless dead (uncontrollable like old enchanter pets). <br />
<br />
- Shadowknights and Paladins who lose key factions will automatically change class to Warrior. If you're evil, you should work on maintaining that evil faction, and if you're good, you should work on staying good. Unfortunately, a side effect of this implementation is that we cannot grandfather anyone, so if your factions are already ruined you may log on to find you are a warrior. <br />
<br />
- Added a Class Alternate Advancement for Bards. Spending 9 points on the &quot;Milli Vanilli&quot; ability gives you the ability to make your songs appear as though they are being sung by someone else. That person gets any associated agression or benefit. <br />
<br />
- Random level 1-3 mobs in zones with Wayfarer camps have been given the ability to Death Touch anyone who attacks them who is more than 20 levels higher than the mob. This ability can function even if the mob is killed in a single blow. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- The Camouflage spell now renders the target flash orange instead of invisible. Hunters have to be safe, and safe hunters wear flash orange. If you want to traipse around without being seen, use invisibility. <br />
<br />
- Call of the Hero no longer works on people who aren't heroes (have not completed their epic). <br />
<br />
- All resurrection spells upped to 100% experience returned, but randomly delete an item off the corpse being raised or off the live character if the corpse has less than 10 items on it.</div></div><hr />

Ha ha ha ha ha - you have no idea how much I laughed on that one !!! :D <br />
<br />
Jokes aside, it really is pretty silly that there are &quot;good&quot; aligned SK's and &quot;Evil&quot; aligned Paladins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that Call of the Hero thing I saw, when someone else quoted this post on my guild's forum, freaked the hell out of me :p</div></div><hr />
