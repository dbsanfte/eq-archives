<br />
What would be the best place for a decently equipped 47war and 46 cleric to duo?<br />
<br />
Faster the XP, the better ;) Coin loot/item drops dont bother me.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Entrance area of The HOLE would be great.   DL still will be decent dou.  Maybe  Veksar zone in  might be too tough.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the best EXP mod  go to THE HOLE 25% exp bonus,  decent loot and you are at the perfect level range to start IMO. Start at the entrance and pull to there this can last you until 49.   At 49 move in deeper,  follow the hallway until you see a ramp that leads to a building.  Stay back in the corner of hallway before the ramp and pull to there.  EXP slows down here at around 53. <br />
<br />
At 53 Mines of nurga comes to mind 12% exp bonus to the zone mobs can be tricky and spell casters are a bitch but it is sure beats POP for fun value.</div></div><hr />

Dulak is a cool zone but prepare to buy a lot of invis potions if you're going with just a warrior and cleric.  I 2-boxed my warrior and cleric there leveling up a lot.  Very fun zone but I did get sick of having to use invis pots to CR, and occaisionally dying in Gunthak thanks to invis fading at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
The good news is that they sell invis pots in gunthak near the bank, so it's easy to pick up a couple for your run back to Dulak.</div></div><hr />
