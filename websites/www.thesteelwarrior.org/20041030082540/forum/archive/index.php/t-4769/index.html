<br />
Well, if you have skill points to spare at the warrior trainer, that's one place to go. Otherwise you simply have to go out and whack on monsters and it'll go up by itself.<br />
<br />
Simple. :)</div></div><hr />

I am a lvl 6 REAL noob with some really good items.   Such as the stone bladed axe. Also I would like to know if anyone knows a good place to train my weapon skills because I do not know of any?<br />
<br />
hehe jk <br />

<br />
Ok my advice is to visit the areas around your home city and just kill anything that cons dark blue.  Over time your skills will raise through practice.  For more information  check out these sites<br />

<br />
Level 6 can be vicious. You just want Crushbone in the worst way but even the orc pawns on the way there are attacking you. Find yourself an orc hill group and bang away at those bad boys for a level or two then head to the tunnel. When you can clear it then you might be ready for CB. It's one of the most fun places in the game. I still wander over there once in a while and clean out the whole damn place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">stick in home city will level 9-10, then you can head over to paludal caverns. with the much faster exp you can get these days weapon skills can lag behind but eventually they will catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">East commonlands hmmm you are a human than.  OK I would stick around there until it start getting green, then hit up Desert of North Ro till around 14 than go to Paludal Caverns.  At PC you can hit 24 in a matter of 4 hours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>levonbaird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ya r u a half elf as i think they r the best race in the game though alot of races i haven't played as i only have LDoN but i still think they r as they can start in freeport and they r as far as i know as good as humans and can c in the dark and a half elf warrior is the best noob combo though this guy is my main and i am i noob but i think im going 2 stick 2 him<br />
by the way do u know how i can get the wayfarers stone because i tryed 2 asked people in the quest area but no one has replyed yet so if u know because when i talk 2 the guy with the wayfarers stone he just says he is busy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yep...half elves own all. No idea how to get the wayfarer's stone. However, you may find this (http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-10-11&amp;res=l) useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>levonbaird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ok thanks i will c what it is by the way if u can do those wayfarers quests like mistmoore and that can u only chose 1 theme?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You can adventure in any team you like. You need to be level 20 minimum to start though. Once you are 20 i think a message will appear when you zone or something of the likes that instructs you to go to your hometown and speak with a certain person there. Just pay attention to what that person says and you should have your stone soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">couple leveling tips for warriors.<br />
1) try to be one of the higher levels in your group especially if you are the only tank. if you are tanking for the group and are one of the lower levels you are going to require a lot of healing.<br />
2) if your groups are melee oriented concentrate on blue cons.<br />
3) pay attention to the mobs you are fighting. you will find some mobs that are hard to kill give the same pathetic experience as some that are easy to kill. select the mobs you like when pulling.<br />
4) if your rate of experience gain is slowing way down look for another zone. some zones are just plain hard to level in.<br />
<br />
i admire you for giving away your &quot;freebie&quot; gear that i guess someone gave to you. when i first started i refused to accept charity from any real life friend but would from anyone i met in game. think of it this way. time spent talking is time not spent leveling. if they give you something because they think you are a nice guy then the item will help make up for the time not spent obsessively leveling. and yes when you reach 40 or 65 even you will indeed take satisfaction that you did it without hand-holding. above level 5 by the way you wont receive many gifts anymore.<br />
<br />
i gave a 200pp weapon to a level 2 wizard recently because i noticed she had been playing for a couple hours already and had no armor but her trainer tunic. i then put her on my friend list but never saw her again. thats sad. i dont like to see a discouraged beginner. but sounds to me you dont get discouraged quickly :)</div></div><hr />
