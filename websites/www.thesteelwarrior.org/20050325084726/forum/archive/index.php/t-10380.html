Is it all random? I remember I got 3 rare items in one day at level 30 in Duskwood, including Searing Blade from a chest in the Brightwood Grove. I used to get tons of good quality (green) weapons and armor whenever I went out to exp in Loch Modan. But now somehow the loot drops are beginning to suck. I get cloth all the time and low quality leather. What could be wrong?</div></div><hr />

I think there may be more to it than that.  I say this because as a level 53 Warrior I track what is available in the AH pretty closely, looking for upgrades.  And the shear number of items available begins to drop off in the mid 40s and takes a really nasty drop in the 50s.  I believe this is because loot actually becomes rarer.  The random number generator might make it seem like loot was rarer for one individual, but the overall numbers should be the same across server.<br />
<br />
Granted, early on the explanation might have been that there just weren't as many people in the 45+ range so the number of drops weren't as high.  But at this point the game has been out long enough that I don't think that's enough of an explanation.  I think the loot tables just get more stingy as you level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cotred</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep.. at 50+ level base most of your gear upgrade comes more from drops than from auction house. At higher levels your search for better itens is almost like a quest heh.. i already know that ill lost round some weeks to get my arcanite reaper for example... few items (most of them from raid bosses) will be a good upgrade for your gear. Sad but true.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drops are very random.  Farming named in instances is the way to go though for 50+ drops.  I honestly don't have any experience with Blackrock or Sunken Temple yet, but I can say that from farming Inner Mauradon (most of that loot is high 40s though), that the consistency and quality of the drops is very nice, especially off of the named.  I have yet to see any gear that requires 50+ outside of an instance though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The comparison to the AH is skewed once you think about it.<br />
<br />
There are tons and tons and tons of people that are lv1-40. All of which are going out and slaying hundreds of mobs at any given time of the day. Many players get to about 35ish, then create a new character in boredom or whatever the reason. Several people in my guild have 5 alts in the lv30s, but none past 40.<br />
<br />
Also, below 40s have a lot of help in instances. The lowbies in my guild are always in need of Gnomeregan or a Deadmines run - both of which I can essentially solo. Hence, it's me passing on everything and some lv20 priest rolling on all the items. In bigger instances, the parties usually consist of five people all in the level range. All five people are now rolling on the items they need rather than one person taking what he needs and selling the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is a bit more too it too. Generally the stuff that has dropped for me as I was farming has been about 5 levels below where I am. As you push higher there is a much smaller pool of people hunting and if the pattern holds, grinding XP won't produce much gear that is 55+. <br />
<br />
Then again it would not surprise me if the top end was under itemized too. I mean we have never heard of something like content not being finished at release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It may also be intentional.  If they offer you lots of carrots at first and then fewer carrots as time goes on, it may keep you in the game longer.  Or at least that seems to be one of the common theories.  It wouldn't surprise me in the least to find that they intentionally adjusted the drop rates post level 50 so items just drop less frequently.<br />
<br />
On a good day with my level 33 Hunter I'll get three or four green items just grinding on trash.  Doing the same thing with my level 54 Warrior gets me maybe one green item, if I'm lucky.  Not proof, just personal experience.  I could just be the victim of the RNG.  But I think other people will report similar experiences.</div></div><hr />

Oh, well that's certainly conclusive.</div></div><hr />
