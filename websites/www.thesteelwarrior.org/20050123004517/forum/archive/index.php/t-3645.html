We have been talking about dueling for sometime and to tell you the truth from all the spells I've seen etc.. I don't think I have a single chance to beat him.  Anyone dueled an SK of equal level and win post 60?  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they're a fatty; than just don't bother :D if the're pun inkies or erudies than good luck<br />
<br />
and no, i never have beaten one. even lower level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best I did was beat an SK that was 10 levels lower, and it took a helluva a long time.  Fuckin shadowstep, insta click invis, etc... *hugs bow*.<br />
<br />
All the others I've been pwnd.  Worst was a 60sk vs me at 60.  He ripped my ass up w/o HT even.  He just put all his DS's on, I slowed him, went 2h and he just tapped me to death (my MR was well over 100 at the time).<br />
<br />
So, in the immortal words... rots a ruck</div></div><hr />

Grab some JBoots and some crap buffs so when he dispells and DoTs, they can be easily pumiced. Just get a high damage weapon and kite him....the snare poo is nice, but you'll probably be in the same boat because he'll be casting Darkness on you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno man, I honestly don't think it can be done.   Back before SoL came out, there was this bastage named Xate on CT (who is now in FOH), who was sitting in EC tunnel trying to dump his Mask of Tinkering for a couple hunred kpp or so.  Eventually he got bored with that and changed it &quot;beat me in a duel.&quot;  I saw that fucker sitting at the tunnel, ripping up all comers.  He got dispelled several times, so I'm sure he was completely unbuffed for the majority of it.  He killed EVERYONE for a couple of hours straight.  The closest that anyone came was a monk with a Tstaff who got a few lucky procs, but that was it.  Everyone else may well just have laid down and died for all the good their fighting was doing them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lifetaps have a low resist, most have around a -200 resist modifier.  Unless your MR is over 200, don't bother trying to resist those.  The level 65 one actually has a -500 modifier (470hp, focusable and crittable).  This includes their Lifetap over times, such as Bond of Death.<br />
<br />
Spears are on Disease resist, and a good disease resist will actually give you a good resist rate on those.  Improved HT (the one that goes to 8k or so) is unresistable.  Those guys aren't common, but more and more are getting them.  The good thing is that he can't take off more than 75% of your hp in one shot, the bad thing is you will have a very hard time getting that hp back.  If you know they don't have improved HT, they'll most likely be using their disc'd HT...that's on a disease resist, and can be resisted but it has a -200 modifier also.<br />
<br />
Almost all their damage spells except the spears have a -100 modifier to resist, with lifetaps and HTs getting a -200.  A method of stunning them would be infinitely useful, as would a way to remove their buffs (especially their proc which gives them mana), and having Fire/Poison/Magic/Disease all over 200 or even higher is the only way you're going to be able to beat a decently skilled SK.  If they have the 8k HT...my advice is just don't bother.  Even with the modifiers for PVP, he's gonna have so much of an advantage over you it's pointless.<br />
<br />
My advice, don't even bother unless you've got insane resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest you aim for the following resists to help you out:<br />
300 MR, 200 FR, 200 DR. This will give you a reasonable chance of slowing down the spell based can of whoopass... and I do mean slowing down, not stopping. <br />
<br />
Pumice the hell out him early, and often. Use a high damage, high delay two hander. I've killed monks by simply standing facing them. Kick/bash to interrupt. It won't help much, but it will. Try to stay in his face. He'll shadowstep around and dot the hell out of you. It's frustrating, but the longer he can keep you out of melee, the better off he is. <br />
<br />
In even gear, you have no survivability edge and are at a significant damage disadvantage. When I was wielding my epic and wearing Malevolant (equiv to Warlords), I fought an even con warrior from an advanced elemental guild, wielding a Blade of War. I lose, but the fight was disturbingly close to even. Had his MR been about 50 less, I probably would have won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first of unless you outlaw HT in the fight dont bother.<br />
<br />
Even without HT similary equiped/AA sk with any skill will kill a warrior without breaking a sweat in most cases. SK is one of the best PvP classes, while warrior one of the worst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I would say that you have no chance of winning.  Just give up.  Unless your level / gear / aa are drastically better than the SKs (time geared vs ssra geared / 200-300 aa vs 30 aa) you have no chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are even in gear but that means neither of our resists are anything great.  Its a friend of mine so thats why we might give it a go anyways just to have a brawl but I figured the same as you all have said here.  I didn't stand a chance.  Should be funny to watch since our 65th lvl cleric friend said he'd join in on the fun.  We are thinking that if HT is used early.. cleric has a chance to kill just about everyone.  But all in all is just for fun figured I'd come out the looser due to lack of spells LOL  There is a brawl planned for us and an all for all which includes<br />

63 necro<br />
63 SK<br />
64 Chanter<br />
63 Chanter<br />
63 Mage<br />
65 Cleric<br />
55 Sham<br />
60 Warrior<br />
<br />
Wonder who will win.. my guess would be the cleric or mage hehe</div></div><hr />

Clerics have won TONS of Last Man Standing competitions thanks to CHeal and their great cures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konjunktion</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the gear, but assuming they are relatively equal, it's almost like ya have it lined up there. Necro or SK first, then the enchanters. Are the mages epic? Makes a big difference. Shaman might be a little too low level to contend well, but usually they duel well. Warrior and cleric at the bottom (unless that cleric is quite uber).<br />
<br />
As far as Warrior vs SK... you're talking about the lowest tier of PvP classes against the highest. Super harm touch, practically unresistable spells, lifetaps, shadowsteps, harmshields, damageshields...<br />
<br />
They have everything over you except their number of hit points and AC. <br />
<br />
My rogue's won a few duels vs SKs. The ones I've lost have been the ones where they never even bothered to enter melee range with me. Just run around, shadowstep... throw a free nuke... that kinda thing. Not much you can do about it. The duels I've won tho have been with poisons and discipline damage.<br />
<br />
I dunno how I'd match that to put the nail in the coffin. If you can't finish them off in a quick sequence... like a snare poison to discipline takedown... or a TStaff to discipline take down... they're going to beat you over time. <br />
<br />
PvP needs a real looking into. But seeing as how there's still so much else in the game that needs looking into (pure melee anyone?)... doubt they'll get around to it ever.<br />

Most of the debuffs dont work...MC doesnt work...fear...dark rarely works unless you're fighting someone lower or with shit MR,  and HT is cut down. Aside from that, keep the fight close range if you can..try not to allow much time for taps<br />
because those will finish you in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SKs and Necros are pretty hard to beat (pretty much unbeatable for a warrior) in duels especially if they're way up their in gear and AAs. When they start doing their chain life tap thing it's pretty much over for a warrior. My advice is to dual wield and hope you interrupt them and hope they weren't bright enough to put up their self DS.<br />
<br />
I recently tried dueling a necro who's in a time level guild on my server in the bazaar and all he pretty much did was chain lifetap till I was dead each time.<br />
<br />
One more reason to go with a BBB or SEWS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konjunktion</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About you losing virtue and haste..<br />
<br />
Keep in mind you have a total of 15 buff slots I believe? If you recieve a negative &quot;buff&quot; effect, it will write over some in their way.<br />
<br />
Also, basic dueling tip.. debuff your opponents if you can, and learn how to quickily dual buff yourself to ward off debuffs and waste their time for as long as you can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it's worth the highest an HT can be against a PC is 4800+Improved Damage. There is no resist check at this stage of the AA, do not pass go, do not collect $200. You luck out because of the 33% penalty to PVP spell damage, and the 75% max damage anti-oneshot coding.<br />
<br />
By the way, /disc is a very poor indication of HT incoming. It's either coupled to the HT in the hotkey, which takes a total of half a second or so to trigger completely, executing the 4800 damage far too quickly to cast as a defense, or the /disc and the HT are uncoupled, which is a great way to get you to blow divine aura on thin air, as /disc Unholyaura has a duration of about 30 minutes.  <br />
<br />
As well, if I pull out a goldenrod or Greater Stormwatcher's horn, I can have up to -three- lifetap procs running, all of which I can both crit heal and crit blast on. It's not pretty.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure a few ppl here know much about dueling as Pal but your chances against SK should be better I'd wager. Paladins do get heals/stuns and mana sives not to mention LoH.</div></div><hr />

You would need extremely high unbuffed resists, excellent ac/hp and dmg/dly to stand any chance, and against AA HT even that won't help.<br />
<br />
If you are going to try it, my advice is:<br />
<br />
- never dual wield. Assuming he knows what he is doing, he will stack every damage shield he can, which even without right click DS items can be a lot, especially with a DS potion. Dual wield = death even if you have way better gear.<br />
<br />
- at least have your MR high. 150 or above  will give you some chance to resist snares,  if you get snared he can run circles around you. Then all he needs is to stack dots on you and lifetap till you die.<br />
<br />
- use damage shield. Won't hurt him much, he will be using 2hander, but it's something, and it will hurt his pet.<br />
<br />
- farm some ice giant toes (not velious, you need everfrost ones), have a shaman make you instant heal potions.  A lot of them. If you have lots of them you might have some chance, if he goes oom.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fieldweeble</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a 51 SK on vallon zek (pvp), and he's -never- lost to a pure melee class, out of hundreds of fights. Warriors just have no utilities to call upon. You don't even have to snare them to win. He gets a good hit in? shadowstep and tap it back. Losing? HT. SKs are very good at pvp when used in the right hands -- but as a warrior, your best strategy would be to use the highest damage weapon you can get a hold of, and get your MR as high as possible. Learn to joust as well, where you hit them without them hitting you. But in the end, if they can't take you down with melee, they'll have you with low resist DOTs such as heat and boil blood. Warriors have to have an outrageous ammount of clickables and accessories and resists to compete in pvp -- that's why I moved to firiona to start mine :)</div></div><hr />
