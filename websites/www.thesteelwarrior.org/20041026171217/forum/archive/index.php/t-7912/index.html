<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, Im no expert.  Ive mostly spent my time playing my Shaman, and my SK, but recently Ive pulled my warrior out of the dust bin brushed him off and am ready to go.  What exactly is the warriors job..Are we DPS, MT, Pullers..My warrior is only lvl 50 and for the longest time I was busting my hump trying to get my STR up as high as possible..Then I was told, nope, get your stamina up with your ac.  But it seems to me that we should be able to dish out damage as well..So wouldnt str be important as well?  And that being the case, would it be better to use duel wield or go with a big honking sword to dish out some big hits with some awsome crits?  I know that when I played a shaman my group allways went that much better when I had a healthy warrior there who did his job well..Any help would be great..Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our job is to make a mob so unbelievabely pissed at us that it does not even think about anyone else and to survive the relentless assault from that mob better than any other class possibly could.<br />
<br />
Our job is not dps.<br />
Our job is not healing.<br />
Our job is not pulling.<br />
Our job is pure tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sums it up<br />
<br />
Prior to 63, get your stanima as high as possible, AC comes second.<br />
<br />
At 63 to 65, Start swapping some of your stanima gear with pure hp, even if it is only 25 pure hp, it adds up and their are AAs that will increase all your base hp and gear induced hp by a percentage, really make an effort to get your around 1400, at this point STA is less important as buffs jump it up fairly high.<br />
<br />
get a GSoT and slap an anger augment on it, this will keep reposites down and keep you alive longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if i had to define a warrior's primary role in two words:<br />
<br />
damage absorbtion<br />
<br />
our job is to keep the mob(s) on us at all times. standard exceptions apply depending on your group makeup, area where you're fighting, and skill level of your group.<br />
<br />
through good gameplay, good utility equipment, and practical experience, a smartly-played warrior can be a good puller in many areas. ditto for assisting crowd control classes for pre-mez/pre-root-park positioning when not MT. there's a bunch of non-tanking uses for a warrior, but few that can't be done much better by classes built to fill that niche.<br />
<br />
but being a good enough player to do all of those things means little if you lack the gear and know-how to fill our most important and primary role: keep the mob's attention until it's dead and don't die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daylenia Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i can't believe ya got 50 without knowing what a wars job is but anyways as you gert higher in lvl mbs will riposte more in this case you will need to use a 2hs otherwise 1hs is usually better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mob ripostes are trivial compared to aggro generation. Holding the mobs' attention on you is vital, taking fewer ripostes is a perk. There are very few mobs that riposte hard enough to really decrease your survivability, and otherwise taking fewer ripostes is unimportant.<br />
<br />
  Other people are basically on the ball here. Ac is good, hp is good, sta is good. Everything else is basically unimportant. If the mob is hitting you, you're doing things fundamentally right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As all have said here the warriors job is to get hit much more than it is to hit. I have tried to go for AC and HP gear when I can. Hvae started on my AA's now once at 65. I am training all the defensive ones first. If the MT is alive the group normally makes it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">get your around 1400 was ment to be get your ac around 1400<br />
<br />
heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our job is to take damage, and do damage. Go to Character Creation and pick warrior, it describes what Sony wants us to be.</div></div><hr />

lol you like my sig huh?:P  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">personnally I think this piece of ass is to eyecatching, it doesn't help reading your post, neither the poor budy that comes just after you ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daylenia Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lol  :D<br />
pherhaps if you guys weren't such perverts lol :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Concerning the original poster's questions: no, don't worry about STR. Until you max your stats out, STA and DEX are more important. <br />
Mainly what you want in weapons is aggro generation. There will be times when you are not the main tank and you will want to be able to do what damage you can without attracting too much attention from the mob. But very often the top damage per second weapons are not the ones that give you the eye candy crits. Look around the site for lots of threads discussing weapons.<br />
If you've played a shaman for a while you've probably been in groups where you are the healer. You've noticed it's easier to cast spells when the mob is hitting the tank and not you (heh), and it's easier to heal some tanks than others. You want your warrior to be the warrior that is easy to heal and who does not let his casters get beat up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yoarik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The warrior's Mantra:<br />
<br />
AC is God, HP's are saints.<br />
<br />
If my enemy hates me most, my friends will live.<br />
<br />
If my friends are alive, I will not die. <br />
<br />
Our job is to keep the target angry at us, and survive it. We survive it in two ways, minimize the damage done to us, and maximize the amount of damage we can take. <br />
<br />
The art of being a warrior comes in how you accomplish these basic tenets. It is possible to get to 50 not knowing this, but you won't get much farther than  that. <br />
<br />
Stamina is your key attribute, Sta&gt; than all other attributes. <br />
<br />
AC&gt; HP because not taking the damage is easier on your healer than taking the damage. <br />
<br />
Defensive AA's come first, because things like Finishing Blow and other damage enhancing AA's are the province of the Rogues and Rangers of the world. Real tanks take more damge than they dish out, we are relentless and armored and cannot be stopped.<br />
<br />
Taunting and Aggro come before offense. The exception is that you increase offense when it has a significant and direct bearing on aggro. The base damage of a weapon is a significant aggro factor. Punishing Blade adds to your 2H aggro by increasing the &quot;base damage&quot; of your weapon. Hastened Instigation is a great AA because it gives you a &quot;no fail&quot; taunt more often.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly it is our job to make fun of lesser plate wearing classes...  Just like it is the Shamans job to make fum of lesser chain wearing classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kronch Polarbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have a similar questions... but a little more specific.  <br />
<br />
What are our jobs on Raids?  <br />
<br />
Can anyone explain specifically each job warriors hold?  <br />
<br />
I'm new to raiding, and last night I was told to be Rampage Tank for a mob, three different people had three different explanations to what Rampage Tanks do...<br />
<br />
Also... how is tanking Raid Bosses different from plain tanking?  Do you pull and immediately go stonewall/defensive...<br />
<br />
I just reached level 65 last week, have been playing off and on since about Sep 2001, and I feel like quite the newb... please help me!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Now hold on just a darn minute. I wait 12 seconds? I only have 10 fingers, even counting my thumbs.</div></div><hr />

Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One foots, two foots, three fingar etc.  Some warriors like to start with the ears but far too many have had one bitten off at some point for this to be reliable in my opinion.  Most that I know like to let all the raid know that defensive has worn off shortly after the Loading, Please Wait... but you can hire a gnome to stand behind you counting if you think it will help.  They are also handy if you get hungry while the BBB is trying to kill you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naldaienea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As rampage tank, you're pretty much supposed to take the rampage that mobs do (not all rampage though) in some cases, but not in all, it also means you're the next tank in line if the main tank goes down.  Pretty much, you have to get on the hate list, and be the second one on there.  You have to be quick and pay attention the best you can, if you aren't paying attention and the main tank goes down, and the healers grab aggro, the whole raid has a good chance of wiping.  Hope that helped ya. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Number one job of all tanks is to manage incoming damage/aggro to the raid force.To do this well you have to coordinate efforts with your tank cadre and cc people.<br />
<br />
As an assist watch for incoming unmezzables to offtank and help knights lock down mezz targets  to  keep aggro off the skirts.Support the ma  by aiding with mob push and aggro slide(er this part takes alil experience and common sense,if in doubt don't aggro hard hitters your ma is on at all).Don't take damage at the wrong time and distract healers if possible.If you're next in the order,or,well things have gone to $%^ and your ma dies ...complete a decent tank switch as suggested above,ie:<br />
<br />
1) have good proximity and facing<br />
2) disc fortitude or furious<br />
3) ae taunt<br />
4) establish youself as the mt and  call for heals<br />
5) take over as ma until replaced<br />
<br />
* 2 - 4 work well on one hotkey<br />
<br />
As MA pick up  incoming targets quickly with an eye to mob pathing and raid position.Prioritize your targets and attempt to  position them well with the help of caster nukage and dps push.Your own group dynamics will play in how you communicate with your raid force defer to your raid leader if in doubt.Don't assume the chain is aware of hard hitters incoming and call for heals before you get splattered all over the priests.Stay aware of your range to chain and don't get pushed oor.Communicate di pops,rgc needs,discs in use, etc.before the lack of them kills you or unduly stresses the healers.Try to achieve a predictable position before enrage and do your best to lessen it's impact on the dps.Although,sometimes it's fun to spin the mob towards the pets....And er sometimes it helps to encourage people to do what they're already doing on the off chance they may be semi afk watching family guy.The latter of course is erm optional and may be subject to your raidleaders review.<br />
<br />
If you're desinated rt ,or, cough... self delagated communicate quickly with  the ma before the mob arrives so you can tag asap.Works best imo usually if rt tags,but, failing that you need to tag before anyone besides ma gets a spot on the hatelist.Communicate rampage to healers in a timely fashion.Don't wait until you're in pok watching #8 wizzy popping in from rampage tanking.If you're an assist,or, er slow typer like me make a,&quot;OMG I'M ON RAMPAGE HEAL ME!&quot;,hotkey now.Try not to spam it when you're just eating riposte.O and really the rt shouldn't be sa...tho thats often how it gos.<br />
<br />
Try to be situationally aware,or, er at least hit auto attack so no one notices you've gone for another soda.Like most stuff it's usually better/safer to stick hard to the basic rules in play until you understand them well.Then you can burn them...well until someone yells at you screwing #$% up.Tanking is kewl ...have fun! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Yethuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">IMO,<br />
<br />
MA = Main Assist ( assess the threat of incomming mobs and calls the raid force to kill the mobs in order of most dangerous to least dangerous &amp; is the person to break Mez's )<br />
<br />
SA = Second Assist ( Does the same thing if MA dies or is AFK or being  a moron)<br />
<br />
MT = Main Tank ( Tanks all the mobs the MA calls to die or the raid leader calls for)<br />
<br />
ST = Second Tank ( Does the same thing  if the MT dies or is AFK or being a moron)<br />
<br />
RT = Rampage Tank ( Should be first person to engage a mob to get on aggro list to take the Rampage damage from a mob and tries to keep agro up without getting agro from the MT * Does not become MT if MT dies the ST becomes MT if MT dies *)<br />
<br />
OT = Off Tank ( tanks any mob the Raid Leader calls for  or if the CC team screams OMG %T not messable SAVE ME :) )<br />
<br />
DPS = Too many warriors on the raid and ya dont have a job ( basically true  statement but  is good to stay awake and keep /shield for cleric or CC  and if the crude hits the fan  Area Taunt  then Furious till CC can get the situation under Control <br />
<br />
and Being a Moron is just if they might be wayyy lagging or possibly LD and just not shown up as LD or engrossed in tells or AFK and dint  mention anything not  simply ya dont like them and you think there stupid  :D<br />
