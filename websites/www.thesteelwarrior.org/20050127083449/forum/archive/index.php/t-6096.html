<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From all the reading I have done here the GSoT is the go to weapon for non raiding people like me and is good forever just about. I have read that it is good 65 unaugmented. I am working on EF for points but at 54 points are slow but keeping plugging at it. <br />
<br />
As for the CHoS and SotB I use both unaugmented and have litterly no problems keeping aggro and doing decent dmg. <br />
<br />
My normal group is my wife Cleric, and an ENC, SK, the last two are interchangeable but normally are a DRU, BST, WIZ, RNG any of two of those. The only time I have a problem with aggro is if taunt fails when the WIZ overnukes but I do not think anything will help that.<br />
<br />
I am also intrested in any upgrade information on these three weapons that are tradeable as I am never going to see the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CHoS/SotB combo is better for aggro, the reason the GSoT is so widely regarded as the best thing since sliced bread is the somewhat limited amount of 2h aggro weapons available, especially for casual non raiding folks, in tandem with the fact that especially early in PoP, before folks were geared up ripostes were pretty harsh.  That having been said, if ripostes are a problem for you, GSoT is the way to go.  If aggro is key, chos/sotb is stronger aggro.  Tradeable upgrades to these are going to be few and far between (there are a few, but they're ridiculously expensive), BoC and SoD are the only two I can think of off the top of my head; some of the new GoD smithed items look decent though, will have to wait and see on those.</div></div><hr />
