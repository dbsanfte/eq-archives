What I mean is, what's the safety margin if you have to eat a no-rezz death?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its about 6% before you can eat a no rez death.  Safety depends on your preference.  I only have about 10% and keep it that way when it dips too low.  Some people like a larger buffer though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like 15% or so incase I die 2 times and can't rez right away.</div></div><hr />

Me and all my friends did that, and one is already 100% into 65.  I'm only about a yellow or so in, but I've ate a few no-rez deaths.  90% AA &gt; ALL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm at like 14%...but i at least one one full orange tho for those chain death events and whatnot.<br />
<br />
but 7% is safe to remain at 65 with dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went 10% then, then switched to 100% aa. If I go back to 9% when I get rezzed, I just turn off AA for 1 kill to get it back up to 10% then go back 100% AA.<br />
<br />
Imo, going 90% or any other fraction, you're just delaying both. 100% AA &gt; ALL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With LDoN though I find that its better to have a larger xp buffer especially if you like to do missions without clerics or pallies.  If you die 2-3x with only a 10% rez buffer you have to finish the mission at level 64 until you can rez after the corpses pop out.</div></div><hr />

I just keep it at 90% and let it ride. I'm at like 68% into 65 now.... I can eat a couple of deaths haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lose exactly 6% XP for a death, so anything under 6% and Im level 64 again.<br />
<br />
When I get down to 5% I go back to reg XP and get it back up to 8% which makes me safe for another 10 deaths or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would get at least one yellow to be safe. then make sure every time u die you swop back for a bit to full exp to top it up.</div></div><hr />

I'm not in a raid guild, so there are times I go weeks without dying.  Why waste the XP?</div></div><hr />

I am also not in a raid guild atm, but there are times when the $hit hits the fan in LDoN. I am doing 50/50 until I get 3 blues, then going 100% aa.<br />
Thanks to all who responded.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onian</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah but if you went 10% exp when it came time for them to jack lvl limit to 70 ..... like its not going to happen ..... youll be that much closer to 66 ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are in a raid guild, just keep 100% exp on during raids, if you don't die much you will get a nice buffer, if you die a lot, you will at lteast keep your buffer.<br />
<br />
If you don't raid much, 6% is all you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3% 4 eva.  Gotta love dinging 5 times a night on raids :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take a goal orientated approach.<br />
<br />
I set a goal as for what AA to get, and set myself to 100% XP until I reach 20%, then I switch to 100% AA until I reach that goal.  At which point I set a new goal and go to 20% normal.  Usually I lose about 10% of 65 beween goals =/  <br />
<br />
I'm at 13% in right now and got 24 more AA to go before this goal is done so I really need to just grind instead of doing LDON adventures :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kept 20% into 65 for a long time. Got sick of getting close to undinging again.  Keep up 100% into 65 all the time now. If i die and eat a rez its no big deal anymore.  aa's are easy to come by, did full exp into 65 in a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am another 10% advocate, yeah yeah I could get a AA a touch closer every so often but it is minute diff when exping. It feels good to see both bars moving even when die in raids. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep it full as well, then again not like I need more AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bjarki_bearskin</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just over 28% into 65 which is just fine for me.  I don't even go below a yellow on a death and I am doing 100% AA now.<br />
<br />
I played with theory that every time I exp'ed I would do a blue and thought about getting 2.5 yellows, but then I just decided to go 100% AA from the point I hit 7 blues.<br />
<br />
Edit: My reasoning eventually was that if they raise the levels again, I would be that much closer.  I wasn't 60 when they upped the levels to 65, but I heard that people who had it full were penalized down to 1/2 of the full 5 yellows so they wouldn't ding immediately.  So, I played around with the idea of getting 50% and stopping there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grobsmashprexus</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5% for me.  I normaly do not lose my level when I die unless I am at like 5.1% but my wife is a epic cleric so I am not to concerned about it, if I need a res I just log her in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SiliniusMT</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im currently in a guild thats completed PoTime.  I eat a death a week or so and generally on gods within Time I manage to run back into the fight.. loot most of my gear without rez and get buffs just so I can tank again if needbe. I would say minimum for a raiding guild tank should be around 25 percent in for those just in case moments. <br />
<br />
Then go 100 percent aa exp for a few weeks.. if you raid enough you will get down to about 15 percent.. then get back up to 25 and switch back.. <br />
<br />
If you arent in a raiding guild.. go with 12 percent in and you will be fine. <br />

I usually keep it at around 19% and turn off AA exp during raids which helps keep it there.</div></div><hr />
