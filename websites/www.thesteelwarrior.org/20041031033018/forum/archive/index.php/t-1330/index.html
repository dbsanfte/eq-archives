<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">any guild regularily kill this guy? we got him down to 5% one time but normally hes like the last mob you clear in zone so numbers start to fall off. maybe im missing something but unless you just have an unholy amount of dps, the mana drain puts clerics out before we can bag him. dispelling the effect helps some, but isnt reliable. im actually pretty sure we can get him if its not late but just seems like a rediculous encounter. hate skipping a loot dropper, but im guessing most guilds let this guy sit, yet to find fennin script up, hopefully its not as insane as this guy hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on man ... we have it on good authority that, due to KEI-FT-Bard songs, Clerics NEVER run OOM.<br />
<br />
Obviously you need a couple more Cleric bots in the CH rotation.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
I apologize for the lack of actually relevant content.  This post just highlighted a recent thread in which this topic came up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if we did him early in the day, we could probably have a set of spare clerics outside of ae and run in when the others go oom, if it was a good turnout. no encounter should take this many clerics though heh. maybe im missing something and someone knows some trick = )<br />
<br />
i plan on killing him, we are starting to kill the other minis faster so hopefully we can burn through them and still have good numbers for this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AMF is by far the hardest mob in Fire. The last 2 times we have done Fennin, we did AMF right after. Both times flawless Fennin kills, both times wipe to AMF first try with the same raid force.<br />
<br />
DPS helps a lot, but in this case you want as much melee DPS as possible. You also want to minimize the amount of mana loss your healers have. You might as well not buff healers or nukers. If they get caught in the AE, they need to be able to dispell on the first shot. It's been my experience that the AE effect usually gets dispelled after a few buffs, so each cast is wasted time and mana. Not like buffs are going to save a caster or priest if they get agro anyway.<br />
<br />
The other thing that seems to help a ton is to avoid the first AE. IIRC the AE is on a 1 minute timer so if you find a way to keep your casters out of range the first time the AE goes off, you have bought yourself quite a bit of time without having to worry about mana.<br />
<br />
And way to take opposing arguements completely out of context Dintorr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And you completely ignore the fact that I plainly stated that clerics can have infinite mana unbuffed by just having enough clerics in the cheal rotation. When you figure in specilization and spell casting mastery 3, complete heal only uses up around 240 mana per cast. At an unbuffed and without FT mana regen rate fo 26 mana/tick it only takes a little over 9 ticks to regen all the mana they used casting. With 15 clerics a 3 second rotation would have infinite mana with absolutely no buffs. Mana regen is not the problem<br />
<br />
It's not taken out of context, you're just too big of an idiot to recognize the DIRECT relevance to the very point you're arguing AGAINST.<br />
<br />
1ludor, sorry to hijack your thread like this bro.  Hopefully Wandor was able to answer your question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hardest mob in fire?<br />
<br />
Sounds like you need to look at how you're doing it, because with a normal raid force, we destroy arch mage flawlessly more often than not.<br />
<br />
More DPS obviously helps, but really mana should not be an issue and if it is, you need to look at ways to fix that.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine more people would leave up Blazzax or Reparm, we happen to kill whatever though.  I would rate arch mage up there above say magmaton, pyronis, quavonis as far as difficulty goes, but still not that tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe i posted cause i ran out of ideas lol, saying we need &quot;figure it out&quot; doesnt help = )<br />
<br />
the only ways i know to get around the ae(300 range) mana dot is have a set of spare clerics sit outside of ae, someone dispelling clerics, and like the above poster said, try to get him to ae one time before engaging. it still requires a ton of dps though, we can do it and im sure we will on a good night, but its no walk in the park by any means. i wouldnt even mention some of the minis in the same breath as this guy hehe.<br />
<br />
i think we managed to down blazzax with 45 one time with maybe 1 tank death and mana was tight at the end, i know we couldnt do that on arch mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm in the same guild as Ludor - we've killed blazzax with like 48-49 the other night &amp; last time we killed him I think only like 2 people died - I dont consider him hard at all anymore, we bat around .500 on reparm as well...yet we have failed to magi like three times with 60+...I hate this fooking guy!  I think we got him next time np (combination of tactics from our attempt where we got him to like 2% along with last nights trip to 20% or so should do it).<br />
<br />
And Dintorr, &quot;Come on man ... we have it on good authority that, due to KEI-FT-Bard songs, Clerics NEVER run OOM.&quot; IS TRUE...unless you are fighting a mob that cast an ae dot every 60 seconds that has a 300 range that drains 250 mana a tick &amp; is not resistable.  Mana regen capabilites with lvl 65 buffs + bard + decent gear is obscene, especially when combined with scm3.  I play a cleric as my main now &amp; with ft14+mc1+c5+pot9+emp shoulders+bard song I can chain cast ch for ridiculously long periods of time without going oom &amp; I refuse to use a horse...theres hella lotta clerics more ubah than I with like 1k+ more mana than what I have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its not that hard, seems you had the right idea just stick with it.<br />
<br />
5-6 cleric CH rot and assign a dispeller for each cleric in rotation, enchanters preferably, although everyone with annul magic can do it semi reliably as well, or if you have farmed AHR, people with  the dispel clicker from there.<br />
<br />
All other casters just mem annul magic and dispels themselves as needed.<br />
<br />
Last kill I was botting a cleric and kept myself dot-free pretty much(wasnt in rotation though). None of the AEs that kill took more than 2 annuls and most just 1. Notice the 5 sec cast on that AE makes it easy to time dispels for minimum exposure to the DOT:<br />

[Thu Jun 12 20:40:06 2003] You have been struck by a disjunction of flame.<br />
[Thu Jun 12 20:40:07 2003] You feel annulled.</div></div><hr />

You sir are a fucking moron. You should not comment on things you don't know about because it makes you look like even more of an ass than you really are. Gallerus summed up why your statement is assinine, no need to rehash it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">think outside the box</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thanks for the spell tip timmok, probably help the most watching for the spell being cast.<br />
<br />
&quot;think outside the box&quot; - gee, do we feel clevah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes the &quot;box&quot; does block the AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We kill him regularly with little problem, its actually one of the more entertaining fights the way we do it. Think creatively and you will take him down easily, and have a laugh while you do it.<br />
<br />
A little hint though to make it easier, the Ae is interruptable. Fight accordingly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry Iskandar, it won't happen again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We wiped I think once trying to figure out the AM. Now, he is pretty trivial and like Coray we get him flawlessly each time now. I think he is far from the hardest mob in fire once you figure him out...like most mobs. If you want to talk hard... lets talk Ofossaa, that encounter is just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">mana drain debuff is dispellable...make sure it lands up top and have enchs or bards used fixed top 4/fixed top 2 dispells accordingly.<br />

According to this, it's not interruptable.</div></div><hr />
