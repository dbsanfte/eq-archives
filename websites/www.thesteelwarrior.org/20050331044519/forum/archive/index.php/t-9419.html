I have mostly been doing adventures for exp, and doing DSP when i cna't find an adventure. So, i was wondering whether these locations will work for me, or if i need a new spot...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you hit 46 head to PoJustice to lfg for sure ... but prior to that you might want to hit up LDoN or some oldschool zone like solb.  Post-50, if you ever get tired of LDoN and PoP groups, Sol-C (the pocket zone off Sol-B) is actually rather nice 55-62 xp, and has some very nice drops off random named on PH systems.<br />
<br />
Droga and Nurga are also hot xp spots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that an underappreciated aspect of leveling efficiently via groups is to show up at about the same time in the same place as regularly as you can, particularly if you are doing pick-up groups. If you do that in a fairly popular pick-up zone, you'll end up grouping with the same people who are generally leveling in that zone, so they'll get to know and trust you, and these same folks will be outgrowing the zone about the same time you do, so you can see 'em in the next zone.<br />
Unless of course people who have grouped with you before are *less* likely to want to group with you than people who don't know you. In that case, you need to move around fairly frequently. :p</div></div><hr />

Solo and slightly twinked; CoM I get the stuffing pounded out of me; plus nurga has too many casters. Since you got a mage to watch ya you could prob make a killing in CoM. hit up the stables and you should be okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 37 I brought a shaman partner to play in Rathe mountains.  Because he was a few levels higher than me (40) He already had some good buffs as well as slow.  He would generally pull a HG to where I was sitting, slow it, and go off for another one to pull back.  I could usually get through a full one before needing a heal and with my uber Wurmslayer I took them down quick (hah!).  The best thing about this camp is that it usually wields a large amount of cash for low level toons to get some good upgrades with.<br />
<br />
After the HG's started to go LB I headed off to the Dreadlands.  If you can find a duo partner I highly recommend the skelly pyramid to the far west.  They don't add if you pull them out, give great exp, and some small change and words.  If you can't find a good duo partner or the pyramid is camped try and get a group at one of the ruins there.  A year ago the place was still busy with about 20 or so people there, and I still leveled with my new necro there a few months ago.<br />
<br />
Just play at some peak times and the exp zones should be full enough to get a group sometime.</div></div><hr />
