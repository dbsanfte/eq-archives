I currently have about 4k in the bank and am slowing doing LDoNs to build on this amount and get me some more ADV points.<br />
<br />
Im working my last AA for RS3 atm and them will be lvling to 55 and working on ND. So im looking for some suggestions for mid 55 to 60 gear.<br />
<br />

Your damage bonus in your primary hand means you want to get as fast as possible weapon in your primary hand.  You'd be much better off with the architects scepter in your primary hand and lightblade in offhand.  Or better yet, get a copper hammer of striking or sword of the bloodsworn for your primary and keep the scepter in your offhand or offhand the lightblade if you prefer.  A nice fast primary hand weapon with a good proc will improve your damage and aggro.<br />

Get some haste!  At least get an FBSS...  or get SCHW or even a Bloodguard soul ring.</div></div><hr />
