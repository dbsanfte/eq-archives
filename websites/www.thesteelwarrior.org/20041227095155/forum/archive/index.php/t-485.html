<br />
So I was supposed to catch MMs rampage and shoot several arrows in his head ! but did not manage to secure ramp.<br />
<br />
Normally there isnt big problems setting ramp, but during this fight, both our first where we wiped and the second where we won hey !, Ramp wasnt set.<br />
<br />
I dont have any good explenation why it didnt work or maybe PoP rampage is working differently from what I thought or maybe my bow is bugged or something. Hell at least we won the fight so we will try again of course and I will once again work on that ramp !<br />
<br />
Just wanted to post here to see if others have had similar problems with MM? and if so had some inputs =)<br />
<br />

He ate 10 wars in about 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
The usual procedure didnt work it seems.<br />
<br />
Oh well just let every rampaged person die, until you are on<br />
someone that has a chance to actually survive. (plate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danathor</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we killed him, we would position him in the corner on top of the big fire pot thing and he didn't seem to be rampaging anyone, almost like it was fake.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karthunk</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't even really set rampage up on him. Just have all your plate tanks fire an arrow on inc and then have them call when rampage is on them. He doesn't rampage like a mad man, so it should be fairly easy to heal a rampage tank if they call it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah, its hard to set, my best guess is everyone has agro because he almost sees the whole room as soon as hes down the steps. if he rampages before you can move up the list on agro, its too late.<br />
<br />
he doesnt rampage much like ppl said, but u do want all the plate ppl shooting arrows on inc so he doesnt eat clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mith Marr has the same bug that many other PoP mobs have (such as everything in earth).<br />
<br />
Rampage actually = Flurry, and Flurry actually = Rampage.<br />
<br />
Mith Marr's rampage is actually a flurry that for some reason gets reported as a rampage.</div></div><hr />
