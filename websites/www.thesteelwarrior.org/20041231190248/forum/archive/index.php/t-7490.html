<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I read through the various EQ boards, and MB strikes me as one in particular, I've been noticing a LOT of the signatures include a screen shot from CoH these days, and not from EQ.  I know that if I was someone associated with SoE and I was browsing the various boards this would really start to concern me.  Typically people include in their signature the character they most associate with or are the most proud of, and it seems EQ sigs are becoming a minority.  Am I the only one to see this?</div></div><hr />

ahh okay...that makes more sense :D i don't do much EZkrapboard so the acronym slipped my mind.<br />
<br />
but yeah, i took a peek and there's a bunch of CoHers there. It's funny when gamers play a game that's fun and share in it's fun :D. reading through their CoH forums is kind of like a breath of fresh air; no stupid rants, parsings, uber bullkrap nonsense. just people enjoying themselves.<br />
<br />
like here :D</div></div><hr />

Sad as it to say that about monks. Heh.<br />

<br />
I know 6 people playing CoH, and as of this moment, they say they are not considering leaving EQ.<br />
<br />
I play EQ because there isn't any other game coming or available that provides the game play I want/need including WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must not be looking very hard then.   And if you aren't interested in CoH why bother reading/posting in the CoH forum?  Puzzling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's funny; any type of angst is taken so lightly when it's in this CoH forum.<br />
it's like people need to rile others up because there's no h8 here. well, not stupid 'my dick's bigger than yours' angst and 'coh sucks eq is teh win' absurdity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't have as much time for chatting (and so, angstificating) in this wing ... there isn't enough downtime for us to be do a whole lot of venting on the boards.  I'd long felt as though at least 1/3 of my time logged into EQ was spent Alt + TABBED to my browser window, but CoH doesn't give that 40 minutes of hurry-up-and-wait time between activities.  I'm fallin' behind on my post spammage!<br />
<br />
As far as the seeing/not seeing SS and sigs goes, it depends where you look.  Some boards are chock full of 'em (not including the obviously .sig deluged CoH boards), some have nary a sign of 'em.  I know a few on CoH that are keeping they're EQ accounts alive, too.  But they're on CoH 6 nights outta 7 lately *hehe* ...</div></div><hr />

/shrug I think its pretty clear that whether or not COH people are cancelling their EQ accounts, SOMEONE sure as hell is.  That is the only explanation for the incredibly timely &quot;communication&quot; between SOE and its players and between the devs and the higher ups.  Clearly SOE is losing accounts.  Some of those are from COH and some of those are from people playing other games and some of those are from people who are just fed up and haven't even picked an alternative addiction.<br />
<br />
Personally, I cancelled my account.  So you can add me to your list and its 7 now.  :p <br />
<br />
In terms of gameplay, maybe you are a player who hasnt' yet made the end game or maybe you recently made the endgame.  But I think its pretty safe to say that a lot of people who have made the end game and have been there for a while no longer feel the &quot;game play&quot; is worth the hassle.  The &quot;game play&quot; is nothing but repetitiveness and angst.  That is probalby because the end-game crowd loved EQ the most and are now the most disappointed.  /shrug  All I can say is enjoy it while you can.</div></div><hr />
