<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashemz</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that Spirit of Rage is used as an Agro modifier, but i was curious as to when the right time to use it is.  Are you suppose to use it before you hit incite, or is it used to modify the agro on procs like EB and Anger?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragan</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think I've ever used it more than once. It seems to me the best time to use it would be at the beginning of a fight where aggro is usually most sketchy and critical due to debuffs. <br />
<br />
However as I recall it Spirit of Rage drains so much endurance and has a reuse timer that makes it not suitable for trash/XP mobs, only for bosses. At the beginning of boss fights I'd prefer spending endurance on Furious/Fortitude instead, so I guess my answer for when to you use it would be &quot;never&quot;, unless I have missed something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, I have used spirit of rage after defensive wore off, or on weak mobs like VT bosses where I don't bother with defensive.  It's not really needed in either of these situations though, and in almost any situation where it would be useful, you will probably need to use fortitude or Defensive/evasive/stonewall.  More or less useless disc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never use it.  It drains a huge amount of endurance and the reuse time is too long.  I'd much rather spend that endurance on half a dozen incites on the mob instead. The effects last longer and you are more under control of when you need that burst aggro hit.  Plus you can incite while running another disc at the same time also.<br />

No brainer really.  Spirit of Rage is useless.</div></div><hr />
