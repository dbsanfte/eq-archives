<br />
I decided to give eq another whirl after having a friend tell me that ldon was actually quite fun...  <br />
<br />
So i guess my main questions are (and im sorry if the answer is scattered in many previous posts, my searches turned up blank)<br />
<br />
Whats the main difference?   PoPl, yekesha, Ldon and gates are all new to me...I have an old 51 wood elf warrior... thats nekkid... (i gave all my stuff away when i quit incase my chars got wiped)  of all the gear i gave away, the only thing I can retrieve is a fungi that I would have to sell to reoutfitt my warrior.<br />
<br />
What are tomes?  I thought i read somewhere about new disciplines for taunting?  I remember i couldnt hold taunt for crap... which was one of the reasons I quit.. are we better at it now?   I think i understand the the vigor/endurance change... instead of timers for disciplines now we lose endurance?<br />
<br />
Are any techniques different?  before we assisted the puller and took aggro.. then stayed on it till dead, then moved to the next mezzed mob...  (im kind of talking myself out of this as i write it so im going to stop  :eek:  )<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help... also in the event that starting my warrior back up may be a mistake, feel free to let me know that too  :D</div></div><hr />

Yes we have new combat abilities for agro starting at lvl 20 with provoke. The upgrade to provoke isn't until 52 w/ bellow. You can buy tomes in the PoK library or the EC tunnel (voris flatblade is the merch he is along the wall near the adventure camp). <br />
<br />
Just turn the purchased tome into a warrior guild trainer to be able to use the skill. Alt + C opens up your combat abilities window listing which ones you can use.<br />
<br />
The fungi should be able to get you enough cash to buy some decent gear they sell for around 100k on my server usually. It can vary....</div></div><hr />
