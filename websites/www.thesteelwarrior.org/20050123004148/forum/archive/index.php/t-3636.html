I want to augment 1 of these with the Anger III, and the Pristine Emerald of Harm (+2 dmg).  wt on the club is 1.0 iirc.  I am leaning toward the club but wanted to make sure that is the correct choice before I blow all these points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. The weapons augmented are basically a wash<br />
2. That I want to open the MiR tree first anyway (+def aug, anger and club all in that tree)<br />
3. It seems easier to get MiR groups together than D Guk<br />
<br />
I havent seen a screen shot of either...that may play into the decision process as well.</div></div><hr />

Unless he forgot to put some stats in for the club, sword has more ac. I would go with the sword if you plan to make this your primary handed weapon, if you're going for offhand, get the club.</div></div><hr />

Pristine Emerald of Harm<br />
Dmg:2, Restrictions:1hWeapon,MinimumDelay16 <br />

Can't put that on either weapon.<br />
<br />
Try this though:<br />

Ruj 340 Aug6 Freezing Nickel Fragment<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zuwar</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I missing somthing?  Both are 1H weapons and have delays greater than 16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, I searched for all weapons with type6 slot with a min delay of 16 and I found ....<br />
<br />
none<br />
<br />
Am I understanding the aug correctly?<br />
<br />
Pristine Emerald of Harm<br />
Dmg:2, Restrictions:1hWeapon,MinimumDelay16 <br />
<br />
The min delay that this aug can go in is delay 16.  Or does this mean the delay must be over 16 and not less than?<br />
<br />
O my, I've confused myself (<br />
<br />
If its possible to add a Pristine Emerald of Harm to a Malevolent Dirk of Deception that would make a 16/19 rogue backstabber with +9%.  That seems pretty insane for the low cost of 2300 ap's<br />
<br />
...hmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It means you can't add it to a weapon with less than 16 delay. I put it in the Malevolent Dirk of Deception myself. It is definately a great value for the points spent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Min delay 16 means that the delay of the weapon must be greater than or equal to 16, both of these weapons fall into this category.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I would go with the club, 17/20 &gt; 16/19 (barely but it is better).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which one looks cooler?  that ones has my vote /duck<br />

Then again, I always have been kinda superficial.</div></div><hr />

Yet you chose to be an ogre. <br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radalas</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why wouldnt you want the 14/19 weapon for offhand also?  Stat wise the blade looks to be a much better buy overall for offhand or primary.<br />
<br />
Looking for more input on why the someone would choose club over the blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The formula is 2Xdamage plus 1Xbonus all divided by the delay, higher numbers are better.<br />
<br />
The 14/19 is the clear winner here, and has the 8AC to boot.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage formula is a bit more complicated than that.<br />
<br />
DPS calculator (http://www.geocities.com/luthairsite/weaponCalc.html)<br />
<br />
15/20 &gt; 14/19 and 17/20 &gt; 16/19</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna have to dispute that.... <br />
<br />
My formula is the correct one and 19del/14 damge is better than 20del/15 damage<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Existing formulae for weapon damage are by no means correct in all circumstances. They're decent yardsticks but you shouldn't rely on them - parses and a general &quot;feel&quot; ya get from experience with weaponry are far better.<br />
<br />
Eoden is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is not that forumla backed up with parsing? We come up with a formula and then say that &quot;feel&quot; is better... <br />
<br />
Clearly DPS is related to damage and delay, it does not seem such a streach to conclude and there is a formula that relates DPS to damage and delay...  Sure there are spicliazed situations where one would be better then the toher but seems the forumla is a good general yardstick, and you cna't just get a waepon for spicial situational usage (well unless you hwat ot have a lot of weapons). .... <br />
<br />
Well I gonna stick with forumula until someone has data to show otherwise.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do that, but I'd listen to Isk, he knows a lot more about warriors than you do. You can't always go off of formulas. The best way to figure it out is to parse out the 2 weps; but, since this isnt a perfect world and no one can always have a 14-19 and a 15-20 wep at their disposal, we came up with *rough* formulas. 1dmg will make a lot more difference than 1 dly on a weapon with its dps. <br />
<br />
again, Eoden is correct. <br />
<br />
Rough</div></div><hr />
