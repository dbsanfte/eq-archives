<br />
I’m looking for a new updated list of all the various warrior /disc’s with effects, timers, etc.  <br />
<br />
Now that we have the Bellow line, plus other new ones I’m looking for a complete list with all of their effects and maybe some data on their effects in practice. When is using the bellow line most effective.<br />
<br />
I know the offensive ones are mostly toys, but I’d be curious to hear about their actual increase in DPS, when is the best time to use each, etc..  It also would be helpful to learn some of the tricks that have been discovered regarding disc usage.<br />
<br />
I did check the SW Library prior to posting, but only found the old information from back when discs had a single connected timer.<br />
<br />
Any and all info/links appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, open your combat window and hit the S button.  That wil give you stamina cost, duration and refresh timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as tricks, the best one I've seen is just being able to use the offensive discs without fear of needing defensive to be up sometime in the next hour and not having it.  Also, furious in the first few seconds of engagement on a raid mob, followed immediately by either evasive or defensive depending on the mob, is really  nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trong</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK,<br />
<br />
I have the discs and focus of will. But just where do you find the rest of the stuff like rage, shield, power slam, cover, cripling strike....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure thats stuff from the openings system which isn't going to be implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't...  Those were part of the now defunct opening system.  Time will tell what, if anything, replaces them.  Well, not really replaces, I guess, since it never went live, but would be neat to get some more abilities since we were supposed to get these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StaboCA</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the answers.<br />
<br />
I've seen some threads on this board talking about using Furious before Defensive on raid mobs.  Is that becoming the norm?<br />
<br />
And what about the bellow line? Is it better to throw out a bellow before/after hitting furious to move even further up in Hate. I understand you can't move further up the list if you're already at the top, but with bellow I'm generating more &quot;hate points&quot; so won't it be even more unlikely that the casters pull aggro off if I'm bellowing ??<br />
<br />
I'd also love some feedback on which offensive discs people find most useful?  And in what situations?  ( I understand the offensive disks aren't that great, but some have to be better than others, and maybe even are useful in the right situation...)<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as offensive discs:<br />
<br />
I use fellstrike when I'm using 2h weapons because it greatly ups my DPS. It's especially good when trying to kill a mob that's about to gate or an unsnared mob that is running.<br />
<br />
Agressive is good if you aren't tanking and want to add to the DPS of the fight.<br />
<br />
Precision - I don't use this one very much, I should try it out more and see where it works good.<br />
<br />
Charge - I use fellstrike instead<br />
<br />
Mightystrike - Good for stunning a mob if you are berzerk (only if mob is stunnable). Otherwise I just use it to show off.</div></div><hr />
