Not one person said  Warrior.  WTF I guess we have no use anymore except tanking boss mobs, no wonder i sit for hours in POT looking for a group. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found your mistake:<br />
<br />
First mistake: &quot;I just read a thread on caster realms&quot; <br />
<br />
That's a newbie mistake. Will let that slide. Just remember in the future, that &quot;I just read a thread on caster realms&quot; is almost equivalent to posting on Allakhazam's that item_01 is obviously monk loot.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Second Mistake: &quot;and people were listing the most useful class in groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lists.<br />
<br />
They're always silly.<br />
<br />
So, you've got a bunch of casters realm people coming up with a list of most useful classes in a group?<br />
<br />
Hijinx are bound to ensue.<br />
<br />
Have a beer, grab a pretzel if you can and chuckle at the robe wearing sissies as they debate group makeups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sarcasm on<br />
think about it for a sec gnomer..what do you bring to a group in terms of utility? :D not too much huh. <br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
castin' types gots too much int and wis and they like to ponder over the minute details; hence that &quot;list&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Wu on this one.  Casters realm posts = worthless.  Imo, every class has it's place... it's just some classes (like warriors) have had their places gradually taken from them.  We're still useful for some stuff, but not near what we should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I wouldn't spend too much time reading the general board at Newbie Realm if you don't want to get hot under the collar.  <br />
<br />
The warrior board used to be pretty good...still is decent but not too many people post there anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to get all my spell info from Castersrealm (when I was a skirt wearing sissy anyway) Back before Lucy, they were pretty darn good. Poor Baelish, I think his dream has kinda died. They were always pretty good though for posting the latest news...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Castersrealm...I consulted them when I was starting out in the game, and as a result, I put my points at startup mostly in strength, and went agnostic...for those crimes they will never be forgiven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shudder... Casters Realm is good for posting the latest news? I haven't been around lately, but Casters Realm, to me, was just reposting the news from the Sony website. I stopped going to casters realm for news.... well... probably before Luclin was released, so maybe it's changed. I check Sony, Mobhunter, and here mostly.<br />
<br />
I used to check CR's Warrior forums back when these forums were deader, but now I hit here. IMO, CR's general forums has a very low singal to noice ratio, and the forum was not designed for warriors.<br />
<br />
As for CR's spell information... I used to look at them a lot, but when mages got focus items (I was taking a beak from my warrior at the time and playing my mage alt a lot) I sent several updates correcting him on what the mage focus effects did. As far as I know, they are STILL wrong. So I use Lucy, and take that with a grain of salt, although not a large one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me qualify my statement regarding Castersrealm and news posting: Back when I first started (Dec 2000) I didn't know of a lot of good sites for info on EQ, I mean, my home was Everlore for a long time just so I could see pictures of those big bad mobs that I would never see... (read: A burly Gnoll, A Giant Snake, Etc.) The EQ main site at that time loaded too slowly for me, and when I could get the same info from Castersrealm alot faster, plus Baelish's comments on the same (which at the time to me Enchanter's were gods and the players behind the toons were Genius') this was a much better scenario for me.<br />
<br />
So when I say that I always have thought that Castersrealm was a good source for news info, this is why. I think the same fate has befallen Castersrealm that has hit Everlore: Lack of updates. When studious attention to detail is lost, all credibility and usefulness goes with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the big negatives about casters realm (other than it's boards are populated primarily by people who have a hard time with thought processes), is that their spell info is incorrect quite often, and it's newbie guides are wrong.  Lucy.fnord.net as always been accurate as far as I can tell, them and magelo are good sources of info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey donnel ask Iskandar about them burly gnolls  /ducks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first time I ever DID see those Burly's I was carrying around a little drum expecting to hit them with that.... (Yes, I was a Half Elf Bard from Qeynos) Some Uber level 10 guy took me up to the pit area where Lord Elgnub spawns and got me killed (Yes I'm sure it was all his fault even though I sang the AoE Song and agrod everything there). Course back then you had to go find your corpse, and since I had no earthly idea where I was in that place (I figured we were so deep in I would never find my corpse...) I just deleted the character. <br />
<br />
/sigh Darn you a Burly Gnoll, you've won this time, but I will get my revenge!</div></div><hr />
