<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maemai</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ages ago I had tested the Hundred Hands effect from Hundred Fists Discipline monks got in Kunark. Hundred Fist Discipline was recently updated for monks in the melee fix and monks also got a new discipline called Speed Focus. Both of these use the Hundred Hand Effect. Last night I went and tested both of these monk disciplines with my lvl 65 monk. I was wrong before in how I thought it worked. I am very happy to find out it is much more powerful!!!<br />

<br />
It gets confusing, but what I took from it all was that it's like going exponential. So Speed Focus is pretty impressive when over-hasted.</div></div><hr />
