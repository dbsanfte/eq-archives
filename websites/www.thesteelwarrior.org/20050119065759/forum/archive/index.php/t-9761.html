My understanding is combat effects on an item of +10 is equivalent to one level of the AA that increases proc rate by 10%--is that correct?  My real question is how far does this stack for multple items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does stack on items... but I'm not sure to what extent.. I'm sure there is a cap but I dunno what it is.  I don't think it's been parsed, if it has I've missed it.  I would assume it would be around the 35+ area.</div></div><hr />

Will keep looking.  Unfortunately, Combat effects isn't that common, and usually gets passed over for shielding/avoidance etc, so there's probably noone with more then 35 atm.  I have a hard time believing it is hard capped, since accuracy/avoidance are not.<br />
Someone help me out here with a link to that parse ;)</div></div><hr />

You sure about that? I've never seen any official statement or evidence of a hard cap for accuracy (nor avoidance nor combat effects), but I've also never seen any official statement or evidence of no cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weapon Affinity and Combat Effects Parses (lots of data)  (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5656)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, there has been no official statement regarding either of these effects.  I can say that avoidance is still stacking at +65.  The most Accuracy I've seen parsed was 25, but I'm sure there's people with lots more now.<br />

P.S. Cheers Bargran, that's what I was referring to!</div></div><hr />
