With 2 healers (priest/shm), it is a COLOSSAL WASTE OF TIME, efficiency goes out the window, take my word on it.<br />
<br />
Prot spec is the ONLY way to go for instances (i mean the last 4 instance not the early trash ones).  Offense tank later becomes an offtanker (which you don't need) or tank #2 in 2nd group (for those who can't handle it so they raid it).  Sure people will give the we raid cause it's a pain in the ass clearing the trash yadi yada,  when they mean to say 'we get tired of getting pwned every time as 5man so we gave up'.  My group now clears lbrs in about 60~70min when it used to take us more like 120~150.  I am still a firm believer of doing the 1 group instances like it was designed to be as 1 group.  Sure the early road is rough but it teaches people fuking skills on how to react fast when shit hits the fan and teaches the instances as to what we can avoid (no need to clear ALL the trash along the way) whereas a raid zergfest teaches nothing cept that numbers win in an instanced designed for 5 people.  The end result?  A dedicated team of 5 who learn all the instances becomes much better players overall in terms of quick judgement and reaction speed, not to mention they have much much better gear then your zergfest joe.  This is not for everyone though as our guild strive for challenge and perfection.</div></div><hr />

You may be able to tank an instance effectively without a protection build, however, you will never tank as well as someone who is (just as a protection build will never do damage as well as an arms build).  That's why we have skill tree options.<br />
<br />
I keep hearing mixed reviews on prot spec being required in the end game.  If it is to stay true to the &quot;spirit&quot; of talents then prot spec wouldnt be required.<br />
<br />
I see those mixed reviews, and the folks usually posting them are arms spec people.  I think you have the &quot;spirit&quot; of the talent system backwards.  If a warrior can do everything, from damage to raid boss tanking, regardless of how he is spec'd, what's the purpose of having a talent system?  It has been pretty  common knowledge since beta that the high-end instances were designed assuming a group would have a protection spec warrior and a strong healer (generally a holy spec priest).<br />
<br />
I too would like to know what exactly Krun found that was causing efficiency to go out the window.  Aggro? Survivablity? Something else?<br />
<br />
I can't speak for Krun, but I can speak for my experience in Marudon/Zul Farrak/Temple of Atal'Hakkar.  I think the word is efficiency.  <br />
<br />
In an instance the goal is to maximize kill rate while minimizing risk.  Kill rate is not determined by how quickly your group kills a single mob or cluster of mobs, but rather by how many mobs you have to kill before you have downtime to sit and drink.  Usually the one person in the group who's mana determines this is the priest.<br />
<br />
A protection spec tank boosts group efficiency by soaking up damage more effectively and by controling agro more reliably.  Better mitigation = less heals needed on the warrior.  More agro control = less emergency heals tossed on the DPS classes, or less chance of the priest getting mobbed.<br />
<br />
The low hanging fruit in protection spec can help with this -- shield spec, toughness, maybe anticipation.   The better skills, however are higher up in the tree.  Defiance, improved revenge, concussive blow (yes many bosses are immune, but you have to clear a dungeon to get to the bosses).<br />
<br />
I've not done the highest instances yet, but I have done runs where I was main tank (protection spec) and others where a higher level arms-spec was main tank.  My regular priest could surely tell a difference (and now she insists I tank regardless of who else we have in the group).  <br />
<br />
It isn't a question of whether an arms-spec warrior CAN tank these zones.  It is a question of how do you maximize the efficiency of a group, and in general that is better served by soaking up damage well and controlling agro with certainty rather than by adding a modest amount to overall group DPS.</div></div><hr />

I have no points in defiance and I have zero aggro issues after playing the game for a few months to figure out how aggro works.  Defiance is definitely not required for single gorup content.<br />
<br />
If aggro is provided by revenge, it's provided by the skill, not the stun, hence the talent points are useless.<br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs to be made a guaranteed stun even on stun immune mobs, or that skill is fucking garbage.  It doesn't produce aggro, and 90% of the time, it's not gonna land on the mob you need it to land on anyway (the high DPS boss).  <br />

Well, I certainly wouldnt expect prot spec'd folks to have much valid input on how effective an arms build is tanking unless they've done both. As I understand the spirit of the talent system, its only supposed to enchance your toon, not make or break it.  Its not supposed to be like AA's, where they were a requirment, if I understand the spirit of the talent system correctly.<br />
<br />
Effectiveness is a relative measure. It usually depends on the people involved.  Anywhere in PvE a prot spec will &quot;tank&quot; more effectively in terms of health and (possibly) aggro managment.  No doubt about it.  What is painfully clear in the low to mid game, a pure tank isnt really necessary.  It definatly helps, but its not 100% required like it was in EQ.  Less than ideal groups can get the job done too.<br />
<br />
In the high end 5 man instances, there are Arms spec guys saying they are tanking just fine.  They are getting the job done in otherwords.  As effective? Probably not.  But do you have to perform at peak efficency to achive results (to kill the boss, take his loot, finish the quest, etc)?  With the right group of players, I highly doubt it.  Of course it will be easier prot spec'd, but not entirely impossible arms spec'd either.<br />
<br />
In a raid setting, where heals are hopefully abundant, it again comes down to a question of is the prot spec absolutely necessary to achive results or can arms spec do the job, even if it isnt as effcient?<br />
<br />
For maximizing your PvE efficiency in groups, prot seems the obvious choice.  But that only covers about 1/3 to 1/2 of the total game play in WoW.  PvP issues (and to some extent solo issues) are of equal importance when concidering how to spend talent points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't see much improvement in prot spec.<br />
<br />
Last night, I did the weaker side of BRS (up to the lv55+ fire elementals and dragoons, after that our priest had to go to bed). I'm lv53, and I had absolutely no trouble tanking a lv60 backstab rogue, 59 fire mage, and 58 shadow priest. I don't think we had any downtime except for bad pulls or when the mage and I spammed AOEs to kill swarms of non-elite mobs.<br />
<br />
Really, if I can tank a +7 level rogue critting for 700 nonstop, Arms can't be that bad. Although I am considering going Arms/Fury as I have a 2h mace waiting for me at lv58.<br />
<br />
For reference, I'm 31 Arms/13 Fury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thengel</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that the talents in the protection tree are just SAD.  The stuns are cool on non-immune mobs, the +armor is nice, aggro is sometimes needed.  The &quot;bang for your buck&quot; factor is pathetic, however.  Every talent you spend in the arms tree gives a pretty good power boost.  Fury is less so than arms.  Protection is far, far behind.  Then at the very top of the tree we have shield discipline, a horrid excuse for a talent.  <br />
<br />
I've been protection spec from the time I got my first talent point and dropped it in shield specialization, and ever since I've been disappointed, all the way to l evel 60.   Arguably the best defensive talent warriors get isn't even in the protection tree - deflection.  Anyone else notice that you can get 1-2% dodge/parry from items or 10-25 defense, yet our talent gives +5% parry and the other gives +10 defense.  5% parry is 3-5 rare items worth, +10 defense is half an item.<br />
<br />
So last night I did a full respec.  Went from protection to arms / fury.  I'll see how it goes.  I know my damage output is a ton higher.  I know soloing is far easier.  In instances I actually feel it matters if I equip a good weapon instead of my 1.0 DPS nooby sword.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That you are able to tank without defiance is great, but about as relevant to how useful the skill is as my ability to solo as a protection spec is to the usefulness of mortal strike.  I've tanked both without and with defiance (after a respec), and have found it to be an improvement, especially when trying to hold agro on multiple mobs.  Spaming sunder is great for locking agro on one guy, but on four you must be constantly swapping around,  agro'ing just enough to hold it then swap to the next mob before it drops onto your priest.  The 15% hate bonus of defiance makes this task easier (though I'd agree it is a min-max kind of skill, not a &quot;holy shit that rocks&quot; kind of skill).<br />
<br />
If aggro is provided by revenge, it's provided by the skill, not the stun, hence the talent points are useless.<br />
<br />
Your right, agro is provided by the base skill in revenge.  The stuns are gravvy.  To get to the 3 or 4 boss mobs in an instance, you have to clear 100-150 normal mobs.  The normal mobs are not stun immune.  Being able to revenge stun them substantially reduces the damage I take, reducing the amount of mana the priest has to spend healing me, decreasing the amount of time she needs to spend drinking, increasing our kill rate (and allowing us to get to the bosses faster).  It is also one of the most useful skills in the protection tree for solo'ing (probably the most useful, actually).<br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs to be made a guaranteed stun even on stun immune mobs, or that skill is fucking garbage.  It doesn't produce aggro, and 90% of the time, it's not gonna land on the mob you need it to land on anyway (the high DPS boss).  <br />
<br />
Oh I don't know.  Ever needed to buy some time for a heal to land against a non-stun immune mob?  How about stopping a caster from getting a spell off when shield bash isn't up?  How about getting a mob to stop wailing on your priest when taunt isn't up?  Do you ever PvP? (hint-it is one of the 3 or 4 most useful PvP abilities warriors have).  Hell, when your solo'ing a tough mob, try whacking it with concussion blow then bandaging yourself.  <br />
<br />
I'd love for it to stick on any mob, including bosses.  But even in its current form it is far from garbage.<br />
<br />
And this is coming from a prot spec tank.  Sorry, prot spec is sorely fucking lacking at the moment.  Don't get me wrong, you can do your job just fine, but there is no &quot;Wow&quot; skill at the top of the tree like there should be.<br />
<br />
Protection spec tank here as well, and I agree, the tree needs some work (as do arms and fury).  Iron will, imp shield wall, improved disarm, etc... are a waste of space.  But there are abilities in it beyond shield disc and toughness that greatly increase our ability to take damage and control agro, and though it would be great to see them buffed, they work ok as is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a lot of things in this game that I doubt, and one of them is this.<br />
<br />
Until we see an actual functioning parser, things like this are just gonna have to go as &quot;fact&quot; until we can properly debunk them.  Mobs swing IMMEDIATELY upon being unstunned, meaning that their combat cycle does not stop when they're stunned.<br />
<br />
The net effect of a revenge stun, is therefore, at absolute best, 1 hit mitigated.  Off of a trash mob.  Every 15 seconds (diminishing returns).<br />
<br />
How many trash mobs live for 15 seconds, even in an instance? <br />
<br />
Revenge does not substantially reduce the amount of damage you take.  It may very slightly reduce it, but it in no way is a major contributor to reducing the damage you take during a fight.<br />
<br />
Ever needed to buy some time for a heal to land against a non-stun immune mob? How about stopping a caster from getting a spell off when shield bash isn't up? How about getting a mob to stop wailing on your priest when taunt isn't up? Do you ever PvP? (hint-it is one of the 3 or 4 most useful PvP abilities warriors have). Hell, when your solo'ing a tough mob, try whacking it with concussion blow then bandaging yourself. <br />
<br />
Been there, done that.  Ability to miss + Next Melee + 45 second cooldown + useless on bosses = Fucking garbage.<br />
<br />
Compare to MS, Ability to miss + instant + 6 second cooldown + useful on bosses.   <br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs A LOT of work.  It may be one of the 3 or 4 most useful  PvP abilities we have, but it's number 3 or 4.  Behind such things as Hamstring and Rend for christs sake.  That's not what I think the definitive skill from a tree should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwaern</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">interestingly enough, improved shield wall is one of the only prot tree talents I see garnering praise from folks that have used it on raids.<br />
<br />
Spec'ing improved shield wall takes the base ability from being 10 seconds long to 16 (on a half hour cooldown timer).  At ten seconds it is barely useful, at 16 it is marginal.  If it were 14 seconds and spec'd out to 20, it would be a much more useful skill.  It is purely a tanking ability, and only really useful in boss mob situations (or &quot;oh shit group wipe&quot;) situations.  In either case, the duration marginalizes the skill substantially.<br />
<br />
It's usefulness is further reduced by being on the same timer with retaliation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;It has been pretty common knowledge since beta that the high-end instances were designed assuming a group would have a protection spec warrior and a strong healer (generally a holy spec priest).&quot;<br />
<br />
This really isn't true at all.  Talent points had absoultely nothing to do with the design of high end instances. I too am a protection spec'd tank. I min-max to the extreme defensively. I can tank an instance &quot;better&quot; than an ms spec'd tank by a decentish margin because of a combination of my talents and gear.  However, I don't know many MS tanks that don't carry around a good shield and a few items to swap into when they're tanking instances, and they can tank it 90% as effectively as a protection spec'd tank.  In the same gear the difference is marginal, and an MS build or even a fury build can do the same things we can. <br />
<br />
Since the game is partially PVP and partially PvE, implying that protection spec'd is the only way to tank is fascist , incorrect, garbage. <br />
<br />
Also, &quot;holy&quot; spec needs work for priests, it actually isn't that good, even for a min-max build. Shadow priests get silence and a number of other abilities that can mitigate damage more effectively. My normal priest switched to shadow spec a few nights ago, and it's actually been working out better for instances/etc. Even on raids, a holy priest has very little advantage. Don't forget killing faster mitigates more damage as well. This isn't EQ, classes aren't 1-use wonders.<br />
<br />
That said I love being protection spec'd. Improved shield wall is one of our best talents, and the 5-10 point talents are great. The rest of the tree can use some work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here's my  thoughts:<br />
<br />
Gwaern really hit the spot with 'efficiency' it's all about reducing downtime and progressing faster over higher dps.  Atm prot spec is pretty fuking weak in the sense we don't have an end skill that defines it (like MS does for arms), i tried shield disc finally and yes it 'may' be decent for the 3pts needed (2sb and 1 sd) but not worth it considering the pre req of 30.  It's like Flurry, great skill to have but not worth due to the weak fury tree, unlike the arms tree which is very nicely tuned for MS.<br />
<br />
Basically what it boils down to is this, an offensive tank won't be an 'efficient' prot tank even if he changes to 1h+shield no more then a defensive tank can  be effective with a 2hander without ms.  You want specifics?  Prot talents on a whole are not 'great' or more synergenic then the arms line that builds to ms.  But due to the game mechanics you cannot get all the 'real' gems of prot if you dump 31 into arms.<br />
<br />
Before i get further let me show and explain my build as a prot tank:<br />
<br />
Arms: 5 Deflection, 5 Tactical Mastery, 1 Anger management, 2 Imp Charge<br />
<br />
Fury: 5 Cruelty<br />
<br />
Prot: 5 Shield block, 5 Anticipation, 5 toughness, 3 imp revenge, 5 defiance, 2 bloodrage, 1 last stand, 1 imp shield block, 2 shield wall, 2 imp taunt, 2 imp sunder armor.<br />
<br />
Essentials i find are : 5shieldblock, 5 toughness, 3 imp revenge, 5 defiance, 2 bloodrage, 1 last stand, 1 imp shield block, 2 taunt, 2 shield wall. Which is 26pts thus making it impossible to get MS.<br />
<br />
My previous build was i ditched anticipation, and imp sunder and with the 7 pts i put into 3 imp rend, 3 deep wound , 1 impale.  But due to the recent high AC + to defense gear i got lately (which i am now a big fan of) Anticipation was needed to further maximize it thus making these changes.<br />
<br />
An MS tank can get Last stand but can't get shield wall basically and i find  that extra 5 sec makes a big difference (not only against boss but against unforseen events where things turn ugly forcing you to use ae taunt)<br />
<br />
A hybrid concept was designed 31/20 arms prot tank 20 being, 5 shield block, 5 toughness, 2 bloodrage, 1 last stand, 1 imp shield block, 1 imp revenge, 3 defiance, 2 imp taunt.  Basically the bare min of prot build and sacrificing cruelty along the way.  It may look ok on paper but not on actual practice.<br />
<br />
MS is a rage dump ability that reqs 30 rage and i don't know how the hell a prot main tank can maintain MS dumps at the final instances.<br />
<br />
Scenario A:  6 mobs 4 of them elite, say you sap 1, i'd go in with charge demo shout, pull it back a bit ( away from sap/sheep mob ) use T clap (Yes T clap), switch to defensive demo again, then proceed to go counter clockwise and add a sunder to each elites, use taunt if a mob turns on someone, accumulate 20 rage, switch to battle T clap again, switch back sunder, demo etc.. it goes on.<br />
<br />
T clap is very very good in terms of aggro generation AND the 10% slowing of attack speed for further dmg reduction,  my rage never goes beyond 40, as i use a sunder then switch to T clap, and if it does i use dumps like shield block (not to mention revenge whenver it pops), and even shouts to keep my rage at optimal effeciency.  A friend of mine recently brought his MS warrior to act as a dps/offtanker, and he was getting his bang for the buck for MS cause all he'd do is charge in MS, switch to zerk stance, use zerk rage, bloodrage, and just keep using Ms whenever he can without having to worry about Aggro since i was keeping it all.<br />
<br />
So basically my tanking job never lets me get the 30 rage for MS and it is not worth for me to pump 31 pts into it just to get the odd MS here and there when i get over my 40 rage efficiency level (which happens on a crit, or shaman windfurry buff procs) etc..  As a singular talent prot is much weaker, but every little bit helps, talents like imp taunt, anticipation, last stand, shield wall cannot be overlooked as well as the most obvious other ones.<br />
<br />
With my MS testing build, i found i did i was lucky if i did 1 MS per 'set of mobs' which is beyond pathetic for the 31pt input into it.  While all the little 'talents' of prot i was missing was impairing my efficiency in terms of tanking to holding aggro which caused further downtime and thus i concluded that it was not &quot;as  efficient&quot; as my old build by 99999999999999 miles.  I am hoping they change shield disc and give prot tanks a workable 3rd tier skill to improve things, but for now i am happy with the way things are.  The last instances requires so much micro and quick reflex that it's sadistically fun to play them, and prot tanks are ANYTHING but boring (if you think they are then you really need to understand how tanking works).<br />
<br />
BTW all of my comments are directed for people who strive to learn how to play properly (doing brs,lbrs,schol,strat) as a single group &quot;efficiently&quot;.  Not to those who sold out to bandwagon raids that teaches nothing cept that you can get by with shitty playskills by hanging out with 15 others in a 5man instance.  If you take along the 'raid' aspect i believe even MS tanks can do 'ok' since u'll have so many healers and so much more dps that it won't matter what talents you have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trash mobs I'm currently fighting in instances at level 49 are level 47-52 elites.  Even with warrior+ rogue+hunter+warlock wailing on them, they live substantially longer than 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Here's a test for you.  Go find some even con mobs that you can pull as singles.  First try solo'ing ten of them with sword and board, without using shield block+improved revenge.  Note your hit points at the end of each fight, then average them.  Next, try 10 of them while using shield block+imp revenge chains.  Note your hit points and average them.   I did it, and discovered that I ended fights with an average of 200 more hit points when I used improved revenge (3200 at full health, ending fights at 2200 vs. 2000).<br />
<br />
A parser would certainly help qauntify things more accurately.  But respectfully, I'll take my emperical results (and the opinion of my priest) over your opinion at this point. <br />

It may be one of the 3 or 4 most useful  PvP abilities we have, but it's number 3 or 4.  Behind such things as Hamstring and Rend for christs sake.  That's not what I think the definitive skill from a tree should be.<br />
<br />
You need to get out and PvP some more.  Our most useful PvP abilities are charge and intercept.  I'd say execute is #3, mortal strike and concussion blow in the running for #'s 4 and 5.  Protection spec is a weak build for PvP (though not as weak as some arms folks like to think), but concusion blow is actually one of the best, if not the best, PvP ability in the tree.</div></div><hr />

lol<br />
<br />
Uh huh.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's worth a fucking damn will never let you get a charge off, and intercept's cooldown is too long to be of use more than once, if they even let you get that off.<br />
<br />
Hamstring, #1, no fucking doubt, no every time.  You let people start running around, you're dying, fucking period.<br />
<br />
Rend #2, Makes it impossible to bandage, impossible to vanish.<br />
<br />
Both low rage skills, both usable by any warrior of any skill level.  Ignore them at your peril.<br />
<br />
Got news for you.  PvP is not what you can do vs retards in a duel.  PvP is fighting dirty and being smart.  Everyone who's played this game for more than 20 minutes knows that if you let a warrior get a charge off, you're done for.  Thus, anyone who sees you coming and has any fucking clue what they're doing is gonna bum rush your ass and close the distance before you do.  Same deal with intercept.  Of course, you can avoid intercept entirely by judicious use of Hamstring.<br />
<br />
Sorry, your make believe land does not hold true.<br />
<br />
Here's a test for you. Go find some even con mobs that you can pull as singles. First try solo'ing ten of them with sword and board, without using shield block+improved revenge. Note your hit points at the end of each fight, then average them. Next, try 10 of them while using shield block+imp revenge chains. Note your hit points and average them. I did it, and discovered that I ended fights with an average of 200 more hit points when I used improved revenge (3200 at full health, ending fights at 2200 vs. 2000). <br />
<br />
Your testing method is flawed.  You wanna know why?  It's because you're forcing blocks, which should easily account for 200.  Shield block is reducing your damage, not revenge.</div></div><hr />

not too many on my server that I've dueled are worth a damn.  They still let me open with charge.  I love it!  And in mass PvP its how I enter into the fray, usually when someone isnt looking.<br />
<br />
Intercept is our anti-kite move.  It works wonders on folks who try that to kite me or run away.  Not foolproof by anymeans, but a great tool in the right spot. EDIT: with today's patch fixing the bug with Intercept, the Bloodrage + Intercept combo should work as intended.  That's quite a big plus imo.</div></div><hr />

Haas, I generally value your opinion pretty highly, but you seem to be talking out your ass on PvP.<br />
<br />
When I PvP it is in Southshore/Crossroads/Westfall with a group of friends, and usually involves 20-30 people on each side fighting each other.  Dueling is retarded.  <br />
<br />
If you are not opening your fights with charge (or if in an open PvP environment, you are allowing people to get the drop on you and preventing you from charging), you suck.  If an enemy has the time to figure out your a warrior, target you, turn auto attack on, and prevent you from charging them, you deserve to get your ass kicked.<br />
<br />
Hamstring, #1, no fucking doubt, no every time.  You let people start running around, you're dying, fucking period.<br />
<br />
Uh huh.  Hamstring is great for stopping rogues or hunters who are trying to run from you.  Rend is useful on rogues.  Neither are worth a damn on just about anyone else.   Those are pretty much the only classes who ARE going to try to run from you.  A priest or a warlock is going to fear your ass.  A mage is going to ice root you.  Or blink, leave your ass looking around wondering where he went, then ice root you.  A druid is going to root you.  A shaman might try and kite you around their totems, but in that case your first priority needs to be to get rid of the fucking totem, then use intercept to get to the shaman and stun their ass (then use hamstring).<br />
<br />
Rend #2, Makes it impossible to bandage, impossible to vanish.<br />
<br />
Good for fighting rogues and other warriors.  FYI, no one else is going to waste their fucking time with a bandage.  <br />
<br />
Everyone who's played this game for more than 20 minutes knows that if you let a warrior get a charge off, you're done for.  Thus, anyone who sees you coming and has any fucking clue what they're doing is gonna bum rush your ass and close the distance before you do.  Same deal with intercept.  Of course, you can avoid intercept entirely by judicious use of Hamstring.<br />
<br />
FYI, PvP in this game is chaotic.  If your standing around with your finger up your ass letting people on the other side target various folks in your group to figure out who the warrior is then turn on auto attack so they can't charge, you deserve to die.  Repeatedly.  In horrible ways.<br />
<br />
Another FYI, most people in this game are smart enough to go after the priest/mage before they go after a guy in platemail.  They are not going to &quot;bum rush your ass&quot; until everyone else in your group is dead.  Unless your out there solo'ing.  In which case you are retarded.<br />
<br />
Intercept lets you close the gap on someone who's gotten away from you quickly, and stun them.  You know, like a priest or warlock who feared you.  Or a mage who ice rooted you.  Or a mage who used blink.  Or a hunter who wingclipped you.  Or a rogue who got a sprint off. Or a druid who rooted you.  Really, the picture you paint of yourself running around hoping you can get close enough to someone to hamstring them is not a very flattering portrayal of your PvP experience.<br />
<br />
Your testing method is flawed.  You wanna know why?  It's because you're forcing blocks, which should easily account for 200.  Shield block is reducing your damage, not revenge.<br />
<br />
Absolutely correct, shield block is absorbing some of the damage.  But as you have said in other threads, shield block's damage absorbtion is fairly pathetic.  Shield block does, however, force a revenge opportunity.  Using it allows you to get free damage + a 40% chance of a stun.  You'd be fucking retarded NOT to use it if your a protection spec warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Essentials i find are : 5shieldblock, 5 toughness, 3 imp revenge, 5 defiance, 2 bloodrage, 1 last stand, 1 imp shield block, 2 taunt, 2 shield wall. Which is 26pts thus making it impossible to get MS.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not going to comment on your build, since variation in builds adds to the customization of the game and makes it more enjoyable over all. However, your &quot;essentials&quot; are not essentials to tanking, just you doing so. An MS build tank can tank almost equally as good as a protection build tank just picking up 5 shield block and improved shield block. If they grab anticipation and toughness, all the better. They aren't going to take such significant extra damage that you have more downtime, downtime is so miniscule that it doesn't matter anyway. I have an MS build friend that tanks every single group instance fine, with a druid as his primary healer. <br />
<br />
&quot;MS is a rage dump ability that reqs 30 rage and i don't know how the hell a prot main tank can maintain MS dumps at the final instances.<br />
<br />
Scenario A: 6 mobs 4 of them elite, say you sap 1, i'd go in with charge demo shout, pull it back a bit ( away from sap/sheep mob ) use T clap (Yes T clap), switch to defensive demo again, then proceed to go counter clockwise and add a sunder to each elites, use taunt if a mob turns on someone, accumulate 20 rage, switch to battle T clap again, switch back sunder, demo etc.. it goes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your battles seem to last longer than mine, thunderclap just isn't worth it. 10% slow isn't worth switching stances for, since you take extra damage switching stances from both effects (which aren't mitigated by the 10% slow) and melee, for the few seconds it takes to switch, use, switch. Also you're over-using sunder, it's nice for aggro but revenge and shieldbash are both just as good but cheaper on rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;T clap is very very good in terms of aggro generation&quot;<br />
<br />
It's actually quite horrible aggro. Test it. ;)<br />
<br />
&quot;So basically my tanking job never lets me get the 30 rage for MS&quot;<br />
<br />
Try shieldbash and revenge like I said, and you'll find you have more aggro to do other abilities with, i tank 8-9 mobs at a time and after using shieldbash/revenge/sunder on them all i always have extra to re-demo, and do some extra sunders or use concussive. I rarely end up having to use taunt even, so find the improved taunt talents worthless. An MS build tank gets to use that extra rage on a mortal strike here and there, which produces decent aggro after you have them all locked down, and does extra damage to boot. Add in the fact that they'll be getting to use it even more soon with the patch going in for rage generation on dodge/parry/full-block, and it's very viable when tanking instances. <br />
<br />
&quot;With my MS testing build, i found i did i was lucky if i did 1 MS per 'set of mobs' which is beyond pathetic for the 31pt input into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Concussive has a 45 second cooldown, it gets used just as often, and you can use MS more than that if you follow the above advice, and don't was as much rage. Also keep in mind that MS is extremely good on mobs that heal themselves, especially bosses that can't be stunned/silenced. <br />
<br />
I'm a protection build, I preach protection where I can, but I don't lie about it being overly useful where it isn't. It has it's uses, which is to take less damage, it however, isn't required and it's top talents are nothing that make you go &quot;Wow!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shield wall is incredibly useful, even in it's 10 second form.  Thats about 10 extra seconds you have to get aggro on -anything-, particularly hard hitting boss mobs.  If you're protection spec, you get 15 seconds of 75% mitigation to all damage.  That added aggro control or damage reduction for later (Should you decide to save it) in the fight can make or break you in a close match.<br />
<br />
I also vouch for hamstringing everything as a matter of policy.  If they want to try and run away, they're not going to get as far, whether I'm stunned/snared/whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me, it doesn't fucking happen to anyone else who's paying attention.  Drop an arrow, instant cast nuke, whatever...people can force you into combat and grey out your charge key.  Well, unless you're playing on a blue server, in which case that's not really PvP now is it?  Charge is fucking great, but if your experience with it is limited to flagging yourself in Southshore, then that's not really PvP.  Nor is large scale PvP a 100% scenario.<br />
<br />
Absolutely correct, shield block is absorbing some of the damage. But as you have said in other threads, shield block's damage absorbtion is fairly pathetic. <br />
<br />
Lessee, you said you were fighting 47-52 mobs earlier, so I'm assuming you at least have a Mograine shield, and I can block 32 with mine, so 200/32 = 7 blocks or so.  You can't hit shield block 7 times in a fight?  Seems to be like a prot spec warrior would have no issues burning shield block 7 times, especially if that's what they're using their rage for.  So there's your 200 points of damage absorption.  Keep thinking it's revenge tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll give you all my take after being mostly Arms specced to 60, and now re-speccing for raids to Protection.  I miss the dps from arms quite a bit.  But I do really like shield disc, concussion blow, improve taunt (I won't live without this now), etc.  But also what I do realize is that you don't have to go full protection for it to be effective.  If you don't want/need an end tree ability like MS or Shield Disc (and in my experience you really need either of them), its perfectly feasible to go a mix of Prot, Arms, with a bit in Fury or whatever way you want.  PvE Prot spec is great (although I'm not entirely sure how much better than Arms it is), but PvP, I'm sucking wind.  I REALLY miss improve rend, impale line etc., and improve overpower.  Potentially I may respect to a mixed Prot/Arms (just keeping 5 in cruelty in Fury), so that I can fill my role as a tank well in raid instances, do well in PvP (well as well as we do P), and also do good in raid instances where I'm pure dps.  (although right now as prot specced when I DPS in instances I break 200 dps with no sweat)  The Prot skills I think are essential are these:<br />
<br />
Shield Spec 5<br />
<br />
Toughness 5(not so sure About anticipation at this point, although I have 4 points in it)<br />
<br />
Improve Shield Block (at least the first level of it, getting the other two levels is debateable depending on who you talk to)<br />
<br />
Defiance 5(anything at all that helps me generate more aggro is good)<br />
<br />
Improve Taunt 2 <br />
<br />
Concussion Blow.  I know there's been some debate about this and yeah its super dumb that you can't use it on most boss mobs.  But, with most high level instances you usually have multiple caster mobs that are just bitches to deal with.  (Just as an example Adepts/Risen Bonewardends in Scholomance and Conjurers/Battlemages on the Strath Scarlet Side)  Being able to shield bash, then stun them with concussion, then potentially another stun with improve revenge, means MUCH less damage from their nasty spells and AEs.  I've had times where we killed one of these buggers and they didn't even get a spell off due to Warrior, Rogue, and Pally chain stunning them.  Also great for PvP.  <br />
<br />
Other than that I think the other Prot skills are just extras,  Improve shield bash is nice for casters as well, I really like that one.  I do have shield disc currently, and I will tell you I find it much more useful, at least from a tanking perspective, than MS is.  (MS is probably a better PvP/Dps ability of course)  But its not a deal breaker for me, I could really live without it.  One handed weapon spec is nice if you intend to mainly one hand/shield and/or duel wield too.  You get the benefit in any stance so you can Fury/Arms if your dps and do pretty good damage.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, prot spec is sorely fucking lacking at the moment.  Don't get me wrong, you can do your job just fine, but there is no &quot;Wow&quot; skill at the top of the tree like there should be.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the highest tier prot talents suck. The best ones are at the bottom with the exception of Improved Sunder.<br />
<br />
I have been Prot spec all the way so I cannot comment on how it compares to Arms/Fury for instances. I can't even comment on other Warriors. Every single Arms/Fury I've grouped with (And there are a lot!) groups like a total moron.<br />
<br />
With the crazy 30 minute reuse on Shield Wall I don't think the talents are worth it one bit.<br />
<br />
The only time I use Concussive blow to explicity stop casting is when I'm soloing. As a Tauren I can go Shield Bash -&gt; War Stomp -&gt; Shield Bash -&gt; Concussive Blow -&gt; Shield Bash and if I still need more stuns I have Revenge or Pummel. The next melee on Concussive makes it lame when you need it righ away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, and I've said this at various other sites (not sure on TSW) the fix for most of the class balance problems IMO is this.  Give EVERY character 2 talent builds.  <br />
<br />
There are 2 parts to the game.  PVE and PVP.  And a classes role can VASTLY change between the 2 parts of the game.  We should have 2 builds available to us and can swap between the two.  Place some restrictions on the ability to swap builds.... a cool down timer, can't do it mid fight etc etc... and many of our problems go away.  <br />
<br />
The way it is now, a person that dicides to go protection specced is absolutely useless in PVP..... especially group PVP as tanking is not part of PVP currently (we can't FORCE the enemy to concentrate on us.....therefore we can't tank).  <br />
<br />
Giveing every class the ability to have 2 tree's makes arms/fury and Prot specced warriors one whole  class again, and not for all intents and purposes of game balance 2 separate classes.  Master of melee says to me the capability of being dangerous with both aspects of melee (dps output ..... and DPS absorption) not dangerous with one or the other.  Are warrior's master's of melee?  Not currently.<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt we'll ever see this because of the development costs involved with this kind of design change, but it would go along ways towards fixing many problems with the game and warrior class in particular.  This would give every warrior the ability to tank as efficiently as possible AND to PVP/Solo to the best of our ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The moment when you ranked rend as a more valuable PvP skill than intercept you became about as credible Pee Wee Herman lecturing the fucking NE Patriots on how to play professional football.<br />
<br />
It sounds like the PvP time you've put in has been mostly solo, looking for someone to fight.  If you see someone, how about instead of running at them head-on like a special ed kid chasing a kitty cat, you try and get the fucking drop on them?  Pull back, let them walk past, then attack from behind.  Hide in some fucking cover and charge as they go by. <br />
<br />
In an open battle (you know, large numbers of people fighting each other, rather than idiots wandering around solo looking for someone to gank), what the fuck do you do after you kill someone?  Stand around picking your nose waiting on someone to AE you, fear you, root you, snare you, dot you, or shoot your ass full of arrows?  Lumber towards the nearest person like Rosane Barr chasing a fucking pork chop?  Or do you back out into charge range, pick another target, charge them to stun+generate rage+scare the living shit out of them?<br />
<br />
Hmm, and what do you do when a mage blinks on you, then starts nuking your ass?  You try and run em down the hard way, praying you can land a rend on em?  Or do you intercept to close the gap instantly (and stun them), so you can hamstring their ass?  When a rogue gets a sprint off on you, what the fuck do you do?  Chase along behind him hoping he stops before he stealths so you can drop a fucking rend on him?  Or intercept and lock his ass down?  <br />
<br />
Well, unless you're playing on a blue server, in which case that's not really PvP now is it?   <br />
<br />
Until battlegrounds goes in, there isn't really PvP on any server.  Real PvP has risks and rewards.  <br />
<br />
Yep I play on a blue server.  An RP one, in fact.  We generally have at least one level 45+ PvP battle every night (a battle, involving 25 or more people on each side, not a couple of idiots wandering around solo trying to find someone else to gank.)  Last night it was a Horde invasion of Deeprun Tram.  Night before it was a Horde attack on Stormwind.  Last week it was a Horde attack on Ironforge that got into the fucking furnace, and an Alliance attack on Ogrimmar.<br />
<br />
<br />
On improved revenge, logic would fucking dictate that stacking several 3 second stuns on a mob is going to reduce its damage output.  You say it doesn't, based on nothing so far but the smoke coming out your ass.  Go do a fucking test of your own and come back and support your claim with something other than swagger and bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to be a raiding main tank, I highly suggest putting a majority of talent points in protection. I recently respec'd from a MS build and I can clearly see a big difference in my mitigation. While, yes... my dps did suffer, I can suprisingly solo more efficently now. Needless to say, my healers are very happy as well.<br />
<br />
While I do miss not having Mortal Strike anymore, I still hold my own in 1v1 and mass PvP. It all comes down to making the most of your abilities.<br />
<br />
Spend your talent points however you wish. At the end of the day, all that matters is that you're enjoying yourself. This is merely a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthax</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am surprised no one has mentioned improved shield bash.  One of the best talents in the protection tree.  Casters are our worst enemy.  Can't think of any better damage mitigation than stopping a caster for 6 seconds.  Follow up with a Concussion Blow (which we all need to remember is only ONE talent point) and a caster will not survive long enough to get off a single spell.<br />
<br />
My biggest complaint in the protection tree is shield discipline.  I think the rage cost is far too high for what it does.  Either upgrade the talent or lower the cost to use it.  Shouldn't we be rewarded for reaching the top tier of a talent tree?<br />
<br />
I am also wondering how useful Defiance is.  I believe that we get most of our aggro from abilities like revenge, sunder, and shield bash.  When I am tabbing through targets firing off revenge and sunder to each enemy, I am not really doing much damage to each individual mob.  I get on their hate list through my abilities, not damage.  So, an extra 15% on the little damage I am doing doesnt seem like much.</div></div><hr />

I keep reading posts from arms spec warriors who describe tanking in level 45+ instances and holding agro well, while still being able to use mortal strike regularly.<br />
<br />
How exactly do you do this?  Mortal strike requires 30 rage.  Tact. mastery 5 only preserves 25 rage when you switch stances.  Are you tanking in battle stance?  Are you tanking in defensive then swapping, then wailing on the mob a few minutes?<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I am dubious of the claims that MS builds tank effectively AND do good damage in PvE.</div></div><hr />

First of all, stop fucking trying to make it sound like I said skills aren't useful in PvP.  I never said that, and I never claimed it.  Of course fucking intercept can catch up to a mage.  Then guess what, frost nova, a little frost bolt action, and you sir, are right back at square fucking one, with 25 seconds left on your cooldown on Intercept.  And quite frankly, if you're not dead before it refreshes, then the mage isn't trying hard enough.  <br />
<br />
Intercept is fucking wonderful....once.<br />
<br />
Compare that to the rogues with MoD standing all around you, ganking one target and vanishing away to do it again, and you'll see why I value rend more.  Rogues don't scare me now after I figured out how to deal with their asses.  There's no better feeling in the world than watching one hit vanish only to reappear and get their fucking ass beat down a split second later. <br />
<br />

<br />
Are you on fucking crack, or do you just fight idiots?  You are ALWAYS in combat in large scale PvP, unless you run halfway across the fucking zone.  You can't back out 10 goddamned steps and suddenly be out of combat if you've got people blowing off AE's and hunters flinging shit everywhere.  Maybe no one attacks you, that's fuckin fantastic, but that doens't happen in the real world.  <br />
<br />
Like I said before..against anyone with a fucking brain (and I'm sorry to inform you that the majority of people in this game don't have one), you're not gonna get charges off.<br />

Logic does not support your facts.  Your tests include 2 variables....shield block, and revenge.  Your shield block covers the damage difference.  So what did revenge do?  You can't claim it did shit, because you didn't isolate the variable, Einstein.  But don't worry, I'm sure those 30+ damage blocks from Shield block that you forced didn't do anything to your mitigation and it was all revenge stun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rage generation is different for an arms warrior.  Anger management produces roughly 1 rage every 3 seconds on it's own, plus they just generally produce an obscene amount of rage overall.  <br />
<br />
Mortal strike really ends up being the same amount of rage as concussion blow if you want to think of it that way, because arms warriors can produce rage about twice as fast as prot warriors can.</div></div><hr />

This is what works for my arms/MS build when tanking multiple mobs. First off I charge with big 2hander equipped if there isnt a possibility of pulling one or two. Immediately switch to berserk and pop Demo Shout to get everything near me to attack then I pop Berserker Rage (More mobs hitting me the faster I build rage and faster I WW Cleave dish out dmg.) Once I pop rage I can usually WW once then back to Battle Stance. I switch out 2hander for dual wield while I wait for WW to refresh. Dual wield generates a ton more rage I also have points into unbridled wrath so every hit I have 40% chance to get an extra rage point. So two very fast weapons generates rage points phenominally better then waiting 3+ seconds to hit again. I can usually generate enough rage while WW refreshes to switch back to 2hander MS once switch to berserk WW then by that time I've locked aggro well enough to focus on individuals and burn em down with MS's and cleave in between refreshs. If I find im low on rage early in the fight I pop bloodrage which gets me going on the rage train. If a mob decides to switch targets I'll toss a sunder in or Hamstring it to get it pissed at me. Sure I take more dmg by not having a shield equipped and turtling myself in defensive stance but 200-500 dmg WW hits on 4 mobs 200-500 dmg MS's and Cleaves in the same dmg range on 2 mobs with Sweeping Strikes etc. most mobs don't last but a few seconds with a decent group.<br />
<br />
Picking up two Icy Chill enchants for Flurries tonight from an enchanter friend will love to see how much they proc and how well the snare and attack speed slow works.<br />
<br />
As a side note I just had a Wall of the Dead drop so I'm seriously considering going protection build and having a guildie craft a Frostguard for me for when I hit lvl 58. Having trouble finding a crafter who has Stronghold Gauntlet and Lionheart Helm plans i've been hoarding Arcanite Bars for 5 lvls and just waiting to find an armorsmith who can make it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, stop fucking trying to make it sound like I said skills aren't useful in PvP.  I never said that, and I never claimed it. <br />
<br />
Well now, yesterday when I said I believe our two most useful PvP skills are charge and intercept, you said:<br />
<br />
lol<br />
Uh huh.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's worth a fucking damn will never let you get a charge off, and intercept's cooldown is too long to be of use more than once, if they even let you get that off.<br />
<br />
Hamstring, #1, no fucking doubt, no every time. You let people start running around, you're dying, fucking period.<br />
<br />
Rend #2, Makes it impossible to bandage, impossible to vanish.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and:<br />
<br />
Everyone who's played this game for more than 20 minutes knows that if you let a warrior get a charge off, you're done for. Thus, anyone who sees you coming and has any fucking clue what they're doing is gonna bum rush your ass and close the distance before you do. Same deal with intercept. <br />
<br />
<br />
So which is it?  Are charge and intercept valuable skills in PvP, or not?  Yesterday they weren't, today they are?  Are rend and hamstring the bomb, or not?<br />
<br />
Of course fucking intercept can catch up to a mage.  Then guess what, frost nova, a little frost bolt action, and you sir, are right back at square fucking one, with 25 seconds left on your cooldown on Intercept.  And quite frankly, if you're not dead before it refreshes, then the mage isn't trying hard enough.  <br />
<br />
So your saying warrior fights mage = warrior loses?  Not my experience.  Intercept puts me on top of a mage instantly, usually scaring the living shit out of him, and it stuns him.  If he has an instant cast left, he has to blow it then.  Or I will either shield bash, pummel, or concussion blow his ass and he's toast.<br />
<br />
Yep, a mage might still have another trick up his sleeve to break off melee with you after an intercept and build some distance.  But try fighting a decent mage without using intercept and you'll die every time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Compare that to the rogues with MoD standing all around you, ganking one target and vanishing away to do it again, and you'll see why I value rend more.  Rogues don't scare me now after I figured out how to deal with their asses. <br />
<br />
Other than this one use (stopping one class, a rogue, from stealthing) rend is one of the most craptastic abilities in the entire warrior tool box, ranking just a fraction higher in overall pathetic-ness than thunder clap.  A powerful PvP skill is one that has value against many classes, in many situations.  With it's only real use being stopping stealth gankers, ranking rend above charge and intercept is laughable.<br />
<br />
Rogues should never scare any warrior.  We have the tools to out and out crush them, regardless of spec.  Retaliation will turn an unwary rogue into a bloody puddle of goo.  Hell, a protection spec warrior doesn't even need to put down the sword and shield, we can usually laugh off the worst they have to offer and grind them into submission.<br />
<br />
You are ALWAYS in combat in large scale PvP, unless you run halfway across the fucking zone.  You can't back out 10 goddamned steps and suddenly be out of combat if you've got people blowing off AE's and hunters flinging shit everywhere.  Maybe no one attacks you, that's fuckin fantastic, but that doens't happen in the real world.<br />
<br />
As a warrior, you will generally do shitty damage.  As such, when you do kill someone in a PvP battle, your best bet is to back up, take a few seconds to look around, find a soft, squishy caster, charge them, then kick the crap out of them.  If you can't charge, use intercept.  You want to drop onto them like a ton of bricks and cause them to panic.  You want to stun them.  You want to use every interrupt and stun you have in your arsenal to lock down the other sides nukers and healers and kill them as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
What you don't want to do is tab the nearest target, run off and start wasting your time on another warrior.  Or a paladin.  Or a rogue for that matter.<br />
<br />
And maybe the folks I fight are smarter than the average WoW player, but the Horde on my server understands that if a guy is wearing plate mail you ignore him until his healers and nukers are dead.  If you have some extra mana to burn maybe you sheep him, or fear his ass.  Pretty much the same in every other PvP game.<br />
<br />
But don't worry, I'm sure those 30+ damage blocks from Shield block that you forced didn't do anything to your mitigation and it was all revenge stun.<br />
<br />
They absolutely did reduce the damage I took.  So did the stuns from revenge.  If you feel the stuns do not reduce damage, go do your own test and prove it.  Bluster and belligerence is not a substitute for any sort of facts to back up your arguments.  Otherwise your conclusion that stuns dont reduce a mobs damage output is no different than the schmucks on the official WoW forums claiming sunder doesn't actually increase the damage you do to a mob, without any testing to back up their assertions.</div></div><hr />

As noted above, MS can be used in any stance.  Really, it's rage cost isn't &quot;that&quot; much higher than concussion blow considering what it does.<br />
<br />
Tank large sets of multi's in defensive.  Once hate is set and the main target we're fighting sundered, rage starts going toward MS (It does produce good hate believe it or not, just expensive for what it does).  When they get down to about 2 or so worthwhile (elite) mobs alive on me,  I switch over to battle stance and bust out sweeping strikes.</div></div><hr />

A powerful PvP skill is one that has value against many classes, in many situations.

<br />
Lessee, if i had to guess, I'd wager that half of the fucking PvP population is rogues.  No goddamned shit, they're everywhere.  Easy to solo class + decent at PvP, and we have a winner captain.  Mages, by contrast, I've seen a grand total of 2 at in PvP in 51 levels on Hellscream.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, maybe you have some kinda issues with bandages (maybe your mummy beat you or something), but everyone I know uses them, and uses them a lot.  Removing that tool from their arsenal is far worth the pathetic cost of a rend.  If you don't believe so, that's your perogative, but at 51 I did put down a 56 warrior who thought the only things you had to do in PvP were shield block, revenge, and piercing howl, so take it as you please.<br />
<br />
Like I repeatedly say..just because the people you fight are inbred wastes of space does not mean that tactics don't exist.  For example, there was a thread earlier about dueling a shaman, which basically completely, 100% revolved around getting a charge off.  Well, I dunno about you, but the people I duel are smart enough to know that's EXACTLY what I want to do first.  Why the fuck are they gonna stand around and let me do it?  Same thing with intercept.  The people I duel know when it's coming, and they have ways to deal with it....earthbind totem, root, snare, whatever.  You get once chance, and that's it.  That's not what I'd call a top of the line priority.<br />
<br />
They absolutely did reduce the damage I took. So did the stuns from revenge. If you feel the stuns do not reduce damage, go do your own test and prove it.

<br />
This is why not having a parser pisses me off.  Run a combat log of your little revenge stun sequences.  You'll notice that every single time the stun wears off, the mob swings immediately.  He's not losing combat round time because of your stun...the vast majority of time he's spending stunned IS TIME THAT HE'S NOT DOING DAMAGE TO YOU ANYWAY.  And when your stun wears off, he gets right back on top of the ball with an immediate swing.<br />
<br />
By contrast, WE KNOW, that forcing a shield block is going to mitigate X amount of damage, every single time.  I have zero doubts that you can get 7 blocks off with a 50 something warrior over the course of a fight.  Your own numbers prove that you're not gaining dick from revenge stuns, and that the entire experiment proves that block reduces damage taken.  Bravo.  It's not my fault that you can't interpret your data.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see a log of this because I think you're both overstating. The vast majority of the time? Perhaps half. It cuts down on damage but it's not like GEE WILLIKER I JUST SAVED A BUNCH OF MONEY ON MY CAR INSURANCE BY SWITCHING TO GEICO<br />
<br />
It does, however, do a number on rogue/monk mobs (which are not common, yes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's combat round for mobs in WoW?  2 seconds?<br />
<br />
How many combat rounds is a 3 second stun stopping?  Especially when he swings immediately after the stun.<br />
<br />
How many of those swings would you have avoided normally, via block, parry, dodge, and miss?<br />
<br />
If you finish a fight with 2200hp with shield block + revenge and with 2000hp without shield block or revenge, is it safe to assume that shield block is providing  the majority of that mitigation?  Revenge stun is only 40% chance at the best level, and that's only if the revenge lands.  It's possible that the block/revenge combo saves more damage, but actually ends up costing you more because you're burning the rage on low DPS defensive skills rather than doing damage to the mob.<br />
<br />
Bottom line..if you're saving 200hp per fight by using shield block AND revenge stun, versus without both of those skills, shield block is gonna provide at least half of the savings, if not closer to 75-80%. <br />
<br />
But, like I said....no parser is really gimping us here.  Without an accurate view of mob DPS on a wide scale, comparing this 1 fight, 2 fight, 17 second segments of fights is just retarded.  This discussion in an EQ forum wouldda been laughed right into the outhouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  Problem with a guy who can't get his fricking story straight.  I mean, come on, are you related to John Kerry? Do I have to quote your post for you again?  Yesterday you said chage and intercept = not good.  Today you say kinda good.  Which is it?<br />
<br />
 Lessee, if i had to guess, I'd wager that half of the fucking PvP population is rogues. <br />
<br />
I hope you'd wager a lot, cause on my server you'd lose that bet so fast you'd be hitting mommy up for an advance on your allowance.   Of course not being a full on PvP server, I guess ganking isn't the past time it is on pure PvP servers.  Paladins vastly outnumber rogues on alliance side, as do hunters and shaman on the horde side.  That's because Rogues in this game, frankly, suck in any sort of group environment.  Horrendously.  <br />
<br />
They also suck in PvP against just about any melee class that can survive their initial special attacks (like, say, a warrior or paladin), or any caster who can fear them.  Stop by the Safehouse and tell folks what a great and powerful class they are, see what your reception is.<br />
<br />
Rend does indeed block them from stealthing via it's DoT component.  Then again, so does any other DoT effect in the game, including the ones that do not do pathetically craptastic damage (like, say, rend).   Given rend's hideously low damage, and usefulness being limited to stoping 1 class (rogues) from using 1 ability (stealth) calling it one of our most powerful PvP skills is halarious.<br />
<br />
 Mages, by contrast, I've seen a grand total of 2 at in PvP in 51 levels on Hellscream.<br />
<br />
Then why the hell did you bring up mages as a reason for why intercept wasn't all that for PvP? (hint, see first paragraph of post #34 you made above)<br />
<br />
 <br />
Furthermore, maybe you have some kinda issues with bandages (maybe your mummy beat you or something), but everyone I know uses them, and uses them a lot.  Removing that tool from their arsenal is far worth the pathetic cost of a rend. <br />
<br />
Never said I didn't use bandages.  If you can find where I did, post it.  What I said was no one, other than a warrior or a rogue (ok, maybe a hunter) is going to waste their time with it in a PvP environment.  Paladins, shaman, druids, priests are actually going to heal themselves.  Other classes will be either rooting or fearing you to build some distance on you, at which point they are going to try and nuke you into the ground, not stand around bandaging.  That's where intercept comes in.<br />
<br />
Bandages are awesome for solo'ing though.  Can be helpful in dueling (especially if you have concussion blow!)   But I thought we were talking PvP, not two morons standing in front of the bank in Ogrimmar wailing on each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 If you don't believe so, that's your perogative, but at 51 I did put down a 56 warrior who thought the only things you had to do in PvP were shield block, revenge, and piercing howl, so take it as you please. <br />
<br />
Congratulations.  Now why the hell were you wasting your time beating down a low damage, high AC, high hit point class?  Or is your experience dueling in front of the bank in Ogrimmar supposed to be relevant in a PvP discussion?<br />
<br />
Same thing with intercept.  The people I duel know when it's coming, and they have ways to deal with it....earthbind totem, root, snare, whatever.  You get once chance, and that's it.  That's not what I'd call a top of the line priority. <br />
<br />
And if they get the earthbind totem off, how exactly is rend or hamstring going to save the day?  Getting one shot to instantly be on top of someone + stun sure beats the hell out of running around hoping you get close enough to hamstring someone, or to use the uberness that is rend.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Run a combat log of your little revenge stun sequences.  You'll notice that every single time the stun wears off, the mob swings immediately.  He's not losing combat round time because of your stun...the vast majority of time he's spending stunned IS TIME THAT HE'S NOT DOING DAMAGE TO YOU ANYWAY.   <br />
<br />
How bout you run a combat log of your own, and look at the interval of attacks by mobs.  Guess what, they generally swing faster than 3 seconds (the duration of a revenge stun).  Which means that even if they do swing immediently after the stun expires, YOU HAVE STILL REDUCED THEIR DAMAGE OUTPUT.  Or would actually backing up your general snottiness be too much work?</div></div><hr />

Posted my above response before seeing this.<br />
<br />
I actually agree with that statement.  My guess is 50/50 split for how much of the mitigation came from block or revenge.  And I'd agree with Iskander... revenge stuns are also a min/max kind of thing.  It makes a difference, but it isn't a &quot;holy shit gotta have that skill!&quot; difference.  Then again, no one ability in any of the 3 warrior talent lines is (save for maybe tact. mastery).</div></div><hr />

Clue time...I dropped the priest this gimp was apparantly boxing while she was picking on TM guards.  After I garnered her attention, she turned to me and proceeded to shield block/revenge her way to a dirtnap.  <br />
<br />
This is why discussing things with certain people is pointless.  If all the details aren't explicitly explained, they draw incorrect conclusions based upon I can only guesss what, and then try to tell you that the sky is green.<br />
<br />
I'm also highly amused by the fact that you can call Rend low damage while being a protection tank, where Rend is actually the most single target DPS you can dish out.   Well, unless you're using HS for that purpose, in which case we don't need to discuss this any further.<br />
<br />
Here, lets come to a consensus.  I don't give a fuck what you do in PvP.  You don't care what I do in PvP. I'm generally successful at what I do, and I get the job done more times than I don't.  Whether or not you approve of it, is pointless to me, and I'm guessing that we're not on the same server anyway.   But when people start wising up to your tactics, I hope that people like you don't claim that warriors are underpowered because everything we have is so underpowered.  Warriors in PvP do the exact same goddamned things they do in PvE in this game....they cripple shit and make it easier for DPS classes to kill people.</div></div><hr />

Since I'm a guy who spent points on tactical mastery, my highest damage combat ability in situation is execute.  Just like any other warrior.  I also get to enjoy the juicy goodness of overpower, cleave, whirlwind, etc...<br />
<br />
One can deal out more damage with a wet newspaper than you can with rend.   At level 50 it adds up to about 168 damage over 21 seconds.  About 1 normal hit with a 1hander.  Heroic strike might actually *BE* a better use of rage than that craptastic skill (at least your going to get your full damage in on a mob or a player that way. )<br />

Ah, I wasn't aware that you were completely protection based, even in mind.  So who kills your mobs for you?  It's clear that you're not doing any fucking damage.   Lets go thru the warrior skills and compare, damage to rage on a single target eh?<br />
<br />
Oh, and on anything that's &quot;Next melee,&quot; we're gonna add 5 rage to it, because that's the bare minimum rage you're going to lose out on for using that skill.<br />

Cleave 20 rage, weapon damage +50, next melee.   We can ignore weapon damage, because you would be doing it anyway.  2 damage per rage.  Wheee.<br />
<br />
Hamstring 10 rage, 45 damage, instant.  4.5 damage per rage.  (Better than cleave if you're fighting one target).<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike, 15 Rage, Damage + 124, next melee.  Once again, we ignore weapon damage, because you'd be doing it anyway.  6.2 damage per rage.   Incredible skill you've got going here.<br />
<br />
Mocking Blow  10 rage, 93 damage, instant.   9.3 damage per rage.<br />
<br />
Overpower 5 rage, variable, instant.  Varies quite a bit depending on target's dodge rate and your weapon damage.  Overall, pretty decent skill, but definitely not consistent.<br />
<br />
Rend  10 rage, 196 damage, instant.  19.6 damage per rage.<br />
<br />
Revenge 5 rage, 64-78 damage, instant.  14.2 damage per rage, but also dependant on your defensive skill rate.<br />
<br />
Execute...while nice, shouldn't really be considered in the same league, because of it's health restrictions.  a 1k crit on a mob with 200hp still only does 200hp of damage.<br />
<br />
Slam...useless while tanking.  Definitely the best skill theoretically, but no one uses it.<br />
<br />
So, uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, you're completely opposed to doing fucking damage?  Rend doubles up every single skill except for Revenge, and quite frankly, with Revenge's rage cost, you should be more than capable of spamming revenge and still have plenty left over for Rend.  <br />
<br />
Didn't have time to figure this shit out in closed beta I take it?  <br />
<br />
Time to take one of your quotes, and turn it around.  The moment you called rage &quot;pathetic damage&quot; is the moment you lost all credibility around here.  And it's not a subjective choice of your PvP style either..it's straight up math.  If rend had use conditions like overpower or revenge, you might have a point.  If rend's damage were over 90 seconds, you might have a point, but fact of the matter is, you put your foot in your mouth here, and no amount of charging, or intercept, or fighting mages or anything else is gonna save you from that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That 100 points of damage or whatever those attacks would have added up to is Damage PREVENTION ... not damage mitigation Haas is correct in that this is NOT mitigation.  But I don't think haas is correct in that it don't do anything for you.  The shield block is the damage mitigation.   Together they add up to the total damage not taken from using the combo.   <br />
<br />
It's simple logic that if a mob stands areound for 8 to 10 seconds not attacking in X amount of time it's gonna put out less damage than if he never get's stunned.<br />
<br />
Now that being said, I agree with Haas that it's pretty damn dumb to have stun's become less effective per stun.  To limit the effectiveness of stuns, mob's/ PC's SHOULD become immune after 3 stuns(I would prefer 4 ... but I'm prot specced :) ) However, all the stun's that lead up to that immunity SHOULD land for full duration IMO.   <br />
<br />
I think the gist of all this  is that 1 concussion blow and the first revenge(if it's time right) will likely  avoid 3 combat rounds of attacks that normally WOULD have been thrown agaisnt you ... however after that, the shortened duration and immunity of the stuns makes any further ones useless as the stun duration is SHORTER than the mobs attack delay and are only really usefull for delaying casters till bash/pummel has refreshed(and even then only if your really quick on the buttons).<br />
<br />
I think they need to get rid of the lessened duration on stuns.   Keep the immunity after X amount of stuns to avoid the possibility of stun lock down, but let the stuns last the full duration they were intended to to help the Prot specced warrior's ability to take less damage better equal an arms/prot warrior's ability to dish it out.   As it is now, there is an imbalance between the two where blizzard has said the intent is for them to be relatively equal.    If they were equal then the amount of down time when soloing for a prot warrior would be small enough to make up for the kill rate of an arms prot warrior soling ... and I can tell ya from experience this is not the case.  When I was arms/fury specced I had only a little more downtime with a MUCH higher kill rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right concept, but essentially not that good. Since the mob swings immediately after stun is released, and only one stun will be for full, usually only 1 attack will be avoided by it even if you land 3 stuns. (I.e. only the first stun is effective) However, have to love revenge on the monks in stratholm!<br />
<br />
The only way to really fix this is to add weapon delay to you first attack after being the victim of a stun. It's a simple, easy to impliment fix, wonder if they'll ever do it.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wish i could turn the stun off on revenge so i could still use it for aggro but have the full duration of concussive blow available when I need it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There aren't really any better ways to spend 10 rage. Against people who can cure it, it makes them waste time/mana to do so, if they're even willing. Simply getting them to do that was a good use of the rage. Rogue battles don't last as long, but having a DoT on a rogue is just precious. Rending another warrior prevents hamstring or stun/bandaging.  Besides that, as Haas mentioned it's the best rage/damage ratio a protection warrior has.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't saying it was good.   Cause it's not.   I was saying that is the Idea .. .the concept behind  much of the extra surviveability for a prot specced warrior(I can see no other reason for the stuns being in the prot tree).  Unfortunately because of the diminishing returns from stuns, it don't work that way.  If we had 4 stuns before immunity kicked in, and each stun lasted the full duration, you would see (if the stuns were timed right) a nice reduction in the damage you receive from fights.  Perhaps enough to offset the extra damage a arms fury warrior put's out and we could catch up a lil to our couterparts in solo ability cause of noticebly less down time.</div></div><hr />

Do we have to channel rend?  Nooooooo.<br />
Does rend take a melee swing?  Nooooooo.<br />

<br />
Furthermore, we're talking about PROTECTION here.  I know it's another gray area for you, but follow along, I'll try to type slow.  If a mob, or a person for that matter, does not stay alive for 21 seconds versus a protection warrior, they are grey.  They are A LOT grey.  This isn't about rend and your preference to use it in PvP or not, this is about rend being the most efficient way to blow your rage to do damage if you don't have mortal strike.  It most certainly is not crap damage if you have any idea of the concept of &quot;Damage over time&quot; effects.</div></div><hr />

Rend doesn't get mitigated, everything else listed does.  Sure your fights may be over in 15 seconds, but if you rend right after charge, that'll mean it'll tick at least 4 times.  That'll be 11.2 dmg per rage.  If you pretend that everything you're fighting has about 40% mitigation, then revenge is only 8.5 dmg per rage.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't add 50 damage for 20 rage, it adds weapon damage +50 on the second hit, +50 on your regular swing, since you normally would not get that second attack.  If you hit for say 200 that would be 300 extra damage for 20 rage, or 15 damage per rage (assuming you have a second target there)<br />

Yes, it is significantly better on multiple targets, but that wasn't really the point of the dissertation.  It was more to illustrate how rend is not worthless, in any sense of the word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I respec'd to an Arms/Fury build this weekend to see what the fuss was about (there goes the neighborhood).  I can say first hand that the notion that you have to have a prot build inorder to MT instances is 100% wrong.  It certainly didnt harm my aggro horribly but it did seem like I was loosing aggro a little bit easier.  Could have been the group too.<br />
<br />
The only noticable difference is you will get hit harder for not having the points in toughness.  I'm at 4.3kish AC now, and its plenty, but I did need more heals than before.  This only lead to one thing: longer down time.  That is to say we actually had to stop for 30 sec now and again for mana.  It wasnt that much better prot spec'd, I can say that, where we had to wait anyway cause the mobs (dps) lasted longer.<br />
<br />
The only place I can see prot spec shining over other specs would be on boss mob encounters that are actually challenging for your group.  There prot will shine as the tank will last a few hits longer.  But I dont think it will be talents saving your ass at that point, it'll be your gear.  As long as you're going for the highest HP/AC you can get your hands on, you'll tank just fine.<br />
<br />
Of course prot spec you'll tank that much better.  Then again, how many MT's can you really have on a raid (about the only time prot counts is on a PvE raid it seems)?</div></div><hr />

I hope anyone else who plans on tanking the mob is prot specced and just as talented out as you are with sunder, because nobody else can overwrite your sunders at that point.  It's an interesting point, but I'm not sure a possible 3-5% (I think thats what the mitigation was figured as in rough numbers) increase in melee damage is worth the loss of universal hate control.</div></div><hr />

Thats a function of sucking.  Just because you don't go protection dosen't mean your job in a group is to do damage unless you're told it is.  There is this mentality floating around that &quot;I'm &quot;blah blah spec class, I don't have to do my normal job,&quot; and it's complete bullshit.  Talents -assist- you in performing tasks, they don't get you out of doing your main job.</div></div><hr />

If you are raiding I'd hope all your warriors have it. Rogues and Hunters do crazy damage to a max sundered mob. By the time you drop 5th sunder you're usually well into the linear part of the AC curve and an extra -750 AC is a noticable damage increase. Sorry i haven't catalogued the #'s other than spot checking what revenge does at the start vs max debuff, but its definitely enough to warrant the points especially if you raid at all.</div></div><hr />

I blame the hitpoints table mainly and their choice of gear and/or skill. I have friends playing priests. They haven't complained about anything, we've done a lot of instances together upto Sunken Temple.<br />
<br />
Never found the need to go prot. See that's the question I put forward to the original poster in the next post, and he never replied to the thread. It would have been informative. It strongly suggests to me that his claim is all made up. Or perhaps it requires a drug to practically notice the difference a full prot spec provides. If it's not made up, he should have pointed out why a 13 prot is useless and a full prot is required for end game instances like I asked him to.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I do feel that a warrior's hitpoints aren't what they should be even while having a lot of stamina. I need to eat stamina food and switch some items only to make my hitpoints equal to those of a level 60 hunter's bear pet (bear is somewhere near 4200 hp). It looks funny, myself being lvl 56. Every item I have has got stamina unless it's a shirt or a guild tabard etc. And I have all blue items except bp and legs.</div></div><hr />

When your on the bleeding edge of what you can and cannot kill, as an MT you need to take every advantage you can get.  This is how prot spec comes into play imo.  I wouldnt fuck with it before that.  Its really boring anyway and it sucks for pvp.</div></div><hr />

What was the bear's AC?  In my experience bear AC is quite a lot lower than a &quot;real&quot; tank's AC (and lower than a VW pet) and the HP are high.  With how hard some of the bosses hit, significantly higher AC would provide a much needed advantage, I'd think.</div></div><hr />

For lower level instances, maybe even Scholo/Strath/UBRS although I've never done those non-Prot specced, you really don't have to be.  Do not get improved Sunder, all other Warriors on raids will kill you as they won't be able to stack and add on to your sunder. (No level 60 raiding Warriors that I know of have this)  Even when you do go a lot of Prot, I'd say the most essential ones to have are shield spec, toughness, improve shield block, and improve taunt.

Shooting yourselves in the foot if you are raiding the core and not coordinating talent specs to have it, in all honesty.

Untalented Sunder leaves off at 2250, roughly equivalent to my 4th sunder. So basically, you are throwing away anywhere from 10% to up to 14% DPS on every melee in the entire party/raid. Name another talent you get that much bang for the buck for.</div></div><hr />

It would require all of our Warriors having it, as it won't stack if someone doesn't.  Just never made much sense to invest talents into it.  I'm not saying Sunder isn't huge for DPS, I've always said that it is, but imp sunder is not something you want as a raiding Warrior.  (unless everyone else has it or something, which will not be the case)</div></div><hr />

oh no argument there, but there is a stacking issue that you gotta worry about.  Rogues and other warriors can mess you up.  And if you take a dirt nap, the next guy in line to tank may not be able to land a sunder beacause &quot;a more powerful spell is already active.&quot; =\<br />
<br />
I usually have another warrior in my group and even when you corridinate the stacking issue still happens (habits can be a bitch to break).  Revenge and Shield Bash still work great aggro wise at that point.</div></div><hr />

also I skipped improved sunder as have most warriors I've spoken with on my server. it's nice but ehhh.</div></div><hr />

enjoy )<br />

I'm well aware of how to get aggro, it's just that a grand majority of people are just going to aim for Sunders for quick aggro, and the cries of &quot;WTF&quot; will be heard all around if you're unlucky enough to bite it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're the only warrior, EVER, then Yeah, improved sunder rocks.<br />
<br />
But if you're raiding at all, with other people with different talent builds, it makes a fuckton of sense for everyone to NOT get that talent.</div></div><hr />

You still have options in most cases.  <br />
<br />
Of course if taunt, mocking blow, &amp; challenging shout dont work on the mob, sunders all you got to turn it.</div></div><hr />

This would allow the improved Sundar to be viable, yet not mandetory.</div></div><hr />

We did 15 man last night with 3 warrior and no CC at all and I had a blast.  But keeping aggro on 2 or 3 mobs cannot be done if you waste your rage using MS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They dynamics only change if you've been zerging.  If you're busy MS'ing and slamming when you should be tanking, you suck.   The fundamentals of tanking are still the same no matter what the spec is.  (Btw, I had plenty of rage to burn on MS and cleave while keeping hate).<br />
<br />
Strath and scholo are still 5 man, whether you bring 10 or not.   UBRS is probably 10 mannable, but it would sure take a lot longer than with 15.</div></div><hr />
