<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The GM of the armor type youre turning in, ie any warrior GM (I think, maybe PoK only) if youre turning in indicolite etc.. I never turned in anything other than hate armor. Its not bad xp really if you go to hate and fight around maestro room its 3% or so per kill and fast kills + all the armor drops are xp. Elemental+ xp is still better by far though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No drop armors from Hate are turned in to Class guildmasters in Pok, To find the right GM Hail him and say &quot;What armor?&quot; If they are the right NPC they will respond and mention the type of armor they are looking for.<br />
<br />
They give about 4% AAexp and a gem per turn in, I myself have only gotten diamonds but other folks say they've gotten peridots as well so it can vary.  I'm thinking it might have to do with the type of armor since i've only ever turned in Warrior peices.</div></div><hr />

We got periodts, diamonds, and a blue diamond in exchange for armor from Hate. I think it was mostly shaman and rogue stuff, but I can't recall.</div></div><hr />

Have gotten anywhere from Peridots to Blue Diamonds. They also will not take the no drop weapons only the armor.</div></div><hr />
