Will lower your dps put the proc is serious aggro. Not sure about getting AE taunt for a Fear raid not sure with the very large aggro range in Fear if that is a good idea or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Valor, you're probably not encountering more than one mob every 30 seconds, so you can use your new Incite line ability on each one.<br />
<br />
In Fear, the mobs are easier and have fewer hitpoints and you don't have to wait for pulls, they just seem to make their own way towards you, so you can't use that ability on all of them.  Add in the asslings that teleport you around and the undead that have different agro rules and you have a situation that is a lot harder to MT.<br />
<br />
If you're using the same group you do in Valor, your problem probably isn't your weapon, but your technique.  That's not to say that a GSoT wouldn't make things easier, or, better yet, CHoS/SotB since you don't have to worry about serious ripostes.</div></div><hr />
