<br />
The differences are multiplicative if you look at percentage of damage taken instead of looking at percentage of damage mitigated. It doesn't matter how much was mitigated, it matters how much actual damage was done.</div></div><hr />

Yes things aren't perfect with todays game but you don't have to run around crying in every post or enciting internet flame wars with witty one liners that took an afternoon to think of. 60% of this boards posts are nothing but trash now days, pathetic.</div></div><hr />

The answer is, as you suggested, that warriors need a boost.  Name one signficant improvement that has been made to the warrior class since Velious.  Casters (hybrids included) have gotten tons of new spells and huge improvements in mana regeneration.  The whole problem we have now is because warriors haven't evolved with the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before these forums were made, it was the same thing, but in the Arena and the Tavern.  We gave up on trying to stop it, and chose to just isolate it instead.</div></div><hr />

It gives us whiny overpowered hybrids a place to rant and argue the stupidest things in everquest with you whiny underpowered warriors without cluttering the useful portions of your board :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
To me evolution is supposed to be about making things better, in amongst all the improvements i think we're also getting too much of a good thing messing stuff up as well. <br />
<br />
My examples? Trivialised mob control as standard, massive mana pools and regen making for no need to use spells well and sparingly for best effect, AA's and itemisation creating massive disparities between player types and blurring the lines neccessary to keep classes distinguished. <br />
<br />
All this seems retrograde to me.<br />
<br />
But then i'm a pessimistic shite ;)</div></div><hr />
