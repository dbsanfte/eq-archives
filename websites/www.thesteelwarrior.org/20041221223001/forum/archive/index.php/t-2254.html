<br />
Here is a log from a recent fight we had against Lord Mithaniel Marr:<br />
<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:35 2003] New_Warrior assumes a defensive fighting style.<br />
<br />
New_Warrior gets ready for his turn up to bat.  We're already a little late here, and defensive has already run out on Old_Warrior.  Unfortunately, my position when I captured this log was such that I could see melee damage from Mithaniel Marr, but not from our warriors.<br />
<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:35 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 2096 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:35 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1659 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:36 2003] Cleric_One tells CHR:2, 'CH inc on New_Warrior, Cleric_Two is next!'<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:36 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits New_Warrior for 654 points of damage.<br />
<br />
New_Warrior must have fired area taunt to pull agro off Old_Warrior. Two problems though. First, he fired it the same time as Cleric_One fires the first CH. That leaves him naked and heal-free for 10 seconds.  <br />
<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:36 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 2096 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:36 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1222 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:37 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1484 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Second problem is that Old_Warrior is still there, whacking away. Mithaniel goes right back to her. When its time to switch, the existing MT has to stop attacking. right?<br />
<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:37 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits New_Warrior for 1222 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:38 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1135 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:40 2003] Cleric_Two tells CHR:2, 'CH inc to New_Warrior &lt;&lt;&lt;Cleric_Three&gt;&gt;&gt; is next'<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:40 2003] Cleric_Two tells the group, 'CH inc to New_Warrior'<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:41 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1047 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:41 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 2096 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:41 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr goes on a RAMPAGE!<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:41 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1572 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:41 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1834 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Ok, the switch was attempted, but failed. Here are my thoughts on this. The tank switch affects more than just the CH chain and the warriors. Before we make the switch, should we have melee disengage briefly and take a step back?<br />
<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:42 2003] Cleric_Three tells CHR:2, 'inc CH on New_Warrior ,,Cleric_Four your next !!'<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:42 2003] Old_Warrior goes into a berserker frenzy!<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:42 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr rises his sword in honor as another falls before the might of Marr.<br />
<br />
Boom, Old_Warrior dead. Melee are still in there though...<br />
<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:43 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Random_Melee_one for 2096 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:43 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Random_Melee_one for 2009 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:45 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Random_Melee_one for 872 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:45 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr rises his sword in honor as another falls before the might of Marr.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:45 2003] Random_Melee_one has been stuck by the valor of Mithaniel.<br />
[Sun Jul 27 20:46:45 2003] Random_Melee_one has been slain by Lord Mithaniel Marr!<br />
<br />
Nice knowing ya, Random_Melee_one...<br />
<br />
After this point, a few more random melee got direct agro and killed before New_Warrior established solid agro and the fight continued.  (We won the fight, but I want to understand how we could improve the switch, which would largely trivialize this encounter for us.)<br />

old tank attack off<br />
new tank defensive / attack on / ae taunt -  there is no need for anyone(other then old MA, who is a dumb ass if he still attacking without defensive with agro weapons and deserves to die) to disengage mob unless old MA dies prior to taunt... and if you are doing MM I shouldnt even be telling you this or this thread may end up like Hydrotha thread... with frogs and french ppl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deimos</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casai,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answer on how to execute an area taunt.  Got it.<br />
<br />
Obviously, my knowledge of how taunt and area taunt works is incorrect though - because now I'm not understanding the agro bounce after the old warrior died.  <br />
<br />
Area taunt should have put new warrior at the top of the list, yes?  Log shows that it did - so far, everything is good.<br />
<br />
Old warrior still whacking way bounced her back up over new warrior.  Great, can understand how that would happen.<br />
<br />
Except, now I should have old warrior at the top, and new warrior just under.  Why did agro start bouncing to random melee after old warrior died?  Shouldn't new warrior have been at the top now?<br />
<br />
As far as the rest, Mithaniel is the first mob I've ever fought (and by extension, the first mob that my guild has ever fought) where a tank switch was even remotely required.  Whether or not we should have fought others before is largely academic (though, ironically, we did fight AOW for our first time last night - which I believe was one of the first mobs where tank switching became the norm?).<br />
<br />
--D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">all of your understanding is correct, but since I am not seeing actual log I cant comment on what happened. A few explanations are that the new warrior either didnt not taunt and just ate rampage/reposte dmg or whatever or that new warrior not as good at keeping agro as the old on. Could be also someone overagroed at same time as MA swtich was happening. There are way too many lil things that could go worng.<br />
<br />
Also SA could have been on god damn rampage list that would make me chuckle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say teach New_Warrior how to maintain agro and/or teach Random_Melee that they wanna be itty bitty baby annoyances during the tank transition. <br />
<br />
Almost two rounds of combat occurred between New_Warrior taunting and Old_Warrior dying.  Obviously the initial problem is that Old_Warrior had great agro and didn't allow the new guy to taunt it off him and keep it off him.  He screwed up.  When that happened agro was shot.   After AE taunt is blown by a fubar transition New_Warrior needed some time to establish agro (one round to taunt or a couple procs).  <br />
<br />
Cas has the right of it.  TA needs to turn attack off in order to allow a smooth transition.  It would have been just as smooth had Old_Warrior just died and THEN the new guy AE taunted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry to say Vigdis SangCaru, but my taunt works different then yours or something. Because what you have posted just does not apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt = high agro + 1.<br />
<br />
Yes?<br />
<br />
Then in order to establish primary agro you need a successful taunt and you need others to permit you to build up agro with DPS/Procs.  Works the same for everyone and I'm pretty sure I have the formula down - albeit there are always threads upon threads regarding how taunt really works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New warrior didn't AE taunt or the AE taunt was out of range.  It wouldn't have bounced if he picked up the solid aggro.  Also you want to AE taunt BEFORE the person at the height of aggro dies if you're going to do so.  The normal way I handle it (And we don't do called MT switches normally so it's slightly different) is as follows:<br />
<br />
Old_Tank dies/announces disc is down.<br />
New_Tank announces he's taking aggro over.<br />
All clerics in loop switch to New_Tank on their next loop<br />
All Rangers/Paladins/Druids/Shamans target New_Tank and begin casting their fastest casting Heal spell.<br />
All other melee's turn off attack<br />
New_Tank hit's defensive disc.<br />
New_Tank waits 2-3 seconds for heals to start landing / CH to start getting near done.<br />
New_Tank hits AE - Taunt.<br />
New_Tank insures he has 5 - 15 seconds of solid aggro.<br />
New_Tank calls for melee's to attack the target again.<br />
<br />
You need to let the heals stabilize BEFORE taking aggro, and you need to ensure that it doesn't bounce around too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">k since I am feeling nice today I'll explain it once how taunt works...<br />
Taunt puts you on top of hate list. If original MA hasnt died he has already established agro above and beyond those on raid. There is no need to let next tank to build agro unless MA dies prior to next tank landing a taunt. If MA isnt dumb and understands he needs to lay off agro. He would stop attacking good 20-30 seconds and switch to dps setup so he wont grab agro from new defensive MA.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse if your next tank has not very good agro weapon setup you could let him build agro, but that should be done only if SA's weapons are much more infereor then MA's. If it is the case, you should try equiping more then one tank. I'll let you on a lil secret you want to have at least 2 close in equipment and hopefully AAs warriors who raid alot. Ideally a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cas, I'm pretty sure we just explained the same thing.  And I'm pretty sure our taunt buttons are identical - but maybe yours is decorated with troll blossoms. /tease  Regardless, you didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.  If the first taunt failed in the scenario explained by Deimos, and according to his story it sure as hell did, then SA needed some more time to get a successful taunt or proc onto primary agro.  <br />
<br />
AE taunt can bounce just like any other agro.  Could happen for any number of reasons here, including that the MA taunted, proc'd, flurried, or probably more likely got low health agro. <br />
<br />
I've never been in a rotation where the gameplan was to allow a tank to die.  But I have been in situations where the MA did die and I was SA. I simply hit AE, hit def, was spam healed until CH rotation landed, and the fighting continued.  Hence, I theorize that if a guild wanted they could base a rotation off that same scenario except the healing could be better orchestrated. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) hitting defensive then AE Taunt then hoping for heals has led me to more bind points then anything else :)<br />
<br />
2) Looking back at the original logs we see:<br />

[Sun Jul 27 20:46:36 2003] Lord Mithaniel Marr hits Old_Warrior for 1222 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Unless they lowered MachoMan's delay new warrior ate a riposte and NEVER had aggro...  So either AE Taunt didn't land or it wasn't hit...</div></div><hr />

<br />
k in my taunt scenario there is no such thing as &quot;shot&quot; agro. There is no need for raid to back off unless MA dies before the taunt. Unless you meant to say something different or I just plain dont get this paragraph, we disagree.</div></div><hr />

MM doesnt rampage, he gives message but he doesnt actually rampage, i'm pretty sure its a flurry ala PoE, but I dont know for sure.. but i know he doesnt ramapage cause if he did our clerics would get assraped when we do him on pull  cause we never set page on him, and they dont</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. All Melees have to do attack of for the new tank to grab aggro. Then the new MT has a bit time to establisch aggro.<br />
<br />
or. A ranger step in grapping aggro using weaponshield. In that tim the new MT hits taunt and works for his aggro and the clericchain changes her target, so when aggro goes to the new Mt the chain is running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">k since I dont wana give out any info on this mob I am leaving this thread you can think all you want.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarix</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE Taunt seems to work fine for all the mobs we do currently as a mechanism of tank switching. Tho we dont usually switch tanks at all unless a warrior dies, so there is no issues with the previous tank having to allow the next tank to aggro. Simply once the prefvious tank dies wait untill the CH rotation starts to land on you, hit defenisve and AE taunt.<br />
<br />
For some mobs that have really large dps we tend to use bridge tanks. These are usually warriors with ae taunt using riposte disc to give the next tank in line 10sec or so for the ch rotation to become established on him. Typical setup for reparm is warriors on tank list alternate between defensive and riposte discs. The riposte tanks disc and AE taunt when the previous defenisve tank is killed to buy time for heals to get started on the next defensive tank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mithaniel Marr does not rampage.  It may say he does, but he doesn't actually do it, like almost everything in PoEarth and Xegony.<br />
<br />
With PoP it's pretty much pointless to talk about a tank switch.  You're not going to switch a tank just because the disc is down because that creates more trouble than it's worth, and you certainly don't know when the previous tank is going to die.  Just hit AE taunt when you're getting heals.  Who cares who else the mob is killing?  That even include clerics since usually the number of clerics usually vastly outnumber the number of well-equipped warriors.  Everyone else doesn't even matter if they die.  Actually it's a good thing for anyone else to die because that's not another warrior or cleric dead.  <br />
<br />
If you have confidence in your cleric's ability to react or the mob's inability to one round you, it's actually pretty trivial for a backup warrior to ensure he's the next person on the aggro list when the MT dies.  For example, if MT is using a Blade of War and so are you, assuming you don't steal aggro you're almost certainly #2 on the aggro list, unless you've some zealous nukers (in that case, it's actually better since they buffer for the tank switches).  In fact it's so easy you actually want to avoid being #2 on the aggro list because generally speaking you can't count on clerics reacting fast enough to save you if you get aggro the moment MT dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he did that then why did the random meleers die when Old_Tank did? :)  AE Taunt wasn't hit or it was out of range.  There's some zone geometry at the spot we fight him that could lead to that.<br />
<br />
And Wychway... Assuming that the guild in question hasn't done Bert yet, MM is the highest melee output mob they're likely to have faced up to that point.  Which is why they may be looking to reduce things with tank switch.  Later in the expansion you fight mobs with MachoMan's DPS output that also has fun of constantly blurring himself :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a mixture of Warlord's and some Ornate on our main tank, plus whatever we've been able to scrounge from PoP mobs.  Right now, all three main tanks are sitting between 8300-8400 raid buffed hit points.<br />

Downside is, a lot of the tactics that are old hat to more experienced guilds are brand new to us.  Hence the reason for this thread to begin with.<br />

/disc Defensive<br />
/pause 600, /rs Tanking &gt;&gt;&gt; %t &lt;&lt;&lt;with the Bigg D, 3 minutes left!<br />
/pause 600, /rs Tanking &gt;&gt;&gt; %t &lt;&lt;&lt; with the Bigg D, 2 minutes left!<br />
/pause 450, /rs Tanking &gt;&gt;&gt; %t &lt;&lt;&lt; with the Bigg D, 1 minute left!<br />
/rs HOLY CRAP the Bigg D is down in 15 seconds get ready!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not positive about what the numbers are but the pause relates to the next line. So it says the line then does the pause for 600. It then says the next line...<br />

Adjust for lag to your machine!</div></div><hr />

No point taunting before you know heals are inc coz a 2k hitting mob is gonna make a stain of you before they land otherwise.</div></div><hr />

I would have to look at home at what it actually is but I have a hot key that used to use to give off my defensive status. DO NOT make a hotkey announcing your defensive status.<br />
<br />
Adjust for lag to your machine!  Because this is impossible to do accurately. You get a lag spike - your hotkey timer is hosed now. Have a little more lag in this zone than another - your hotkey timer is hosed now. When you are fighting a mob that can potentially 1 round you, having your timer off by 10 seconds - 5% error - is way more than enough time for you to be splattered before your clerics can adjust to the extra 40% damage you will be taking. Keep in mind that the heal that is saving your ass right now, was cast 10 seconds ago so there has to be a pretty substancial lead time for the cheal rot to adjust to non-defensive tanking.<br />
<br />
If you really want to make hotkeys to warn the clerics, just make the warning key -<br />
<br />
/rs 60 sec left on defensive<br />
<br />
Then use /disc to see the current amount of time left before you can use a disc again and do the math so you know when to press the button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just tap /disc periodically, or use a stopwatch at my desk, to track the time, and then just call it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your disc will go down at 4 minutes 30 seconds to reuse if evasive, 7 minutes 30 seconds if defensive if I recall correctly.  Use /disc to see how much time to reuse to determine how close the disc is falling.  However announcing discs is PoP is fairly useless.  It's hard for me to imagine why you'd have two different types of heals (disc and undisc) for any PoP uber that dishes out meaningful melee damage.  Well you can get more assist heals from secondary healers I guess but I'd say 90% if not more of the healing is still handled by the chain and if they're not doing it right you'd still be dead.</div></div><hr />

Have a mixture of Warlord's and some Ornate on our main tank, plus whatever we've been able to scrounge from PoP mobs.  Right now, all three main tanks are sitting between 8300-8400 raid buffed hit points.<br />

Tactics and skill will only get you so far in PoP unfortuantely. There's a point where you absolutely have to have the hp on your tanks, mana on your clerics and DPS on everyone else. You're starting to hit the wall, or at least get very close. I give you major props for getting this far without being a zerg guild. Very well done!</div></div><hr />

I haven't killed anything bigger than Rydda and Mith Marr, but in general I agree with the other posters, tank switches are generally more trouble than they're worth.  Keep your first tank up as long as you can and go to the next tank when he dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have loh and spam heals ready to go on the next tank with a rune and ss if neccessary. if ppl know ahead of time the next tank, they can normally save him even if the mob turns right to him with a few remedies for 2k hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, that usually only happens on mobs where we don't care who's tanking next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Better way to do it:<br />
<br />
- MT goes defensive and builds aggro<br />
- rest of raid engages<br />
- defensive wears off<br />
- patch healers spam MT with quick heals to make up for lack of defensive<br />
- MT continues to tank until mob dies or until he dies<br />
- if MT dies then 2nd tank pops defensive and then taunts<br />
- if taunt fails 2nd tank pops AE taunt<br />
- repeat until mob dies</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's easiest if you just buffer the tank switch with people who overaggro.  The only way this can fail is if everyone is actually managing their aggro, but this almost never happens.  Actually, if people are all managing their aggro like they should, that would mean on your tank switches and/or MT deaths, you'd stand to lose people who are actually important (warriors and clerics) as opposed to everyone else.</div></div><hr />
