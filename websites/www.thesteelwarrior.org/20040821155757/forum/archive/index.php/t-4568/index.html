<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As of Dec 02 the new melee changes are on the test server.  I logged on yesterday and there were merchants in West Commons by at the old dark elf tents in the north east corner of the zone.  You buy a tome from one of the 3 merchants appropriate to your class (cost 2 coppers each) and then give it back to the merchant to train it.  Then Ctrl+C (I think) brings up the melee skills window and you right click the blank buttons to activate the skills you have.<br />
<br />
They had a test mob there to hit when I went there and I hit it for a half hour or so with my level 25 warrior and got about 10 openings to use a new skill.  None of the skills seemed to do anything at all and the openings seemed to be pretty rare.  Also, the window of oportunity to use a skill seems way too short.  <br />
<br />
All things considered, I don't see how this system is going to be ready by Dec 16 or so when they said they were putting it on the normal servers.  It looks like they have a huge amount of work to do on this still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alt - C for the window.  My thoughts exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On test while I was there I found the following problems:<br />
<br />
1) The rate of openings was insanely low.<br />
2) The window of oportunity was also insanely small.<br />
3) I did not have anything on my chat window that alerted me to the opening.  To me, staring at the &quot;combat skill&quot; window to make sure I don't miss out on the opening, or staring at the skill so I can find out when it becomes &quot;ungreyed&quot; is not an option.<br />
4) The skills did absolutetly nothing.<br />
<br />
I am sure that the reason for some of these is that the skills aren't actually completetly implemented yet.  Hopefully they'll get some working soon and fix the window of oportunity and chat message etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=tome+of&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
thats the list of all the melee &quot;spells&quot;<br />
<br />
seems some of the descriptions seems fucked up though, like it says defensive decreases your melee mitigation :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The skills were working only on dev clients as of yesterday, same with the disciplines. I heard it was fixed today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is the &quot;first impressions&quot; post I made on FoHGuild.org since this board was down.<br />
<br />
My main issues were the same as Furor and Frodlin listed. The openings are too rare, and too short. According to my log, I got 63 weapon procs (dual wielding unaugmented bloodfrenzy and blade of carnage) and 25 openings of some sort in the same time. Not horribly rare, but it wouldn't be unusual at all for a fight to go by with no openings at all.<br />
<br />
The real problem was with the duration though. I didn't time it but it seemed like 2-3 seconds for an opening, so if you're not staring at the box all the time you'll miss them. Also, even if you see the opening, having to read what type it is (there were &quot;offensive&quot;, &quot;defensive&quot; and &quot;special&quot; openings), decide which one you want to do, and either mouse click it or Cntrl+Number is a lot to do in 2-3 seconds. If you're moving a mob or sending a tell or something when it comes up, chances are you're going to miss it.<br />
<br />
I /feedbacked that there should be some kind of sound or particle effect or even an alert that pops up in the middle of your screen or something when there's an opening because staring at the box waiting for an opening to come up was lame, especially when they're only happening every 2-3 minutes. I also hope there is some way to put these into a macro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Provoke&quot; is definitely promising, as is the 4 sec stun and a few others. I just hope they make it a little easier to hit those openings because I could tell just from the half hour or so I beat on the big goon in WC last night that staring at your combat abilities all the time while fighting sucks, and it's pretty much necessary if you don't want to miss the openings right now. <br />
<br />
Last night's patch message said that they had increased the proc rate of the openings.  Unfortunately they took out the &quot;opening chance reset!&quot; message so it's not possible to parse the proc rate from your log anymore.  I would still say they went off less than my weapon procs but that's about the best I could guess.  The duration may be longer as well.  Either that or I am just starting to get used to it, but I didn't have a lot of trouble hitting the buttons when openings popped up last night in an exp group (I have been hitting the buttons just for practice even though they currently don't do anything).  I imagine, like disciplines we will use 2 or 3 of the abilities most of the time so decision making about which ability to use in a given situation should get easier as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure if this has been brought up yet . . .<br />
<br />
They did increase the number of openings you get, although it is still very low.  I proc with weapons much more often than openings are likly to happen.<br />
<br />
The problem is not the number of openings you get it is can you make use of the opening.  I only have a level 25 war on test, but i was fighting in Mseru and averaged about 2 openings a mob.  Usually only offensive openings were available.  First time it poped up, all the hotkeys for my 3 abilities became available, and i clicked &quot;head bash&quot;.  I saw a fancy animation, but i had no idea what i actually acomplished (and there is no adequate description of what these skills do).  Later on during the fight an opening occurred, but none of my buttons were available (i must assume i did not have the ability for that opening).  Next mob comes and I get another opening and get my buttons available again, only when i press flurry, i find that &quot;you cannot use this ability for 7:05 min&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I was thinking these combat abilities were going to be pretty cool, but with reuse timers on the abilities . . . i think i'll save all the my money for something else.  The abilities will be mere toy's that will do nothing, and get used about as often as we use &quot;/disc resistant&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Warrior Spell list by level <br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?classes=WAR&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
And holy crap we get a lot of them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">these new abilities really shouldn't depend on openings. I mean, think about it, they say it requires an opening in combat... who kinda opening do YOU know that actually is open for a couple, or even several seconds? They're usually just split seconds. So they can't fall back on the realism defense.<br />
<br />
No, these abilities should be able to be activated on demand, otherwise it's just more dependance on the RNG, and the requirement for openings means that the abilities will not be used all that often, and there will be minimal benefit to the pure melee for using them. Especially with the absolutely puny duration on many of these effects, with how little they seem to occur.<br />
<br />
In its present form, this isn't balance... this is being thrown a bone. Especially with the design that apparently, taking advantage of openings while under the effects of a disc, as being under the effects of an opening ability will break the use of a discipline....<br />
<br />
Yeah, this stuff's pretty useless. Remove the need for openings and its attendant inability to use any of this stuff on demand, leaving endurance as balance, and up the duration fairly significantly on most of the abilities, and it might approach being worthwhile to use. Until then it's pretty much a waste of time and effort for everyone involved, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe that it should have been a combination of both, Openings and new skills on demand with endurance cost.  That would at least keep someone from simply using skill skill skill skill skill skill skill etc.. without ever thinking &quot;shit if I don't have endurnace for this other yada yada yada I won't be able to go defensive for some &quot;extra&quot; time&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of implementing everything as an opening it should have been more like D&amp;D.  Melee's would now get &quot;feats&quot; they can simply perform at a cost and the openings should have pretty much just translated into &quot;attacks of opportunity&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I haven't logged on test so I can't really confirm this, but in SoE's article about the new melee system, and in the live chat they did say that some of the skills would not be based on openings. Not ALL of them require an opening. I could be wrong though. I'm sure we'll know more when the abilities actually work on test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fafnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think these abilities are pretty unfun as implemented.<br />
<br />
Needs, with this system:<br />
* skills without openings - you want to drive the pace of combat, not &quot;get lucky&quot;;<br />
* (various) auto reactions.<br />
<br />
To explain the last one, preferred responses to openings are largely the same every time dependent on your role in the group.  Examples:<br />
* if you are tanking, generally you want to either add more agro or take less damage<br />
* if you are raiding but not tanking, you either want to do more DPS or to help the MT take less damage<br />
* if you are just in a DPS role, you just want to do more DPS.<br />
<br />
So, since the result is very often dedicated to one reaction linked to your role in the group/raid, then just<br />
<br />
/setautostyle #<br />
<br />
where # gives the type of reaction you do to a particular opening automatically.  To turn it off and go to the clicky approach (or to conserve endurance for use of something proactive, like evasive/defensive), just put in a 0.<br />
<br />
This seems like a useful addition to me - take the reaction time out of it, but be less flexible in how you react to openings.<br />
<br />
Kinda defeats the purpose of putting them in in the first place, eh?  I mean, if you are tanking and want to take less damage, by making it auto just works like increasing your chance to dodge or riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The autostyle thing would be nice.<br />
<br />
Here is a little more detailed version that I was thinking about after I read the above post:<br />
<br />
First of all, perhaps we could create and name our own autostyle categories, perhaps up to 10 of them or so and only one of them could be activated at once from a special menu.  Lets say I had defined some autostyle categories such as &lt;Aggressive + Low Agro:1&gt;, &lt;Neutral:2&gt;, and &lt;Defensive + High Agro:3&gt;.   I could then have the game auto apply each skill based on how I decide it should be categorized.  The autostyes would be a sort of programable AI that a person could set up so thier character would implement the skills as they want it to.<br />
<br />
For example I assign &quot;Provoke&quot; to go off when I have my autostyle set to the &lt;Defensive + High Agro:3&gt; autostyle and when that autostyle is selected, my character uses provoke when the proper opening occurs.  I don't have to sit there staring at the melee skills box at all.<br />
<br />
When I go to Alt+C and right click &quot;Provoke&quot; there would be a slot where I could type in [0-9] or leave it [blank].  To associate with my &lt;Defensive + High Agro:3&gt; autostyle I would put [3] in the slot.  <br />
<br />
I could assign a skill to multiple autostyles by putting something like [2,3,4] in the slot.   Basically each player could assign each skill to whichever categories they decided.   Each skill could be set to manual activation as well by no number being entered [blank] such as you would want for disciplines.  If there were multiple skills assigned to a given autostyle you could either have it default to manual activation or randomly pick one of the choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Auto-style ? <br />
<br />
We already have that, its called AUTO_ATTACK...<br />
<br />
Please, this is designed NOT to be another auto attack feature. Disciplines are not opening related, the new Provoke (pure hate at range) is not opening related. They have said they will be adding more not opening related. Give it some time..<br />
<br />
To all the people saying this is just a bone they are throwing us, or that they are copying other games because of competotion...<br />
<br />
Look at the changes they are implementing...<br />
<br />
Look at our 'Brainstorming thread'<br />
<br />
Better Mitigation.. check<br />
Taunt message fail.. check<br />
Skills... check<br />
Unhooked Disciplines... check<br />
Ranged pure aggro ability... check<br />
better aggro abilities... check<br />
added dps abilities...check<br />
added utility... check<br />
<br />
<br />
My God people, give it a chance. You all are starting to sound like Paladins, or even worse..droods...<br />
<br />
Are these everything we wanted? No.<br />
Are they as powerful as we wanted? No answer to that yet, as everything is still in testing stage.<br />
Is this a start? YES<br />
<br />
personally, I prefer them starting slow, and if it doesn't meat expectations, scaling upwards. As much fun as it would be, I would hate to see them break everything, where a couple warriors could go solo in the Elementals with no other help. Sure it would be fun, but I didnt create a warrior to go solo. I made a warrior to be the center and focus of a killing team.<br />
<br />
This is, IMO, the best thing ever to happen to pure melee in EQ. Why ? you may ask. Because Now we have an Identical way to get upgraded every expansion, just like evry other class in the game. And all of the changes are easy to interpret and understand, because they work on the same system as the spells in the game. We know the mechanics. No longer is it hidden under smoke and mirrors.<br />
<br />
This gives them tools to implement to keep melee current and upgraded on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For those who are moaning without trying them, a few tidbits of info that *may* affect your opinion *slightly*.<br />
<br />
Provoke requires no opening, uses a trivial amount of endurance, does 165 hate directly, plus a hate dot effect for 1 minute, has a 30 second recyle and has 100 range.<br />
<br />
On the downside it locks the offensive melee skills while it's timer recharges, this may or may not be a bug.<br />
<br />
You may now return to your whining about how the changes suck and don't address warrior needs 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ryld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just seeking clarification, Velk;<br />
<br />
Does that mean skills like Bash/Slam/Kick etc. are locked while Provoke refreshes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i have not noticed kick being unavalible.<br />
<br />
but it is kinda cool pulling with it... <br />
<br />
range is 150.<br />
<br />
seems to help hold aggrro a bit.. not exactly eb but that + good proc weapon should = aggro lock much faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Landrain, sure we're getting the type of thing asked for... but it's like needing and asking for a Panzer, and getting an Austin Mini instead. They're WAY too weak and limited to be especially useful. Take provoke... the aggro on a provoke doesn't even cover ONE slow or tash, which is what it needs to cover. Let alone a reesist and recast.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way... go look up the poison skills for rogues... a LOT of people thought they were useless and not worth the time and effort involved. Well, ya know what? poison is OVERPOWERED compared to openings abilities.<br />
<br />
This new system is just way too weak and limited as it stands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snoedog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am scared.<br />
<br />
I read on the old bored (while this one was down) that the defense disc will be GONE!  And with nothing else to fill that spot warriors will have no advatages over nights, even with all this new trinket skills bs they are putting in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>zigak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">provoke is bullshit. enraging blow is 700 hate and a paladin who uses 1 stun will outagro 1 EB, so 165 hate is pointless. They should quadruple the endurance cost of provoke, remove the dot, and make it do + 800 hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am in love with provoke.   <br />
<br />
In Kael, I was grouepd with another 65 warrior and a cleric.   We had the cleric stunning the mobs, and a provoke + any amount of melee was able to pull the mob off.</div></div><hr />

This would be an increase of 15% less damage from mobs than before correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xahulz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Until you include the base 5% mitigation.  If they simply add, then this is about 10% more damage than before.</div></div><hr />

A large portion of the people in this thread complaining about the openings and how they work, were from people who WERE trying them.<br />
<br />
You know, on test, seeing how they worked. That kind of thing.<br />
<br />
I dunno about you but me ... I'm gonna take their word on it, if that's what they say from their very own in-game testing.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The biggest problem I saw was waiting for the brief opening, staring at the little skills menu.

<br />
Wow, you mean I should login to the test server, play a level 25 character so that I can see if the balance is in place for my level 65 character?  Sounds like a good plan.<br />
<br />
Yes, testing on a 25th level character is better than nothing... or is it?  Warriors weren't all *that* broke before level 40 or so, so what is testing a character that isn't all that bad off in the first place going to tell me about how well it works on a 65th level character?<br />
<br />
I suggested this and I would like to see other people do it.<br />
<br />
/feedback<br />
<br />
I would like to see a new feature on the test server.  /testbuff servername.charactername so that I can test balance on the character that I play and am most familiar with.  If you want people to tell you about balance, they should be using their character, with their gear instead of a level 25 character (how many people actually play a level 25 main anyway?), where they probably couldn't tell you thing 1 about existing balance... other than that Rangers are still out of balance and die in 15 seconds?  My character was level 25 for about 2 hours and has been level 65 for several months, I know a lot more about the game and it's state of balance with my character how (s)he is right now than I ever knew about balance at level 25.  Please allow me to test how this balance will affect my character, instead of testing balance on a character that I will never play more than 2 hours of.<br />
<br />
That will probably have many more players actually TEST balance for their characters.  Entire guilds will likely test balance at times, instead of just bored people, between raids, testing balance at level 25 on a character that is probably nothing like any character they are ever likely to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I like the provoke skill . . . heck i kinda dig all the skills in general.<br />
<br />
What i don;t like is that they work like disciplines and lock my bar all the time.  Sure they are all under 10 minutes so far but lets put it in perspective:<br />
<br />
On a normal night I do LDoN with a group of friends with my level 65 warrior.  We finish adventures with 50 - 40 minutes remaining on average.  We average a mob dead in about 30sec - 1min.  With some of these refresh timers I might get the option to use an ability once in a great while, but on average it's going to suck.<br />
<br />
I understand not wanting people to spam boss mob fights that take a little longer, but I think the refresh timers stink.  If and I say IF the reuse on provoke was 10 seconds (similar to a paly stun spell) then I think there would be a whole bunch of satisfied warriors running around.  As it is I am not sure the skills are going to be worth the cost in PP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Provoke seems the only half deced idea they've come up with in the whole scheme of things, even then it's lack lustre. The rest can be deleted for all I care.<br />
<br />
Opening system requiring anyone to stare at a window untill the ticker comes up (for a whole 3 seconds mind you) then making you chose wich of the 3+ abilities to use in that timeframe is total garbage. <br />
<br />
Is like a pack of scrawny birds fighting over bread crumbs an old lady is tossing to the ground while one fat ass bird is laying around cause he's been eating the bread slices directly. Sorry to burst anyones bubble but the fat ass bird isn't a warrior.<br />
<br />
*As for the testing issue, the test server in it's current form is a joke. Treating a supposed testing environment as a production envorinment leads to all the crap that goes live in todays current game. The only way to restore some actual purpose to test other then a low pop proddy is to allow char copies for limited times, or limited by like 1 per acc per 6 months or something.<br />
<br />
/testbuff to a level 25 gimped char is not how you test new skills, rulesets or content. To even further restore some purpose allow current test players the option to movelog off to server of their choice, remove all raid zones from access as they did in the LDoN beta with pop zones and do invites when needed for new types of content delivery balancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree with this statement. I think they would get a lot larger cross-section of the players if they were to do this. <br />
<br />
Ever try playing a group dependent charactor on test? If you don't know people then your chances are pretty slim so most role up a druid, necro, beastlord, etc. I have a 40 paladin that I started before PoP or /testbuff and managed to pretty much solo him the whole time. It might be better now with LDoN, but up to just before then if you were over the level 25 range then it's solo or log.<br />

Thanks to the people who do play full time on test. Without them we wouldn't even know as much as we do now.</div></div><hr />

My comments though weren't really addressing the same thing yours were.<br />

I was merely stating that the bulk of complaints against the openings system are coming from people who are on test testing them. <br />
<br />
So when someone says &quot;Quit whining and go try them!&quot; ... well, the complaints are coming from those who are trying them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">tested this out today with a 25 warrior.<br />
<br />
openings have annoucements in chat window.<br />
openings have a time bar in the combat window.<br />
tested bellow vs provoke vs brells bellow<br />
<br />
provoke does seem to have a DoT effect. one warrior used bellow the other used provoke. bellow warrior had aggro until second provoke then i had aggro. he tried bellow 3 to 4 times and did not draw aggro until he got withing melee range.<br />
i backed off and sat down and he kept aggro. i got up got in melee range with no aggro taunted successfully gained aggro then backed up and lost aggro. <br />
<br />
openings seemed to very rare but then again i was fighting mobs that were very green to me at lvl 25. so far it seems to work but will have to see what happens when it goes live and test it out fully in a group at 65.</div></div><hr />
