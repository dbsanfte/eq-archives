I have room and points right now for either the AC aug or the Regen +5 Aug from N Ro LDoN Merchants.  What are the considerations regarding regen for Warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">osserkon</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">none in my opinion. get the AC augs and let the cleric worry about keeping you healed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">regen isn't useful anymore, mobs hit too hard.<br />
1AC worth between 4 and 6 HP depending on your gears.<br />
+6 regen is 1DPS reduction ... not that great when you compare it with mobs' dps output. moreover we are capped at 35 worn regen so you won't mittigate that much with max regen. on the other hand there isn't a hardcap anymore on AC so every little bit help to mitigate more. if you are under 3000AC then go for the AC aug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree.<br />
<br />
To me AC is king yes, but Regen is not to be ignored.  I can't count the number of times Regen has saved my backside despite it's bonus being so maginal. With decent AC and an added Regen bonus, you can actually make the job of a Cleric a whole pile easier.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With decent AC and an added Regen bonus<br />
<br />
that's the key point.<br />
you need first a decent among of AC.<br />
nobody choose the fungi tunic (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28951) (25AC,15regen) over a Breastplate of Eradication (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25206) or equilavent (55AC) so if you don't trade 15regen for 30AC why would you trade 5regen for 10AC ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any situation.<br />
<br />
No questions asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK the RegenV Aug he speaks of is this:<br />
Shiny Sandstone of Reconstruction <br />
[ http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24016 ] <br />
for Chest only (Type 3).  <br />
<br />
Not: <br />
Brilliant Blood Ruby of Prowess <br />
[ http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24142 ] <br />
for Face Neck Shoulder Back Waist (All Types).  <br />
<br />
They do not conflict, unless I have missed a LDoN Aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's conflicting in his adv point pool : I said he has enougth for one but not for both, thus get the AC fisrt and then if he has anouth courage for more ldon gring (after 5 10AC aug and the 5 HP aug and the two or three A3/Ykesha aug and at least one takk armor), he can go for +5regen, yes why not.<br />
but remember that there is nice HP all slot aug that drop in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you solo a lot you might find the regen useful but if you are after that I would suggest one of the lifetap augs instead.  This way you damage the mob and heal yourself and it should do more than a Regen 5 aug for you.  I would consider the regen aug for solo/farming if you have a regen bp to put it in after a lifetap aug.  A 50 pt lifetap aug proccing 2 times per minute will heal the same 50 hps to you if it is resisted once, plus it does 50 hps to the mob.<br />
<br />
If you are tanking in a group go with the AC aug.  I have noticed (not parsed) that I seem to take less full hits when I broke 1800 AC and then again when I broke 2000 AC buffed.  Much more so than the 50hps per minute that a regen 5 aug would heal.  If healers are using complete heals on you and you are not with in 10 hps of dieing then the regen 5 is negligable.  Cheal is 10 seconds to cast or just under 2 ticks.  In 2 ticks the aug has healed you 10 hps.<br />
<br />
I have a regen bp I got in Riwii.  It regens 17 per tick with a 2 regen aug.  It has 25 AC.  I have an ornate bp as well at 63 AC.  I wear the ornate when tanking hands down.  To me the 38 raw AC is greater than the 17 Regen.  If I am farming light blues or greens I wear the regen one coupled with a lifetap weapon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwavlin</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good info: thanks to all.  I do have the Royal Attendant BP, and the ldon Legs from EF, as well as 4 of the +10 AC augs from MM ldon merchants.   I can buy a 5th AC aug, or go for the GoD AC aug and buy the regen Aug, or keep saving for the 36% haste Aug from N Ro LDoN merchants (I only have 31% Soulscream belt atm).  <br />
<br />
LDoNs are getting harder to find.  The instanced zones in OoW and OoW in general have hit LDoN pretty hard.   I was looking for something like<br />
<br />
1AC = 10 Regen, up to 2000 AC<br />
1AC =  5 Regen 2000-3000 AC<br />
<br />
.. and also, I am prolly gonna be turning in my LDoN legs soon, so I'll have more points.  I already have 2 Anger3 Augs, as well as DPS augs for my DPS-only weapons.<br />
<br />
So my thinking now is: get the last +10 AC aug, then go for regen, or save awhile and go for the 36% haste aug.  After that, LDoN will be pretty useless to me.  No reason to grind LDoNs with the OoW armor quests available....</div></div><hr />
