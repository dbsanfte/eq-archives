I know that my normal group isn't quite ready for MPG yet, but I was hoping that we could start going here some.  I'm really tired of WoS and DH and this would be a nice change.  My magelo is linked, and the rest of my group is similarly equipped.</div></div><hr />

You're gtg gear-wise, although I'd recommend to others that more defensive aa's would help quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Even with a cleric, shammy, ranger x2, beastlord... all 67-69, I came close to dying a handful of times in a couple hours (read as under 6% hps).<br />

Cleric, quite reputable, said he was being mana effecient.....  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arganax</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies, yeah I agree I need to get the defensive aas asap.  I had to get my agro issues taken care of first, but now that I've done that (for now at least) I am concentrating on the defensive aas.  Actually, I'm lvl68 atm and I'm thinking I should get LR5 and ID5 before I make the push to lvl70.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd recommend doing that. XP in WoS/RCoD is going to decrease a bit at 70, and without them, even with 70 you're going to be getting beat up badly in MPG. It's probably not a big deal though, if you win a 69 rune i'd go ahead and level up to scribe it :)</div></div><hr />

It was challenging, but no real problems at all.  Besides being less croweded than WoS, there are the Sewer and Catacomb expeditions there too =)<br />
