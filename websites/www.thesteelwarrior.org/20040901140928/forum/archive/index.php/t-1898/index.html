<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What about consentual tossing? I mean if you and the dwarf tell the mounted police or whatever it is that you both wished the tossing to occur and dont wish to press charges is the officer compelled to file charges anyway (like domestic abuse laws)?<br />
<br />
I need to know just in case I'm in Canada and happen upon a dwarf who says &quot;Please toss me&quot;.. could I still get arrested? And with regards to the fine, can I just pay that on the spot? and will the officer have change for a $20?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You wanna be careful, I don't know about Canada but here in the UK that would have a completely different meaning and you would certainly get arrested ....... well if you did it in public anyway!</div></div><hr />
