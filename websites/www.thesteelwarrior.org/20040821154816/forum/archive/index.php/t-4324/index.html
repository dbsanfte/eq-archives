<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We've ALL seen the threads for the November 24th discussion. We need to focus on this. We need to be right in there telling them strait up what our problems are. But we can't be vague about it, we need to have a strong support behind us, to show that our idea is held by many. We need to figure out what problems we're going to take to the discussion.<br />
<br />
Are we going to request...<br />
<br />
-warrior taunt boost?<br />
-removal of the need for EB weps?<br />
-increase in innate HP/AC?<br />
-hybrid nerf?<br />
<br />
I think you get the idea.<br />
<br />
I also feel we should bring 5-10 representatives to speak on behalf of the warrior community, that way we're not flooding the chatroom with the same ideas. It'd be more productive to have everyone in there listening, and havingour representatives speak our sides in a constructive manner to help get the most information we can out of it.<br />
<br />
Anywho, lets get a few of our most supported ideas to the foreground and focus on them.<br />
<br />
Ideas? Thoughts? Concerns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What I personally would like to see.<br />
<br />
 1. An upgrade to taunt, in two parts. <br />
<br />
       A) Chance of success scaling by level to 70% at level 65. All classes!<br />
<br />
       B) Failed taunts adding (once again, scaling at level 65) 100 hate to the taunter AS LONG as they are not at the top of the hate list. Otherwise, Taunting should have no effect.<br />
<br />
 2. (or 1b, if you prefer) The removal of the need for TB/EB items.<br />
<br />
 Sorry, no class that has a taunt key should EVER need to have one of these if they didn't want them. Period Amen.<br />
<br />
 3. A return of a more sizeable gap in AC/HP between Knights and Warriors - I will not comment on whether it is better to lower one or raise the other.<br />
<br />
 4. The complete removal of /disc defensive from the game and replacement with /disc strikethrough, which would have a 20 second duration and an increase of one second per level thereafter.<br />
<br />
 5. The unlinking of offensive and defensive discs, with retuned refresh times.<br />
<br />
 6. The removal of the ability to gain aggro from low level spells that cannot possibly affect the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EB weapons should be a bonus, a luxury, not a necessity.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
-Stances (as several others will no doubt suggest as well) that allow you to choose if you want to be defensive or offense or enraging (agro-getting for several mobs) or whatever, so warriors can adapt to their role in the group.<br />
<br />
-A method to gain agro, such as making the taunt skill actually do something other than fail a lot.  Or adding other abilities that gain agro well.<br />
<br />
-Expand Berserker Fury to have special abilities you can activate during this time, such as Enrage(Furious) and Auto-crip(Mighty Strike).  Can only activate these abilities during Fury.<br />
<br />
Hell, add abilities that, if they were on a mob, would make people actually worry when the mob is a warrior instead of saying &quot;eh, just slow him and he's a pussy&quot; like they currently do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi?<br />
They're making an overhaul change.<br />
Taunt will probably (hopefully) no longer exist.<br />
New means of aggro will be brought in, maybe ideas of meleeish mana, who knows...<br />
<br />
They seem to have a basic idea of what to implement already.. and just want to see what we like and dislike about that idea.<br />
So kind of hard coming up with any ideas until we've heard of what they're thinking for the melees.<br />
<br />
Try thinking instead of where you want the warriors to really be in the class ladder.<br />
And how we could be much better then knights as tanks, without annihilating their chances to a group.<br />
Maybe think of a couple &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;fun&quot;, &quot;group friendly&quot; abilities/discs that could be implemented into whatever system they're thinking of.<br />
<br />
Once you got those general ideas in mind, just improvise the 24th.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most ideas I've seen seem to be the sort of things we've gotten through expansions...<br />
heighten the cap of Taunt (yay... not).. heighten our hp (yay...not).<br />
Again...<br />
they're changing the ways melee work,<br />
not upgrading them a tad bit...<br />
<br />
Next person who thinks our fix resides in fixing the Taunt button, gets my boot up his skirt :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Firstly, Warriors need basic parity in snap aggro generation with knights similar to the close equivalence in tanking ability.  Y'all know that i favour more of a nerf than an upgrade but that's beside the point so long as there is parity. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, and once that basic equivalence is met, they need something that defines their class clearly in a group that is proactive and actively aids the groups progression (more than simply adding damage over time). <br />
<br />
There should be reason to group a warrior no matter if you end up tanking or not. Not just in the exp game but when raiding also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's an unveiling, not a roundtable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i will just be there to make sure we dont get fucked again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If anybody gets a chance to ask a question it should be this:<br />
<br />
How does SoE expect these changes to improve/effect the warrior players contribution to grouping?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cladar Conquers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Taunt is the first thing that comes to mind when i think of a fix for warriors. Altho, warriors should have something to bring to any exp group even if not the main tank.<br />
<br />
One thing i have done in the pass was sent SOE a request to fix taunt for warriors. I sent with that request a quest of some sort to up grade warriors taunt to an enraging taunt at lvl 62 and above. Not to take away from the EB effect items but to give the base warrior something to bargin with when it comes to getting into an exp group. <br />
<br />
I have quit playing my 65 warrior on the Legends Server for the longest time now due to LFG for hours and being passed by for Pali or SK. The biggest problems with the warrior class is by far maintaining agro, so if they do anything to upgrade/fix warriors i would hope it be in that area. Not asking for more DPS or anything like that. Just give us the ability to do what our classes was ment to do, Main Tank! thanks for your support and i will be looking to jump back on my warrior when a solution is found and fixed :) otherwise i plan to cancle all my accounts on Legends and start playing Horizons. be well /wave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would personally ask if there is any plan of tweeking current content to fit the Melee's changes (like was done with Caster's resists in Velious),<br />
or if they only plan to keep melee changes within the current content's level.<br />
<br />
Hoping for the first possibility :D , not only would it indirectly slightly nerf knights... but it would also refresh current encounters! yum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My only idea would be for disc defensive to be removed and made permanent. We should just take less damage period than Knights. They get insta lock aggro even at range that is fine by me if my ability to take damage is noticeable better than a Knight which has studied magic while I fought my entire life and have become a WARLORD.<br />
Knights can still get groups with lazy people who want insta lock aggro but they need to pay for this somehow and I do NOT at any cost want the solution to be via equipment or items. I want people to respect a Warrior at his job of taking damage. If you want to heal less get a warrior , if you want to be lazy and cast at will not managing aggro get a knight. I dont even care if they have equal HP and AC , but dammit I should take FAR less punishment then them period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sarhea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't know how I feel about nerfing any other class.  I don't know how it is on other servers, but on FV, warriors are already the whiny toddlers of our server, according ot a few very vocal folks, and a nerf would most assuredly be taken out on us.<br />
<br />
I want, more than anything else, for any positive changes made to affect warriors like me(small guild, small raid alliance, etc) as well as the Time and ELemental warriors.<br />
<br />
That said, I think taunt is my number one concern.  Not the getting of it, the keeping of it. <br />
<br />
And while not as important to me as the ability to keep aggro, I would dearly love to be able to solo a dark blue on occasion. *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All I can say.. is for some reason...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes my Warrior.. there is a mana bar...<br />
<br />
Its been debated and hashed out here a lot, but from what I can gleen from the brief Absor quote, and the way EQ2 is and WoW will be, and what FFXI has.. melee will now finally get their &quot;spells&quot; This, is potentially a great step forward in class balance..<br />
<br />
And no matter what they call them they will be spells, just as bard songs are spells... <br />
<br />
All I can say, is about damn time..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">why did you lead us to beleive that you were balanceing the melee, and not just tell us you were makeing a whole new system?<br />
<br />
or what ever its called.<br />
<br />
how big is the learnign curve for this new thing. am i going to have to play 4 more years to get the same skill lvl, or is it idiot proff like the rest of the game?<br />
<br />
will my so called skill be dependant on weither i chose option a,b, or c in a fight?<br />
<br />
how bad will it mess up my UI?<br />
<br />
will i be able to see/use it if i dont have the right video card?<br />
<br />
are we realy just talking about the new spell effects on test and not melee balance?<br />
<br />
&quot;wow lanagor thats a neet new lighting bolt. have you seen my root?&quot;<br />
&quot;no i havent grebob. whers mokor with the coffee?&quot;<br />
&quot;I MAKEING IT AS FAST AS I CAN. play with your new effects some more or something while you wait.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cuedyen2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's an unveiling, not a roundtable.<br />
<br />
I had the same impression.  I have a feeling they already know what they are planning on changing and will be informing more then asking opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You know, in the time of frenzied warriors, it's a good idea for everyone to take a deep breath, and analyze this situation logically.<br />
<br />
When they said they were announcing something on the 24th, they did NOT say &quot;We are having a chat asking for input so that we can return to the drawing table and do somthing.&quot;   That something is or is near being done, and they're being nice enough to tell us in advance and allowing us to ask questions about it.<br />
<br />
THEY ARE TAKING STEPS... <br />
<br />
Dont' speculate on whether they're going to be &quot;enough&quot; and get yourselves whipped up into a frenzy of pessimism, that's retarded and makes you look like jackasses.   Let it happen, then afterwards analyze what was actually said.   Any pre-game analysis is about as valid as a movie review for a movie which hasn't been cast yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would think as they said it will be a totaly new system for melee. that more than likely, there will be no &quot;taunt&quot; fix. <br />
what is more likely will be  difrent ways of playing all the melee.You will be able to choose a more agressive stance or a more defencive stance. sorta like the Slider bar that was brought up on a few posts , but without the slider. <br />
<br />
Going defencive may let you have acess to diffrent defence hot buttons , going pure dps would let you use others. All would depend on what type of fight you where about to get into . <br />
<br />
The dps rought might let you have a untaunt button to keep agro down while the defencive style would have buttons that increase your agro . <br />
<br />
only problem I see is that they will probably make this change to all melee classes and at the same skill points . so that a paladin will be able to go as defencive or as offencive as a warrior. <br />
<br />
this is all speculation  but from what people have asked for and the fact that noone realy wants to nerf anyone . this would seem the type of new melee option they would only have left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I for one, am still expecting to wake up any moment now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">While some may feel let down due to past inactivity with regards to warrior balancing, I agree that waiting a few days to hear what Sony has to say before getting too distraught is reasonble.<br />
<br />
They may or may not get it right this time, let us hope they do.  After all we DO want them to succeed correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What do you mean getting rid of Enraging Blow weapons?  You act as though these were just a bandaid fix to a problem they have known about for years!  Oh wait...<br />
<br />
Lets see what they bring on the 24th.  I'm betting we get mana bars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dont' speculate on whether they're going to be &quot;enough&quot; and get yourselves whipped up into a frenzy of pessimism, that's retarded and makes you look like jackasses.

<br />
*cheer Frodlin*<br />
<br />
After the chat, we will have plenty of time to talk about what is said.  Till then, let's relax a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i don't think that melee's will ever have a mana bar, its been stated a lot that it is something that they never once intended to do, and don't want to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Roldon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I do agree that in this chat there should only be a few people speaking for the War community.  This adds professionalism and a preception of organization.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are those out there that we could all support as speakers for our community.<br />
<br />
Roldon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What scares me with what I have heard so far, is that they are planning on making it all depend more on player skill.  THis has the potential to make matters worse for us, because as long as Knights are able to have aggro lock through spells, then there is even more reason for casters to  be afraid of warriors because we all know how many ebayed, untalented ass wipes who don't pay attention as they play that there are out there that helped add to the fires of our current problems.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you wouldn't have to have the talent and skill to melee well if your a knight....just keep casting and it all works like it always did.....aggro lock....slow on inc..... nuke nuke dead.<br />
<br />
AND not only that, in teh interrim, Warriors will likely have a learning curve(as they learn the new system) that keeps them from being as effective.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that this is done in a manner that negates my concerns...and if so then THANKS SOE .... but if I am right, then be prepared for our frustrations to be even worse.  I REALLY THINK that my questions above (or some form thereof) be asked at this discussion about their propsed changes......cause if they make this new system more dependant on Player skill .... WITHOUT doing something about LOCK AGGRO FROM SPELLS ..... then this change(as we understand with the tidbits I ahve heard so far) will actually make matters worse for us...(especially in teh short term).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am thinking, or perhaps hoping that the melee system is changed somewhat in terms of DAOC. <br />
<br />
I found that combat system interesting and challenging (minus the brainless, autostick function) <br />
<br />
During the meeting I do hope we can have a single set of speaking voices, not because anyone is more senior but simply to make sure key points are addressed and heard.<br />
<br />
I do hope the combat takes on a certain DAOC type flair that allows flair and style for each warrior.<br />
<br />
One question I have to ponder is if this &quot;change&quot; is drastic enough to spur reitemizing and is a long ways off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wyndaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Patience young grasshopper...<br />
<br />
I was all for the stand down, but it has worked.  They are announcing something that they had no intention of announcing on the 24th.  The community rallied together and made something happen. <br />
<br />
It's good for the community, good for business, and good for everquest.  EQ/SoE will prosper because player needs will be met.  Think about it<br />
<br />
They aren't fixing taunt.  They aren't just putting a bandaid on 1h weapons.  They are going to do something to significantly affect the melee classes.  As for that baby whining about how hard it will be to learn.... Wah wah...   Sheesh.  We bitch, whine, and moan about changes, and when they announce changes, we whine about changes.  Sheesh. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I trust Sony, not altruistically.  No, I trust 'em because they're bottom line depends on making us happy.  Contrary to the naysayers, EQ isn't going away anytime soon and Sony will scrap, kick, and claw it's little paws into our pockets for as long as we're willing to let 'em.  <br />
<br />
Adventure well.  Grats to everyone and Grats to Sony too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">blah blah *NERF* blah blah *NERF*<br />
<br />
blah blah GO TO HELL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You first, I need something to cushion my fall, and your Cheeto-inflated ass should do nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Norfolk:Brell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I personally am hoping that in addition to the melee code shuffle well also see some itemization fixes, specifically increases on the damage code for many WAR, WAR/PAL/SHD, and WAR/PAL/SHD/RNG usable weapons, and a nerf (Yes a nerf) to knight wearable armor.<br />
<br />
At the present level I see no point in having weapons that are both warrior and knight usable, as you woulndt catch a Knight dead wielding one of these weapons since the ratios are MUCH MUCH MUCH better on Knight only weapons. Currently warriors and to a lesser extent, rangers and monks get a serious shaft when it comes to melee weapons. and this is part of the problem as it severely lmits the amount of melee DPS these classes can put out. I understand that non dual wielding classes are supposed to get better weapons to offset the fact that they dont dual wield and have lower skill caps but with current itemisation its going to far down that end of the spectrum and the bure melee are suffering for it.<br />
<br />
As much as I hate to say it, another part of the Itemization problem is that at all levels, the Knights can get armor sets that are comparable, if not better than the gear avilable to warriors. this topic has been discussed to death and im not going to repeat what we have all heard before so I'll just close by saying that Id actually like to see the Armor Class and raw Hit Point counts reduced on a lot of the Knight wearable armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Marrgill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I suspect the &quot;new&quot; combat system SOE has in store for EQ will be similar to the combat system in SWG, with mana-like bars governing the use of special offensive and defensive &quot;modes.&quot;  Think AA abilities or disciplines except their refresh and use is determined by how much gas we have left in our &quot;offensive&quot; or &quot;defensive&quot; tank.<br />
<br />
These items won't be affected by +MANA items but by the statistic buffs we know and have come to love despite their minimal effect on our actual damage output and tanking ability.  Strength and dexterity will affect how well and how often our offensive modes work, while stamina and agility will affect how well and how often our defensive modes work.<br />
<br />
Stamina Loss spells would have to be reworked since they currently worked on a fixed scale.  They'll work a lot like Clarity for pure melee, where they affect stamina/agility bar or strength/dexterity bar regeneration.  Melees will be bugging shaman for Acumen as well as stat buffs.  Hybrids might actually memorize Invigor and Extinguish Fatigue for a change.  Everyone will love bards, beastlords, enchanters, and shaman even more because of the buffs they bring to groups.<br />
<br />
An additional positive benefit is that stat debuffs will actually be very useful if they give monsters these new offensive and defensive modes as well.  That remains to be seen since that might require new AI programming for monsters.<br />
<br />
Since the fatigue bar has effectively zero effect on EQ other than our ability to jump (whoopy doo), it will be replaced by the new &quot;defensive&quot; bar while the mana bar will be replaced by an &quot;offensive&quot; bar for pure melee.  The new abilities will likely be similar to the disciplines with a mix of offensive and defensive &quot;combat modes&quot; though not to the levels achieved with disciplines.  No &quot;all or nothing&quot; modes, but rather defensive-style modes that provide some benefits with some costs.<br />
<br />
This is all speculation, of course.  I can't wait to see how it all shakes down next Monday.<br />
<br />
PS.  Whoever suggested that warriors have permanent /disc defensive is nuts.  They must have forgotten that warriors take a major hit on their offensive output when they are defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I already posted my 3  moderate suggestions in another thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4375), so not gonna add that here.<br />
<br />
What I hope not to happen is :<br />
<br />
- Mana Bar ... No, I don't want it, I don't want spells either, I'm not a hybrid I'm a warrior.<br />
<br />
- Special moves ala DAoC .. this is really cool the first few days and then gets real annoying. You often run out of stamina after each fight and cannot keep it going. We are Warriors dangit, we are supposed to keep going after everyone else stops. That's the whole concept of Warriors. Besides, it was spells in disguise really.<br />
<br />
- Some new and fancy system that is suspectible to lag, having to execute Move X + Y at time Z in spot W really gets screwed up if the MOB is lagging around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Here is what the most popular issues have been for warriors balance. I will be there on the 24th myself. For whatever fixes SoE proposes, the important thing is to make sure they fit as many of the following categories as possible. Here they are listed below, along with what have been the most popular/successful solutions have been <br />
<br />
Agro: <br />
- Agro. Fix it, warrior agro is redundant. The most popular ideas regarding fixing agro were:<br />
1) Furor's Taunt/DoT idea: starts at level 20, scales in power. Level 65: 350hate/tick, 150 damage/tick. Duration: 2 minutes. Reuse: 24 seconds. Can be used at range, but he mentioned the range to which it works is limited. Multiple taunt/dots can stack on one mob (raid encounter utility). <br />
2) Innate EB proc. 700 hate instantly, usable at range, re-use time of about 20-30 seconds. Also works at range<br />
<br />
Having both ideas implemented also suggested.<br />
<br />
HP edge:<br />
- The HP gap between knights and warriors has become WAY too narrow, especially since Plane of Time Knightmization, paladin buffs, and LDoN augs. Most popular fixes:<br />
1) Innate 5-10% Natural Durability for warriors.<br />
2) Stamina post-255 should work as it did prior to 255, giving warriors 7hp/tick as it should be (since 51-60 was 6hp/tick). <br />
<br />
Implementation of both also suggested <br />
<br />
Damage Mitigation:<br />
- See above in terms of HP gap. See the log parse for Rallos Zek if you are unconvinced. Most popular suggestions:<br />
1) Innate 10% mitigation boost for warriors. That means 10% off DI AND DB. Suggestion to limit this fix to just DI also made<br />
2) Remove /disc defensive altogether, 20-25% Innate mitigation boost (off both DI and DB).<br />
<br />
General Fixes (this area affects ALL pure melees, not just warriors):<br />
- While casters/hybrids received massive benefits between levels 61-65, pure melees received nothing at all. Aside from that, pure melees have been suffering at the hands of game designers since SoL. Suggestions:<br />
1) Skill caps increase: 5-10 points/level all around (offensive, weapon skills, defensive skills) for pure melees only. <br />
2) Stat caps increase (since casters can get up to 355 wiz/int, smilar increases proposed to melee-based stats; Str/Dex/Agi/Sta)<br />
3) Unlinking the timers between discs. Especially between offensive and defensive based disciplines.<br />
4) Duel-Wield. Fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Lionk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I expect Sony Developers and Strategists to be fully aware of the most common complaints Warriors and other classes have. This is a business of making money, and they would be fools to ignore their clientele, and they have a major initiative on the way in the form of EQ2.<br />
<br />
However they may change their strategy to passively force you to play EQ2 by enabling you to further your current characters in EQ2. This way you would not be looking at a major time sync to start all over, and fork over all your money.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I expect to log in to the chat channel on the date/time/location and LISTEN/READ Sony's response to Warriors and other class concerns, and a period of open Q/A maybe. Don't fool yourself, it will be highly moderated and not a place to act like an asshole. They could flag you or ban you.<br />
<br />
I also anticipate they will have a script runing or News post on the Live site for the late comers or for those who miss the live chatit to see what response they have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I got 2 things.  One is a Rumor I heard at work and the other a question.  First I heard that they are pretty much (for warriors) at least they are going to implement a rage bar ala WoW style.  Again this is just something I heard from someone at work that heard it from someone else etc.. you get the picture so it might just be BS.<br />
<br />
Second.  Where is this Chat going to happen?  As in how can I join it?</div></div><hr />
