<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My greaves have to go, they do little to nothing for me in terms of pure HP.  I've hit 247 sta unbuffed, and don't intend to do PP in quite some time, so with shaman buffs I'm always maxed out.  I'm in a family guild, so keep that in mind please when you make your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zacc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about some Luminant Heraldic? (Greaves and other pieces) There's no shortage of that stuff on MM. The chain pants from CT have 65 hps, but not much AC.<br />
<br />
Zacc-65 War-MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cheap - steel wrapped leggings - 27AC 45HPs<br />
Cheapish - Kylong Shinguards - 35AC 45HPs<br />
Mid Price - SS MQ, Fine Heraldic etc - 40AC 40HPs <br />
Expensive - Ornate - 46AC 90HPs <br />
<br />
Its always been hard to get decent legs.  Camping (and winning) Ornate plate legs in BoT would be your best shot at good legs and you won't see anything worth upgrading to till Fennin is eating dirt at your feet.  Kylong shinguards are a decent cheap pair of legs to last you till then.<br />
<br />
Side note to this, helped a mate with Yeli faction so he could quest his tormax head the other day and we scored 3 pairs of thurg legs while we were at it (the drop rate seems way better these days then when I actually wanted the stuff) so we went and checked out the stats while we were deciding who's twink was going to get what.<br />
<br />
Warrior Thurgadin legs: 34AC, 9str, 7sta<br />
Cleric Thurgadin Legs: 24AC, 10wis, 80hps, 40mana, click cast group heal<br />
Shadow Knight SK Legs: 24AC, some stats, 60hps<br />
<br />
cleric gets 80hps, SK gets 60hps, we get zip.  Why did it take until PoP for us to notice we were getting the itemisation shaft?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or you could grab some friends and head over to HoT, pray for some Skyshrine-quested legs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
should fit what your looking for just need good smith and farm ct for the parts or find in baz. all the tae ew plate stuff is pretty good, and great for non ralos zek worshipers not evey peice since some have caster stats but decent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Greaves of the Orcish Master would be decent upgrade and obtainable by single group in Rujarkian (EC) LDoN mission. Not huge hp upgrade, but could get em for free and earn a few points exp along the way :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here (http://www.bathandbodyworks.com) Should be the answers to all your problems :D<br />
<br />
Honestly though; if you still got the faction go hit HoT and get myrmidon greaves and gloves; maybe even a helm...Esp the gloves; they've got a big chunk of hit points on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I camped Gaukr in BoT untill he dropped my legs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fierce heraldic or helanic tundra legs will give you a ghood 45 AC and 80 HP, so unless you're agnostic, this is the way to go. Unless you wanna camp ornate. Another possilbity is greaves from Takish for 1490 points, they're somewhere from 80 to 100 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you all for your suggestions.  Zacc gets bonus points for noticing my diety was Mithaniel Marr from my sig.  Shik gets to go with me to the mall next time I'm in a power shopping mood. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Malevolent Greaves from Miragul's. 760 points, easy as pie. <br />
<br />
Also if you're having too much sta...ditch the 15sta bracelet and get the +40hp thing from Velks. They're all over the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
