<br />
then i need to do some humongous patch via this steam thingy, ok all done. can i play halflife? no. need to unencrypt the files. ok ok all done now.<br />
<br />
finaly, all set to go, click on half-life 2........... game currently unavailable.<br />
<br />
excuse my french but wtf is all that about. i mean godamn it its a single player game. so i track down the steam website, look up the faq and follow the instructions. nada. same problem.<br />
<br />
so i figure a problem with installation.  must be. so uninstall gdam steam and half life 2. <br />
<br />
reinstall. and jump through all the above hoops again. and guess what. no fucking surprise, ... game currently unavailable.<br />
<br />
so here i am, a 60 dollar game of 5 cds that may as well go in the dustbin cos for the life of me i cant figure out how to get it working.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">load it up again after getting that error, reboot first.<br />
<br />
seems to always present that error on install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope tried that too doesnt work.<br />
browsed the forums and no one seems to have a cogent solution either.  funny thing is, they even disabled search on their forums.<br />
<br />
and i just realised the most annoying thing, now everytime i reboot computer, the steam application loads on start up. <br />
<br />
i take great pains to configure computer so i have minimum apps on start up and now i have to deal with this just to play a single player game. sigh.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT - i finally gave up and called valve customer service.  they seem to have an overseas call centre but i figure hey give them a chance maybe the've been well trained. anyway the guy suggests i try and play the game offline. so he talks me through how to do that.  didnt come as much of a surprise when i got exactly the same message.<br />
<br />
at that stage he said sorry, cant help you anymore, its a problem with steam.  i said great, steam dont have a number i can even call, so all i have now is an email address. <br />
<br />
i mean i can understand a company trying to take steps to prevent pirating, but it seems somewhat counter-productive if you alienate those who buy the genuine product and cant even play it.</div></div><hr />

That sounds like Funcom's answer to the AO woes of the first year :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow...HL 2 is freakin awesome...<br />
<br />
i couldnt stop myself playing the last 2 days (cept for school) im at the mines now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 hour to install, 5 CDs, fricking encryption process takes forever..  I've only played CSS but I'm back to playing 1.6 again.  100 FPS in 1.6, only 20 in CSS.  Others seem to have to same problems despite tweaking the config.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 hour to install?  thats why i have the DVD rom version</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrem</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have the CD version of the game, however I can give you my experience with Steam.  It's basically a patching service similar to eq.  The difference is, you right click the game you want to play click properties and look for &quot;offline mode&quot; and the percentage of the game complete, once it hits 100% ( fully patched ) then you can disconnect from the internet and restart the steam in offline mode and play the game as long as you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just ignore steam and leave it on, having steam runing while youre playing doesnt matter much i dont think.  i also discovered that you can use the same copy of the game on multiple computers, just probably not all at once.  not to take advantage of this or anything, but i installed it on my new laptop and i can play it on that as long as steam isnt running on my desktop at the same time (i think.  i didnt test it with steam running on the desktop.)<br />
<br />
PS i beat it!  awesome game, dissapointing endgame compared to the whole rest of the game, now i cant wait for Half-Life 3 :D</div></div><hr />

after 3+ years of counter-strike, 1.6 finally pushed me over the top. fuck you valve</div></div><hr />
