<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagitus</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love playing my new 36 Warrior.  I am close to finishing up my HHK days and have been looking for groups outside of this zone for a long time now but noone seems to want to group. Maybe it's not me or the class, I am thinking that maybe I'm looking in the wrong areas. <br />
<br />
I run to Crystal Caverns all the time.. noone wants a warrior as usually the only players I find are those that can Lev/Invis and are self sufficient.<br />
<br />
I run to Great Divide once a day for the past two weeks, noone wants a tank. &quot;Thanks, we're good.&quot;<br />
<br />
HHK everyone wants a tank.. no surprise since its close quarters right? My question is, where are all the groups at in the 30s-40s? I will confess that for the first 3 years of my EQ days on Tallon Zek, I was a soloing caster of every kind.. I never needed a tank. And so, I do not know where to find a group. It's been so disheartening that I paypal'd a Ceremonial Iksar bp in an attempt to just go solo... but I find myself wanting to group as a tank still.<br />
<br />
Advice?<br />
<br />
Also... I asked this question on my server board, maybe you guys have thoughts:<br />

You might also try the Luclin zones, like dawn shroud peaks and serus mar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagitus</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks, omw to Dawnshroud, I had forgotten about the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other There<br />
Dread Lands<br />
Srnak Fort in Loio?<br />
Giant Fort in the stupid zone off Dread Lands<br />
Dawnshroud<br />
<br />
thoese are places I see crowds of similar levels to yours on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagitus</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for additional ideas, I do prefer dungeons as I think they are much more fun, seems noone wants to dungeon crawl anymore!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pick up groups dont do dungeons unless forced to go there. Make friends and take them to dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See where they are.<br />
<br />
Try the LFG tool... it can be great for finding groups anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagitus</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first thing I do, I hit /lfg and configure that. I'm usually the only one on the server ( Tarew Marr ). Wonder if there's any interest in forming a &quot;dungeon crawling&quot; guild...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumptimax</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is, where are all the groups at in the 30s-40s? <br />
They are on Stromm, shuolda rolled there.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I get tells for groups all the time and pure melees are in demand as over half the populace rolled (situational) solo classes or casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagitus</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;They are on Stromm, shuolda rolled there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silly answer. People roll new characters all the time on every server.. I personally have 5 level 50+ characters but this is my first Warrior. The real answer is that I should probably just wait for the new exp bonus if grouped thing coming soon. For now, I'll just solo with my fungi that I was forced to buy so I don't spend half my nights running around begging for a group in the 30s.<br />
<br />
But thanks for the reminder about Stromm.. I think it'll be fun to try something there where bronze can be good stuff again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumptimax</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, inentionally silly mind you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagitus</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did a lil research.. apparently Stromm has an uber guild already doing the Planes.. and more than a few are over lvl 65..<br />
<br />
my god..<br />
<br />
EDIT: tryin to fix sig..arg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, I remember people calling Dawnshroud 'the new Dreadlands'.<br />
<br />
Run back and forth between DSP And ole' DL, at 45-51 you might wanna try good ole' KC. There aren;'t many people in there, but it's not a zone very popular for soloing either, so if you stick to it after a few days you get to know the regulars and find groups without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns, even though it is a very nice zone for grouping, it is one of those zones that just is not practical to run through and to get to, so sadly it has never been a popular group zone to my knowledge.. <br />
<br />
Same for Iceclad I guess, used to be a popular camp for the cougar claw earrings at your level 35-40ish.. but again in those PoK portal days it's not practical to get to. We get lazy :( <br />
<br />
How's Netherbian Lair? I thought it was kinda hard for the exp, but its right by DSP, so you may be able to pull a group down there and do one of the caves area.<br />
<br />
If you have just one healer friend who's willing to go with you, the tent near ToFs tower in Iceclad is a nice cozy camp.. no cougar ever get close to it except one very rare spawn. You can single pull cougars easily with a bow, andI think the exp is good till 40.. but I could be wrong .. been a while ago.</div></div><hr />
