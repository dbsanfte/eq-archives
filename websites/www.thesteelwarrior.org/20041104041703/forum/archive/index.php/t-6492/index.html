<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying FG, and the exp isn't too bad there. I can kill 3 or so before I decide to heal back up. The exp is better than Velks. I thought about the mobs in the Deep zone in area, but since it's a longer run and they are light blue I'm hesitant.<br />
<br />
So, with 6k unbuffed hp's where can I get the most bang for my buck assuming ease of travel and AA exp per kill?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can try PoJ. I kill the second set of wandering guards (I forget their name) that con dark blue. I'm significantly better geared than you though, so they might be too tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">About GE, how do you manage to split the 4 mobs? I always get the lot of them and can't do them all at once. Once the spawn is broken I think I could solo there pretty easilly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoJ tunnels or PoJ basement aren't that bad. May need to stop and heal every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do you finish a single pull with over 1k hp left? Seeings how you have that much more than me.:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">pointer; nothing in greigs sees invis... just find yourself a good corner (out near servitor of luclin's room works well, 2 mobs path by there every 15minutes)<br />
<br />
and if you have a willsapper/primal it makes the soloing even easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I solo Droga self-buffed.<br />
<br />
I lead with Truncheon of Doom, then switch to Anklesmasher and Prismatic combo till the Anklesmasher procs, then I go to my Great Staff of the 4 Winds.<br />
<br />
If I have to fight 2 such as when I drop down into the trap by the zone in, I use Stonewall and then, if things went poorly, I'll use Mighty Strike (by this time I'm berserk and the crips mostly perma-stun) or even Furious.  I won't need the discs again for 30 mins anyway.<br />
<br />
I did this before GoD,  or my 10th ring.  Important items include a way of snaring, Truncheon of Doom, and Ornate gloves.<br />
<br />
I suggest using an Eye of Zomm to pull the 2 goblins in the pit trap to zin if you aren't used to it.  I did for a long time, but now with Weapon Affinity, I trust my procs more so I just dive in.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i solo pov caves when iget bored =p kindof slow if you dont box a healer though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Soloing as a warrior sucks, even if you have to level up a healer just to heal you it is worth it.</div></div><hr />

At almost 10k unbuffed I would possibly try that, but 60% of that I may need to look for other targets. Thanks for the ideas though. I just would like to get the most AA for time spent when I have nothing better to do. I'll try the invis in to GE. I know that solo I can take atleast one before I reach critical mass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nurga beyond the blackguard thabis camp.  it's not spectacular but all the dark blue mobs are 1% aa per kill, 5-7k hp depending if it's a caster or melee.  If you get a caster, it's an easy kill.  Only a few spells will land @ 65, mainly the fire based DoTs that have a neg 100 resist check. 99% of the pulls are singles here so it makes it even easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have about 5.5k unbuffed, no Tod, no way to snare, I have soloed a few times in POI trash mobs. I need to heal after one pull. I find if I use defensive durring the fight my damage goes down too much for me to successfully kill the mob without yelling for a nearby cleric or druid. Any good places for me to solo better then poi? Or any stratagys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">use stonewall, you won't lose your dps. Oh and buy some dmg shield potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmm with 6k1 unbuffed, primal and willsapper, and ornate gauntlet haste, would i be adequit for GE? what would be the best spot for me? i think i'll log in and try nurga or FG when i get home.<br />
<br />
I also have a 65 druid i can box *sometimes*, know any good places for me to go with that in mind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">greigs end, or dragons necropolis (rats)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hello<br />
<br />
60 war here dual boxing 54 cleric. BoC and some &quot;dark whatever&quot; 15 21 piercer as offhand, 4.5k unbuffed. Looking for a good spot for Cleric EXP/Warrior AA. I can sometimes 3 Box with a friend's 65 chanter with DC, so ability to get  a DCable mob is important.<br />
<br />
I tried:<br />
<br />
Nurga: Can be a hell if a mob flies or gates (or was Droga where mobs gated?) <br />
Velketors: I can handle a train with ease and killing fast better exp than Nurga.<br />
Nadox: Is not close enougth to Pok for my taste. Just were there getting componetes for quest.<br />
<br />
Problem right now is that Velketors was very good while my cleric was 39 and my war 5x but now I feel it is not worth it for regular exp for the cleric...</div></div><hr />

Dual boxing in Plane of Nightmare would probably be good exp for your cleric, as all yours pulls would be within that magical 5 level range and you have the benefit of a PoP ZEM.  I was able to do it without a problem with my 58 war and girlfriend's 60 druid.  I used a ToD to slow then switched to either fabled m2h or dual weild for dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">what exactly were you killing in velks? i dont mind having to kill a lot in there as i need the velium anyway (g/f's shawl, gate pot.s), but are you talking about regular spiders/trash mobs near the entry or UD or what?</div></div><hr />

Especially if you're soloing, use Stonewall instead of Defensive.  You won't be chasing after the MOB to get aggro (it's all you!), and if the critter runs you can click off Stonewall to pursue.  I've actually become so comfortable with strafing that I use Stonewall nine times for every one time that I use Defensive.  It's what I use every single time I duo with my g/f's druid ... and she's become used to standing still if she does pull aggro off me.  Strafing is all well and good, but it's hell when I'm chasing someone kiting aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Update:<br />
<br />
I tryed Grieg's End, and was able to scrape by, but there was too much downtime for me so I moved on. I then went to Ackheva Ruins and found the 4-5 mobs near the zone in to be more inline with what I'm looking for. A nice mixture of dark/light blues and I can kill the lot of them before I need to sit. Doing this I am able to get 20% AA in about 90 minutes. Nothing compaired to a caster, but something to do when I'm bored.</div></div><hr />

Just gonna take a guess here and say that you could probably get a group in 90 minutes + Run to Akheva that yields more than 20% of an AA lol :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Stormhammer probably not. Most of the time during peak hours there is less than a group worth of folks in the /lfg channel. I normally use the time before our raids to earn back some of the exp I lost from the last raid ;)</div></div><hr />
