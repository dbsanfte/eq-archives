<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was tossing this idea around The Dojo today given the upcoming 'Melee Re-whatever' and wanted to put it up for discussion here.<br />
<br />
First, let me state that I'm not a big fan of converting mana on items into something a warrior can use. In the sense of Everquest, it just doesn't mesh with me. I would rather convert something the warrior is already supposed to have in surplus.<br />
<br />
With that said, I want some form of Conversion system for Taunt/Hate.<br />
<br />
Let me explain how this works:<br />
<br />
At level 20 a warrior is given the innate ability to turn their health into hate (they take damage while dishing out hate). As the warrior levels, they are able to more efficiently turn their health into hate and additionally, increase the raw amount of hate they can generate.<br />
<br />
The hate generated can be used up to 150 range. You can set various hotkeys for varying amounts of hate. For example, at level 65, a warrior is able to utilize up to 70% of his total hps at a 75% conversion efficiency ratio. Thus, for every 1000 hit points he converts (he takes 1000 damage), he can generate 750 points of hate.<br />
<br />
This sets up some interesting scenarios. A warrior could have a number of Conversion hotkeys. Common grind at level 65 would probably be around a 400 hp/300 hate conversion, while tank switches could focus on massive conversions of 5k hps at a time all the while carefullly balancing that CH or bombardment of SLs to land right after a conversion goes through.<br />
<br />
<br />
What this does for gameplay:<br />
<br />
At experience levels, it balances out the playing field for Warriors in the area of Taunt/Ranged Taunt. Heavy useage has drawbacks limited by Health and mana of the healer. Careless, clumsy warriors could easily kill themselves in a Conversion. Poorly managed groups where wizards are chain nuking, for example, will result in overexhertion, and quite possibly warrior death and eventual group death. <br />
<br />
<br />
Less reliability on CH:<br />
<br />
As you're using conversions, depending on how you have your own hotkeys setup (remember you can setup your conversion to anything under your cap, so the possibilities are massive) you may find that you will have to do a lot of quick thinking in large/bad pull situations and raids, which will naturally require large and fast landing heals to come into play. The more skilled warrior will be able to multi-taunt, and still retain a careful balance among the groups healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior Focus Items:<br />
<br />
Conversion Efficiency and Enhancement FOCI. HP regen on grinds given more meaning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now remember, this is all just off the top of my head so I'm open to any improvements or ideas, and I still have no concrete conversion rates for level 20 - 60.<br />
<br />
Also of note, for this to really work, Warriors would require a more appreciable hit point advantage than they have at the moment (something which I believe is in the works anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a shaman can Can themselves to death and a necro can Lich to death, a warrior can hate himself into an early grave. :p<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think this is one of the more original balance ideas I've seen. Without any concrete conversion numbers it's hard to say how balanced it is, but the theory seems sound. I like the idea of giving us something that works at range as well.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but it seems that this skill would give warriors an incentive to work with shaman and druids because of their regen spells, especially with the 400hp/300 hate conversion.<br />
<br />
My only initial question is: Would you put a timer on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think a better system than having several hot keys would be to have 1 ability that could work like dot for lets say 100HP/tick on you that turned into 100hate/tick on your current target, that you could toggle on and off. what would happen is you'd gradually gain agro once you can see your target. you wont be able to agro as fast as a knight on inc, but it would be better than where we are now. <br />
<br />
i think a side effect of a HP/hate conversion would be a huge jump in worn regen items prices as regen would be *the* warrior effect. <br />
<br />
personally, i always thought they should just raise the taunt radius. i always considered taunt to be a like shouting obcenitits (i cant spell) or giving the mob the /rude or some thing similar. i know alot of times a spell has landed and i hit taunt just a second too late as it ran out of my taunt radius, or where i'd have to chase the mob as the chanter/wiz/cleric ran around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newtank</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wars need a whole bunch of abilities like that.<br />
<br />
For example take 1000 damge but do 3000 damge etc.<br />
Wars are way behind sk on peak damage output which is a utility that adds a lot of strategy to things.<br />
I think you need some form of ability in that department.<br />
<br />
You run into a bit of a problem with the hp for effect in that a cleric can give you 18-19 hp per mana.  So either the effect of your hp to effect conversion is poor or you need some form of anti-buff that removes the hp from your total pool for some period of time.  If you removed the hp from your pool then you can imagine a lot of effects that would allow wars large &quot;utility&quot; improvements like HT etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this idea. It gives us increased aggro control, especially on incoming, but with a very significant tradeoff. I also like the fact that the ability would have raid benefits, including a way for warriors to lockdown mobs without damaging them. I see some very positive implications from an idea like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except I'm sure that somewhere down the road, Sony will tweak a spell and inadvertently cause every warrior that uses this ability to automatically take 10k damage regardless of the setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This seems like it'd be pretty overpowered for XP groups since you can pretty much just dump whatever health you have before a CH lands (leave say a 2K buffer for emergency) assuming you trust your cleric.  Then again, this actually counts on your cleric being able to communicate when a CH is landing (or to use CH at all...) so maybe it's not as powerful as it sounds.  I'd guess you'll have to put a timer of say 30 seconds on this ability at least, possibly longer.<br />
<br />
It seems like it'll make uber fights a bit too easy to get solid lock.  You can just pull a mob, have CH rotation starting and the have a warrior do like a 5k HP conversation thing well before the mob's in camp (no damage so no summon), and 5K converted to hate is more than enough to offset aggro from an earlier CH chain.  I don't think we need to have more HPs than other class for this idea to work.  Just make the conversions more efficient and that's like having more HPs.  Now, I think we should have more HPs, but that's another issue altogether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't think that's the point. This ability already exists in experience groups with far less cost to both Paladins and Shadowknights. I cast a level 15 fear on any mob and aggro is mine. If I have to, I'll cast another fear and maybe a Darkness - this just rarely becomes an issue, unless the shaman is chaining Turgurs on the same mob over and over and over again. Total mana spent? WHO CARES cause I already regenned it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reminds me a bit of the card game Jyhad.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have with this idea is purely aesthetic... I can see no way to explain in game terms why I'm losing health and the mob is getting madder.  There are 2 explanations that sort of come close for me:<br />
<br />
1) Picture a warrior pulling out a dagger and drawing it across his palm, then holding it up in the air... the smell of blood wafts across the field... slowly the giant turns, sniffs the air and licks his lips, blood frenzy rising within...<br />
<br />
Ok, that works... on a really limited scale.  Slicing my palm open is a small wound self inflicted designed to taunt an opponent into action.  I can buy that.  However what Furor suggest is more akin to the warrior taking out his two handed axe and lopping off his own leg.  I just can't picture that....  And what about in the middle of combat?  How do you justify it then...<br />
<br />
2) Ok, maybe like this.  Seeing the giant turn towards the Cleric of Brell, the halfling warrior hollered an obscenity and yanked off the plate mask that had been protecting him from the massive blows of the giants fists.  &quot;Hey you miserable excuse of an overgrown orc, take a shot at me now - if you're man enough&quot;.  The giant paused and seeing the now exposed head of his enemy turned back toward the warrior and renewed his attack.<br />
<br />
Again... I buy it... on a limited scale.  Mid combat you could taunt your oppenent by giving him an easy/free shot, knowing that he can't resist.  This could be simulated by giving up HP's.<br />
<br />
However to make either of these things truly balanced I think you would have to reduce both current AND total hit points by that amount, and total hit points would then regenerate back at a steady rate.  This would put a type of timer on the ability without trivializing it by timing it to land just before a CH.  Perhaps even losing the HP's until you or the mob is dead... <br />
<br />
As the giant staggered backwards and slowly crumpled to the ground, our hero retreived his helmet from the ground, grumbled about the new dents and grunted as he pushed it down onto his bruised and bloodied head....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sort of assume that they'll eventually get rid of Knight's bag of cheap tricks on aggro.  Maybe it's not a good assumption.  If Knight do not get nerfed on their freebie aggro this wouldn't be a bad idea, but if they actually fix the cheap Knight tricks, I think this ability can be potentially overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newtank</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Podling <br />

<br />
Just make the mobs first hit be how you take the damage and call it lowering your guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This would also give us a pretty good way to offtank without causing summons.<br />
<br />
Additionally they could just convert warcry to a +hate aura rather than a fear resist aura.  Or even level 1 could be +hate, level 2 could be +hate +attack, level 3 could be +hate +attack +ac (for the same short durations currently ingame)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it. I am not sure on the idea of being able to set it up for the amount you want but a fixed amount for each level or similar level set up as to spells pre 60 could be interesting and done fairly easy i would think. Few questions that come to mind:<br />
<br />
Would this skill require a small timer similar to spells for casting and reuse?<br />
<br />
And if it would be set up like a spell to take a time to land could a mob interrupt it? <br />
<br />
I would think yes on both of those but I am definately not as knowladgeable as a lot here just try hard.../grins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see a rational link between the warrior losing health and gaining aggro. If anything, the mob should be happy, and less angry that the warrior is losing hitpoints, not more angry.<br />
<br />
In what possible way could a warrior make his target hate him more, which also has the penalty of directly lowering his hitpoints by the same amount??  I just don't see ability that could exist that you could explain how it works, IE what the warrior is actually doing, while using this ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be the hate boiling in our blood that would cross over to said mob I would believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do we suddenly need to explain EQ in some sort of terms that makes sense? Think of an EB proc, taunt, hitpoints, or aggro in general. It doesn't make sense. Take the very concept of hp as you're looking at it... Oooh, I gain a &quot;level&quot; and suddenly I'm tougher and can get hit by monsters more.<br />
<br />
 That being said, the AD&amp;D 3rd addition rules explain hp as the ability for a person to avoid the majority of a hit and otherwise shrug off the damage... Hence, a higher hp character has the ability to survive swings better, not just because they're tougher but also because they know how to lean out of the way at the right time. You can think of an aggro for hp conversion as something along the lines of an active taunting (slapping and otherwise irritating the mob) to the point of leaving yourself open to their attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I do think there should be a conversion for mana.  It just makes sense given the way itemization has been and probably will continue to be.<br />
<br />
As far as hp/hate conversion ability, I could see it, although it fits less with me than a mana-&gt;endurance conversion does.  I guess I think that I shouldn't have to lose hitpoints to taunt really,  even from a distance.  I would just say make a ranged taunt that adds say 300 hate, and simply uses endurance.<br />
<br />
Also in experience groups with a bad wizard, I'd still be more apt to just let the wizard die as opposed to die myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's nice to see a fresh idea. unfortunately, it would make no sense. &quot;omgz I and sliting my wrists so you will hate me more&quot; <br />
<br />
No, I will not follow, I don't give a fuck if it's a Furor idea, it just isnt a good one. too bad though that the sheep caste is going to preach this like their catch phrases &quot;RNG, Knightenization, snap-aggro ect&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My big problem with it is that IN THEORY it sounds like a good idea. AND IT IS for the ubbah warriors that don't realy care about losing additional HP through the coversion....they have enough HP that they can tank the largest mobs and their guilds have enough clerics in rotation that it just don't really matter if they lose the extra life.<br />
<br />
Where this becomes a bad Idea is a guild that is up-and-coming .... that everyfight is close and the warrior needs EVERY HP AVAILABLE to tank.  This warrior don't have teh extra hp to convert to hate.....<br />
<br />
As such teh only way I can see this is if HP's were balanced to take this into consideration.....as it is now, it would effectively be a useless ability to Warriors like I described above as they coudl never activate it during a raid......I am assuming the normal aggro would stll be available under Your Idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The key is that you will need additional spam heals whenever you activate it during a raid. It doesn't matter what level of raid you're at, losing a significant amount of hp hurts. If you were to let your guild know when you were about to do it, you could get additional spam heals from secondary healers. One of the good things about an ability like this is that you could do it in exp groups on incoming for a small amount of aggro, or on mezzed mobs after taunting to save the 'chanter, or countless other situations where you need additional aggro. It just comes at a price.</div></div><hr />
