<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">obiwan</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have a windblade.  I play my warrior casually and usually only group him with my wife.  Current AAs are around 40ish. <br />
<br />
When playing my warrior I usually do just LDON.  I am looking for sheer damage output and am not concerned with holding agro, etc.  <br />
<br />
So does an augmented windblade beat 2 decent 1 handers (say 13 / 20 ) which are also augmented for sheer damage?<br />
<br />
I know proc rate will affect this.  I dont have any of the proc affecting AAs as of yet.  Am currently working on punishing blade.<br />
<br />
Money isnt nescessary much of an issue.  I wont be putting out 600k for a BOC but if needed to I could reasonably shell out 200K per 1hander.  <br />
<br />
In addition, on augments,  should I go for vengeance, rather than HP/ AC.<br />
<br />
Dont have magelo.  Some of my equipment includes. <br />
<br />
helm of RZ<br />
elemental arms<br />
ornate greaves, boots, wrists   <br />
heraldic bp<br />
Cloak of flames<br />
Earth rings<br />
<br />
First item to get from ldon will be Sand bp.<br />
I dont have elemental access (got lucky on arms) so I am looking for either one groupable no drop weapons or buyable weapons.<br />
<br />
Thanks for suggestions.</div></div><hr />

If you are looking for flat out DPS, your best bet is to get your hands on a GSot4W and aug it with the 125 DD or lifetap. You might also consider trying to get an Ornate Greatblade since they rot pretty often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, to address your question more accurately, you basically cannot buy or single-group any dual wield weapons that will outdamage a windblade.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the BOC and SOD, you have only a few choices.  A splitblade of destruction (14/19, tradeable, from Drunder) paired with an ornate stone battlehammer (13/19, tradeable, from hard Rujark LDON) is probably the highest DPS setup that you can buy or single-group at this time.  You should get about 90 DPS with this combo fully hasted.  That will come close to windblade DPS, but is unlikely to exceed it.<br />
<br />
The only way you are likely to improve on that is to spend about 5300 LDON points to make yourself two of the 1-handed weapons at the Wayfarer camps, 16/19 and 17/20 I think.  This combo would give you about 115 DPS fully hasted.  This would exceed a windblade, but not a Greatstaff of the 4 Winds.<br />
<br />
As for augments, if DPS is what you care about, then yes, definitely get vengeance augments or damage augments.  You can expect to gain about +0.1% DPS per +1 ATK.  If you don't have it already, then one of the best ways to gain 10-15% DPS is to buy a couple of ST keys and get a prismatic weapon (theoretically 1-groupable) to swap in for the proc.  This assumes you are nowhere near the worn ATK cap, so that you get the full benefit of primal avatar.</div></div><hr />

This seams like a high overall raiting. With a SoD(12/18) and Ichorflow(14/20) I get closer to 65 DPS without offensive AA's. Fully bard hasted I get closer to that number on average though.</div></div><hr />

I am a 59 warrior that recently picked up a Sword of the Crypt Keeper from a ldon adventure.  It is a 42 damage/46 delay weapon that procs a 50 point lifetap, which I augmented with the 50 point lifetap from BB camp.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the weapon is comparable to the Windblade, and with the 2 lifetap effects it procs like crazy.  Personally, I wouldn't use it without some sort of  haste though.<br />
<br />
On my server you can find them in the bazaar for around 5k... which is far less than a windblade will cost.  I really like my weapon.  The dual lifetap procs add damage output and actually make a difference to the healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but a 42/46 weapon with 2 procs is not going to be anywhere near the output of a windblade. Even with 2x 50 pt life taps, you are only getting a bit over 3 DPS from the procs, which is no where near enough to make up the difference in ratio.</div></div><hr />

ARrrrrrg.  I asked this exact question months ago, using these exact two weapons as my example (16/19, 17/20) and was told they wouldn't come close to outdamaging Windblade.  The exact quote I was given in fact, was &quot;No 1handers will ever outdamage Windblade&quot;.<br />
<br />
Here I could have been working towards these two weapons this entire time, but had opted to stick with Windblade cause of the advice I was given from this board.  And now I find out months later this advice was wrong... and no one bothered to correct the guy for my benifit.<br />
<br />
Fucking beautiful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spending precious LDoN points on second-rate DPS weapons strikes me as a shockingly poor idea.  Join pickup tower raids, kill Auliffe Chaoswind ten or twenty times, get lucky on a roll, get your GSot4W.  Much better DPS, and far less time than that needed to accumulate 5300 LDoN points.<br />
<br />
The LDoN weapons are inferior for aggro purposes (only one proc possible) to the standard CHoS/SotB combo, and inferior for DPS purposes to the GSot4W.  Why spend massive points for a second-rate item?<br />

You were well-advised not to buy them.<br />

I had completely forgotten about the procs thing.  Already have the CHoS/SotB combo with 2nd procs on each (not great procs, but something for now), which I only pull out when absolutely needed (which is practically never)... so I guess it's Windblade for life.<br />
<br />
The points will be better spent on armor pieces.<br />
<br />
I'll have to look into this Auliffe Chaoswind giant.  I'm sure we can take him (there are 10 of us total).<br />
<br />
I just wish there were some good DPS 1hander substitutes out there.  I really really miss my 1handed battle spam.  Just my personal preference that I enjoy the feel of two quick blades rather than a slow 2hander... no matter what game it is.<br />
<br />
Explaining the Windblade for life comment, I will never be in a guild.  I did that to death once, and got too burnt out on the soap opera stuff and 100+ man rosters.  It's real life friends or nothing now (which means no Time 1handers or anything even remotely close to that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This seams like a high overall raiting. With a SoD(12/18) and Ichorflow(14/20) I get closer to 65 DPS without offensive AA's.<br />
I have no direct experience with SOD, but I imagine you must be almost 10 DPS higher if you factor in the procs.  Still, that sounds about right.  All the offensive AA's do add up.<br />
<br />
The DPS figures that I listed were based on my own experiences with those weapons and a parser (or equivalent weapons in the case of the LDON ones).  My DPS figures did not include bard buffs.<br />
The exact quote I was given in fact, was &quot;No 1handers will ever outdamage Windblade&quot;.<br />
The windblade has been greatly overhyped due to the nerf of its drop rate.  For a while, everyone had to have one, and there was nothing better.  If you actually parse it, the windblade's DPS is about the same as the war marshal's bladed staff, a much-ignored weapon.  These weapons will sustain about 105 DPS on a good day with the wind at your back.  You should match or slightly exceed this with the LDON 1 handers, depending on your offensive AA's.  The new Sinister Strikes AA will tip the balance further in favor of the LDON weapons.<br />
I just wish there were some good DPS 1hander substitutes out there.<br />
It's not so much that the 1 handers have bad DPS, so much as the 2 handers having really amazing DPS at level 65.  To me, exceeding 100 DPS with groupable 1 handed weapons is a pretty impressive achievement.  In non-raid PoP era, the best DPS weapons are 2 handers.  For aggro you can probably do better by augmenting some 1 handers.  I think it is a deliberate tradeoff that Sony has presented us: aggro or damage.<br />
<br />
I still recommend trying out a war marshal's bladed staff while you wait for a chance at a better weapon.  They don't cost much, and from my own experience, it slightly outdamaged the windblade.  And if memory serves, the war marshal's bladed staff has nicer stats than a windblade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
False.<br />
<br />
I did a parse awhile back.  SoD + Copper Hammer edges out windblade with just melee with Ambidex, Fero3, CF3, Flurry 2.</div></div><hr />

Also, Flurry6 would improve the windblade more than the dual wield setup.  I don't doubt your parsings, but they do not match mine, and I'm sure it's just a difference of AA's.<br />
<br />
I deliberately ignored the BOC and SOD at the poster's request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug.  If PB3 makes a difference in the results, then add in ingenuity 3.  It makes no difference.  Windblade isn't insurmountable.  I did it with no raid weapons at all.  Some high quality 1h's off something actually worth killing will beat the living tar out of it, and be better aggro to boot.<br />
<br />
You could even do it with Copper Hammer/Sword of the bloodsworn i'm sure.  Bloodsworn is damned near exactly the same as SoD, save for a couple DPS in proc damage.<br />
<br />
My results are around here somewhere, but I don't care enough to look for them.  Either way, anyone who claims dual wield is dead in the face of the windblade isn't trying hard enough to make it an option.</div></div><hr />

It is slightly better DPS than a Windblade. GSot4W would be MUCH harder to get on my server, everything is camped 24/7. Are there any decent LDoN 2handers to match it (with certain aug combos)?<br />
The problem is not getting the weapon, it is getting the camp! I can do LDoNs forever, but can't get the camp for items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Copper and Blood have a chance at matching Windblade?  That would be great news as I'd pull them out a lot more often since I love the look and feel of 1handers better.<br />
<br />
When we were all 60 doing LDoN, just working on AAs till a friend caught up to us in level, the two didn't even come close.  The SK was using a War Marshall's, and I was using Copper and Bloodsworn.  We would just barely win, losing often.  We'd just run out of time.  Not enough DPS.  Then we both got Windblades, and we started winning with 20 minutes to spare.  It was a huge difference in DPS at the time.<br />
<br />
But now, we're all 65.  I have Flurry3 and CF3.  Would like to hit Ambidex and a few others too soon (the HP and defensive AAs have been tempting me too much though, and I've been spending there).<br />
<br />
So now, with our new levels and AAs, Copper and Bloodsworn might be an option again?<br />
<br />
I think we could handle a number of mobs in NToV.  Only problem is that I don't think we could handle any adds at all.  Flurry drakes are what I worry about most in that situation.  We'd just get eaten if we had more than one mob I'm sure.  But I can't tell for sure.  The only times I've been in there was with a 60+ man raid, all level 60.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the Bastion giant.  Will have to check on it's availability.  I'm on Stormhammer, so practically nothing is camped 24/7 over here.  Which is why we can get away with our RL friends only grouping and still get some decent targets and equipment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you could probably 1-group the twisted steel bastard sword (Eashen, was it?).<br />
<br />
You could also do Seru with 1 group, and get an even better 2 hander... theoretically.<br />
<br />
But I would suggest that if you can 1-group these mobs, then you already have superior gear to what they drop.<br />
<br />
Why not focus on the one that spawns frequently?  Auliffe is far easier, and spawns something like 27x for each Eashen or Seru spawn.<br />
<br />
On my server at least, you are far more likely to find an opportunity at Auliffe during a given week, than you are to find Eashen or Seru alive for more than an hour or two.</div></div><hr />

Oh god whats the world coming to?  I am agreeing with Haass on this one and will go one further.<br />
<br />
My SoD and BoC combo with Combat Fury 3,  Flurry 3,  Ferocity 3,  Fury of the Ages 3,  Ingenuity 3, and Raging Flurry 3 I can make the Windblade scream for mercy and leave it behind in the dust.<br />
<br />
But beware make sure you have enough defensive AA or you will die quickly to the ripostes from duel wielding those 2 weapons.</div></div><hr />

No dps augments on any of them, and I have no offensive AA's yet at all.   However, my 1H parse did include proc damage from the CHoS.  The test mob was the katta banker.  Using 31% permanent haste, the wmbs did 58 dps, the BoC/CHoS did around 59.5 dps.  My only thought was that the proc damage was unrealistically high, as the green con mob was hit for the full 179 points on pretty much every CHoS proc, from what I remember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I never said that.  I only said hardly anything is camped 24/7 cause of the server that I'm on.  Didn't specify week vs. daily.  Just been reading the suggestions that have been posted so far.<br />
<br />
Of course daily spawns would be easier to get a shot at.  That's just common sense.<br />
<br />
Chances are good we'd eventually get a shot at whatever mob we happened to want to try.  Where as my old server, we &quot;never&quot; would (and never did).<br />
<br />
Yes, you could probably 1-group the twisted steel bastard sword (Eashen, was it?).<br />
<br />

<br />
But I would suggest that if you can 1-group these mobs, then you already have superior gear to what they drop.<br />
<br />
Doubt that we do.  Which means all this talk of NToV is probably moot too then.  My warrior is probably the biggest of the 10 characters.  Level 65, 94AAs, topping out around 7900hps fully buffed.  Everyone else is 65 with 12-50AAs.<br />
<br />
Our roster:  Warrior, SK, Cleric, Wizzie, Enchanter, Shaman, Druid, Rogue, and 2 Bards.<br />
<br />
I'd love to take a wack at someone like Seru, but it's probably not in our future.<br />
<br />
Why not focus on the one that spawns frequently? Auliffe is far easier, and spawns something like 27x for each Eashen or Seru spawn.<br />
<br />
I'd rather do both :)  Whether I had a better weapon or not.  Just so we can say to ourselves that we were able to do it.  But yeah, looking for Auliffe would definately be the quickest way to go if a 2handed upgrade is what I was looking for.</div></div><hr />

He is also the easiest of the tower bosses to kill. Your crew should be able to kill him, but it will be a tough fight with the group make up you have. Adding a 3rd group would make it a heck of a lot easier. You really need more healing with 7.9khp. Add a cleric or 2 and some 3-4 DPS classes and you are golden.</div></div><hr />
