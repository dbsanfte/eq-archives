I have between 200k-300k.  I would like some suggestion on what gear I should be leaning towards.  My LDoN points are in serious lacking points.  I am almost able to be zoning into SolRo.  I am a level 58 Halfling.  Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I just was stating that I am able to zone into most zones.  Sorry for the confusion.</div></div><hr />

1- destroy that ranger toy out of your offhand and buy a CHoS and put it in your primary hand<br />
<br />
2- Learn to properly spend your AAs, you have 12 AAs, no ND, CA, or anything out of basic AAs but you have inate CHA 1?!?!?  :confused: <br />
<br />
3- replace that Dark hoop of the necromancer with either a Bloodmetal earring, Ear Symbol of the Veteran, or Tear of the Rainmaker. Or if you can get some buddies drop into the Hole, kill the Guardian of the Seal and take his earring, it's nodrop 15 AC 85Hp.<br />
<br />
4- Valorium rings! Esspeically replace that ACless garbage known as the Ring of Thunderous Spirits.<br />
<br />
5- Repalce thos Arms! Look at either some ornate or Dried Clay Armguards or AL drops some decent arms if your guild does him.<br />
<br />
6- Get an ele bow<br />
<br />
7- Do the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest<br />
<br />
If you still have money after that look at your boots, bracer(champion), and helm.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe you can easily tank PoV/BoT with 3600 HP and 1100 AC much less wanting to tank SolRo. Just becuase you have the flag doesn't mean you belong in the zone. Also, I'd sell that Zlandicar Talisman unless you're going to turn it in for a key and get a Serpentine Necklace(more AC and HP) and use the extra plat to help elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

As far as PoV/BoT yes I can tank there with the proper group, So far it has bee the birds and another camp that skips my mind.  I have been mainly going with guild members.  As far as the Sleeper's key is concerned I have turned that in for the key.  On the AA issue yup I messed it up.  So I am going to be fixin those once I reach 62+.  Thanks for your imput and advice.</div></div><hr />
