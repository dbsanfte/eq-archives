<br />
Edit: But to actually provide a tiny bit of advice...  It's probably a little easier at lower levels to go with a large race, because you'll have more HPs, but eventually gear pretty much wipes out that advantage, so you might as well go with whatever race you'd like to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pick whatever race you enjoy playing.<br />
<br />
Don't want faction issues? Don't play a DE, ogre, iksar, or troll.<br />
<br />
Want innate regen? Play troll or iksar<br />

Want good night vision? Avoid barbs and humans<br />

If you're going to play anything other than a large race, twink the crap out of him.  Otherwise, your starting str/sta deficiencies will be a tremendous pain in the butt.  Gear is the great equalizer.  Play what you like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pick one that YOU like. Not one because of stats or an ability.<br />
<br />
If you plan on raiding often, put you points into CHA.<br />
If you don't, put them into STA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things to consider.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir have to be agnostic, so no diety armor to twink with.  Not sure which other races can't worship RZ, but depending on what you planned to twink him with, that may be a factor.  This is really only a twink issue, as dropped gear without race/diety restrictions surpasses all the race/diety limited armor.<br />
<br />
Barb, Ogre, Vah Shir all have issues cornering mobs in some locations (even fully shrunk)... easily solved via illusion - but something to consider if this toon will grow up to be an MT for raids.  Gnomes don't need shrink or illusion to corner, not sure about halflings.  Everything else will need at least shrink in some corners.<br />
<br />
Slam is nice for interrupting, but post 55 kick also can interrupt, so the advantage is only while levelling.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, Ogres have frontal stun immunity.  Very nice.  Advantage is partially negated at high level with stalwart endurance aa.<br />
<br />
Halflings and Vah Shir can sneak.  Handy for some questy things if you're in to that.<br />
<br />
Gnomes can tinker.  If you're into that kind of thing, it's a nice side benefit.<br />
<br />
But like other people have said before... in the high end game, gear is the great equalizer.  My guild has MTs that are Ogre, Wood Elf, Barbarian, and Vah Shir.  All of us do just fine, and any differences in our tanking ability is gear and AA related, not race.  We had a halfling for a long time, but he moved to a different timezone guild that fit his playtimes better - he was just fine as well.  Play what will make you happy - the days of fatty tanks being far superior are long gone.  Race really just doesn't matter.   Well, except for the fact that Vah Shir get all the ladies... 'cause we're so damn sexay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your low on cash (or) your warrior is going to be your main character, I HIGHLY suggest you pick an ogre or barbarian and worship rallos zek, the fierce heraldic armor is not only awesome but its incredibly cheap compared to equivalent armor that all races/religions can wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you want the sexiest race that gets all the women, go with dwarf.  Nothing beats the jump roll.<br />
<br />
But like people have said, there is no real superior race, tanking wise.  Choose the race you like the most, for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
If you don't care about race for rp or whatever reasons, halflings are actually a pretty good choice.  Can worship rallos for fierce heraldic (good and cheap), get sneak and hide, and aren't a fat ass.  You will still be an assling though =p<br />
<br />
Also a note, Vah shir do not get slam, even though they are a large race.  They have to rely on kick stun from 55+ like the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Personally, none of the benefits of others is high enough to get me to play anything but a dwarf, and none of those benefits make any race actually superior to another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halflings can be further shrunk.  Not by much, but we can.  You can corner tank most things in the game without having to be further shrunk, but there are some mobs that required me to do so such as the Ancients in Sleeper's Tomb.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, I remember that being about it, hehe.</div></div><hr />

By &quot;mid tier&quot; raiding guild standard, all your melee stats will be maxxed but CHA and as a MT/ST/whatever, your ability to corner (including at a pinch) will be more important than the rest.<br />

Honestly though, because gear and AA mean so much to warriors, it really is like they say, play what you will have fun with.  Because if you dont play them enough to get AA, shrug, aint going to be much of a raider.  And if you arnt playing to be a raider, you are playing for fun, so, again, pick what you will have fun with.<br />

About Ogres. I personally find it kind of anoying that you have to shrink when you walk under a bridge. <br />

Personally i made agnostic human. I dont like the idea of being Rallos_zek_deity_duplicate_12095. Its not realy that bad to not be rallos zek deity if you got a reasonably solid foundation of PP to twink with. <br />

On the other hand, pick a race that you will enjoy playing...it doesnt really matter when you get the gear and aa.

<br />
Fast, great mitigation and &quot;who cares&quot; faction with everyone... except the out-right evil anyway. hehe Well, and trolls... who are still pissed about the whole relocation program.<br />
<br />
On a slightly more serious note:<br />
<br />
Froglok's seem faster to me than just about every other race on Norrath... which I've tried believe me. I'm known (sadly) for leveling an alt to 20-30 and then deleting them because I get bored... which is why after almost four years of EQ... my main isn't 65. lol<br />
<br />
In the end it boils down to -- play what you want to play because you WONT be happy otherwise. And if you're not having fun anymore, might be time to take a break for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, frogloks are obviously faster and mitigate better then others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the posts above suggests (probably with a measure of humor involved) that Fierce Heraldic armor &quot;owns&quot; Tribunal. In fact, the sets are substantially the same. I'm pretty sure all of the pieces have exactly the same AC. I *believe* that FH armor as a set has 5 less STR, 10 less WIS (heh), and 20 less STA than Tribunal. On the other hand, FH has +20 DEX, +25 AGI, and +15 hitpoints over Tribunal.<br />
<br />
The Tribunal's WIS advantage, of course, is completely worthless; the basic differences are that you get more STA with Tribunal, and more DEX and AGI with FH. <br />
<br />
FH is probably more commonly available in the bazaar, and thus perhaps a bit cheaper if you intend to buy all of it that way. But in both cases to get some pieces you'd probably be far better off to contract directly with a friendly GM smith, especially if you can bring them some of the more expensive components (blue diamonds come to mind) and some of the mob-drop only temper components. <br />
<br />
Thus, if you are creating a warrior from scratch, and intend to twink him with player-made armor, the best plan is to ask the smiths you know which set they can make (if the race you're choosing has a choice). If you earned your plat in a legitimate fashion, checking bazaar prices and asking smiths you know will not seem like a big time sink. If you (and I don't mean the original poster, just any generic you) bought all your pp on Ebay, well, it really doesn't matter what you do (other than avoiding at all costs telling your smith that you bought the plat, as someone who took the time to GM smithing may well decide that he doesn't want your Ebay twink ass embarrassing his armor).<br />
<br />
Both sets of armor are so good (AC of 327 and hp 820 and 835 respectively, if memory serves) that if you are wearing them and are lower than lvl 55, any problems you have staying alive are very very very certainly not being caused by your armor. <br />
<br />
In either case, by far the most expensive thing to do is to contract with a smith to make you a set that your character cannot wear because you got the name of the armor wrong, lol. Believe me, it happens.<br />
<br />
Oh, if time sinks do not frighten you, any set of armor you can wear you can probably make. All you have to do is a few thousand smithing combines and a little farming. How hard could that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakatsu</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like the man said &quot;IKSAR&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
All people run at the same speed, it just appears different depending on size and such.  Smaller races look like they run faster when you are playing them, but they run the same as every one else.  (Frogloks are considered a small race, along the same lines as dwarves).<br />
<br />
Also, Dex has nothing to do with mitigation.  It is useful for archery, fletching, minorly for procs, and supposably for melee skill ups, and thats about it.<br />
<br />
Agi does not directly affect mitigation either.  You get about one ac per 7 or so agi, and thats all.  Going from 124 agi (my base) to the 305 cap doesn't make a noticable difference at all in my tanking ability.<br />
<br />
No race has an increased ability to mitigate more than another with equal ac, effects, and aas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gankan</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hussar -  the key word in my prior post was &quot;seems&quot; faster. <br />
<br />
Whether or not the race is actually any faster - there is no hard data to suggest, validate or reinforce that.<br />
<br />
And what all of the stats do has been up for debate ever since EQ was announced so it's really a mute point. This post started out as a &quot;what race should I play&quot; one and so I offered my opinion. You can debate it all you wish but to me, my froglok will always -seem- faster to me. <br />
<br />
However, if it satisfies you, I have removed the &quot;frogloks have increased mitigation&quot; part of my original post. <br />
<br />
Btw, I was not talking about running speed -- I was referring to attack speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't need to get so worked up about it, it wasn't an attack.  I was merely pointing them out because I didn't want someone to read this board and come to believe that something that is incorrect is true, since this is a place where many people come for advice and to learn.  I didn't once say your opinion about the race was incorrect, as it is your opinion and you have your right to it, but that doesn't mean that someone won't correct facts to help make sure others don't get confused.  Being incorrect about something isn't bad, everyone is wrong at some point or another, but getting defensive when someone says it's been shown to be another way is not needed.<br />
<br />
As for what stats do, it's been parsed both here and the shaman boards.  It is no longer a question or a debate.  It is now just a fact.<br />
<br />
As for why your froglok seems faster, it's probably from the way they make the frogloks attack.  The guktan model seems to exagerate their attacks, which leads to the model appearing to be moving more often than other models.  But the movement of the model is only partially connected to the actual attacks.  It does speed up / slow down depending on haste / slow, but it actually doesn't dictate when you really do swing at all.</div></div><hr />

My reaction was based upon how you titled your response - tis very easy to take things the wrong way when someone starts out a corrective post by pointing a finger or naming someone else exclusively. <br />
<br />
Irregardless, sorry if you think I'm upset or if you were upset by my response as well. <br />
<br />
I too come to this board looking for factual information and am quite happy that there is alot of number research and such going into the recommendations here and not just opinions. <br />
<br />
But when you ask what race to play -- you are infact asking opinions and not so much playing the numbers game... especially now, in today's EQ, where there are enough equipment options available to make a &quot;frail&quot; high elf into an exceptional warrior -- if only they could play our class. ;)</div></div><hr />

I somehow survived to where I am today and now revel in the uniqueness of it. Lots of people use /shownames 1 and I get lots of comments like &quot;WTF didnt you FD!?&quot;<br />
&quot;R U going to snare?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow.. Your aggro REALLY sucks.&quot;<br />
&quot;You got to be the most heavily armored SK I ever seen&quot;<br />

I have dug around a bit, and cant seem to find any hard numbers on this. /shrug maybe im not looking in the right place.</div></div><hr />

And you'll see that race has nothing to do with speed of attacks.  That is simply a matter of haste and weapon delay.</div></div><hr />

Just out of sheer curiosity, how much AC is the Iksar racial bonus? <br />
<br />
if my memory isn't clouded by too many beers; i think it's 60AC butt naked with max defense and matchcing agility between toons at level 60.<br />
<br />
granted; this is with zero aa's/etc and taken pre-luclin, so YMMV</div></div><hr />

Actually, did you know wood elf warriors can worship Rallos Zek? Just dont go near the dwarf guards in Butcherblock or they'll kill you.</div></div><hr />

He's doing well at level 9 now after dinkin' around for an hour or so, and he has a full suit of Curscale, minus the arms and a wrist.<br />
<br />
I am pleased so far with what he is capable of, and I love the regen bonus for healing up.<br />

Tomayto, tomahto?<br />
<br />
Yeah but how many AA is that, where the Ogre can put thos points into something else.<br />
<br />
Whether or not the race is actually any faster - there is no hard data to suggest, validate or reinforce that.<br />
<br />
It is a fact that run speeds are identical on all PCs. Run0 is the same on an Ogre, Halfling, Frog, etc. Run3 is the same. SOW (aka Run4) is the same.<br />
<br />
Btw, I was not talking about running speed -- I was referring to attack speed.<br />
<br />
Delay time, or atk speed, is not impacted in any way whatsoever by race.<br />
<br />
But as you say - it boils down to what you like to play! Or just make an Ogre then get illusion items, lol. :)</div></div><hr />
