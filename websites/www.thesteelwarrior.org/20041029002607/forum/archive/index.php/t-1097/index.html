Anyone else still having these issues? Or does my connection just suck? I play with all spells on, btw -- since it &quot;seemed&quot; to help with bugged heals.<br />

I typically have anywhere between 150-200 ping.<br />

In the second one, I am still meleeing after I had 'supposed' to have died, and also recieved a Lay of Hands....</div></div><hr />
