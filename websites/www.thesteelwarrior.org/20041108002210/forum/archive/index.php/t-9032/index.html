<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well OoW has been good to me. These are the pictures of the loot I have gotten so far. I mostly farm in the City of Danik zone. These are mostly from the Opal, Dragon Laborer and Bowman (near zone in) camps. I have gotten over 22 items (7 X on the expulsion item) and 4 runes so far (I am trading runes for items). I can SiX BoXoR RoXoR solo the mobs and the Place Holders with my level 66 characters. I have 920K in the bank from selling items…. I have gotten more loot in the last week then in the past 3 years…. The ring of the Serpents Eye dropped from the PLACE HOLDER of the Opal mob, so I assume it is the rare drop from any mob in the zone. The viel of piety is from somewhere else not sure, traded a rune for it LoLZoRs...<br />

Depends on your gear I guess.  I would be able to 2-box easily in WoS I'm pretty sure.  WAR and CLR magelos below.</div></div><hr />

You may have me a little outmatched in the 2 box setup.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I 2 box my cleric in group less than half the time I'm exp'ing, but my cleric has gotten 3 items in OoW already and my warrior none.  Granted one of those items was lower quality than my warrior would have needed (cleric isn't as well geared) but the other 2 were very nice, just not useable by warriors.<br />
<br />
What's with so much caster loot when warriors are one of the most gear dependent classes in the game?  The only drops I've seen so far that I'd want (2 of them) were also labeled all/all and had stats every class would want.  All 6 people in the group wanted them even when they were no drop.  But my cleric can loot up the caster specific loots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ya I been getting slaughtered in PvP... I was bound in Blood and caught at my bind point heh... But its well worth it I am getting item after item....<br />
<br />
No matter I have 1.1 million pp in the bank now. I played 13 stright hours yesterday, Iv go so many items Iv lost count. I have like 5 of those capes now. Traded a level 66 rune for &quot;soulpiecer&quot; weapon, sold it in 2 minutes in the bazzar for 88K. Traded level 68 rune for a FT2 Agument. Got &quot;earing of oppression&quot; in another rune trade. Most of my guys are maxed at 345 Int and still have Int left over for when I get higher. Nice for non guilded.<br />
<br />
Magelo is now up apparently and I will be able to update when I can log in again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes we get two mages and I get all 6 guys CoH from the Opal Camp to the Stone Camp, and we hold 4 camps down at one time. I had basically the whole zone yesterday and held the Opal, Dragon Lord, Bowman and Stone camp the whole day. Cept for the PvP (about 3 hours)... gratz bind in blood though no run backs heh.<br />
<br />
Got a nice loot system, no one complains. I get every other named (all drops) and other people get choice of item (if two items drop I get what left if only one drops to  bad for me) when its their turns. Turns are based upon when you enter the group. So basically if you join and you stay long enough you are sure to get an item. Naturally people stay and contribute long enough to get their item then take off but its fair because they were last in line to get something when they arrivied. And no one really complains much if they can't use the item, as I will usually trade them something they can use or they see they can sell the item easy. Plus most are non guilded so this is their only opportunity to get drops like this. But some players from the top guild on the server also group during non raid non prime time hours.<br />
<br />
I get most all the exp also, sometimes they will split off to do the PH's by themselves and call me when a named pop.<br />
<br />
I can solo 3 camps by myself but letting in anyone who wants to play is way better then everyone getting mad cause they can't join. And  getting a mage or two for CoH so I dont have to move from camp to camp is ownzors. Plus Necros can solo the PH's at the other camps. Plus we need lots of people for the Pkers, we been trained with bards, rangers and wizards LoL. Kinda hard being in the middle of a named pull and someone brings 10 mobs down on you (gratz evac X 3 but they then train the evac point heh... but then I zone into Blood, but then they train that zone line also.... LoL)<br />
<br />
Im like 40 percent into 66 now just kill PH and named, its realy slow but adds up. Its really dumb to exp right now cause you know they gonna nerf the drops, they not gonn nerf the exp.....  PH are fast pops, if your are doing 3 or 4 camps you barely get back in time for the pop. Ya I suppose if you are doing one camp is &quot;seems&quot; slow but thats not the case.<br />
<br />
I think team evil made an error though we really should have taken Wall of Slaughter instead so that we can get to MPG...  but who knew at the time... Oh well just a matter of getting drops in City zone and trading them for drops form WoS and MPG. <br />
<br />
The only thing my oppenents had over me was a huge gear advantage becuase they had time/elemental stuffs vs. my bazzar stuffs. Now that edge is going to be WAY less.<br />

Think the BBC is better then BoC? No mod on proc rate....? Better then BoC for AGRO (including the better DpS), obvisouly its better for dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are the only two decent weapons on OoW found so far I thinks. Like I say I sold the soulpiercer for 88K as I cant see it as better then OSoW or BoC. The Cleaver might have some potential hard to say though, no idea at all where it drops in the City zone none have droped on my server yet.</div></div><hr />

Very basic, if you don't get fancy and have the right classes its easy to control them from one keyboard. And naturally I have socials for everything.<br />
