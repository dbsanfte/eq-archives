<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was not flagged for either of these two zones but since the new patch thought i may take a look one day. ANyway ive read a bit about CoD and know that it can support exp groups, but never really hear anything about PoTorment.<br />
<br />
Can anyone here give me a brief lowdown on it? Dont want to look like a total noob when i go into the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CoD is pretty fun imho..  Its a dungeon crawl.  Mob respawn is fast.  Go in from zone and turn right (some goul thingees do see invis though) and keep going into the &quot;rat caves&quot;.  This are is pretty large and goes pretty far back into the zone area.  Most are 61 with an occasional name.  Or from zone head straight in up the stairs and fight these walking dead flag carriers.  Some HT but there are alot of mobs back there.   I haven't been to below yet.  As far as Torment goes, I heard from a friend that mobs have insane hitpoints and wasnt worth it.....</div></div><hr />

Mobs have insane hps and give tier 1 experience, its pointless and useless. The only redeeming factor is that it has some pretty cool music.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the info. i was wondering why no one ever talks about going to torment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that and you can get tormentor parts for stew =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CoD is a great zone, but it should never have been opened up to 55+; I know the way SOE did it was to open up the zones that drop ethereal parchments to 55+, and the ones that drop spectral to 62+, but CoD was already train city BEFORE flags being opened; now it's just hellish.  a lvl 55 tank or a lvl 55 enchanter will get chewed up.  Should be at least 60+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once people start getting chewed up, they will go elsewhere until they are big enough to handle it.  I was in CoD last night, and as long as you go in past the entrance, it seemed to clear out pretty well.  We just have to get through the initial onslaught of people wanting to check out the zones that have opened up to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobody 55th level needs to hunt in CoD unless they're there with a bunch of higher level guildies/friends.  I went to get flagged a few weeks ago, everything was extremely red to me at 54.  Watched another group kill a few things, based on the combat  messages I was seeing, no way I'd want to tank anything there until I've got a few more levels under my belt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Torment rots for Xp , but if anyone is doing the Powered Clockwork Talisman quest, the drops are super common go straight across the 4 way and the spider traps ( pop when you walk over them ) the Parylyx Hatchling drop the Strands of Living Chain I got mine after 2 spiders, so its a quick in and out 45 mins max to clear to them and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Played in CoD this morning. The AAexp was pretty good at 65, ranging from 1-2% a kill (2% really common when you go further in)... and mobs drop a lot of tradeskill pieces (tainted planar blah blah blah) and diamons blue diamonds. Everyone in my group, in a 1.5 hour run got at least 2 diamonds and such. I'ts not the best exp in the world, but it's pretty good, and the loot isn't too bad either.<br />
<br />
Havn't been to torment yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wanted to try torment because a putrid belt of rotten hide would help my belt slot and could save me 3500+. so any info on mobs difficulty how often and what type of group do you need would help aton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only been in Torment a few times myself, trying to dual box and with groups.<br />
The front 3 ravens proc silence so keep your casters away, hard to split to begin with (wake of tranquility works though, they are not that high level) and crappy pathing.<br />
Best was a group with a chanter using a CoD-pet there, exp was reasonable but nowhere like tactics or HoH.<br />
<br />
CoD isnt fun anymore, full groups or semi raids of mid to high 50s camping entrance are good for a laugh, its an area where necros used to charm solo and duos can usually keep up with the spawn.<br />
Best was 2 groups unintentionally training each other with their mob, as low health agro is very bad here.<br />
I had my mob agro on someone across the room when it was down to 40 percent life already and try to chew him up, so not the best place to share with several groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive won a lot of loot in CoD.  Being a paladin i get invited to the undead groups there by warriors friends.  I would say BDs, diamonds, are semi common, and the named dropping their loot common.  Sold a Shaman only focus IV item for 20k. Undeads are straight ahead from zone in (dont pull Carprin :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calhoon</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Plane of Torment is a cool zone.  Once you get to the mini bosses etc. you will see some damn nice loot.  If you haven't been, I recommend that you go if you can.  Even for some exp, its just a fun time, and exp really isn't that bad if you have a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wanted to try torment because a putrid belt of rotten hide would help my belt slot and could save me 3500+. <br />
<br />
Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide drops in CoD... off named rats deeper in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with everyone about CoD it rocks and on Tunare server is never crowded maybe 1 group there at most.  I can't understand though why everyone says Torment mobs have insane amount of HP I don't think they do.  I agree about the Tier 1 exp. though but they seem to have HP of a Tier 1 mob.  Most of the mobs I've fought don't hit hard sure they can hit for near 450 or so but it's usually around 128.  Never fought a mini there hardest I fought was some beast looking mob hit for 625 and summoned :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waeolwen</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I loved Torment. It was quite possibly one of the funnest zones I've fought in. Lots of surprises around every corner. Like the mobs that cast a quick cast snare. That makes pulls interesting. The birds out front are easy to break. Just arrow pull the one on the right farthest from the bridge, then the one on the left, followed by the last one on the right. Pulling is made easier if you have a monk; lots of steep inclines make pulling with a bow impossible (mostly).<br />
<br />
The mobs don't hit too overly hard and some can drop spectrals. XP was about the same as Valor or Storms, I thought. CoD did have better XP, though.<br />
<br />
That's my info on Torment. If ya need more, just post here. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. - If you have an enchanter with you that has DC. Kill the birds out front over and over again. A mob called &quot;a small blood raven&quot; will spawn. It's DC'able, always. :D</div></div><hr />
