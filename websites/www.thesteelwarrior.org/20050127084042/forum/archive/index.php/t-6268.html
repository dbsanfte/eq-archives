From looking at the stats on the Berserker Epic we need Epic ver 5.0 not 2.0 :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  If they put in a kunark-level epic quest no one would do it becuase they can go buy a WMBS in the bazaar for 2k and it would be way better.  If you're working on your epic these days as just about any other class, you should know it's for the &quot;fun&quot; of doing the quest, because any high level warrior using epics is pretty sad these days.</div></div><hr />

All a Berserker has is damage.  They don't tank, they don't hide/sneak, they don't feign death, they don't have spells, they just do damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree.  Regardless of what era Zerkers were created, Epics are still Kunark era weapons and should have Kunark-era stats.  Would it be fair if Zerkers got Kunark armor with Ornate stats on it that drop from the same mobs?  No, of course not.  So why should the Epic be any different?  The argument that you can buy better in Bazaar doesn't even make any sense.  People still do Warrior epics and there is no reason to anymore.  It's a status symbol.  Maybe if the Zerker Epic quest was a Pop difficulty, then I could see it.  But the quest is even easier than most of the other epics.  Zerkers didn't get an Epic quest, they got a kickass weapon with a pathetically easy quest.  None of the Epic fights were even remotely difficult (which is right in line with Kunark-era fights at this point).  Bottom line is that the Zerker epic isn't epic at all.  It's like the Rogue epic, which I've seen done in a single day before, except with Pop tier3+ stats on it.<br />
<br />
I will not go so far as to say that it should be nerfed, but I have yet to hear any good argument to incline me to believe that it SHOULD be so much better than the other epics.  There is simply nothing that warrants it beyond SoE wanting to sell the expansion.  IMO, the entire Zerker class was a mistake.  We didn't need another class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, my warrior on TM still has everything for the epic except the queen blade and green scale in his bank.  It's all been there since early velious :p<br />
<br />
And yes, I hate all you guys with the crappy light sabres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with making analogies is that they still aren't the same circumstances.  You have to take things on a case by case basis and since Kunark mobs *don't* drop ornate-level armor for Berserkers, there's no point in using &quot;what ifs&quot; to justify your disagreement.<br />
<br />
High-end items have over 200 hps, crazy effects, stats and resists that can max you without buffs.  The biggest challenge in the game is to get enough people to log on so you put into practice the strategies you read on a message board from people who got the information from devs in beta.   Honestly, this game is 5 years old.  If you still play to be a strict min/maxer or a cross-class whiner, that is your own problem.  There are things I'd like to get and equipment choices I have to make, but the overriding reason I continue to play is to be with friends and to have fun.  A Berserker having a good weapon with little effort doesn't affect either of those objectives.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oddly enough, many zerkers disagree with that.<br />
<br />
Many of them state they tank trash mobs just fine. So they can tank.<br />
<br />
And they have snare, stun and aggro reduction &quot;spells&quot; which is far more than a warrior has.<br />
<br />
But eh, whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh. Now to defend SOE just a little bit, I think it does need to be pointed out that the most likely candidate for the disparity you have detailed wouldn't be fogetfulness on the dev team's part. Nope. The most likely reason for this disparity:<br />
<br />
Employee turnover.<br />
<br />
It's not the same people who worked on Luclin quests, I'd wager.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
I'd love to ask SOE for confirmation of my theory, however, I'm afraid the question would sit in a queue for a month until someone from India gets to it and ignores it.</div></div><hr />

And they all complain about how poorly their snare works and how it doesn't last very long.  An enchanter can tank slowed &quot;trash&quot; mobs with Rune of Zebuxoruk, whoop-de-friggin-doo.  Without some kind of weapon proc, they're not going to keep aggro worth a crap.  You know what I'm talking about, but you just argue for the sake of argument.  We can stun mobs too ... if they're under a certain level and if our kick/bash happens to land at the right time.  Everyone can do a little bit of a few things, that doesn't make much of an argument that Berserkers aren't the class most purely devoted to doing damage though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Riiiiiiight.<br />
All original epics have 100 pts divided between hp and mana.<br />
<br />
Beastlord: 175 hp<br />
<br />
This was the start of luclin when the majority of the high end players had 150 hp in weapon gear.  (BoC/Primal) and single group encounters had better stats.</div></div><hr />

There have been epic upgrades in weapons for warriors with every expansion, just because they they dropped off a single mob rather than involving a huge quest doesn't make them any less epic.</div></div><hr />
