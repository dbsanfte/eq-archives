<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>levonbaird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi my friend told me about something called the wayfarers stone and i know the guy who gives it 2 u but when i talk 2 him he just says that he is busy and cant talk so does anyone know how i can get the stone?<br />
ps. 4 people who dont know about the stone it is in the LDoN and teleports u heaps of places</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you need to go to your home city and talk to an NPC there.  You might have to be a certain level to do this but if you are high enough and go to your hometown, a voice will tell you who to see.  Then follow the dialog and once it tells you you have made progress to becoming an adventurer (or something like that) then go to EC tunnel and talk to the bard guy in the wayfarer's camp.  He asks you 4 questions which can be answered from what the NPC in your home town said.  I think that the answers are &quot;farstone&quot;, &quot;morden&quot;, &quot;favor&quot;, and &quot;adventures&quot; but the order may be different than I said.  Once you answer those questions you get a green augment for the charm slot which he tells you to have on you.  Just keep it in your bag I suppose.  Now you can use the maguses to teleport to the various wayfarer camps by hailing them and saying where you want to go.</div></div><hr />
