Things which are solely science fiction now, could prove to be reality if the world pushed for it. As a side effect, the rest of the world will receive the benefits of these technologies, whether directly or indirectly. <br />
<br />
However the issue remains that with such a push to build a colony on the moon, the current issues that we all face will be pushed aside as irrelevant to the advancement of man. If the world can somehow go ahead and attempt moon colonization, and at the same time, solve the problems of the world, then yes, we should go for it. <br />
<br />
In summary?<br />
1. Solve world problems first (food crisis, terrorism etc)<br />
2. Make it a world effort to achieve the colony<br />
3. Make the results of the development available to all nations of the world, not a select few.<br />
<br />
If we can do the 3 things above, yeah, let's go for it.</div></div><hr />

 * ISS is a 0 gravity light-station in  low altitude. <br />
 ---- 0 gravity : human being can't live under a given thresholds of gravity (out of memory, this threshold is 0.2*g, g being the everage earth gravity) without slowly loosing its health. At the end death can happen. thus human being can't stay for an extented period of time in the ISS.<br />

 ---- it is mainly use for studies of long 0-gravity exposition. plus some observations.<br />
<br />
 * a moon base<br />
 ---- the average moon gravity is under the thresholds of livable (out of memory, moon's gravity is around 0.18*g). thus human can't lives for an extented periode of time (longer than on the ISS, but still finit).<br />
 ---- a buried moon basis would gain radiactive protection from the whole satelite.<br />
 ---- the moon is really far from earth (few days of travel) increasing very much its cost of exploitation. Moreover between the moon and the earth there is two 'rings' (don't remember their name) that are filled the all the high-energy charged-particles that are captured by the magnetic field of the earth making their crossing dangerous for living being. All the Apollo missions crossed theese rings two times each thus a human being haven't cross them more than few time, but creating a persistent basis on the moon would oblige spacenautes to cross them much more, increasing their chance of developping cancers.<br />
 ---- it can't be used for 0-gravity studies, thus ISS is still needed. the space observation can be automatised ala Hubble thus doesn't need human being on the moon. the underground can be studied with robots, ala Mars pathfinder, thus doesn't need human being on the moon. the earth observation is made easier from low altitude, thus it would be dumb to do it from the moon. Creating a 'first step' into space travel (with or without life on bord) is a good thing to do on the moon. However it would be more efficient to do it from a space station (ala ISS) that gravits around the Moon in orde to not have to take off twice (from the earth and from the moon). Moreover a 'tanker station' or 'dock station' doesn't need a human being for its maintenence.<br />
<br />
So all in all, there is very very few scientific purpuse to build a staion ON the moon, and even less to make it livable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually this is the only good point I see for doing it. wasting trillions of dollards in such things would boost some part of the industry world-wide, same for many other scientific fields. But the question, as mentionned above, is do we really have nothing better to do? like signing the Kyoto act and decrease the pollution.</div></div><hr />

For example : <br />
Take the &quot;Star Wars&quot; program under the Reagan administration.<br />

Not to mention every since activity related to that industry.<br />
<br />
So far so good.<br />
<br />
Built me 10 Laser Canon Satellites, but them into orbit.<br />

But the major issue for human travel on Mars is psychological !<br />
no human has been out of sight of the earth for more than few minutes, and during this time, both the sapenautes and the earth basis were stressed at max. a travel to mars implies getting out of earth sight (and vice versa) and nobody can tell if spacenaute would be able to keep their mind...<br />
because we are much more concerned with risks than before I think we won't let human going to mars if we can't afford an 'emergencie trun back at 180° and run back home&quot;, which we can't right know (too too too too too too much expensive).</div></div><hr />

1. The technology developed would &quot;Trickle-Down&quot; to the consumer level eventually just as the initial space technology did (velcro anyone?)<br />

<br />
My thoughts.<br />
<br />
I think we should for various of reasons, however i was wanting counters to my arguement as well. To find the holes per say, or to rip it apart.  :)<br />
<br />
Why the moon? Because its close to us. Its like moving out the first time. You always know you can go home if you need to (for most people).<br />
<br />
These are few additional to Grumbam's<br />
<br />
First, I believe we should go to put a base in the moon. Why?<br />
1) Use it as a space port to say. Considering most rockets use most of their fuel to get out of the earth's automosphere, and there is much less gravity on the moon they could refuel there and go on.<br />
2) The resources: The helium 3 was talked about. Yes, at this point we can not truly harness it, but better way than be there and try different things. Not only the H3, but mining asteroids.<br />
<br />
there is a platinum asteroid that is worth about $5 trillion or $6 trillion, as well as an asteroid that has more steel in it than all the iron on Earth<br />
<br />
And these are just a few asteroids. There are many, not are valuable, but they all have resources to be harnessed. Heck, some may have resources that we have never seen before.<br />
There is the make up for the cost to ship everything up there.<br />
Along the same reasoning, what if you could make more raw materials in one asteroid than you can in clear cutting a forest. Which would you choose? Which makes more sense, clear some oxygen producing life forms or dig on a floating hunk of ore?<br />
3) Making us relearn how to care for the environment--One person pollutes and everyone pays.<br />
4) To EXPLORE. Explore the moon to maybe help us understand our past.<br />
<br />
every time we go into space we learn something new. it offers advantages that cannot be found on earth. and we do it mostly because.. thats what man does. we explore and learn and reach out further. its in our nature<br />
<br />
5) Low Gravity Experiments. Yes, this can be argued that the ISS is this, but its still one more reason.<br />
6) To have a global effort that might actually work.<br />
I always use to say the only thing that would bring the world together is either a great cause or a great claimity. Lets hope for the cause.<br />
7) To meet the challenge and say we could do it and do it.<br />
8 ) I'm leaving the searching for new and unconvental life out of this.<br />
<br />
In reference to NASA not having the money. If this is a global effort, there very may be private investors that will contribute: The Mars Society, Alliance to Rescue Civilization (they are interested in using the moon as a DNA bank incase something goes wrong on Earth), MirCorp (was in the works with Russians to fund the first PRIVATLY Corporated Owned spacestation), and a few others.<br />
<br />
There are more reasons but i am brain dead and will have to give them later.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for those people that support Bush<br />
not only would it get the focus off Iraq, but:<br />
B) To bring freedom to the moon before tyranny can get its hold on it.<br />
<br />
Do i think we should do it? Yes. When? As soon as we can, otherwise we may lose our chance forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3.

<br />
Is it just me or does anyone else find it disturbing that America would have to resort to a moon base to fend off its enemies... Actually, I think what Grumabm was getting at was that the US needs a moon base to intimadate its enemies, which is pitiful at best. Because lets face it, I think I'd be much more affraid of a tactical nuclear strike from long range balistic missles(which would probably be much cheaper and do more damage) than I would be from a moon base. Not really a strong arguement when you factor in other cheaper methods of blowing the shit out of other countries.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, to get back on track with the topic of the thread...<br />
<br />
Do I think going to the moon and making a base there would be money well spent?<br />
<br />
Not really. I think all the money that could be used to fund this space exploration could be better spent in medical research. I think that finding cures or at least more effective treatments for illnesses like cancer, AIDS, asthma, diabetes, etc. would be a much better use for the vast amout of money that would be required to fund  trips to the moon and to create a permanent base.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand, automated mining machines to farm astroids for resources would actually be benefitial to the human race and the planet. <br />
<br />
But then again, what do I know? I'm just a 19year old kid from Canada</div></div><hr />

1. Develop a malaria vaccine<br />

3. Teach the hundreds of thousands of children whose lives would be saved each year by this vaccine to read.<br />
4. Eighteen years from now accept any of these children into US universities if they test higher than the American kids who spend their time diddling around searching the web for pictures of unusually well-formed breasts, sending text messages, and playing video games, much to the detriment of their ability to engage in sustained logical thought.<br />

That's f*** asskicking. Everytimes the journalist tried to find an issue he couldn't solve, this man just ansered &quot;it's not a problem, we can do ... bla bla bla&quot;.<br />

So yes, I aggree with Emilia. but remember what I said, we can't establish a true colony on the monn because the colons would have to get back on earth to rocover from the too-low gravity.</div></div><hr />

Why build a moon base?  thats like asking why europe wanted to find a new route to asia.<br />
<br />
Just think about history..  what would have happened if no one sailed across the atlantic.  no USA, at least not as we know it now.   Everyone just knew the world ended just over the horizon and that horrible sea monsters waited to sink any ships that strayed from the established 'safe' routes.<br />
<br />
Medical research?  Feeding the poor?  As far back as i can see in any history book i look at, those problems have ALWAYS existed.  They always will.<br />
<br />
The great strides made by any nation came when those nations pushed the frontiers.  looked beyond their front yards and reached for the unknown.  <br />
<br />
Not only should we build a moon base, but we have to.   Any nation that does not grow eventually collapses.  Its people become lazy.  They start relying on other nations to do their work and produce things for them.  Look at ANY nation in ANY period of history and you will see the pattern (by the way, those of us in America are living in Rome just before the collapse).<br />
<br />
Yes it will cost trillions of dollars.  Yes we will militerize space (if you think we havent already, your just plain dumb).  We will also reap untold profits and gain uncountable benefits from doing it.  What are these profits and benefits?  I have no idea, thats what SCI-FI writers are good at.  Go read a book and see what is possible.  Todays science fiction is tomorrows fact.  Landing a man on the moon!  perposterous!  Having a steel ship that actually sails under the water?  Are you daft man!<br />
<br />
It use to take months to cross the atlantic and how many people died to the unknown storms, reefs, and other dangers that the unknown always hide.  But look at what it takes now, just over 200 years later, hours.........<br />
<br />
The only way to survive is to grow.  Mankind will eventually have to colonize space or we will die on this world.  The sooner we start the sooner we make it routine.  there is only two constants in life, the first is everyone will eventually die and the second is everything will only cost more in the future.<br />

<br />
1. The technology developed would &quot;Trickle-Down&quot; to the consumer level eventually just as the initial space technology did (velcro anyone?)<br />
<br />
2. After the end of the cold war, so many defense contractors went out of business, this push could restore a quantity of manufacturing and reasearch jobs to the U.S. These jobs are sorely needed. <br />
<br />
3. It's crucial to our security the America retain it's lone superpower status. A base on the moon would provide a technological and psychological symbol for our power that would help us negotiate with our enemies in europe, asia, and the middle east from a position of strength. <br />
<br />
4. Little boys (and girls too) would dream of becoming scientists and pilots again, instead of strung-out hippies or violent gangsters. Achievements in the sciences are far better goals for our young people.<br />
<br />
Solid gold there.<br />

For all the problems and negatives people can focus on, there's a few strong reasons for yes.<br />

I'm torn on the situation.  I'll let you guys debate it out before i take a side  :D .</div></div><hr />

no problem to bump old thread when making a good post. At last somebody made a rafreshing post that difer from the usual flame-troll battles. Unfortunatly some have already jump on your tail.<br />
You brought new idees to the table, and they are interesting enougth to discuss about them. <br />
but I will wait a bit to think about it deeply.<br />

<br />
Note: there is much more grammar whore on this board (were you able to read me?) so don't worry to much about the spelling. ocasionnally some troll make funny jokes and that 's it.</div></div><hr />

You're right.<br />
<br />
The only thing I really have to say is that growth and progress towards &quot;utopian&quot; society seem kind of impossible to do at the same time.<br />
<br />
With that said, people love to screw. Screwing makes babies. Babies are the biggest example of growth, one of the oldest kinds, and aside from StarBucks, one of the most delicious!<br />
<br />
Its really a shame I'm so greedy, and so are you.  We could have a really perfect society without it.  All we have with it is shiny things, and a wish to not be so readily distracted.<br />
<br />
Heh.  There's more to my whole opinion, but I don't think writing a super long post about this is really smart right now, since I should be writing a thesis statement for something else haha...</div></div><hr />

Going to the moon for a base:<br />
<br />
Yes &amp; No!<br />
<br />
NO: If we government fund it and have other severe problems then hell no.<br />
<br />
YES: If we make it private like NASA should of been 50 years ago then hell yes.  I read an article 2 or 3 years ago that went in depth about how if NASA had gone private in the early 50's, today it would not only be the largest company in the world it would of paid for all of its programs 11 times over.  The sheer number of things produced by NASA that we use today is taken for granted. Everything from Velcro to Cars for the handicapped.........<br />

and yes...fucking ANTIMATTER! yes we have not only proven it exists we have produced it.  Take a look on google if you don't believe me. And no it still has not broken the golden ratio....but like fusion its close.<br />
<br />
<br />
not to mention things we have figured out from going into space including....<br />

hole in the ozone<br />
hazards of solar radiation<br />

how to more effectively manage crops and our national forests<br />

any company with that resume would require gross missmanagent not to be profitable<br />

Call me a capatalist pig if you wish, but people work when motivated and you could get them a lot more motivated by saying &quot;Hey, solve every problem involved in getting a permenent base on the moon we will take a few spin-off ideas an make you so filthy rich your dog will have his own 300,000 sq ft mansion with his own private jet and a personal maid to scratch ole fido's nutz!&quot;.<br />

That would motivate me! .....damn it now my nutz itch......<br />

PS: you know it would be pimp to play EQ on the moon! (yes yes i am aware of the delay fo msg transmission, but if thats what you were thinking then your unaware of another technology NASA is currently working with spun-off of their anti-matter work. but thats another topic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">moon colony.  ok.  how many people does it take to qualfy as a colony?  a base viable breeding gene pool?<br />
<br />
i belive thats a minimum and don't quote me i maybe wrong.  but i belive thats minimum of 48 people or so to have a viable gene pool base.  <br />
<br />
ok  thats alot of water.   thats alot of air.  thats alot of food.  <br />
<br />
you do realise that 6 months in a enviroment without 1 gravity will ruin bones and muscles?  you would have to exercise Vigouriously  daily to keep up the muscle and bone mass..   for life.   thats eats alot of energy.  <br />
<br />
all i can say is.   to build a Viable moon colony you need some MASSIVE transport power which the pitiful shuttles are whoafully inadequit for the job.<br />
<br />
all the digging equipment would have to be brought up.   mining equipment.  hydroponics.  heating/cooling.   recycling.  <br />
<br />
the Project is MAsssive.   and  what would you get for your returns?<br />
<br />
yes  a project of this size would need to have some sort of real use.  <br />
<br />
about the only things i can think of would be a Construction and refueling base for Real spaceships.   or more sinister  a weapons platform.  <br />
<br />
but again you need one thing on the moon i do not think there is Enough of to warrent the entire process.    Water   Lots and Lots and Lots of water.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but i think thats a given....<br />
<br />
and what would you get for your returns? <br />
<br />
Did you read the posts before this or just add your own =P?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for all the problems with going to the moon you listed......yes thats why its a challange. And I don't think their aim is for a &quot;colony&quot; as you define it yet.  They just want astronaughts up thier for now. So more like 5 to 6 people, which is significantly less hassle for food and the like.  Once they are setup, the base can be expanded more easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poor overpopulated countries don't need your monitary/food support.  They need birth control and education.  As is a lot of the countries are overpopulated for the amount of theoretical inhabitants the land can support.  What happens in nature whan a population booms to a greater level than the land can support?  Massive starvation and death/disease until equilibrium is once again maintained.  By shipping our shit to them we basically change it from a localized problem to a global problem.  In the end it will catch up with us if the world doesnt wisen up.  This planet can only support so many people.  We support their already overpopulated areas such that they continue to thrive and grow .. much like a tumor it will inevitably kill its host (the planet) if not kept in check.<br />
<br />
That said Americans are over-fed and we could do to ship some of that excess food abroad (and we do).  Don't use the poor and suffering folks of the world as some sort of proof text in an argument to hamper progress.  The poor and hungry have always been around.  They will always be around.  If we continue at the rate we are going though all of humanity will be in trouble.  As much as I hate to admit it, the chinese were/are on to something with their 'x number of children' laws.<br />
<br />
Yes to moon research.  Yes to outerspace projects.  Yes to progress.  I bet you could come up with a list over a million long of things we waste money on.<br />
<br />
I don't want to come off as a heartless fuck, but when you step back and look at the cold hard facts ... well ... i'm just stating the facts.  The human population is growing.  There's only so much habitable space at this point.  Unless we can expand the habitable space at a rate equal to the rate of growth, we're fucked in the long run.  We're already taking our toll on mother earth.  More importantly than the 'habitable space' persay is the sheer volume of biological life this planet can support.  With our views of humans &gt; all non human life, we as a race are taking up other animals' 'spots' on this planet.  What happens when only humans are left?  No other animals and our population keeps growing?  No way to supply the population with food?  Starvation.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant, I just hate it when clueless bastards want to rub the poor/starving people of the world in your face whenever it comes to spending money on government projects.  I'm all for helping the needy of the world, but not at the expense of hampering the progress which will inevitably save the human race.<br />
<br />
As Tam pointed out, the innovations that would come from moon colony research alone would foot the bill for the project ... maybe not directly but the trickledown will have huge impacts on society.  It would also jump-start the economy like nothing else, creating tons of jobs.  Anybody remember the single biggest economy boosters in this country?  Thats right ... the world wars.  It helped put the money in the hands of the people that needed it most: the workers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I've already said in this thread before, the whole &quot;moon project&quot; and &quot;exploration of outer space&quot; business would be a terrible mismanagement of money. <br />
<br />
Yes, the research and development required for the project would create new and ingenous things that we've all dreamed about... but when it comes right down to it there are more important things in this world that need to be addressed first. <br />
<br />
like...<br />
Education for everyone (and not just the people or your country, i mean the whole fucking world), a lack of education breeds ignorance. So much of the disease, illness, poverty, hunger, etc in this world could be avoided through proper education. I believe the saying goes &quot;give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, teach a man how to fish and he will never go hungry&quot; We have to get over the mentality that a few dollars or some aid supplies  is helping people. The only thing these people are learning is to become dependant on aid  from other countries. Sure, they may be alright in the short term, but what happens when the aid stops coming? They starve or drink bateria filled water and struggle to find food. I'm sure the poor and the truly needy of this world are going to be helped by finding new ways to recycle water or by finding new ways to make your food last a little longer in the freezer.<br />
<br />
Medical advancements: Finding cures and superior alternative treatments and vaccines to major illnesses should be much higher on the &quot;to do&quot; list than making a jump platform for outerspace missions on a rock. How many people know someone that has died from cancer or an illness? I'm sure the answer is just about everyone. In 25-30years would you rather have a man on Mars and a new microwave that can cook anything perfectly in 10seconds, or have your son or daughter or wife/husband or grandchild survive a bought with cancer because we decided to invest the money we have today into advancements for treatments? I think I'd rather see my son/daughter/grandchild get married and have a life than have to bury them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm tired of writing now, so I think I'll wrap up. <br />
<br />
There are a bunch of other things that should come before space exploration, just look around and you'll see what I mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many medical discoveries and advancements were the product of nasa's experiments ... please bear in mind that a lot of the raw materials used in today's medicine were pioneered from space technology.<br />
<br />
Medical advancments are moving as fast as they ever have been or will.  There is so much money involved in the making production and sale of medical stuffs that pouring more money into it won't help it move much faster.</div></div><hr />
