It's much clearer ... kinda like &quot;Are we to be the aggro tank, the dps tank, or the damage sponge tank, and how do the upcoming changes address what we are to become?&quot;<br />
<br />
My take on the upcoming changes is ... I cannot, as of yet, lay my hands on an EB type weapon.  But I am about to become one, and dammit that's a good thing.  Today, with a smart group, I can do my job well and I can almost keep up with a group of micro-encephaloid monkeys.  With the changes, I should be able to bump up each end of the spectrum by a notch; I'm looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

None of the new abilities in the Provoke line change them.  I did not want to sully this thread with them, however, I guess I have to justify this thread by stating that I believe the devs are working on the capstone abilities without laying any foundation work.  This is, unfortunately, a colossal waste of time, which I'd prefer not occur.  The provoke line is fluff if more fundamental changes do not take place, and if they do, will probably not be needed.  Note that not needed is not the same as not welcome.  I'd be overjoyed if it looked like the devs put the entire provoke/openining/increased mitigation changes on hold to do more fundamental nuts and bolts work, as opposed to the current attempt to wallpaper over cracks in the middle of an earthquake.<br />

Tell me what the end goal is and I can make suggestions......  Hence this thread.<br />
<br />
I could say what I think needs to get done for what I'd like to see happen for warriors (best raid tanks+adequate xp group tanks+better PvE balance for EQ in generaL), but then I've already said it elsewhere.  Of course, the current changes don't do any of that (except, maaaaybe, adequate xp group tanks, but we are so far behind there its not even funny and any improvement at the moment is coming from a round of mudflation and hence even more damage to PvE balance in general) so for all I know the devs are trying for something completely different.<br />

All of this is great. the opening system (while everyone will agree the openings are too short) is what will make us diferent from the basic casters. Just like in real combat you cant head bash or slash the joint of the enemy's armor if you dont see an... opening, heh.<br />

<br />
Please?I agree with that statement. I also understand why this rabbid band of monkeys is deluging this dev with questions - he's really the only official sony responce we've gotten that hasn't been read out of a PR policy handbook.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps the point isn't the end goal but rather the process of getting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First off instead of posting this question you should have just emailed him (read the post from him , he welcomed feedback to his email about the changes as well as posting on that thread).  Expecting him to come over to another thread and then explain what their visions for warriors are  . . . is IMHO asking way to much.  <br />
<br />
It would be absor's job to answer your question anyhow.  Ryan is working on this system and getting working as intended.  Having to step out and explain to you class balance etc is probably not really high on the priority list.  His job persay . . is to get this system working correctly, and tweaking it in order to achieve balance.  It was remarkable he came here and asked for feedback, even gave us some insight.  To expect him to come here and explain what they mean by balanced is just  . . . well . . . silly.  Besides, i'd prefer him to be coding some changes into the provoke line rather than explaining what's he's doing; leave the PR for the PR people ie Absor.<br />
<br />
If you really want an answer to your question i'd email it to ryan and you might get an answer, however i wouldn't expect one it you are just going to flame away and blast the system, and demand a clarification on what class balance is.<br />
<br />
I did email ryan some input as to how i feel about the system so far, and surprise I got a response.  To summarize the developers are not really happy with the system so far, the timers to openings will be removed because the randomness of the openings is restricting enough.  provoke will be on it's own timer, and will be available often enough for 1 a fight.  He emphesised that they were not done tweaking the system and that the changes should enable our actions to make a difference in combat, not just eye candy fluff (which the current openings aren;t even much eye candy either).  <br />
<br />
If that isn;t enough of an answer for your question i suggest you email him your feedback since he gave you that option.  I might also add that I am fairly impressed that they came here, discussed stuff with us, and heck he even answered my email even though my name isn;t Frodlin, Furor, or Brutal . . . maybe he isn;t aware of SoE's bad public image?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Non-RNG agro is nice, but not actually required.<br />
An inherent damage mitigation advantage is needed, but mitigation ACROSS all classes is too high already, boosting it even more will to scant little.<br />
Request number three I view as windowdressing, but whatever.<br />
Request 4 is important.<br />

 <br />
<br />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
The agro generation ability still is inferior to knights (hey, I don't mind this, I actually approve).<br />
The damage mitigation, while a boost, doesn't actually help in any relevant fashion.  Look at the next comment to see why more damage mitigation is not needed.<br />
If /discs were important, then you'd see people doing tank swaps.<br />
The opening system is frosting, tasty, but not exactly nutritious (and in its current form, its fairly stale, too).<br />
Taunt success/fail is ok albiet not something that would affect balance.  I'd VASTLY prefer an ability to tell what my target's target is of course, beyond /assist.<br />

I expect people to swoon in rapture over changes that won't actually affect class balance, until its too late.  I expect to be a Cassandra (who, you should recall, was correct to be pessimistic about that whole horse thing).  I don't want to be one but I find the odds of either most warriors agreeing with me before its too late or the devs sitting down long enough to come up with a useful plan rather unlikely.  I guess I am just trying to get my opposition to the changes on record, so I can say &quot;I told you so&quot; a month from now.  It kinda sucks to being reduced to that though.  *sigh*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Since there was so much assumption and not enough fact surrounding the aggro relationship between warriors and knights with the new skills, I decided to go ahead and test it myself.<br />
<br />
All I can say is you'll be surprised at how warriors stack up to knights with the new skills.   I'd call it &quot;balanced&quot; even.<br />
<br />
I used a 55 Paladin<br />
Raaj used a 65 warrior with Raex BP<br />
<br />
If I pulled with Cease, he'd get aggro with 2 berates (no attacking)<br />
<br />
If he pulled with berate, it took me 4 cease/stuns to get the mob off.<br />
<br />
When using Spirit of Rage + Raex + 2 berates, it took 8 stuns to get the mob off of him and aggro was still wormy.<br />
<br />
If I pulled and meleed, I kept aggro with cease/stun.<br />
<br />
I held no commanding advantage over him like I would in today's EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Interesting results, Frod, and it's a direction I can wholeheartedly approve of. However, may I suggest that this test be refined by the addition of an otherwise uninvolved puller, in order to minimize the effects of the apparent initial aggro modification? The ratio of cease to Berates seems strange, and highly dependant on that intitial aggro. While the tank can be reasonably expected to pull in some exp groups, a raid will have a dedicated pull team, and I think this needs to be accounted for.<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to participate in this myself, even though I'd only have a /testbuff character to work with.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the death of aggro control in everquest? It reads to me that the pally had to go to a fat whack of effort to break the aggro control, and the warrior actually had a big fatty of it until then.  Mebbe I misunderstand your intent, as I know you've posted that aggro lock is not a good thing - if I read along the lines of &quot;Welcome to the end of the art  of aggro control and the birth of aggro lock for all tanks&quot;, it gels with what you're saying.<br />
<br />
Kraydak, I am kerfuffled by your posts.  I think I know pretty much what you don't want (it looks like everything, the current and pending system), but I can't figger out what you do want.<br />
<br />
I'd VASTLY prefer an ability to tell what my target's target is of course, beyond /assist.  I don't know why we need two ways to do one thing.  Mebbe you wanna redirect the output, so your own target doesn't change?  Stuff like that is ouching my gray matter.<br />
<br />
I'ma echo the other suggestions here and say you may wanna send the fella an email, describing your vision and the flaws you see in the current and proposed systems.  It looks to me like the general tone of responses your getting here is &quot;If you don't want this, what do you want?&quot;.   Once you've defined that, you may be better able to describe your complaints.</div></div><hr />

all/all itemization is still a problem.<br />

If we are on par with them, they will not fix the warrior issues of AC and HP with all/all armor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Needing 8 stuns to pull off a Warrior that is NOT meleeing is just utterly ridiculous.  It destroys a large part of warrior progression via equipment for aggro control.  While in the current state of the game it may not matter (because aggro is broken on Knights right now) I expect all aggro abilities to get scaled back once they're live and the effects can be observed.  I have never had a group situation where the Paladin needs to stun the mob more than twice to get aggro back.  I'm sure people can always play dumber but that's not the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">kray this is in no way a waste of time, sorry to be frank but i see you as another nay-sayer who is pissing on the paraid and telling us its raining.<br />
<br />
perhaps you didnt notice but this is a VASTLY flexible class changing system, the problem with our class was we where so specialized when no flexible change system was placed in the same vein, like pure casters get, this new system gives us the flexiblity to live on.<br />
<br />
patron are you upset because stuns arnt aggroing as well by comparson?<br />
<br />
consider that the effect of hate overtime doesnt stack, and that any warrior mashing this ability will soon be out of go-juice and as helpess as prior to changes.<br />
<br />
and i noticed people going on about gear progression, if i could i would slap you, all paladins of the same level almost always have access to their class defining spell lines, same with pure caster(aside for a few ruins which can be got in pick up raids)<br />
<br />
now warriors on the other hand, our weapons (most of the time) match our guild, or if you bought PP online, your bank account(i frown uppon this) it is sad that we have to have a perma camped hate weapon to do our job, which half of us will never see, how can you even call it gear progression when we dont move up the ladder with out abandoning our family guilds? no other class puts that emphasis on their weapon, and the dev's said back in velius that proc aggro was a short term solution<br />
<br />
<br />
as always sorry for blatant spelling errors, but im to lazy to correct them :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Phantron,<br />
<br />
I dont' think you let this sink in....<br />
<br />
The warrior used.... a Raex BP (dismissing your &quot;the end of progression via equipment argument), he also used a high endurance discipline which increases aggro generated by 50%, he also used berate to pull the mob, and he ALSO let it go through it's entire duration, and he ALSO cast it again AND let it go through it's entire duration AGAIN.    To be frank, I was surprised that it only took 8 stuns (without ever hitting melee attack).   <br />
<br />
To call it &quot;utterly ridiculous&quot; is to not look at the relevant data.    The Raex BP is relevant, the fact that he pulled is relevant, the fact that he used a hate increasing discipline is relevant, the fact that he let the FULL duration go, not once but TWICE before I started in is relevant.   The paladin was 10 levels lower with no AA and in craptacular gear, it probably should've taken more like 10 stuns to pull aggro, not 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">frod dont get to mad, its just like them tell us to ignore 1 paladin tanking a mob that was ment to be warrior only :D<br />
<br />
to be honest the warrior had used things that added to the hate generated, and the paladin wasnt stunning WHILE he was using his belittle, it was once he was all done, if you where stunning as he was building aggro i would see a problem here, but if you let a tank build up 2000+ hate then i would complain that he had aggro /eyeroll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Aggro was the only thing knights had.<br />
<br />
Knights have so much to offer added to aggro generation...<br />
<br />
Shadowknight can snare, tap atk and stats (I think) increase aggro of everyone else, FD (and everything FD imply) and add a great burst DPS.<br />
Paladins can root, heal, fast heal, group heal, rez, DA... <br />
<br />
I group regulary with a (good) paladin in LDoN adventures. with this paladin of my guild I was full buffed to about 8k, he was at 7k9 and had 50 more ac. He dont play more than me, we have the same level of gear.<br />
Am I a better tank than him ? it was not noticeable. Does he have more to offer ? certainly, the only thing I have over him is to use defensive on the boss at the end of assassination.<br />
Oh I'm better at DPS when there is no undead too, but because he cant do his SU crits (usually under 1k but sometimes a lot more :p)<br />
<br />
<br />
About the increased aggro generation : I know some warriors with no EB (or anger3 procs).... and I know some damage dealers that dont WANT to group with those warrior because they are diminished when they group with them. Here is 2 tells I received on Karana with pickup groups<br />
<br />
&quot;it's great you have a boc, the warrior before you get us killed 2 times&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;sorry the chanter wants a knight or he leave&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Originally posted by Varalla <br />
when all I wanted was mitigation, AC, and HP over hybreds to ensure I will always have a job The amount of AC/HP that would be required to make a significant difference in tanking ability in a non-raid situation would completely break the game. A boost of even 15% to AC/HP would make warriors so powerful that mobs would have to be buffed across the board. Warriors already have an advantage in AC/HP (it's less apparent on the high end because it doesn't scale, in the low to pre-elem game, which makes up 90% of people, it is VERY apparent).<br />
<br />
You are right, this does not fix the itemization problem, but it does address some other very important issues in non-raid situations, which is where warriors where hurting the most. Just because a knight CAN tank Quarm doesn't mean you are out of a job. That would be like saying warriors are obsolete because a druid tanked Vindi. Other classes tanking old content is not new, and warriors will still be used to tank mobs until new content has been farmed into submission.<br />
<br />
Aggro was the only thing knights had. Well, that and life taps, heals, buffs, LoH, HT, rezzes, snare, and root to name a few. Warriors could have the same agro lock ability as knights and we would still lack the utility that comes with a spellbook. Openings will help address that to a point.</div></div><hr />

I read that as a reference to openings? Right?<br />
<br />
Here's a quote I just read from Rytan about openings:<br />
<br />
&quot;Openings are outside the scope of this discussion so I’d rather not get into them here. Suffice it to say we’re not happy with their current state and plan on making lots of changes before they go live.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I've read here and elsewhere that openings have been undergoing constant testing since this all started. That the window frequency has changed. That the window duration has changed.<br />
<br />
And now I read from one of the devs that they're still not happy with how windows are working.<br />
<br />
They HEAR YOU. They really do. They don't want you getting carpal tunnel either, I don't think.<br />
<br />
So, uhm ... I guess that's good news? Maybe?<br />
<br />
I'm a wait and see what they do to openings. But at least it's very good news to read that from a dev and realize he hears the feedback, and they're all taking this into consideration and working on getting the system to work better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Let me think.<br />
<br />
2*{300+60*(60/6)} + {15+50}%*{300+60*(12/6)}= Approx. 2220 hate In the course of 120 seconds,  or ~19 hate per second, so powa .:rolleyes:  <br />
<br />
BTW: the higher level one jumps up to a &quot;mighty&quot; 23 hate per second.<br />

Did you try with higher level stuns Frodlin?<br />

It's been discussed, and shown, time and time again that extra mitigation and AC isn't gonna help a warrior who can't get decent control over aggro as compared to a knight of the same level and equip.  Unless that warrior only logs on to MT a boss mob.<br />
<br />
Can I do the job without the tweaks?  Hell yah.  Am I gonna be able to do the same job better now?  HELL yah.  It may help to remember that most of the money that pays the devs to create the content for the high end encounters comes from the little guys who will never ever see a BoW or the like.  Beyond that, the changes won't affect me much, as I don't look for groups, I build them.  And I've had the pleasure of sending a tell to a couple who said &quot;I'm interested if you have a knight&quot;, &quot;We have a pally, but we just lost interest in you&quot; :D.<br />
<br />
A smart knight offers a lot more than aggro to a group, although all the lazy groups care about is the aggro.<br />
<br />
I understand your trepidations, but I don't agree with them.  But it is clear to me that we are viewing the game from different perspectives, and that is probably the whole difference.  But it sho 'nuff is distressifying to see such callous disregard for the majority of warriors out there, plugging away at the mid-game.<br />
<br />
It destroys a large part of warrior progression via equipment for aggro control.You say that like it's a bad thing ... as though there aren't a tonne of drops out there left for warriors to raid for, fret for, and lose rolls for.  And as tho EB drops are suddenly obsolete.  That warriors should not be gimped as a class solely based on their equip has been iterated to death on these boards, and Gerick has responded well enough here.  But from my perspective, the tweaks should take the pain in the ass that was &quot;looking for a guild to raid the guy to drop the toy to win with a dice roll&quot; (*gasp*) from a giant spike rammed all the way up to my brainpan, down to a throbbing hemorrhoid ache.<br />

<br />
Warriors will still use agro weapons, I will still recommend to the warriors in our guild to pick up a GSoT, or the Droga pair...quite simply because every bit helps...and the fact that they aren't bad weapons in the first place.  On my server, GSoT is usually around 125pp on Veeshan, ~15-20 being sold on average...if a warrior wants it, one run of a LDoN mission (win or lose), or even a day of playing (solo in SolA for a day, Fine Steel weapons drop there) should get a 55 warrior enough pp to get it.  A 31/30 weapon with an agro proc...that's nice for such a low price.<br />
<br />
Frankly I'd like to hear the official statement.  Are they intending Warriors to remain in the &quot;best tank&quot; role?  Or are they intending the three classes to be more equal tanking, with warrior's specialty being slightly higher hp(~600hp naturally)/mitigation(4-5% on Test)/avoidance (parsed to be ~2.5%?), whereas the Knights bring their spells into play.<br />
<br />
Also, I never saw a straight answer.  That 4-5% mitigation warriors get on Test atm...does that mean that a warrior will never take as much damage as any other class? (Meaning, the max damage taken on Warriors is 4-5% lower than any other class?)</div></div><hr />

Very good question. I think someone posted/postulated that since it's just one level of DI whatever you call it, that there will be instances where it's not noticable difference.<br />

We are discussing this over on PoN as well.  Most (not all) think that the amount of hate generated by provoke is about right.  The other thing (I have to keep reminding my Paladin brethern about) is we can use stuns on multiple mobs and we have more then one in our arsenal.  <br />

From my perspective, it appears Knights still have superior snap aggro but Warrior's initial aggro and sustained aggro will be sufficient for xp groups and raids.  I am personally kind of surprised that it appears they did not overdo it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a deceptive line of thinking. I have seen it mostly expressed as something along the lines of 'The heal chain heals at 0 sec delay anyway, having 5% mitigation will make no difference'.<br />
<br />
While this is partially true, the big glaring omission is that there are a lot of mobs that can one round a tank regardless of how much healing is being done. 5% mitigation has a significantly more than 5% chance of preventing the death of a tank during a damage spike. It's like having 5% extra hp, but with the added advantage that, unlike 5% extra hp, it doesn't decrease the efficiency of CH, and is useful even in situations where the mob has zero chance of one rounding the tank.<br />
<br />
For xp group situations where healing is ad-hoc it's a straight 5% saving in healing, as well as extra survivability on sticky pulls etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, and hopefully this also means that SOE can start putting more diverse procs on warrior weapons instead of just enraging blow and stuns without compromising aggro ability too much.<br />
<br />
Offcourse, just because we get a nifty new aggro ability won't mean we can just chain it and not use a weapon, then we will still lose aggro for sure.<br />

Kraydak, I am kerfuffled by your posts.  I think I know pretty much what you don't want (it looks like everything, the current and pending system), but I can't figger out what you do want.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is mob spike DPS massively boosted (somewhere between 50% and 100%) against non-warriors while upping their average DPS by under 5%.  Give mobs the ability to have critical melee rounds, or PCs the ability to critically fail defensively (a critical melee round for double damage 2% of the time, for example).  This would turn warrior's defining ability to never screwing up.<br />
<br />
Against raid target, this would vastly increase the number of guild relevant targets that would 1 round any non-warrior (while leaving some knight tankables even at the guild relevant level).  In exp groups, this would hurt warriors a little by boosting mob DPS, but the random and rare level of it would mitigate that and the fact that Krigers and LDoN Assasinate targets would become a serious threat to knights would help us in the more interesting camps.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find any mob that Knights would stop being able to tank with this that they probably shouldn't be tanking in the first place, and it would give warriors back their slot as best tank.<br />
<br />
With a change like that in place, then the opening system becomes decoration on a solid foundation and I'd like to see them live.  Toys are fun after all.<br />

I'm very aware of that.  Tis one the the major reasons that modifying long term mob DPS (as opposed to spike) is a very bad idea.  Spike mob DPS however, is very different.  Even int casters can take a double melee round or two in an xp group (with a few exceptions, like the infamous Krigers) and expect to live.  And with this change you would want to think twice about having a sub VT-knight tank a Kriger.  One crit melee round before slow lands and you are looking at a significant wipe threat.  At a 2% frequency, its also almost negligeable in terms of general damage taken (less effect than the current mitigation on test, actually).  The fun thing is that raid targets DO live long enough that a 2% frequency event WILL occur, and will bring back the spectre of 1 rounding knights, which, frankly, is what is needed for warriors to tank again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, for the people that are not lazy, increasing the chance to kill people for doing their job is not an incentive to having warriors tank. This will just make non-warrior classes fear for their lives and depend on massive aggro even more.  <br />
<br />
Same point made twice over.  Again, the threat level *in xp group situations* wouldn't be affected much at all by this change.  And on raid targets, people will just have to suffer and watch their agro since their beloved knights would no longer be able to tank in the first place.</div></div><hr />

The sad truth is that in an exp group there are six spots, and there are 15, soon to be 16 classes. That means we can only reasonably expect to land a group about one in 2.5 times. I'd rather be part of a set of classes where my assets gel with a group in a certain way, not because I'm perceived to be a &quot;required class&quot;. For example, the difference could be: &quot;the pally can heal himself some, the warrior can't heal himself but takes less damage so requires less healing, the sk can't heal himself but can give the cleric mana so he can be healed more often.

Phantron, you seem to be a supporter of &quot;hate generation through gear&quot;. I am not against this as an additional level of hate, but for those people who are not geared to the levels where they can own said gear, it's disingenuous to demand that gear be the primary condition for gaining hate, unless said hate gear is much easier to come by, and if it is, then that diminishes the accomplishments of those who fought the gods and their minions for said gear.

I think the problem is that aggro generating weapons did not generate sufficent aggro (unless it is different at the very high levels).  On the flip side, I doubt the new Provoke line of skills by themselves will generate sufficient aggro for an entire fight.  However, using Provoke + aggro weapons + taunt + melee aggro should give warrior's solid aggro.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the death of aggro control in everquest.  <br />

You guys don't actually fully understand how aggro works with the stun/fear lines. The test needs to be redone where both of them are in melee range and not miles apart. Proximity plays a huge role. I can bet you money that all it would take for me to peel off a mob AT A DISTANCE from a war that just used Incite + Raex + Rage would be 1 Fear and 1 Festering. At most 2 Fears and a Festering. If I were in melee range the 1 fear 1 festering would be sufficient.</div></div><hr />

Is it hard for you to be so ignorant?  A level 65 paly who has NEVER raided ever, just grinded xp will be able create just as much aggro as a TIME GEARED PALY.  This using some level 9 and 15 spells that probably cost around 50pp.  Both palies leave a warrior in the dust.<br />
<br />
A warrior who just grinds might not have anything better than what he can buy in the bazaar, and even if he raids that is not a guarentee he'll get something like a BoC.  Even if the provoke line gave warriors a BoC in a Bag (which it does not), how in the world can you sit there and act like this is unfair.  By itself Provoke will not create enough aggro to last a while fight, and does not come even into the same ballpark as a paly's stuns atm.  I think you are forgeting also the fact a warrior with a BoC type setup will have much better control than one without.  The provoke line gives warriors better aggro, kinda what we have been asking for.  In fact what paladins say we need.  So what is your beef?  Warriors should just outright suck compared to knights so you can continue rule the land?!  Even if we could use provoke every 15 seconds we still wouldn't be able to generate as much aggro as knights, so kindly drive through instead of posting next time.</div></div><hr />

It is the test server after all.  <br />
<br />
It's not an 'if'. They are going to nerf spell aggro on the low level stuff. I know for a fact they already did a ton of debugging on low level fears/stuns and the reports were that they were generating WAY too much aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm not really concerned about Paladins, I don't think they should have any solid method of aggro lock short of just the 'taunt' button. Stuns should have never been allowed to be used as aggro tools to begin with, they actually server other purposes like interrupting casters and actually, YOU KNOW, stunning. I am concerned about Shadowknights, however, as they are intended to have real and definite snap aggro spells and the Terror line needs some work in that department. Best suggest from me is to just add a hate dot component to all Terror line spells along the same line as Provoke. The benefit of Terror is still the range, naturally (which has some quirks that also need to be worked on).<br />
<br />
But yes, Fears and Stuns are going to definitely have their aggro butchered, and rightfully so.</div></div><hr />

Terror is not a bugged spell in the sense that Stun is - that is, whereas Stuns real function is to STUN and INTERRUPT casting - Terror only has one function - Hate. The Terror line is currently not worth using over Fear. Given that SKs are supposed to have spells for the sole purpose of generating hate and understanding that Fear is going to be nerfed, then yes, I feel the Terror line should be brought in line to do what it's intended to do, actually taunt worth a shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what you don't understand is how Terror actually works. It's buggy and impractical. Why do you think SKs dont mem Terror at all and instead have Fear up? There is something actually WRONG with the raw data of the spell line. <br />
<br />
You're also not understanding the function of the SK class. SKs are limited by the number of spells they can have memmed. DoT dumping is MANA INTENSIVE and SLOW. If it's on ONE target (i.e. an Uber Mob) this isn't so much of an issue, but that's a Warriors job, tanking the big game. So for crowd control situations, an SK isn't going to stand there and dump DoTs and DDs all over the place to gank multi-aggro. You rely on your Festering and you rely on your direct Hate spell (Fear). This also becomes problematic when you're CCing things that summon. The Shadowknight is a VERY complex class. You cannot just parse the spell data and say, &quot;Oh, well it looks like it's pretty overpowered right now, what more do you want?&quot; That's only 1/4 of the story. <br />
<br />
Bottom line here is, Terror sucks. Terror has too many issues to be useful. So what I'm saying is simple, WHEN they nerf fear, they need to check the spell data on the Terror line and make the proper adjustments, and it also needs a hate dot component added to it, after all, that's the only damn purpose of the spell line. I have to mem that one spell which means another spell I could have memmed for another purpose whether thats a DoT, DD, Tap, Aura, whatever, is that much more unlikely to be memmed.</div></div><hr />

Phantron seems to be having the &quot;unstated theory&quot; that aggro generation should be &quot;earned&quot; because giving hate to warriors &quot;cheapens&quot; his EQ experience by making his acquisitions and decisions less valuable compared to others than it was.  <br />
<br />
I clearly disagree, I've got enough benefits over non-raiding warriors that I feel plenty comfortable not crippling them so i can feel better about attending raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Phantron, you've finally gone completely clueless.<br />
<br />
 As a Warrior, I want the ability to use whatever frigging weapon I want to use - not because it has a hate proc, but because I like the weapon. Paladins get to do it, SK's too......BL's, Rangers, Monks, Rogues all get that variety/flexibility to some extent. About the only class that doesn't is the Bard, and that's because up until EP/Time, there is NOTHING better in offhand than the epic for efficiency.<br />
<br />
 I want the same freedom the other classes get - the right to pick and choose my weapons based on stats, damage, anything but aggro. You may like being chained to a handful of weapons, but to most Warriors, that idea sucks as much ass as it did in Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">It does not cheapen my experience because my guild do not raid LDoN actively and most casters are wimps and wouldn't use the extra aggro I can get out of the abilities for the other raid situaitons.  Although I didn't walk uphill both ways to get my weapons neither did you so SoE doesn't owe you some kind of stupid overpowered ability to make up for your past woes.  It just doesn't do the game any good to have aggro lock which is what the Provoke line will turn out to be.  Today I was grouping with a Wizard who wanted to make full use of his concussion legs, and I realize that since concussion is -400 hate, if I had Incite which is exactly +400 hate as well (ignoring the Hate over time part) the Wizard would never get to use his Concussion legs at all unless he wants to do 2 SoS back to back (which isn't really practical for XPing due to mana issues) or he wants to pull with a SoS.  Actually even if he does 2 SoS back to back, since he can concussion in between SoS there's a pretty good chance he won't get aggroed still, and I really don't see how a Wizard can pull more aggro than he was unless they're trying to purposely get themselves killed.<br />
<br />
I have been in plenty of groups with concussion legs Wizards that don't use it because my aggro is adequate.  When you can get enough aggro to make Wizards not use arguably the best anti-aggro gear addition any class can obtain in the game, there's something wrong.  When MT goes down and the next 3 people to die are Warrior 2, Warrior 3, and Warrior 4 who are just meleeing, you've to really wonder who's the class that needs anti-aggro abilities, Wizards or Warriors?  Especially consider the death of the 3 Warriors is far more disastrous than the death of 3 Wizards.  Am I supposed to unclick my proc buffs, unequip Raex BP, and unequip my aggro weapons, just so that I won't die the moment the MT does?  When you're told to run out of the battle halfway to drop your aggro so that there's still another tank to continue tanking if the MT dies, how can you say the Warrior class does not pull enough aggro?  One of our tanks uses primal in offhand.  Another uses Crow-Footed Lance (35/20 or something junk from PoAir).  I'm beginning to think that if I offhand a Dagger of Distraction (or maybe even put it in primary) it'd actually improve my ability to serve my purpose as tanking.  And you don't think that's wrong?<br />
<br />
In a typical PoTime raid there's only 3 non-Warriors I know that might die before me (suiciding Paladin LoH doesn't count) if MT dies and while everyone makes fun of them for overaggroing, these are the people that makes me worth getting more aggro.  I know they're the ones trying to push their DPS as much as they can and that's why I have to do what I can to make sure they stay alive.  I used to be able to say that about the majority of the raiding DPS dealers.  Now my aggro is solely for the 3 people that actually pushes their limit.  Maybe the guild is too conservative, but I can't change that, and people prefer to play safe anyway as long as the loot is still rolling in.  <br />
<br />
Maybe it's just the way my guild plays, but I really don't see how more aggro does warriors any good when your aggro is reduced to only good for just the 3 people who actually want to push their limits since it is grossly more than anything your normal characters can pull.  And no, I don't mean pushing limits like trying to see if you can tash a mob 3 times on incoming before slowing.  I mean actually trying to get that extra nuke in to end the battle faster on where it counts (i.e. raids).  To me my aggro matters because it keeps the DPS people alive.  This is no longer the case.  Most DPS of the raid will never die as long as any warriors are around.  There are only 3 people I get to keep alive now.  Will it be 0 when this patch goes in?  I certainly hope not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">And on the option of being able to pick your weapons, if you wanted the ability to pick weapons that do damage but not high aggro, you should've played a Knights or even a Rogue.  It's rather ironic, because I do pick low aggro weapons, because those are important for me to survive because all warriors pull too much aggro now leading to instant death on all other warriors on MT deaths.  Our best aggro weapons are also our most damaging ones.  I really cannot see any reason not to use them.  It's like saying a rogue shouldn't be tied to always using the JTB.</div></div><hr />

You may not be interested in doing damage, but I am, and I will strive to balance DPS/Defense/Aggro to acheive the best possible return to make me the most effective warrior possible.

Yes, if you dont want the agro you are supposed to take measures to prevent it. I always click off pestilence shock and switch to DPS setup when I am not in MT line.<br />
<br />
And besides the ideal situation when a MT dies is that another warrior takes agro..by far preferable over having your mag/nec/wiz crew get splattered. If you as a warrior die in that situation you(or your healing crew) have done something wrong.<br />
<br />
Next MT in line should have:<br />
- Patch healers in group<br />
- DI/BoV up<br />
- Should be at full health at all times so he is ready if MT die<br />
<br />
If those conditions are met I hardly ever die as second MT, even if I get agro immediately after MT death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">What aggro weapon does less damage than comparable weapons you can obtain?  Blade of Carnage, Hategiver, Bloodfrenzy, Blade of War, and Darkblade of the Warlord all are pretty much the most damaging warrior weapons you can get in their respective eras.  I don't know too much about tradeable aggro weapons but I think most good aggro weapons at least put out respectable DPS as well.  If there was a weapon that was 0/20 but procs EB X 4 I'd see your point but such weapons do not exist.  I do care about damage, and it bothers me that I can't just use my most damaging weapon setup in raid situations if I want to actually survive.<br />
<br />
You can take measures to make tank transitions easier but it doesn't change the fact that if you one tank everything, that means the next tank is tanking the uber for 10 seconds without a CH.  You can DI and do whatever you want but there's always a decent chance you will simply die before anyone can react.  Yes the tanks can usually survive but you just don't take chances around stuff that actually does decent melee DPS.  Sure no one cares if 3 warriors die on Terris Thule because if worst comes to worst a Paladin or a SK can finish the fight but for anything that you have to worry about tanking, you sure don't want to just be down 3 warriors on your available tanks.  The only way I get to melee as much as I want is on fights where tanking is more or less viewed trivial.  Granted that is pretty much just Rallos Zek in PoTime now but doesn't it feel odd you as a warrior have to take measures to drop your aggro on any mobs that depend on you tanking because no one else is even close to the aggro you're pulling?<br />
<br />
And what does positioning have anything to do with any of this? And yes people use pets a ton in my raids.  It's not like it stops them from instant killing me when MT dies since CoD aggro has been nerfed a long time ago (not like there's anything charmable in PoTime anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Because its next to impossible to get a mob with pets on it to move.  Its the pet coding.  Try it some time.  Make yourself a ranger twink... level them up to 20 or so and have a friend make up a mage or necro twink.  Have a 65 cleric and 65 shaman buff the hell out of the pet (so he'll live longer), and send him at a level 30ish mob.  Then just stand off and spam snare.  As long as you aren't in melee range, you're not going to get touched.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Mobs high enough will still summon of course, but I think that when this pet coding went in, its really pushed proximity agro to the front of the priority list for mobs with pets on them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I hate to break it to you but warriors do considerably more aggro than it takes to move a mob.  CoD aggro has been nerfed a long time ago, and there are no charmable mobs in PoTime.  Regular pets get killed by AE/rampage anyway on most of the Time encounters.  Most PoP ubers are coded to given significant aggro bonus to those in melee range (and for some like Vallon Zek they almost never aggro anyone not in melee range).  It has nothing to do with pets.  If something summons you chances are you'll be able to move it and you just don't take chances on things like that unless you're trying to see how many people you can kill because it's too boring to have a flawless victory.</div></div><hr />

Pet aggro issues are all kinds of wonky at the XP level.  Last night in PoM I often saw the BST's pet given the /pet back off command, and then summoned back to the MOB - when the rest of us were off it and sitting in an attempt to pull the bastige outta da wall.</div></div><hr />

Stonewall is a disc that has the same defensive benefits of /disc defensive, but without the DPS hit.   In exchange, you are snared 70%.   Healing Will is a &quot;heal over time&quot; (in essence, 500hp in like 5 ticks, that takes some mana), and Spirit of Rage is a +50% aggro modifier.   All of these are on test, on live they're still linked, but when the changes come they'll be unlinked.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, you should look into all that's changing, there's a LOT there, and i bet your view would improve dramatically of the effects of these changes on warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I was under the impression they were talking about things as they stand now.<br />
<br />
As I've said in other posts, I have nothing against the style system they're going to implement, and new Disc's were long over due, but at the same time there are some basic problems with the warrior class as they stand now, and you don't stack good ideas on a bad foundation.  They need the shortcomings we have before they give us the new toy to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I disagree, the foundation is solid.   I'd like to point out all we're getting, and how it completely changes the way we play EQ.<br />
<br />
Mitigation upgrade:   If it's the same as we suspect, we will not be able to be hit for max damage, period.   <br />
<br />
Let me explain the way it works, using a mob we all know and love:  Cazic Thule in fear.   His DB is 200, his DI is 20.    This means his minimum hit while non defensive is 220, and his max hit is 600.   His max hit on a WARRIOR non defensive will be 580.   If you have 2400hp, you can be 1-rounded with 4 hits for max without the mitigation.   A warrior with the SAME hitpoints will not be killed, it will land for 2320hp at most.  <br />
<br />
Now, let's look at something a little meaner... AoW, DB: 254, DI:45  Max hit on a non warrior:  1154, max hit on a warrior after mitigation upgrade:  1109.   On a quad, the warrior with the *identical AC and hitpoints* takes 180 less hitpoints of potential damage EVERY SINGLE ROUND, and if he flurries, it's even more.<br />
<br />
Now, let's get a little meaner:  Rydda Dar<br />
<br />
DB: 429  DI: 122.4<br />
<br />
Max hit:  2997<br />
<br />
Max hit on a warrior after changes:  2874<br />
<br />
&quot;Virtual&quot; Hitpoint advantage: 490 per quad<br />
<br />
Warrior will have a 500hp advantage over a knight, EVEN WITH THE EXACT SAME visible hitpoints, or will have that much more chance of surviving, or seeing a DI fire, or so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
This mitigation change is REALLY nice if you understand it and it's WAY better than a regular hitpoint boost, as it is ALWAYS there and scales with equipment.<br />
<br />
next:  Taunt Failure message<br />
<br />
Again, this is HUGE, getting a message indicating that taunt didnt' work, you KNOW that you have to overcome and better yet you can communicate that to others.<br />
<br />
Next:  Unlinked discs, HUGE<br />
<br />
The ability to fire a /disc furious and a /disc stonewall or /disc defensive in rapid fire increased your chance of survival 10fold early in fights.<br />
<br />
Next:  Provoke line, big big big... an ability usable at a range which not only gives numerical hate or &quot;virtual hits&quot;, but also gives a lasting effect so that if you do it right, your healer won't die on his first heal after an AE taunt, or when mez breaks, etc.<br />
<br />
Finally:  Openings, while none are huge, combined, they're fiarly powerful, and give you a LOT of versatility and choice on how to play.<br />
<br />
The openings are the smallest of the upcoming changes, but i like those too for the most part.   <br />
<br />
Yes, you WILL be playing a better class come December 16th.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">You're missing the point Heimdall.  The point is that no amount of extra HPs by itself would be enough to balance us without totally trivializing the game.  That's why they're giving us a small mitigation boost that scales as we fight harder and harder mobs, an aggro boost, and a utility boost.  It's the total package you have to look at.  Knights have to be reasonably close to our AC and HPs to be able to tank non trivial mobs effectively.  We need to have a reasonable amount of utility and aggro control to compete with knights that have close to our HP and AC to compete as XP tanks...  That's what they're giving us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you're missing the point.  Similary geared pallies and sk's will be the prefered grind tank because they have the same CH efficiency, and 500 phantom points against a raid mob that isn't going to be an AA grind target in this lifetime isn't going to feed the XP bar.  Not comapred to stuns (for their acutal purpose let alone agro locks) snares, FD pulling, downtime heals, LoH, Brells, Group Taps, Zevfeer's (I know, but it deserves its own mention)...</div></div><hr />

What pisses me off is the &quot;nerf&quot; in disguise they have pulled here by changing evasive to 10.5mins. Evasive was probably my favorite disc simply for the fact that it had that short recharge on it. It allowed some lateral thinking in mid-long fights such as Time Rallos, where generally I would open with evasive, tank with DI firing a few times several times through the middle of the fight, then finish the last 25% with defensive up. I really hope they dont continue with this part of the change and leave evasive timer alone.</div></div><hr />

Writing what you actually mean makes for a good argument.  Besides, you'd have to be hypothetical, I'm not a warrior.  And I know full well that a EB proc/Terror after a Taunt instead of before it is better...if I ever even needed to hit Taunt in the first place (which I rarely did...even moved that button to second page to make room for pet hotkey).  Technically for me, it'd been a Clinging Darkness after a Taunt, but yeah...<br />

Not comapred to stuns (for their acutal purpose let alone agro locks) snares, FD pulling, downtime heals, LoH, Brells, Group Taps, Zevfeer's (I know, but it deserves its own mention)... <br />
Technically, Knights won't have the same CH efficiency...neither will any other class.  This mitigation change means 7500hp is worth more to a Warrior than a Knight, really.<br />
<br />
They are addressing the issues, just not in the way they've addressed it before, and I think you're not able to see that not taking as much damage as any other class in the game is a hell of a lot better than more hp above the CH cap.  Mix with Agro on demand with Provoke line, openings system (which is still being tuned), and the ability to use disciplines other than Defensive/Evasive.  Then add in to this the current warrior AAs to get more potential attacks per round than any class, guaranteed AE taunt, more melee damage from the front than any class, and very low chance of being stunned.<br />

Oh bollocks, look at how long it took them to fix issues with many spellcaster powers over the years. Getting stuff changed if you think it's wrong WHILST they're actually concentrating on it is far more likely to get you results in a reasonable timeframe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">I understand what they're doing, and I can even agree it will help warrior CH efficiency.  I'm saying it won't help ENOUGH, on a grind.  I don't want so much advantage that knights are skipped over, I want enough so that I'm not skipped over either.  We have ZERO utility.  The ONLY advantage we have is CH efficiency, so that has to balance with the utility knights bring.  <br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned:<br />
<br />
First, everything should be its own patch.  This stuff should be stepped in, not all at once.  Every time SoE and Verant before them did this rebalancing crap, they'd over-correct and we'd get a whiplash effect from the balance rubberband snapping.<br />
<br />
Do the Agro first, probably since that's the the first area we should be straight up equal in effect if not in method.<br />
<br />
Only AFTER that is COMPLETELY fixed should they move on to the HP/Itemization/mitigation effects.  Warriors should have a bonus in HP, Avoidance and Mitigation over knights.  While they're learning to wag their fingers, we're still working on dodging, taking glancing blows, and jogging for endurance.  But that should balance out with the effects Knights bring to a group, with the pally healing, knights taps, pacification, FD pulling, snares, stuns, and so on down the line.  I'll even go so far as to say Pally Paci should be on the same level as clerics, they need a boost there.<br />
<br />
THEN you can balance our new styles and discs with the discs for the hybrids on on the endurance bar.  I be totally in favor of giving Knights a couple new discs each in keeping with their flavor.  They could use new toys too.  A new Trueshot for rangers,  An insane regen or maybe DA style disc for Pallies, a CR based aura of cold DS for SK's... <br />
<br />
But this stuff has to be done in stages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will it be DI = 1 to 19 or DI-1?<br />
<br />
That is, is it a straight 4% boost to mitigation on every hit received, or only on max hits. If the latter, then it's not a big deal really, since 4% of max hits is a pretty small number overall. If it's the former, then it's pretty good.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at a parse and check out the hit spread on the different DI intervals.  It'd be overall nice if for warriors that entire spread was moved down one DI interval on this change (making the minimum hit just the DB, instead of DB+DI(1)).  This would overall just lower the damage a warrior took completely, giving all warriors that mitigation all the time, instead of just saving a bit on max hits.<br />

<br />
Unless you are eating a *lot* of healing, 5% mitigation is less than a decently AAed SK's lifetap procs.  To say nothing of his cast lifetaps or worse, a paladin's healing.  Sufficient mitigation to bring us back in line with hybrid healing would seriously threaten game balance. (Of course, I feel game balance is already near death, but thats another story)<br />

300hp/0.04=7.5k hp base damage taken per minute for a 4% mitigation advantage to equal the procs.  One CH/minute landing for full, or more likely for most people 2 CH/minute.  Thats a fairly high damage rate...<br />

A 300 mana heal for 1k (unfocused Supernal Cleansing) can be cast every 2 minutes w/KEI alone for an averaged rate of 500 hp/minute.<br />

I don't think you're calculating that correctly. If it's actually DI-1 then you are avoiding a DI worth of damage every hit.<br />
<br />
A bubonian defiler has a DI of 17. If he hits you 18 times in a minute, that's 306hp/minute (unless he's hitting you for min a lot). That's less than 5 quads/min, easily doable even with a slowed mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not just heals however that help mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
Back a while ago I did some parses and some math on the value of stun.<br />
<br />
Basically I had the MOB slowed on INC with the Pally tanking. With the warrior tank, I waited 10 second for slow. The fights were ~1 minute long.<br />
<br />
The MOB does 100 DPS unslowed, 25 slowed. End result was that the Pally would take the same damage from a 150 DPS MOB over 1 minute as a warrior would take from the 100 DPS mob, just from pre-slow.<br />
<br />
60 seconds x 25DPS = 1500 per fight<br />
(10 seconds x 100DPS) + (50 seconds x 25DPS) = 2250 per fight<br />
<br />
Preslowed 150 DPS MOB = 2250 per fight<br />
<br />
Even if you manage to slow 5 seconds in there is still like a 20% advantage.<br />
<br />
Now you take some actual interesting XP MOBS that hit for 300+ DPS ...<br />
<br />
Pre-slow = 4500 per fight<br />
slow 10 seconds in = 6750 per fight<br />
<br />
That has always been my biggest issue with stuns. The mitigation properties that most pallies will out-right deny exists. They tend to only look at the value of the duration of the stun, and ignore that the agro aspect actually adds mitigation by allowing proper debuffing.<br />
<br />
Those numbers do not even include the fact that when our pally tanks, Hand of Ro can be tossed out on INC too.<br />
<br />
I do not even want to look at the math if the pally is tanking a 1000+ DPS MOB =p<br />
<br />
Hopefully, with the new agro skills this is addressed to a degree.<br />

<br />
The little information that has been provided has led me to believe that the mitigation change will give Warriors ~4-5% improvement against high DI mob melee damage and little or no improvement against trivial mobs (low DI?).<br />
<br />
IF this is the case it will have an immediaiate effect in that Warriors will have and easier time vs. high DI mob melee damage. But no change (probably) when doing stuff like LDoN easy.<br />
<br />
Knights can already tank PoTime mobs.<br />
<br />
In the future, SoE can make mobs with slightly higher DI's if they wish I suppose. But high DI mobs produce big damage spikes and with current DI's that's why Warriors died from melee damage - a couple of max hits in a row coupled with  a bobble in the CH rotation.<br />
<br />
So in truth if SoE wanted to make a more powerful mob it would be best to raise DB and not DI. For MT's to handle the mob it would take some of the new expansion's equipment and (dare I say it) the more AC and HP's gained from it.<br />

OK.. so we get 490 &quot;bonus&quot; &quot;virtual&quot; hitpoints against Rydda'Dem's MELEE.  Woo eee.  Yeah, that makes up for the shrinking hp gap.  I'm sorry, instead of the 1500 hit points more you were supposed to have at 10K over knights, you now get to keep your 500 we have given you for the past 4 years, and now we're giving you a bonus 490 points that only matter if you get hit.  And stuff.  <br />
<br />
Heimdall, I think you need to look at the whole picture and not just focus on the effective HP change or even the exact details of what is being implemented on the 16th.  Sony is implementing a number of changes now and I'm sure they will be changing things over time as they see how everything works on the live servers.  The important point is, they will now have a good foundation to work with in the future - one that allows melee specific tweaking without the risk of breaking the game like the current system.<br />
<br />
Give them some time and look at all changes in combination - don't just pick a specific piece and harp on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm presuming it averages out to about 4% extra damage mitigated, which is the number thats been getting bandied about.  Assume that approximation holds, so do my numbers.  At 5% average mitigation, 300/.05=6k damage intake to equalise with SK procs (and only procs, not cast taps), which is more than a CH (3k sounds like the norm for generic tank tm) and a somewhat extended elixir/minute for most people (2500 at 5 ticks).  Once we get more info on how it works we can change models/whatever...<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, getting hit 18/times minute is actually fairly rare (especially once slow lands).  (18 hits/minute)/(2 swings per melee round, rough and usually high)/(.5 rough hit percent)=18 melee rounds needed/minute.  At about 3 seconds effective weapon delay, this will do the job (and maybe even a bit extra, I'd need to parse the multipliers a bit more but they aren't THAT far off).  Slowed, it won't come close, and we know how eager people are to face PoP mobs in melee w/o a slower around.  In LDoN, it'll take a few adds to get that high and with caster mobs (finally frequent in many zones), it'll be lower still.<br />

<br />
And yet, that specific piece was what I saw as the core issue.  Efficiency.  That was our patch in the garden.  We were the most efficient CH tank around.  I was pointing out that 5% mitigation still isn't enough to offset even the basic &quot;healing&quot; the SK and Pally can put out.  And incidentally I don't think I was harping on one thing, I was pointing out any number of symptoms that lead back to the root problem...<br />
<br />
Buffs make up a significant portion of our HP now.<br />
100+HP gear is prevalent for WAR and knights.<br />
The buffless HP gap hasn't changed numerically- though the value of that gap has diminished dramatically.<br />
<br />
All that combined adds up to a serious deficiency in Warrior CH Efficiency- which is our reason for tanking in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't.  The mitigation change only affects DB.  Some mobs have a high DB and a low DI.  Some mobs have a low DB and a high DI.  If we assume that mob damage output averages about half from the DB and half from the DI, then the 5% mitigation boost is really a 2.5% overall boost because the DI which makes up half of the damage is unaffected.  This number could be a little higher or a little lower depending on what percentage of damage the mob puts out due to DB in relation to DI.<br />
<br />
Edit, I must have smoked too much crack the day I wrote this.  Swap DI for DB and it's on target.</div></div><hr />

Our mitigation discs have no more or less effect than they used to.  Evasive is better than it used to be now due to the increased mitigation.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">&quot;And the overall boost is more like 2.5% since only DI is affected.&quot;<br />
<br />
It really depends the size of DI relative to DB.  The higher that ratio, the closer the benefits of the mitigation bonus approach 5%.<br />
<br />
In the extreme cases: <br />
<br />
If DB is zero and DI is anything, the benefit is exactly 5%.<br />
If DB is anything and DI is zero, the benefit is exactly 0%.<br />
<br />
Numbers in between scale between 0 and 5%. <br />
<br />
<br />
On a mob like Fennin (DB==1000, DI==47), you won't see much benefit; max hit goes from 1942 to 1895, or about a 2.5% reduction.<br />
<br />
On a mob like Reparm (DB=469ish, DI==135ish), max hit should go from 3174 to 3039, or about a 4.2% reduction.<br />
<br />
This all assumes it's just a straight reduction of the DI multipler by 1, in the damage calulcation.  I think most tests have confirmed that, but I saw some weird stuff happening at the lower end when I was looking at new min/maxes.</div></div><hr />
