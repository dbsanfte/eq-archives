Fact: Knights have a higher snap aggro than Warriors even if over time Warriors match or exceed Knight aggro generation at the high end.<br />
<br />
This was OT from the originating thread, but I wanted to ask about this.<br />
<br />
I cannot remember seeing a knight using an aggro weapon, tho I know they exist for knights too.  And I can remember a couple *LOL, I had to use my taunt button* comments from a few knights, here and there. I know that the knights I group with blow me away (taunt, toys, Incite, and all) for aggro.  But I'm seeing more references to warriors topping knights at the *so far gone we don't know what to code for the encounters* stage of the game.<br />
<br />
With aggro weapons, augs, and WA5 available to the knight classes as well, how wide is the aggro gap at the top of the game, if a knight really wants to get the aggro?  And if a post-Time warrior can generate that much more aggro than a typical knight, is it just a matter of time till knights gear/AA accordingly to bridge the gap (have they generally not bothered before now, in other words), or is it irrelevant - in that knights can get all the aggro they need, and warriors can get more but don't need the excess?  And is it just a shortage of aggro weapons for knight classes, brought about by development perception that they don't need em?  Scouring thru LUCY I didn't find an overwhelming number of aggro weapons which were clearly designed with knights in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best aggro setup a Knight can probably get is a VDD + Yak Augment + Symbol of Planemasters - (and WA5)<br />
<br />
No Raex BP, no DBoTWL and no Anger 3 Augments and no Duel Wielding. <br />
<br />
I dont know many Knights that have a Symbol of Planemaster, we have a self buf (w/o stun) that doesnt stack, and between choosing other items in that slot, and well it just not have being as big of a problem before<br />
<br />
In addition, due to survibality issues, many Knights try to &quot;Bunker Down&quot; so to speak and go Shield 1hder, our high end 1hders have very crappy procs aggro wise (Lifetaps/heals).<br />
<br />
I tank Innoruk/CT in time, and I dont have too big of a problem holding aggro, but its just not as solid as when our MT goes in with DBoTWL+JoS (A3 augged) with Raex BP, on longer fights like time fights we can still use our other abilities decently, because we have gotten ahead on aggro enough that we can slack a little on chain casting stuns and slip a heal, but in short duration fights like Tipt boss, or Ikkinz named,  I sometimes loose aggro when I try to heal myself or do something else except going full forcei nto tanking while everyone else is in full burn mode (No Furious makes it so we dont get  a large boost at start, i can get 1 maybe  2 stuns in before a named gets to us)<br />
<br />
Many Warriors when they talk about how knights shouldnt beable to do X if they get a defensive disciple - its largly already done, because the majority of our time (In my experience) we are just trying to keep aggro, and dont have time to do something other then that..<br />
<br />
If we got a mob, no Taunts, and I bet I would loose to our MT just trying to hold aggro...<br />
<br />
2.5 Second Cooldown 1ish second cast time is a stun every 3.5 seconds at the absolute highest, which is unrealistic because of fizzles, interupts, and stuns, so more like every 4.5? ish second?<br />
<br />
Thats about 13 SPM max realistic imo, I dont know the hate values of stuns compared to EB/Anger3/FB/Anger etc, but i'm pretty sure its less so that number is a little bit misleading<br />
<br />
Add in Weapon procs, max of 6PPMish from a yak/VDD, but less because of time spent casting/stuns/interupts (yes i'm aware of hybrid bonus, but eventually you'll cast at wrong time, get stunned, etc (no stalwart endurance! =( )<br />
<br />
Of course you can take awaysome of those procs if you go the shield route for greater survibility.<br />
<br />
Also factor in no flurry/innate tripple attack etc and you just have less &quot;melee hate&quot; (If Paladin Melee's at all, often warrior suggest we should try not meleeing so we dont die as easily)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorta off topic but I do use taunt button a lot when trying to get aggro/breaking mezz's etc etc, sucessful taunt + stun is a lot better then a stun + a stun and hope thats enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In short, Knights still have pretty impressive aggro, but we have to do a lot more tradeoffs in the high end to get it, while warriors generally can just do furious, attack on, stonewall and not have very many tradeoffs for their aggro, the biggest tradeoff a warrior can choose to make probably is whether or not can trade offhander for a shield, and loose DPS. (And Well Knight sjust loose a ton of DPS doing all their stuff heh, not to mention its already pretty crappy)<br />
<br />
I like the idea of tradeoffs, I'm not saying its grossly unfair or whatever, they just exist, although it is sorta frustrating, when talking about aggro, Warriors say we should do X, which  happpens to decrease our survability, and when talking about Survibility, they say do Y, which decrease's our aggro, its a balancing act. (Once again, I'm not saying having it being a balancing act is bad, just pointing it out)</div></div><hr />

I don't have too many aggro problems any more, but most knights I know are just as good or better aggro wise.  Sounds like maybe some better aggro one handers need to be made available for knights at the higher end of the game.  Of course, I'd also like for there to be a slightly smoother transition from humble_joe_warrior_01 to godlike_ele+_warrior_01.  LDoN went a long way towards that I suppose, but having the high end game be so extremely different from the casual game makes it that much harder to balance accross the board.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;gap&quot; is really only speaking about sustained aggro over time.  Snap aggro is still easy enough for knights, and warriors don't seem to be too bad off in that department, but I don't know or care who's ahead.  I have tried chain-casting aggro spells(i.e. not much melee and no utility spells at all) on an engaged mob, and seen a warrior take aggro from me via procs alone inside of 20-30 seconds on more than one occasion(how quickly it happens is pure RNG luck, but it will happen).  That's with me having WA5 and a ykesha-augmented weapon.</div></div><hr />

Same thoughts here, Beornegar.  If the game progressed more smoothly overall, maybe there wouldn't be the GoD issues I'm reading about ... but on the other hand (there are always two *heh*) there wouldn't be those *fek uber* carrots at the end of each expansion to pull us forward - which they have to balance the next expansions challenges against.  And then they have to fix the *balance* ...<br />
<br />
Thanks Mathas and Madronedorf for your responses, yer made the whole thing much much clearer for me. /salute</div></div><hr />

The amount of aggro a Time equipped warrior can generate is amazing, especially with weapon affinity 5.  Personally, I hate the pissy contest warriors and knights get into on raids when you see them ping pong aggro back and forth to test their eq penis size but warriors can and will pull aggro off knights, but knights can pull it right back with some work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The aggro abilities of knights and warriors high end are comparable, with warriors have an edge mainly due to AE taunt.  However, warriors have their hate generation more &quot;built in&quot; by having it come from procs.  Knights have to trigger it by casting stuns.  This actually makes it easier for knights than for warriors to control when they have aggro, but if they got into an aggro pulling contest, the high end warrior (DBotW + EoE, Anger augs, WA5, proc buff, etc) will probably win out.  However, this only covers 1% of the warrior/knight population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knight's real advantage is the ability to aggro from range.  Even though Warrior's aggro is superior on the high end, it is very easy to lose quite a few rounds just from looking for the mob.  This is actually the biggest part of the Knight advantage that people tend to overlook.  While your warrior's trying to look for where the mob is and gets the 'your target is out of range' message, a Knight doesn't need to chase the mob because he can aggro from range.<br />
<br />
I have to turn off attack using Vanazir with a Paladin tanking CT so I don't overaggro and die.  Yes, CT does silence and that messes up Knight aggro a bit, but in my mind there is no comparision between Knight (especially if we ignore SK using Fear, which seems more like an exploit more than anything else) and Warrior long term aggro on the high end.  Warrior wins, easily.  Even for snap aggro, I don't really think Warrior loses to Knights any time you can be sure you can actually melee the mob.  The problem with Warrior snap aggro, especially on raids, is that you'd see a mob coming in, and someone will invariably cast slow/tash/whatever before the mob's in the warrior's melee range.  This guaranteeds the mob will make a beeline for the other guy and if a warrior's reflex isn't particularly good, he would lose quite a few rounds just trying to locate the mob.  But I think this is a reasonable balance, and it can be overcome with better discipline.<br />
<br />
Also, peopel tend to overlook AE Taunt a lot, which is the best snap aggro in the game by far, even if it's only usable every 10 minutes and 30 seconds (15 mins without the faster AAs).  For survival reasons, it is simply not desirable to keep all your tanks high on aggro, since you can end up losing mutliple tanks while clerics react.  It is very easy to misgauge how far behind you're on the aggro list relative to others and we're talking about being behind by thousands of hate with ease.  With a Warrior it's no big deal.  Even if you were afk the whole time you're just one AE Taunt away from getting a clean start.  Knights do not have this luxury at all, and I have seen Knights fall behind more than thousands of hate if they misjudge their place on the aggro list which cannot be made up easily even with chain stun/fear/etc.</div></div><hr />

Any partiuclar reason why you'd consider that more of an exploit than, say, a paladin using whatever low-level stuns they use for aggro?  No mob over 55 can be feared, no mob over 55 can be affected by cease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dual Proc + Dual A3 + WA5 + Clicky + Combat Effects = 1 proc PER TICK.<br />
Thats right 1 EB/Stun every 6 seconds on average. <br />
<br />
There is absolutely no way anyone can keep up with that much agro.<br />
Even wiz chain WF or any other class (pal/sk/shaman/ench).<br />
After 30 secs of fight, not even GOD himself can pull a mob off a Time+ warrior.<br />
<br />
That beeing said, it takes 30 seconds (sometimes more if you dont get lucky on procs).<br />
And you have to melee the mob. And you need Time+ Gear<br />
<br />
This is where hybrids have a great advantage :<br />
1) They can agro from distance<br />
2) They can dont have to melee the mob<br />
3) They dont need AA/Gear<br />
<br />
PS : Bazaar Warrior01 can get :  2 Stun / 2 A3 / WA5 = 8 procs per minute ....<br />
That is absolutely amazing compared to pre LDoN era .... 3 procs pre minute ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Good question. VoT is useful spell until high end game. I most SK wish it was just a higher % so it would feel like it makes a greater difference<br />
<br />
2. Incite well still suffering from some of faults of the terror line. It is instant cast, and has a hate over time effect, which gives it an overall greater value. Most of the complaining is based off that it helps War's in a way that threatens SK's raid role. Since Warrior do have better migration.<br />
<br />
I don't complain about VoT or incite so I have trouble answering these questions.<br />

The biggest issue with VoThule is a simple matter of cast-recast time: At 9 minutes recase for a 10 minute buff, it devours precious buffslots and spellslots. Most of us don't really care much about echo of anger, except in comparison to the effect on Grimror's BP, which is a horrible, horrible joke. It effects one line of spells with a long recast time and very high resist rates. It is worth noting, however, that in the case that you decide to pick on EoA, it's superior to Voice in every possible way - It's a larger effect, doesn't keep you from doing anything else, and doesn't eat any of the precious buff slots.<br />
<br />
Having fooled around a bit with a 65 warrior, and playing my own baby warrior, the difference between incite and terror is enormous. Pure hate is very, very borked when not attached to melee, but incite is -not- pure hate in the sense of enraging blow or terror. It leaves, somewhere, a little icon. This makes a world of difference, or at least, appears to. Our experience, as a collective, with terrors is that they simply won't turn a mob around off someone else, so we use anything else that will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, I must realyl disagree on incite.  When used from a distance, while all us warriors leap for joy at what it is compared to previously, I've seen several instances where someone standing AFK was between me and mob, and I laughed while the incited mob killed them off for simply being present and THEN came at me.   Incite isnt' all THAT good.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, Brael did some tests which pointed out that terrors did exactly the hate advertised, didn't he?<br />
<br />
I'll need to do some looking into this.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you understand how these type of spells work.  I also think you are rewording what has been said by SoE about &quot;how&quot; these spells do not &quot;function.&quot;<br />
<br />
They do work.  SoE has said they do not work the way many Shadow Knights wish them to work.  The primary reason for this is the way agro works in general inside EQ, namely proximity agro and initial agro.<br />
<br />
In short, the agro spells a Shadow Knight gets do not override proximity agro or initial agro.  If you used these spells with that in mind, you would find (as I have since I have a RL friend with a 65 SK 200+ AA) they do work perfectly well.<br />
<br />
If you want to continue to misinterpret what has been said by SoE to justify your claim they do not &quot;work&quot;, then be my guest.  There isn't anything I can do about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever hate they cause may or may not be what they advertise. The Shadow Knight issue with them is that they are completely and totally ineffective at holding aggro. They were worthless when I was hunting Ssra and CT at level 58 at their introduction, and they're worthless now in LDoN and GoD, and what the explanation is, I simply don't know for certain.<br />
<br />
Here's a rough account of the last time I used terrors, during the great big debates over whether knight aggro needed nerfing, or warrior aggro needed boosting. I thought to myself, 'What the hell, enraging blow works, this really should too... And besides, abusing fear is kinda gimp.'<br />
<br />
Mob 1: Inc, pulled by monk. Terror of Thule on inc. Mob continues to pound on monk. Enter melee, successful taunt. Lucky DD proc. Enchanter Tash, Slow, mob stays on me. <br />
<br />
Mob 2: Inc, pulled by monk. ToThule on inc. Mob stays on monk. Enter melee. Apparent taunt failure. Mob on monk. Tash - Mob on enchanter. ToThule, apparent taunt failure, still no proc. Heal 1- Mob on enchanter. Heal 2 - Mob on cleric. ToThule. Mob on cleric. Ranger snare - mob on ranger. Apparent Taunt failure #3. Arathena says 'The hell with it'. Fear - Mob on me until dead, no further action excepting periodic DDs. <br />
<br />
What really hammered the point home though, was this. I was grouped in Sebilis one night with some guildies, screwing around in hopes of getting a fungi. We had with us a warrior about 8 levels and tons of gear behind me. For reasons of levels/gear, I was tanking. I went out to pull a shroom. Pounded him with -FOUR- of the highest available terror of the time, Terris, generating a theoretical 2040 hate, while keeping him at range. That little warrior shot one arrow at the shroom, at which point it stopped dead in its tracks, turned 90 degrees, and streaked over to beat the stuffing out of him. I about tore my hair out. <br />
<br />
I run my little warrior, I have marginal success with provoke - her weapons lag behnd today's twink fest, and it doesn't really matter enough at her level. It's not fear, but it's a damn sight more effective than Terror has ever been. I run a warrior bot, Incite's not darkness, but combined with the melee, it makes the mobs hit me. Terror, in my experience, does absolutely nothing worthwhile, and I believe it does so because it's attached to nothing. There's no dot portion, there's no poison/disease/magic/curse/lala fancy cream counters, there's no melee potential attached, nothing to force the 'next target/maintain target' check. Do what they're supposed to or not, they are functionally not useful for regaining lost aggro, establishing initial aggro, or manuevering mobs - an ability now basically lost to repeated 'fixes' of related issues. Therefore, most SKs do not use them. <br />
<br />
Even when the measure of success is the maintence of an aggro gap between you and the next DPSer down, incite does not fizzle, it does not get interrupted, and it does not have the potential to interfere with your melee. It is superior to Terror in the same manner that echo of anger is superior to Voice of Thule - While the overall effect may be similar, the incidental price of Terror is far higher than the incidental price of Incite. Incite does not consume spell gems, it does not consume time, and it is not vulnerable to actions by the mob, nor the flat 'you have a 5% chance of fizzling.' The fact that incite appears to work, while terror, in our experience, does not, helps not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the recurring theme Arathena is that you were trying to use them outside of melee range.  Pure hate spells have their hate component decay to almost NOTHING as soon as you start opening the distance from the mob.  The reason for this is before that was the case one SK chain casting ToT would be able to keep aggro on the 'run speed 0' mobs of Srra thereby completely gimping the encounter.  I think that if you had waited till the mob entered camp and THEN cast your -FOUR- of the highest avilable terror spells all while practically being inside the model of the opponent, you would see something different.

My bad then.  Goes to show what I know about SKs, which isn't a great deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would you mind explaining this a little better?  Are you referring to the Voice line or something else and if so, what did you mean by overriding proximity or initial aggro?<br />
<br />
Proximity agro:<br />
  There is bonus agro (temporary) based on how close you are to a mob.  You can test this (I did) by getting initial agro with someone, not attacking or casting with this person, then with multiple castings of the pure hate (not the hate percent voice line), you will pull the mob off.  I estimate this proximity agro is somewhere between 500 and 2000 hate depending on the mob.<br />
<br />
Sit agro:<br />
  Similar to (and possibly related to) proximity agro.  You can move far enough away to not get sit agro (when if you sat closer you would get attacked at least one round until you stand.)<br />
<br />
Initial agro:<br />
  Every mob has a different amount of initial agro, that in the best way I can describe it, the first person to obtain agro will retain.<br />
<br />
Melee agro:<br />
  Much effort has been put into melee agro, which puts it around DB+WD per swing (hit or miss.)  So, say a BoC, CHSD, with max AA, a warrior can generate (max) 175 hate per second.<br />
<br />
The description of when you can not pull the mob off the enchanter, cleric, etc.  Many of these spells (slow) are significantly more than 700 to 800 hate.  It doesn't surprise me that a 500 hate spell should/could easily pull a mob off someone.  It does not make the spell not function.  From every test I have made with a real Shadow Knight toon, these function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SK were annoyed about the Raex BP effect because it was a permanent and overall better than our most powerful spell in that line...  (and made our spell pointless due to our spell's flaws which the Raex BP had none) <br />
<br />
For some reason warriors having more powerful spells than hybrids (especially compared to one of our 65th lvl spells) is more than a little annoying.<br />
<br />
On terrors...<br />
Take a look at Terrors and the Warrior End-based hate line...  they are different in their effects slightly...  Terrors add hate and then do nothing else...  the warrior line continues to add hate (modifies) after you use it, and leaves an effect on the mob.<br />
<br />
The best part about the warrior line is that it filled a gap that the warriors truly needed.  It allowed you to add hate when you needed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can already add hate whenever they need it.<br />
<br />
The sad fact is that Shadowknights are used to grabbing aggro from 200 range irregardless of what anyone else does... (disease cloud\shadow vortex\dark line\etc)  Since they have nerfed the first two into worthlessness, and the last one is heavily nerfed if resisted or immune, we were looking for a spell line that actually HELPED our taunting skills for once.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly, the greater portion of our spellbook causes better snap and sustained aggro than terror does.  Unless its a lifetap or a really slow DoT, pretty much we can get both Taunt AND some other effect out of our mana.<br />
<br />
The reasons Terror is pretty much useless comes down to the special taunt rules being more powerful than the hate effect the spell has.  That and the fact I can throw pretty much ANYTHING else at the mob and its going to turn around at me faster.  most of those spells are also more mana efficient due to being cheaper, faster to cast, and having another effect beyond just adding hate.<br />
<br />
Example:  Spear of X spells are now actually just hate spells...  they do damage occasionally in GoD, but are quite unreliable for any real damage output.  (High DR creatures seem to be quite prevalent in GoD.)  I can either throw ONE spear for 225mana in 0.5 seconds having a  small chance at some damage and KNOW that resisted or not I have a high chance of it turning the mob despite initial aggro irregardless of range, OR I can throw 6+ Terrors at 60mana and 1.5seconds apiece and know that it it highly unlikely the mob will notice me...  meanwhile the mob beats on the cleric/enchanter/etc...<br />
<br />
The fact that one spear that is more than likely to do ZERO damage and that costs 225mana and has a recast of 45 seconds is a more powerful aggro tool than a spell that only costs 60 mana and that ONLY causes hate should be a very powerful indicator.<br />
<br />
Spears (and terrors) are actually secondary hate causing spells anyway...  the Dark series (when not resisted) and fear are still our main hate-causing spells.<br />
<br />
Frankly, all they need to do is add 0-sec stun, 0sec mez, 0second fear(53) or some other high-aggro effect to the beginning of Terror and they are fixed.<br />

<br />
1) Well, the raex bp is certainly limited to a minority of Warriors.  So for the most part, SK will have a better version available.<br />
<br />
2) I will not debate the fact that most any spell that does something harmful to a mob may do more hate than a Terror.  I actually agree with that statement.  I am only debating that the spells &quot;work.&quot;  I guess if the definition of &quot;work&quot; is &quot;pull a mob onto me with 1 cast&quot;, then they do not in fact work.  But they do add the advertised amount of hate.  It is just that this amount isn't enough to pull a mob out of proximity, initial, and sometimes melee agro.<br />
<br />
3) I don't have a problem with this, but they could just as easily add say 600 to 1200 more hate to the spell instead of a stun/mez effect.  I think they should do something of this type.  Will they do it?  I am not sure.</div></div><hr />

and 200+ AAs....  and dual wields quarm hammer and EoE or RZ 1H...<br />
<br />
Yah I know this is high-end... but this is what I have to compare to somehow...<br />
<br />
&quot;Work&quot; for a shadowknight aggro spell means &quot;being worth a spell slot&quot;.<br />
Thats probably the best way to describe it.<br />

The scaling statement if more to how after 55, they don't work nearly as well as fear. Also They range based issue, as you mentioned. They also cast more mana to cast.</div></div><hr />
