<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what to chose ...<br />
I got extended shield lvl 3 it s pretty usefull especially in these nasty Uqua and god raids ...<br />
I also got Sta regen  to lvl 3 and you can appreciate the difference .<br />
 Did anyone parse the DPS increase with the Dual Weild AA that supposely increase Off hand dmg / hits and cost 15 ??( and i forgot what s called atm and i am too lazy to look it up plz don t move my post to the outhouse tho !!!!!! :P ) <br />
Bash / kick  Dps increase ?? mhhh for fun or xp groups may be ...<br />
whats else ?? <br />
 i m sorta disapointed with god aa , i mean for freaks like us with 700 aa ish there s not that many to play with ... sniff soon maxe AA again ! ehehehe <br />
Anyways if anyone could give his impressions on these and if they parsed or felt a dramatic differance .<br />
thx in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Swift Journey is decent if you don't have that done yet, aside from WA and Sturd though most of our GoD aa are pretty lackluster, I have been just doing the most expensive one first and working my way down since none are overly useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got swift journey before finishing WA and Sturdiness and it has paid off since I am generally the puller in my group.  I have the kick/slam aa at level 2 atm and increased my max kick to 52. Extended shielding, unless it has been fixed only extends shielding by range by 3 steps when it is maxed.</div></div><hr />

You should see roughly 5-6 dps increase with sinister strike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stikka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup like most Rogues (Derrict is another Safehouse old timer like me) I took Sinister Strike. It is not stellar, but it is also not junk.<br />
For a DPS concious tank it isn't a bad tool, but wasted if you use 2h a lot or swap in a shield frequently.<br />
<br />
I would think about swift journey rather than Sinister strikes as a non DPS oriented next step from WA and HP.</div></div><hr />
