<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So we've got some new people in the guild, and some others that returned from long-time absences etc and there are quite a few people that only need the emp rift to finish their VT keys.  Nobody on test does the emp, so even though we don't really do VT anymore, we decide to go pop the emp so people can finish their keys.  On the way the Cursed cycle is up so we stop to kill that too.  We pull the exiled and holy shit he's got a sword in his hand.  <br />
<br />
After two years, probably at least 30-40 exiled kills, I finally have to apologize to those I have called liars.  Apparently the Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled really does exist, and I am now the proud owner of one for the handsome price of 2dkp.  I can't really imagine the situation where I would want to equip it over my blade of war, but at least I can look cool sitting around PoT with the dual bloodfrenzy look now 8).</div></div><hr />

Your sig crashes my browser hehe.  What is it?  <br />
<br />
I doubt it's anything particularly bad about the sig, a lot of boards I have to disable images completely thanks to our picky firewall, but on TSW I am able to open any thread unless it has a post by you in it hehe.  <br />
<br />
Don't change your sig or anything, I'm just curious whether there is something weird about it in hopes of being able to diagnose my browser crashing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scrabler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've had a BBoTE for a long time myself..good bit pre-PoP.  As far as I know it was the first on TM.  It's been banked for a long time but I don't think I will ever toss it out of the bank.  Hell even back then they forced the warriors to random for it lol no one wanted to buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Got mine as an guild app. Were three or four other wars on and none wanted it thinking they would wait for BF. Could not be happier with its perfromance.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it procs a metric fuckton, but it's nowhere near the agro of my auged BoW.<br />
<br />
I won it on a roll cause none of the other warriors realized its potential.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">4 BBotE , 0 BFs for us in a dozen Cursed kills, maybe more. More luck on RZtW hopefully, 4 BoWs in 4 kills heh :)</div></div><hr />

Works for me at home as well.  Something about the firewall at work doesn't agree with sites with lots of remote linking for some reason.</div></div><hr />
