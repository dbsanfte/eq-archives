Statue was even easier, and I HIGHLY recommend him to ANY guild that can drop Vindi. Once you get slow in he's not even a challenge, my clerics jaws dropped as they moved cheal's to around the 10 second delay mark.<br />
<br />
Anyways, getting back to Velketor. This guy always bites me in the ass. No matter how many times we do him, I always end up dropping dead somewhere around the 30% mark in Velk's hps. WTF ?!?!<br />
<br />
I know my clerics can cheal properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
AAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!<br />
<br />
I refuse to believe that this guy is harder than Vindicator.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to suspect that it's just that caster mobs going to give us a lot of problems and 1-dimensional melee mobs are easy for us. If that's the case then I'm REALLY worried about the future =\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">perhaps your disc ran out? hes got really spikey dps too, u definately dont wont to sieve him as his melee is much worse than his nukes. he does hit harder than vindicator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not honestly sure why you are having so much trouble on Velks.  My old guild was 3-0 against him with 2 maybe 3 clerics sometimes and a 7400 HP Tank.  We had mostly HoT armor maybe worse.  I've never tanked him personally but I assume Vindi is harder I have tanked him.  I've killed Velk with 20 people and wiped on Vindi with 32 like I said not sure how you are doing your tactics.  If your dps is lacking for the raid just make sure you don't have him on the Throne at all that greatly lowers dps.  Make sure the other non cleric are keepin an eye on your health also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i have never done this encounter, but going off form what other people have said here, maybe you should wait on defensive until he starts heavy melee?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like your healers are not adjusting to the fact that he is OOM. He does have quite the DPS jump when he stops casting, even worse when he is dual weilding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kergin</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has killed Velks several times.  The first few times I'd get crushed when Velks was at about 20-30% so what I do now is wait till he is at about 60% before poping defensive and that seems to take care of it.  His DPS spikes high when he starts meleeing, usually catches the clerics off-guard.  Now we do him with just one cleric and me dual-boxing a 65 druid for patch heals.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ichkabibel2</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">once oom he is *definately* harder than vindi, you should save your disc for once he goes all out melee.  also depending on where you fight him, its usually a good idea and push him back and forth (we usually fight him at the hall at zone line) to interupt casting as much as possible.  as soon as he runs out of mana you're going to be in a world of hurt, as he does much much more damage than vindi, just no rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saved my disc until I started seeing real red text bud. It was still harder than our first Vindicator kill.<br />
<br />
He is a little bitch, mostly because people don't realize he can be hard and slack and it is tougher to corner the boy and get great DPS like in Kael, which is easy.<br />
<br />
We finished with paladins spamming heals on me and 3 out of 4 clerics 100% OOM and me at 15% duking it out with Velk, who was at 3%.<br />
<br />
it was pretty damn cool actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time I tanked him, we didn't use a rotation.. just had 3 clerics spamming SL and SR.. worked just fine.<br />
<br />
His melee goes up drastically when he runs OOM, so just make sure you kill him before that happens, or adjust your healing to suit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As everyone suspects, you are getting splattered when Velk runs out of mana. Once he goes oom, he is a beast. He hits harder than Vindi and will out DPS Vindi if he is not casting. Worst part is, he doesn't tell you he's lom so you don't find out until he rapes you like a prison inmate. After doing Velk doezens of times to get robes for our wizards, these are the simple rules we came up with for Velk:<br />
<br />
1. DO NOT mana tapping him, the longer he has mana, the better.<br />
<br />
2. DO bring lots of wizards. Giant Bane is almost no agro so they can easily chain cast without fear of agro if they cast from max range. I have personally done over 60k damage on Velk in a 3 group kill.<br />
<br />
3. DO NOT fight him in the throne room. If you get him on the throne - which will always happen in there, you lose a ton of DPS to cannot see messages and he will summon people into the throne and squash them. Fight out in the hall somewhere.<br />
<br />
4. DO NOT start the fight with defensive. He casts a lot early in the fight. Hit defensive when he gets 50-60% so if he does go oom you don't get splattered from the sudden increase in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most fights imo yuo shouldt go in with defensive, in EPs some but even for RZTWL i wait until 80% to disc so its still on at end of fight and more importantly on when clerics are lom and blast healers. At the start of most fights paladins, druids and clerics are blast healing you like mad so much less need and on casters like velk just like they are saying they dont go buck wild until oom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashem</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh thanks guys, I thought it was me.<br />

We normally pull his guards out and fight at the end of the stairs and before the t inersection to him room. Since we're switching from a casual to raid guild I'm still fairly &quot;noob&quot; to main tanking in general. So every big mob I'd be popping defensive as soon as I engaged.<br />
<br />
Something I tried last time was this hotkey:<br />
<br />
1. /disc defensive<br />
2. /rs I AM DEFENSIVE<br />
3 /pause 1200<br />
4. /pause 500<br />
5. /rs DEFENSIVE DOWN IN 10 SA TAKE AGGRO<br />
<br />
Didn't really have the chance to really try that because raidsay was being spammed with CH LOOP messages.<br />
<br />
yeah, normally it's in our healers channel but I bot my cleric sometimes and needed it in that channel so I could alt-tab and slam my ch key. ( I &quot;box&quot; on one machine)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I tried last time was this hotkey: Never, Never, Never, Never, count on a hotkey with a /pause to do anything important. Never. I can't stress this enough. The problem is that /pause is directly effected by the amount of lag you are currently experiencing. Say you mash that hotkey on inc, then the mob gets turned around and you are now facing the raid, lagging your machine or you get a big lag spike. If there is a 5% difference in the time it takes /pause to fire off the next line of text warning the clerics and SA that defensive is wearing off, that's a 10 second difference. Plenty of time for you to get smashed and the mob to go wild on the casters because the SA was not expecting agro for another 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Something else to consider - the MT is the single most important person on most raids. It is your job to position the mob, keep it in position, keep agro, and make sure you are the only one taking damage. There is no way that you can really pay 100% attention to the mob if you are boxing a cleric, particularly if you are boxing on the same machine. You want to break that habit now before you get too dependent on your cleric because the tougher the mob, the less effective you will be when it counts.</div></div><hr />
