<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some suggestions for DPS for my 55 warrior.  I currently 2box a Warrior/Shammy combo (both 55) or a Monk/Shammy combo (59/55).  I want to push my warrior to 60, but I notice that my warrior takes about 30% longer to kill than my monk does (not too unexpected though).<br />
<br />
For DPS my current setup is GSoT (which is 30/30 due to my level).  I also have a CHoS, and that 16/26 GuardII LDoN wand as my best ratio dual wield setup.  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions for upgrades for front attack DPS, where agro isn't a concern?  I should mention I only have about 10k banked, so cost is a concern.<br />
<br />
Lastly, should I be going 2H or dual wield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speaking from a 2 hander perspective WMBS is the best droppable DPS there is.  The damage at MN:min (every hit for a minute at the magic number) is on a par with the emp sword - ignoring the bane damage and proc on the emp sword.  If there's a DW combo that does more for less plat, I don't know what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jacl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is another sword that is very close to Marshal's Blade. I don't remember the exact name but it's something like &quot;Monstorus Greatblade of Alarcity&quot;. It is a 2hs with a dmg/dly of 23/21 I believe. It seems to go for around 7k to 8k on Zeb.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">also look into a Greatsword of the Bloodsworn too; i think it's 32/30 or something........seems like a nice weapon and a decent proc ( acrimony?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does proc acrimony, a 20 mana &amp; 20 hp DoT for 5 ticks, 9 poison counters.<br />
<br />
It's a fairly inexpensive blade these days.  Decent graphic, too.</div></div><hr />

I'm also a 55 warrior and I'm wondering if the advice about 2 handers for dps is true at our level?  My perception is that my 1 handers out-damage my GSoT at my level (but I haven't done parses).<br />
<br />
I have seen other posts mention that the BIG damage bonus for 2 handers doesn't kick in till 60, but I've never seen an authoritative statement about pure DPS at mid-50's level.  <br />
<br />
So... at 55 specifically, will the high damage 2 handers (WMBS for example) definitely outdamage a good dual wield combo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tested last night in Velks, GSoT vs. CHoS/Wand.   The ChoS/Wand dual wield won impressively.  I thought I would take more damage due to riposte with this setup, but I found that since mobs died faster, damage was actually reduced per mob.<br />
<br />
Interesting....<br />
<br />
So what about 1H weapons? Any recommendations for a better off-hander?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sword of the Bloodsworn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Riposte damage isn't much of an issue until the MOBs hit for 400 - 500 or so regularly. Don't think any Velketor MOBs short of Velketor himself does that amount of damage though.<br />
<br />
Now, as for Damage dealt, don't forget to have a good haste item.</div></div><hr />

Here is the sword I mentioned earlier. Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's one fast two-hander. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ainorli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The low damage bonus on that weapon might cut back on the dps, so the War Marshalls bladed staff or Windblade could have better dps but none of them seem to be that bad.</div></div><hr />
