<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just picked up Charge but dont have a clue when to use it. Can someone please give me a rundown on the how-to of the lvl 53 and higher disc's.<br />
<br />
What i'm looking for is when is the best time to use them. I dont want to screw things up and use one at the wrong time and get my and my party's butts kicked. Any info would be great. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends on the mob/raid, if youre on a raid, ask the MA or the whole raid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, it's situational.<br />
If you are, say, level 53 and tagging along on a raid, essentially as dps/possible offtank, then find out whether the mob has an area fear, area magic/fire/cold spell. If you don't have time to research the mob before you go in, send a quick tell to the MT when the raid is setting up. If you're in the dps/come-with-us-and-learn-the-zone function, then your basic jobs are 1) do what damage you can, 2) off tank, 3) require as little attention from healers as possible during the fight. (Well, that and follow directions and avoid accidentally falling into holes or off ledges and training the entire zone onto the raid).<br />
So, if the boss mob has a nasty fear, you might be best off to run fearless. If it has area of effect fire/magic/etc then you might get some milage out of resistant (and you will be better off with some resist gear, too, as long as you are not tanking).<br />
<br />
However, when you are tanking nasty stuff, evasive is your best tanking disc at the moment. There's a thread in the library about which mobs are best tanked with evasive and which with defensive. Evasive is more useful against many mobs you might face at our level than is usually mentioned. I'd tend to save this disc for very tough mobs/situations: named mobs or those times when 5 mobs get in camp or you're in a tough fight and you see your healer say &quot;LOM.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charge has pretty limited use in my experience. If you are chasing a runner that might make it in aggro range of another mob, you can hit charge and you might increase your dps slightly because you won't miss. It might make a difference, but probably not. the problem with charge is that it tends to be more effective against yellow and red mobs, because you'll miss them more often. But your increased dps from &quot;landing all blows&quot; is pretty trivial against such mobs. So you won't use charge much.<br />
<br />
If you're level 53, then you're about to get some really nice discs. At 54, you get Mighty Strike. Not terribly useful, but kinda fun to spam everyone with your crits. And, depending on your weapon, can add some dps.<br />
<br />
At 55, you get defensive, a class-defining disc. The library thread concerning evasive/defensive will tell you what the difference between them is.<br />
<br />
At 56, you get furious: for 2 ticks you riposte every melee attack made against you by any mob in front of you. Obviously useful at beginning of fights where multiple mobs get to camp; can give crowd control a chance to get organized, without you going splat. Notice that furious/fortitude (which you get at 59) are on separate timers from evasive/defensive. So, at 56 you can /disc furious followed by /disc defensive (or evasive, depending on the mob) and you will be much, much more difficult to kill early in the fight. Very useful against mobs that cannot be slowed.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget to load up Berate at lvl 56, of course.<br />
<br />
those are the main ones pre-level-60, I think. Although it is pretty early in the morning for me and I haven't had my coffee yet and I could be spacing out something. More knowledgable warriors will chime in, I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good answer, Brabble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info. Makes sense to me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mighty strike can also be used to perma stun mobs. However, this really isn't that useful as lots of mobs are flagged unstunnable. Only use ive found for the cripple stunlock thingy so far, is solo'ing natimbi named's.<br />
Not that useful info, but atleast now you know :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Charge is good for dps, especially if its the only offensive disc you have. It's good for red and yellow con mobs, as mentioned. They can still dodge, parry, block and riposte you from the front, so for best results, use from sides or back.<br />
<br />
However, the main use for Charge at high levels is so your kick doesn't miss.<br />
<br />
Kick has a lower skill cap, and can do it less often than melee (obviously) so if you need to interrupt that CH... Also good if a mob is running, I suppose, but you'd be wasting most of the disc, and a running mob that brings adds is like a free pull!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I have more time to kill, so it might be fun to go over the other discs.<br />
<br />
Resistant: Not very useful, but if you might as well use it on AEing mobs at low level, as you have few other options. If you have low MR, it might be a good idea to use it to pull mobs that root and snare. A Warrior should never have such low MR that those spells work on you, but if you're still low in level it could be a problem. It's on a different timer than offensive and defensive disc's so unless you're hurting for endurance, it's probably not a waste to use it if casters and AE's are punishing you.<br />
<br />
Fearless: Old school dragons, like Severlious (sp?), Talendor, Naggy, Faydedar, ect. like to use a weak AE fear, if you find yourself feared by that or by a mob (most mobs will never cast fear as a spell) then use this to break free! <br />
<br />
Later on in Plane of Time, Inny will use fear to good effect too, but since you can only use this to break his fear one time, it's still not all that useful. I may be wrong on this one as I've only fought him once.<br />
<br />
Evasive: Uber. Especially before 55 when it's all you got. On some raid mobs it actually works better than Defensive. There's  list out there somewhere of mobs that Evasive works better on, but in general, if a mob has a deadly proc, or if Defensive just doesn't cut enough of the damage off from their average hit, it can be more effective to use Evasive.<br />
<br />
For example: If a mob his anywhere between 250 and 2000, use Defensive. If a mob hits anywhere between 700 and 1000, use Evasive. I hope that makes sence. At any rate, if Defensive isn't working so well, try other alternatives, like Stonewall and Evasive.<br />
<br />
Mightystrike: At it's best when you're soloing. This move will especially save your ass if the mob is stunned by your crippling blows. Then they're pretty much screwed. This is just a flashy disc. Was fun to use this when playing with rampage and a good two-hander. Create mega-train in wussy zone. Let them get you to crippling health. Hit Mighty Strike, rampage and destroy them! Then click off Mightystrike and use Furious to kill off any stragglers. Good fun for all! Spamtastic for dual weild, big numbers for record setting hits when using a two hander.<br />
<br />
Defensive: The default disc for bosses and rares! If you don't know hard its gonna hit, but you're thinking its gonna be bad, use this! Any defensive disc also has uses when your healer is low on mana, or a beastlord or ranger or something  :D  Not that good for soloing. Use Stonewall for that, it doesn't hurt your DPS. Since I'm on the subject, note that Evasive causes you to miss more, and Defensive causes you to hit for less damage. This gives Defensive the general edge for agro. Stonewall even more so, when you get it.<br />
<br />
Furious: Ahh, Furious, how I love thee! This is the ultimate &quot;Oh, shit!&quot; button. This, used in conjunction with running like hell, will save your life! Also great for DPS when using a 2 hander. If it looks like that CH isn't gonna make it on time, pop this disc to save your ass! If it's a melee mob of course, which is how you die most of the time anyway.<br />
<br />
Also great for main tank switches! If another tank is about to lose defensive, use AE taunt, or just a successful taunt, Incite (or whatever you have) and then hit Furious when you have agro. This will give raid healers a chance to react! Make sure you hit let the raid know too, as a general rule. Sometimes used when a mob is first engaged too (Boss mobs).<br />
<br />
Other uses! Mobs that do so much DPS, you have to be invincible to live! When some folks in my old guild were first doing Ikkinz trials, we'd have like 8 people there sometimes. We would have to use this disc chained between several tanks, rangers, rogues, whoever was there, sprinkle with DPS and you get teh win!<br />
<br />
Fun uses... Well, they create themselves, but one thing that's kinda fun that I did when I first got this was create a train, hit this disc, turn around, and sit! Then you're like the matrix, and they can't hit when you're sitting  :D <br />
<br />
Well, that's all for now. More to come if I'm bored!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, felt like writing more!<br />
<br />
Precise: Haven't used it since they nerfed it. It used to be that you'd be more accurate, but dodge less attacks over a 3 minute period. I used to use it or Aggressive on boss fights where I wasn't main tank. Now it has the same 30 second duration as the other offensive discs and no downsides. The lack of downside is nice, but without the 3 minute duration, coupled with the fact that this is on the same timer as the other offensive discs, makes this disc lose all value IMO. Why hit more often for 30 seconds when you could hit every time for 30 seconds? If I'm wrong on this please correct me.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike: I use this a lot. I use a 2 hander, and bust this one out during exp grinds, LDoN's, whenever it pops. I'm of the mindset that I might as well be doing more damage when I'm able to. I do the same thing with rampage, after making sure there are no mezzed adds around of course. Free DPS, might as well, eh? I often wish Rogues and Monks did this too, but they tend to &quot;save&quot; them for rares/bosses. I might do it too if I thought it mattered, but frankly, its free DPS, but very rarely enough to make a difference. I'm not really willing to save DPS discs on the off chance of a rare, especially since I'll probably end up using Defensive on it instead, if the mob does more damage than average ones.<br />
<br />
On a side note, this is the disc you want to use with 2 handers to score the highest possible crippling blow on, the kind you screenshot like Rogues do with their highest backstabs.<br />
<br />
Fortitude: I don't use this one a lot. I tend to favor Furious, as it's on the same timer and does damage, and I'm probably facing the enemy anyway. This is good if you're training, if you think fast enough to use it when you really need. I found myself using this the other day to buy my group time when Shadowhunter jumped our group. He AE'd us, and I was lying there FD, but was still tanking Shadowhunter while FD. I didn't know where he was, nor the position of the mob we were already killing, due to the gflux. So when I hit low health agro, I hit Fortitude since there was no way I was gonna live through that (I was at 0% health) and bought the group some time to escape. Good to use if you're surrounded or mobs are at your back, or if you don't want to hurt the mob you're tanking for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Aggressive: See Precise. Why use Aggressive when you could use Fellstrike?<br />
<br />
Stonewall: Now here we have a nice addition to our Warrior abilities. This one supposedly increases our effective AC giving us tanking prowess similar to defensive, but with only one catch: You're snared. Many Warriors swear by this disc. I find myself using Defensive more since I like to be able to move if something comes up. I should also note again that this is good to use when soloing due to the fact that it lessens the damage you take, but not what you dish out. Click off if you need to run.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Rage: Hmm, I didn't test this much, as it was surprisingly ineffective at generating or drawing agro. It's on the same timer as the Healing Will line, so you'd think I'd use it more, but I generally find it's a waste of endurance. It's only use that I've found is that it's moderately good at stealing agro if you just really want to steal it from someone. Not fast stealing mind you, but stealing agro from like a paladin or something. Eventually...<br />
<br />
Healing Will line: Great when soloing, even if you have a heal BP. Call me lazy, but I'd rather bust out this disc and take a short AFK then click my BP 10 times. Burns endurance, but usually worth it. Remember that you can't do anything besides sit and run around while this is working. Meleeing, casting a spell, zoning, ect. all cancel this disc. I believe, however, that if you GET hit while this disc is active that it won't cancel it, as long as don't do anything about it.<br />
<br />
Incite Line: Another nice tool for all Warriors. It's like forcing a proc, basically. Well, an agro proc anyway. I DO hope you're using agro procs  :p The agro per tick is nice as well, which is why its generally used at the fight start. The beginning of fights is always the hardest for a Warrior. Unless you get lucky and proc on your first few swings, anyone can take your agro right away. That's why you generally use this to simulate a proc to start the agro in your favor. Also useful during long boss fights. Just hit it when it refreshes to add likelyhood that you won't lose agro. Also good in the middle of a fight when someone takes agro to snap it right back to you.<br />

OoW discs: I don't have these yet.<br />

Discs I forgot: Did I forget any? If I did then I forgot.</div></div><hr />

I like to use this disc on Inny in potime so i dont go running off like a moron, more or less you get summoned before you even get out of hitting range while being snared  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaastle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In a majority of cases I use Furious first upon incoming and then defensive.  You have to be quick on some mobs because they are hitting for 3k + and some have a DD they hit you with at the same time.  I've found Furious can save a group in MPG when you get one of the mobs that casts a DD rapidly like the Nocs or Lightening guys and the healer isn't keeping up with the damage.  <br />
<br />
I have the new Savage Onslaught disc. for level 68 and have found it to be crap.  A crippling blow instead of a crit. hit.  (wow)  How often do you crit?  Just not worth it imho give the rune to a caster.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I generally use Fortitude at raids, and Furious in groups.....depending on the situation.  Furious doesn't block procs (like Reparm) or Flurry's from mobs.  However, if it's just a straight melee mob, I'll use Furious for the little bit of added dps.<br />
<br />
Another really good use for Fortitude is for when you have to set Ramp on a mobile mob.  For instance, doing Bert....send your Ramp tank down to pull him, drop an arrow in his ass and hit Fortitude, then haul back to the MT.  MT hits AE/Incite/Furious, and you just stand next to him and get pounded on.  Fortitude gives you time to get back to the raid force without a healer pulling agro once Bert is in camp.</div></div><hr />
