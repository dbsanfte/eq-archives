<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. Got a quick question for you if I may. Ihave been equipping a SBoD and a CHoS. I recently came across a good deal on a SoD and was kinda stumped. What should I use? All are great weaps. If you were in my shoes howwould you do it&gt;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SoD sits high on King Aggro Mountain....but it better be a damn good deal to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What do you consider a good price on an SoD? If I could get an SoD for 50k, I would probably do it because I could sell eithe my copper hammer or bloodsworn. If you are talking about a good price like 200k, then I would say you have to be crazy to spend that kind of plats when you could probably get around 400hp worth of upgrades for that price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tricsun-Drinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm thinkin that GBoS &gt; SoD, and it isn't to hard to come by if you have a guild capable of doing towers, and just because SoD doesn't drop anymore doesn't make it worth anywhere near that amount.</div></div><hr />
