<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am not understanding a couple of things. I posted a while back and asked what to use to maintain aggro. The suggestions given to me were the Frostbringer and BCA . At the time I had both of these weapons equipped and they do work to hold aggro fine if my group is not in a POP zone. Here is my trouble it seems that no matter what I do I always am switching back to the Windblade for a bit better aggro. I am 53 and my stats are comprable to most others. Max str and sta, Dex is at 160 ish .<br />
 I am thinking of getting a FG but am unsure if this will help all that much. Can someone please explain to me or just tell me a better way to keep aggro in POP?  Thanks again to all that can help. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I would post my magelo but before the patch I updated my naked body and now I can not update it til the fix magelo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was like that for me too. The thing about PoP is that you gotta have quick aggro ( /rude Paladins ) Slowing a mob quick to keep the healer's mana is a big concern when mobs start hitting from 300+.<br />
<br />
The reason the Windblade is fairly good at that is because on your first round of swings ( if you hit both swings ) you probably do 200-500 dmg at your lvl. If you are fighting with similarly gear friends that dual wield, they won't be putting out your dps, atleast not in the beginning of the fight. That is a huge dps aggro compaired to Frosty and BCA. Now when BCA and Frosty start proccing they would normally out aggro you. If you miss a round or two of swings w/ a Windblade it becomes difficult to make up the edge you had, however.<br />
<br />
My first aggro weapons were BBoT and a Frosty. I got a Windblade for a super-sweet deal and I had it happen just like you did. Unfortunately any DPS aggro edge you have over your friends disappears at 55 usually. I went for a pair of smithed Ykesha weapons and was very pleased. They procced well and held aggro well enough till lvl 61 when I got my GSoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At a guess that is from the strictly better DPS of a windblade.  Also, from my experience, BCA was not a great agro weapon when I tried it.  Proc just was not enough agro it seemed to me.  You might try to trade it in on a honed blade of Ykesha(or religeous version if you can use one) or the new 1hs coming out of Droga(12/20 with DD and stun proc if memory serves).  Also, if Windblade is holding agro ok for you, stick with it.  It is by no means a bad weapon.  Lastly, at 53, agro is a royal pain in PoP zones.  That might be adding to your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it works; than by all means go with it.<br />
<br />
As a personal reference; i never had much luck with the forstbringer and even the wavecrasher; and for most of my 50's up to getting epics my MT weapons were a BBoT and a praetor blade which were much more reliable.<br />
<br />
but most other warriors have had excellent results with it; i guess it's all dependant on the RNG and ... something.<br />
<br />
If teh windblade works though..go with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok my weapons are:<br />
<br />
BCA/ShadowHeart<br />
Aggro/Dps<br />
i can hold aggro easily in tier 1(mostly PoD cy PoN hedge) since 55.<br />
I can hold aggro in tier 2 if no one is over nuking.<br />
also a good idea is look into a 2hs. sometimes if my pair of 1h's not doing the job my 2hs actually does work.</div></div><hr />

My GSoT has really helped me but I would like to give these a shot.  Anybody have an idea of who or what drops them in Droga?  BTW, at 64 almost everything in Droga now is dark blue and hits for nothing close to pop mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was MT in a group in HoH about a month ago now.  There were two warriors in this group (I know repetitive) but we're good friends so we work well together.  I was decided as MT because I was toting a couple hundred more hps (maybe not even that many).  So, I'm weilding (at the time) a Blade of the Black Dragon Eye in main and a Ribcracker in offhand for DPS.  So, for some reason that night the RNG hated my guts, because without procs right away, this guys Windblade was pulling taunt through half the fight.  Sometimes it just happens this way.  Btw, my solution was to let him tank while I chain pulled.  Sometimes your weps work, sometimes they don't, I use the two handed Epic to tank alot in PoTactics and have no agro difficulties.  Sometimes I can put the Red Epic in main and the Black Dragon Eye in off and still can't hold taunt, you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the real problem here is that a lvl 53 useing those weapons shouldnt even be in PoP . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">most ppl use to mainhand seb croaking dirk and offhand the black dragon eye back in the day. 14/24 is just too slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used a Seb Croaking Dirk for a while, and liked it, but I found that as the mobs got bigger that speed didn't count for as much agro.  That's why I dropped the Lammy for a Frosty way back when.  I still pull out the black dragon eye alot when agro is an problem, I've found that even on resists that proc still pulls a good deal of hate.  Alot of the times I'm tanking with the Jagged Blade of War, while it's ratio leaves alot to be desired it still has a real nice proc.  That's in a regular Tactics group I'm in with myself, chanter, cleric, druid and two AM3 Rangers.  Nothing says taunt free damage like a ranger with 300+AAs.  I wish I could dish out 1/3 that much damage.  But, as my momma always said, you can wish in one hand and piss in the other and see which one fills up first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Magic lvl is 55.<br />
<br />
If you try to hold aggro with a 55+ rogue with double backstab, you are gonna have a hard time.  Eventually the DPS from other classes that you are grouped with will be so much greater than your windblade dps that you will not be able to keep that mob on you.  Thats where procs come in.<br />
<br />
Also you are lvl 53 only.  Once you get defensive you will learn why you want procs as your weapons.</div></div><hr />
