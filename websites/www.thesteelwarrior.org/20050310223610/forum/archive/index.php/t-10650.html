<br />
1.  How high is your electricity bill these days?<br />
2.  Do you enjoy playing by yourself?<br />
3.  How long before you get banned for using Macroquest? 12 toons -- 1 man <br />
4.  What makes you think we care?<br />
5.  WHY?  (this one may not be some simple)<br />

ok ... i'm done now   :confused:</div></div><hr />

Probably do the same thing in a different game. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is good and all, but why not get chars equipped via;<br />

Yinzi 70 bard Magelo num=945853 Tamat 70 cleric Magelo num=945861 Ialdar 69 wizard Magelo num=945863 Smallervic 70 war num=1024796 Dyaus 70 sham num=1171587 (main)-Silvereyes=1171585  for another *real* hydra team look up saldio/conlaenn/didiann/kolo/sslithers/gedafix, people who dont use programs to do their stuff.<br />
<br />
start doing stuff thats not 4 years old? ex: Vt, Qvic, elemental, OoW raid named(fera, chail, velkitoren, hulc, etc... and you &quot; might &quot; get some credit.<br />
<br />
I mean this may be a little harsh but I think everyone here is in the same boat in asking you to please stop posting how many characters you can run at once, because when ya get down to it nobody cares but you, It's a fake sense of accomplishment for you I suppose.<br />
<br />
 I can run 6 characters efficiently on one comp, do I post and brag here about it every 2 weeks? no.<br />
<br />
<br />
This post isn't supposed to be a flame, or one of those posts that has 15 people say &quot; pwnt ' after, but its a question, what are you trying to accomplish? &amp; without Macroquest would you be able to live with yourself only being able to do a max of 3 - 6 chars?</div></div><hr />

The guy who thought we cared that he could do more dps with 6 characters than people with 1 or 2.  He's always bragged about his hydra'ing like we'd all be impressed by it.  He's always been immune and/or oblivious to people being far less than impressed and flaming him instead.  The arrogance has grown over time so much so that now he's almost a parody of himself.  It's like some kind of odd trolling attempt, but I think he might be serious.  /ponder.</div></div><hr />

Hey guys everything you need to know is in this map check it out, and tell your friends its so awesome and if you didn't know I can box 18 characters now and last weekend I was able to finally reach the bottom of befallen with them after countless valiant battles!</div></div><hr />

What evidence do you have that these people you list dont use macroquest2 by the way? Did they post showing their equipment and go step by step exactly how they control their toons? <br />
<br />
Post some links. <br />
<br />
I 12 box 100percent within the rules. <br />
<br />
And I explain in complete detail how I do it. <br />
<br />
Using one keyboard is not against the rules at all lol.... <br />
<br />
And WinEQ (a windows control program for EQ) is also 100percent legal. <br />
<br />
Maybe some of you don't know what an in game social is... they are provided in game by SOE and are not &quot;macros&quot; or &quot;macroquest&quot; heh... They are explained in the manual that is in your everquest directory on your computer. <br />
<br />
Im not all that interested in the PvE aspects, the new group is for PvP purposes, I doubt I would have chossen 5 rangers and a bard for PvE purposes. Do a raid or not its no difference to me. Kill 6-12 enemies and not loose a toon is my goal.</div></div><hr />

Why on earth would we &quot;like the fact&quot; that you have the money to buy 2.2 million platinum with which to twink your toons? And why on earth would you run 12 toons specifically for PvP? Being your own PvP zerg force does not make you uber, it makes you... I don't know... sad? I can almost see trying to do it for PvE, which can at least get you gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yes, and though you may or may not be using MacroQuest, buying platinum online for RL money IS in fact cheating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5 rangers and a bard?<br />
<br />
Eh.  PvP servers are different I guess but you know if you'd done something like...<br />
<br />
2 clerics, a druid, a shaman, a bard, and a paladin....<br />
<br />
You'd never have to ask for buffs and you might be able to run your own mini-raids :P<br />
<br />
Then again that'd be sooo boring, 99% of the fun for me is seeing my guild progress and my guildmates and friends get cool upgrades... the other 1% is bettering my own toon.  I can't even do alts these days I get so bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havn't bought plat since augest of 2002. <br />
<br />
I made over 3 million selling earthshakers and runes (the first few days they were selling for 120K each). All the items on the new guys are from plat I earned with the Sams. On Zek 1/2 the toons have been bought or sold for RL monies so its kinda late in the game to cry about sales, not to mention people leveling on ledgends then coming to Zek, not to mention tons of plat bought and sold.<br />
<br />
Given that over 1/2 of my competitors have bought sold plat or toons with RL monies I can't see how its &quot;cheating&quot; to do what they do to be competitive, although I have never bought toons as they can be taken back to easy. <br />
<br />
In fact on my Zek board there is a thread wehre someone is looking to buy 1 million plat and not a single person has posted that its cheating.<br />
<br />
http://p205.ezboard.com/fsullonzeknojihadv2frm11.showMessage?topicID=10661.topic<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well really fighting humans or AI... which is going to give you more competiton heh. <br />
<br />
On Zek its about killing oppenents and the pve is a means to an end. On the other servers the pve is the end. <br />
<br />
Phat Lootz and super items is nice, but killing yur enemy is way better heh. <br />
<br />
And we never get board.... <br />
<br />
<br />
Avallach Whitewinds also allow me to point out that if you are in a guild that kills mobs faster because someone else uses Macroquest2 or ShowEQ then some would argue that you are cheating even if you yourself do not employ 3rd party programs. Given that 99percent of all guilds have at least one macroquest user....<br />
<br />
<br />
And to claim that use of RL monies is cheating then you could just as well claim that someone who has a faster computer or better internet connection is cheating also.</div></div><hr />

 The boc's / sod's would be impressive if you actually boxed aow or the old school warders.  Buying them, then bragging about having them all on your 'noobs' isn't all that cool.

I bet 3 toons (not double boxed) could drop the gang-bang without much trouble.  I started on the zeks and took a sabatical about a year ago to level a toon to 60+ on sullon in particular after i got bored of blue server progression.  PvP is not really all that hard.  You can learn all the tricks there are to know in a few days of fucking around.<br />
<br />
As with anything in this game, PvP is 90% gear based.  No amount of skill in the world would save any of Sam's goons from 2 or 3 well geared toons all working togehter.  This is why it's so much more fun to hang out in PoNightmare and other random lower level zin's to pick off unsuspecting folks!  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm guessing pvp fights consist of Sam using his ench to unresistable mez on poor-newb_01 .. tash debuff debuff and then have all his wizards use their best lure nuke simultaneously followed by another quick mez.  Rinse and repeat.  Hardly a bragable feat.  Is it worth 150 bucks plus several hundred bucks worth of electricity, and thousands of dollars of machinery simply to be your own one-man zerg force?</div></div><hr />

With 5 rangers and 1 bard I can take 3 or more easy. I will be able to autofire while RUNNING AWAY from my enemy at selos speed. With the various hastes I be at 130percnet total haste (including bard over haste) (and my chanter haste) with a 24 delay bow. My oppenents will get hit with 5 arrows every second, even while I am running away from them at full speed, and my range will be 390 feet.<br />
<br />
Does the team that builds a faster racecar due to superior preperation prior to the race have an unfair advantage when the race starts. 60percnet of pvp is makeing a character or characters to fight with.... <br />
<br />
Casters will die getting from 390 feet into the 200 foot casting range lol...<br />
<br />
<br />
My warrior can shakerpage also. Its possible that I could be shakerpages if the enemy warrior could get next to me while I am moving at selos speed (I plan to only run 6 characters during pvp and just have my cleric in next zone for healing). <br />
<br />
The best pvpers on SZ looked at my plan to make 6 rangers and only one person (Milt, founder of Hate) found a way to improve it by adding a bard. Not a single pvper has suggested that there is any possible better group. This group hits you 5 times per second while running at selos speed and can do it all day long. <br />
<br />
Also I am not sure but its possible that pbaoe or shakerpaging might kill your own group on this server. My guys grouped together mellee each other no problem at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a completely moot argument, and the example your using is a poor one.  It suggests that both teams are going in there with the same basic quantity of contenders and that the only difference lies in the quality therein.  Is a boxing team fighting fair by putting 6 men in the arena against one other?  Do they have an unfailr advantage?<br />
<br />
Furthermore your 'pvp' as i can see is going afk in PoNightmare waiting for someone (anyone) to zone in and blasting the fuck out of them while mezzing them down.  That's not pvp.   It's not even worth bragging rights.<br />

I killed a qvic geared mage/necro team by myself last week in the arena.  I also out-witted a time/GoD geared warrior and beat him down in the arena.  Qvic Zerker = dead.  Tacvi ranger = owned.  These are feats you'll never be able to boast. Why?  Your pvp skills are limited to being able to overwhelm people with numbers ... not skill.  If you couldnt beat people 6 on 1 i'd laugh at you.  Just because you can doenst make you talented.  So yeah, i'd call you a talentless hack.  Stick any 2 of your characters in a pvp arena against my one gimp ass warrior and you'd get owned.<br />

I just can't do knights  :(  with better gear and half a clue ... clerics can suck too.</div></div><hr />

I realized that out of every thread of Sams that has ended up in the outhouse, it's always because of other posters flaming him, and it continues to happen. I don't understand it, but it's borderline rediculous.</div></div><hr />

I just stumbled across his 12 b0xx0r r0xx0r post on eqclerics.  Apparently it's on various other EQ class boards too.  He wants to make sure ALL of us playing EQ are suitably impressed.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
He lost all sort of credibility as far as I am concerned when he started posting all those pics of him with whores and his sexual &quot;prowess&quot;.<br />
<br />
Those who can do, those who can't teach, and in the case of Sam, those who have no clue post pics of them with whores...<br />
