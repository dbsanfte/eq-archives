<br />
 First, him being able to claim the items are property and having the court agree.<br />
<br />
 Second, the claim that the items were not only property, but HIS property.<br />

 It will either legalize a Sony crackdown on Yantis et. al. if the first point is upheld and the second not, or it will legalize third party virtual goods sales if both points are seen to be within the law.</div></div><hr />

the funny part is the made the game company pay and not the guy who stole it. think of the precident this could set in real life. sueing your landlord for all  stuff some theif stole because of lack of security, but it was a furnished apartment everything but your clothes and laptop was the landlords. the thief dumped out your clothes though and you had your laptop at work with you. so in effect the landlord has to pay you for his stuff that was stolen by someone else.<br />

i seriously hope our laws are not like china</div></div><hr />
