I'm currently lvl 58 and i'm mainly looking to boost my hp.<br />
the guild that im currently in has just started doing Terris Thule kills and i dont have much time to spend hours in bazaar, so pretty much all of my equip i've gotten from raids / groups... I've been trying to find some equip that could boost my hp a bit more (looking to break 4k unbuffed). Im 1 piece away from my emp key (just need idol from com1). I usually dont have any time for long camps / groups, or to work on my AA points coz of RL, i usually get home late and would have about 30mins before its raid time.<br />
<br />
any advice would be great, thx :) <br />

If no drop is fine saw you have skybreaker, va'dynn also drops a nice 100hp neck you may look into at some point.  He is a simple kill that you can grab late night or something and also horn spiked shoulders from vakshiz the shade(sp) in PoN is 65 raw hp and nice AC.</div></div><hr />

A level 58 warrior is going to get hit prety hard in the types of zones your guild is going to, your best bet will be to level up as much as you can and I'm sure you'll find better gear starts comeing your way as you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ding 60. You ought to break 4k with your current gear and just 2 levels.<br />
<br />
If not, somewhere between ND 1 and ND 3 you certainly will.<br />
<br />
But some gear options that might help you along ...<br />
<br />
Draconic Mask of Enhancement has more HPs than your current mask.<br />
<br />
Or Eyepatch of Puldner.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Flames has more HPs than Cloak of Crystaline Waters.<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry to replace 6/65<br />
<br />
OR Regal Band of Bathezid.<br />
<br />
Either one will take you closer to 4k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Or Ring of Sky, I mean you got some NToV drops there.<br />
<br />
Your ornate plate planar armor is pretty good upgrade to some slots (like bracers? Maybe? Certainly sleeves).<br />
<br />
Oh, and get some stat food. Tormentor Stir Fry, Halas Meat Pies, or whatever. Cheap way to add 50 or so HPs.<br />
<br />
Maybe upgrade your Solstice Earring to Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement or something.<br />
<br />
I dunno, just throwing some ideas at the wall there for you. Serioulsy, your gear is pretty ok. Grind the last two levels and get some stat food and you'll crack 4k, IMO. Grind ND3 and you'll have no worries. Go get 65, Stamina 15, Planar Durability and Physical Enhancement and never worry about it again.<br />
