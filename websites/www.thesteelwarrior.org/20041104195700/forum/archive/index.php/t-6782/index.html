I was under the influence that when in offhand a weapon goes off by a roll or such everytime a swing of primary is made, based on dual wield skill.  Having this in mind i thought the yak would hold better aggro in offhand, but the CHoS has better stats.  Upon looking at the stats on allah, CHoS is a 40 offhand efficiency and FSSOY is a 41, so does this mean they are going to hold generally the same aggro? Thus making the stats from CHoS a stronger choice?<br />
<br />
Your feedback would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aggro would be based on the procs. Both are pretty close anyway in effect so it is a close call. The higher efficiency on the CHoS is prolly based on the higher DD from the proc than the FSSoY.<br />
<br />
Aside from the stats, which I'd think are purely situational at best, I myself would go with the FSSoY. Unless I've got this understood incorrectly, the higher the delay in the offhand, the bigger the dmg bonus. Which to me suggests the 1 pt over the CHoS in it's offhand efficiency.<br />
<br />
Everyone's got a damn CHoS. Dare to be different :P<br />
<br />
Of course, your best bet is testing them both out, with an open mind, and feel which appears to work better for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The offhand has no damage bonus. Unless you have Sinister Strikes. And even if you have SS, it SCALES based on the weapon's delay, unlike the primary hand. So for offhand, ratio still matters more than delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For your offhand, I'd go with the Fabled SSOY.<br />
<br />
1.) Your offhand weapon swings independantly of your main hand based on your dual wield skill...trust me I have had many rounds where I only strike with offhand weapon(with damage bonus it's easier to tell than it used to be). Ratio is all that matters for offhand dps, and the ratio on the SSOY is slightly superior.<br />
<br />
2.) It's a fairly unique weapon, there won't be 500,000 twinks running around with them.<br />
<br />
3.) The Fabled has 40HP less but 8AC more...going by the general 1AC=5HP this puts them on a pretty even level there. <br />
<br />
My conclusion: Fabled SSOY has a slightly better ratio, a near identical proc, similar stats, and a less common look to boot. <br />
<br />
F-SSOY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korak Sarathai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Y'all are forgetting the most important consideration :)<br />
<br />
You can sell the Copper Hammer while it is still worth something and reinvest the plat.<br />
<br />
The Fabled Ykesha blade is a great offhander.  I have enjoyed it so far and look forward to plopping a second ykesha proc on it down the road, unless of course I have gotten something better before I get around to doing that many Guk adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The other thing to consider is the fabled yak proc is magic resist check -25, while the copper hammer of striking is magic resist check base + 25.<br />
<br />
Meaning the fabled yak proc will land a great deal more often than the copper hammer's proc will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes no difference if it lands or not the result is the same.   I used a GSoT from the time it came out and dont want to see anymore green skulls but I really like graphic of the force shock on the copper.<br />
<br />
just my two coppers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">less resists = more DPS, so in this case the resist check does matter. Maybe not in terms of agro, but certainly in the bigger picture. Since the weapons will provide virtually the same proc agro, you can look to other things such as DPS, stats, and style points - which makes the Yak the clear winner. Sell the hammer and upgrade something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100% False. Swinging your offhand weapon is based off the delay of the weapon and your DW skill. It is not at all based on the main hand weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thorvak, that was an old rumor people used to pass around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The resist on the Copper is MR 0.  The DD on the copper lands for me about 80% of the time so the Yak would have to land 95% of the time to equal the dd dps of the copper with the same proc rate. Pick what you like, there is no winner spec wise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SlinkyTWF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not sure if Wrath of Ykesha has a stun component or not.  If you desire more aggro, choose a stun DD over an non-stun DD (unless that DD is humongous or something).</div></div><hr />
