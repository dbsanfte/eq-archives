<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkiera</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
  Hope you all can help me out here. I have used search, but can’t find the information I’m looking for, or things have changed since the post was created. <br />
<br />
  My current group, all level 65’s is Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Ranger, and me ( Beastlord ). We are in a smaller family guild, so our gear is mostly LDoN with a smattering of PoP items up to tier 3. As you can see we have a strong group until we get to tanking, which I usually do. This works out fine in LdoN’s, Droga, LoY, and Tier 1 zones. But we’d like to play and explore in GoD, Tier 3, and tougher old world mobs. We are looking to push our limits as to what we can do with just one group. <br />
<br />
  So as you can see we are in need of a plate tank. Currently I have a warrior, SK and Paladin all level 35-40. I enjoy them each and can see strengths in each. I know what is strong at those levels may not be true at 65. Since I don’t have time to level all of them to 65 and see which fits best, I have come here to ask opinions of those that have been there, done it, and have the T-shirt. <br />
<br />
  With this group and our goals, which will serve us better in the long run? I plan on posting this question on each of the class boards to give each class a say.<br />
<br />
Thank you all,<br />
Val</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's really 2 things that group is lacking: Pulling and tanking. A warrior is the best tank, especially for raiding, but you just might need the SK for some pulling as well. That's some pretty significant healing force you have, so a SK for the combination of some pulling ability with good tanking might work out. I'd lean towards using pacify lots and having a warrior tank personally.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Clarified post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkiera</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are quite versed in pacify pulling. I usually pull as the beastlord with help from the cleric.  So we can do the same with a warrior. We just run into problems where pacify can't be used.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A warrior would be just fine in your group.  Between your druid, shaman, and ranger you have all the utility you would ever need, and I pull with my warrior and cleric all over the place.  You have a buttload of healers, so the paladin doesn't add much.  If you think you need a FDer you might consider an SK, but other than that your group has everything a hybrid would bring except for Brells.  If you're happy with your pulling situation, and want to killed named stuff and hard-hitting mobs, then go with a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashbomba</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">seem there is only 5 of you in that group, why not pick up a new friend that is a warrior/sk/paladin or 3? have them join you in your escapades in GoD and tier 3 areas? to me that seems the best and most viable option.<br />
if your truely stuck on just you 5 then i think the sk would add the most utility to that group with the ability to FD pull and to summon corpses. the DPS that the sk can do is lower then a warrior and on par with a paladin using only melee. however they have a larger array of spells that cause damage and aggro generation. <br />
the warrior would be the best bet if you are looking at taking on things that you are not quite sure if you can handle with the use of the defensive discipline. however the warrior provides the least amount of utility to the group other then tanking.<br />
the paladins ability to tank is equal to the sk. the DPS is sub par to the warrior and equal to the sk (minus spells). paladins group heals and buff are minimal upgrades over the ranger/beast. the rez is below to the cleric and the ability to paci pull is long past. <br />
<br />
over all the paladin adds the least to that group the warrior is a nice balance and the sk adds some over all utility to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in my opinion Warrior is the way to go... will let you do tougher stuff and also ... for that 6th slot.. befriend a bard or an enchanter.... I have a similar set up but the 6th slot is a mage... works out pretty good but we wished we had more resists and crowd control at times.. which in truth only the bard can offer all of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkiera</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We wouldn't mind adding a 6th to what we have, however we've had bad luck there. About the time we find a good fit, they change guilds, or work schedules, start school in the evenings, and so on. We've decided it would be best for us to just build the best 5 person group we can. The druid also has an enchanter that could bring CC to the group, or pick up a guildie chanter or bard. <br />
<br />
Our main goal is to challenge ourselves, we don't mind putting in the time to get decent gear. Actually my tank would be the only one lacking. Everyone else is already 65 and has decent gear. I hope with a mix of LDoN armor, ornate, and lower tier drops I can suit up a tank that will get us going well. <br />
<br />
I thank you all for your advice and opinions. After the group read the collectiave responses I think we are going to go with the warrior. If for nothing else the ability to take a beating. It's easier to find CC or a puller then it is a tank you know and trust. Least that's been our luck so far. And who knows maybe we'll collect up a puller somewhere as a 6th.<br />
<br />
Thank you all<br />
