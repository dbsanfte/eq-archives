<br />
It would be nice to hear some informed discussion on the relative merits of Fortitude and Furious and where you want to use each one.<br />
<br />
On a more concrete level, I've always been a Furious user, but lately there have been a couple of mobs where honestly it didn't seem to do a darn bit of good (latest was Rydda'Dar), which has got me to thinking about this as a general topic. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your input. <br />

<br />
Only time I seem to use fortitude anymore if when im in a pinch, i can type /disc fort faster than i can type /disc furious.  Normally I use the combat ability window for activating them when I know im going to use them, such as when engaging boss mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fortitude whenever a mob *can* hit your back (fear,..) or you plan to do some kamikaze style death run. Furious is just too damn good agro and dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets break it down to simple reality:<br />
<br />
With Furious, any number of things could cause your back to be to the mob, be through fear, bad push, or simply turning a little too far on accident. Its not a safe, reliable discipline for staying alive. You cannot proc on a riposte, and if you use a 1h weapon, its pretty close to worthless. The only real purpose for Furious I know of is in GoD events, with only one group and requiring high damage mobs dying fast.<br />
<br />
Now on to Fortitude. You don't gain a ton of ripostes. Boo hoo... You get full, 360, melee immunity. For anything involving 18+ people, its superior. Warrior DPS is not a meaningful raid factor, especially with tanking, but it is in one-group trials.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yes, Fortitude also gives Rampage and Flurry immunity, while Furious won't. Yet another advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">flurry goes through furious, flurry NEVER goes through fortitude. also if the mob has a stun and hits you with the stun while furious and you start turning your back could be open<br />
<br />
the only mob i use furious on is RZtW to gain aggro as fast as humanely possible and since he doesnt flurry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been said on this board that Flurry and Rampage attacks will strike through Furious, but not Fortitude.  I haven't tested it myself.  I always use Fortitude on any mob that Flurries, Rampages, stuns, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use fortitude a lot (instead of furious) when I am rampage tank.  I will tag the boss on inc, then hit fortitude and tank it while the MA pulls agro off me.  This works better than furious, because furious generates a hell of a lot of agro with quad / flurry mobs laying into you unslowed.  If I use furious here, and the zone is PoWater or something where AoE taunt fails a lot, then I am in for a beating if I still have agro when furious wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use fortitude while using Earthshaker and flurry mobs.<br />
Furious on everything else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always use fortitude on raid mobs.  If for whatever reason you need to move the mob during disc, it's a lot easier to be able to turn around.  I do this moving mobs into a corner pretty often.  Sure you can back up, but being able to run straight for the corner and not risk getting stunned and spun by a flurry is worth more than the dps you would do for 12 seconds using furious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I am MAing a mob, I will use Furious.<br />
<br />
The Agro it generates makes it alot better then Fortitude.<br />
<br />
I do use Fortitude if I pull, but in those situtations I am normally rampage tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaiel_RN</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will almost always pop furious on inc for mobs for two main reasons.<br />
1.) It's give my CH chain 15secs to get there chain started on you and keep it going.<br />
2.) It add's a nice bit of aggro on you.<br />
<br />
So I like to Furious to open followed by Incite &gt; AE Tuant &gt; Defensive, Stonewall, or Evasive depeneding on the sitution corning and what not.  <br />
<br />
I really don't use fortitude much.  There is  not to much of a need with good healers.  Furious is really ment to get you time to get a heal on you in a tight situation and still keep aggro.  Fortitude is good for RTing and you don't want all the aggro but just enough to keep high enough on the list to keep Rampage off of others.  Or you have a ton of mobs on ya or pulling a named out of camp when you had a bad pull so a cleric can get out for rezen hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Fortitude 99 % of the time over furious.  Furious means you probably won't take damage(unless you are stunned and spin around, or get summoned and hit in the back, or feared, or flurried, or...), Fortitude means that you absolutely won't.  I could see the argument if you are using a 2 hander for agro that the extra agro from furious might make it worthwhile, but as I use 1 handers for agro, the extra few swings I would get simply don't make that  much of a difference.  The idea behind using either of these discs is to give healers time to make sure the healing is ready and stable to keep you up, or as an oh shit response to suddenly finding yourself 1 hit from dying.  In eaither case, I will take the sure thing over the probable thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious really owns for bad pulls, camp gets trained and furious ae taunt gives enough aggro that your raid gets enough time to get stuff under control. Fortitude can work but I've seen more loose mobs that way cause doesnt have as much aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it conclusive that ripostes (from furious) produce aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont think its conclusive.<br />
But from my experiance, one hellava perception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well swings = Agro , Furious = Lot of ripostes from unslowed mobs.<br />
<br />
Furious is good for 2 things : <br />
1) Dealing with Bosses, rush Furious, and you have insane agro (hello 10k in 10 seconds)<br />
2) Getting Trains/Bosses under control (i prefer furious to fortitude in Uqua)<br />
<br />
Fortitue is GODLY when you want to stay alive for 10 secs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use fortitude unless I am using a 2 hander and I know I can keep the mobs to my front. In that situation I will use furious. Since I am normally DWing for aggro setup it is Fortitude 90% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer furious just because it allows me to lock aggro quicker and wizzys can jump in earlier.  But, I havent tanked anything REALLY BIG so maybe just inexperance talking here.  usually only use fort if i'm doing a suicide run somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my rules:<br />
<br />
If I am the MA, and the mob is being pulled, use FURIOUS.  Extra swings are more aggro no matter how you look at it.  A mob is not going to kill you from flurries alone in 12-18 secs, and your healers SHOULD already be healing you at that point, and you should already be in relative position as the mob is being pulled.  In a controlled pull, furious is superiour, hands down.<br />
<br />
If I am the RT, use FORTITUDE.  No contest.<br />
<br />
If I am in &quot;Oh Shit&quot; mode, I hit AETaunt (if needed) and then Fortitude.  This is for when the cleric is late on a heal, the raid is wiping and I need to move some mobs for a cleric to get out, or in general something is just messed up.<br />
<br />
I cannot really see any reason to not follow these rules, but I'm sure there's a few exceptions (I've only done ikkinz1 single group and EP raids)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doing a mini named in water the other day I used furious on inc and immediately got summoned and killed (got behind the mob, disc doing nothing, can't back up cause I'm in water).  I still think Fortitude is by far the best for staying alive as MT.  Doing a bunch of damage for 12 seconds is fun, but it is much riskier to your raid than using fortitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're in a corner the chance of getting hit from behind is pretty much nil.  In most MT situation I can think of you pretty much never move anyway unless someone does something extremely dumb.<br />
<br />
Also you don't get rampaged while you're tanking.  Flurry goes through but your healing has to be really sucking for you to get killed by one round of normal melee (you are immune to regular attacks ater all).  <br />
<br />
Furious is also better for tanking multiple mobs.  While you can't confirm riposte = aggro, it's pretty obvious that Fortitude won't aggro anything at all.  Sometimes Furiuos doesn't seem to work on Enrage whereas Fortitude does, so if a mob enrages I use Fortitude to tank.  Otherwise I use furious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously the ripostes from Furious cause aggro- about as much as a few hits from your sword would. Its a rather insignificant amount of aggro however and I have never needed to rely on it. Fortitude is far superior imo in a raid situation.<br />
<br />
Alot of situations, you will not yet have a chain on you when you use either of these discs. I personally never need to do this &quot;on inc&quot; because our chain has already started at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The aggro generated is not &quot;insignificant&quot;.  While tanking, try turning off autoattack for 20secs, and see if you lose aggro.<br />
<br />
Swinging your weapon accounts for, in my guess, 1/3 of your total aggro (in other words, aggro not including incite / procs).  I havent parsed it, of course (I dunno if it could be tested)...but its definately a good chunk.  Tripling the amount of weapon swings in the first 18 seconds of your tanking WILL be significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those extra furious swings cannot proc, so I am not sure how much aggro you can really expect to get from those extra melee attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors were holding aggro even before they had anger3, Enraging Blow, and Incite.  It wasn't by slamming the taunt key, either.<br />
<br />
Melee swings generate aggro.  When I was in my 30s, my wurmslayer held aggro just fine, even without a proc.  When I was using my Mithril Greatstaff, I held aggro just dandy.  I camped for ages to get my Jade Mace before i got my epic...and I held aggro without slamming taunt every time it popped up!<br />
<br />
Riposting builds plenty of aggro, even without procs.  Yes, it's true.<br />
<br />
edit - omg, my 69th post!  I feel so dirty!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aabuster1</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a 2HS (Bloodied Beserker Blade w/Anger3 aug) weapon all the time and my furious/fortitude rules are:<br />
<br />
Fortitude - Use on mobs that have a exrtremely large weapon proc, fortitude blocks all melee damage and procs. I don't worry about flurry damage or small proc damage thats why we have clerics.<br />
<br />
Furious - Use on everything else; it generates so much aggro especially with a 2HS weapon that I  have to die before anyone else can get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious also blocks all procs as well unless you're facing the wrong way, which should never happen on anything with a proc you need to worry about.<br />
<br />
Neither will stop a mob from using a fast recast single target spell, for example the triple Throw (3k DD) that various golems in Ikkinz do, or TZ's fire and cold arrows (neither are procs) though such examples are relatively rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use fort in water, for tank switches, furious for everything else.  Sure you will take a few flurrys and the occasional proc, but its never killed me a you usually get a few spam heals as the chain establishes anyway.<br />
<br />
If I die using furious in a situation where I wouldn't have using fortitude then I will reconsider, but when using it for tank change over (get in the corner, hit furious, hit AET) every bit of agro is important, and laying into a fast hitting mob with a big 2 hander with furious up is fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;The aggro generated is not &quot;insignificant&quot;. While tanking, try turning off autoattack for 20secs, and see if you lose aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't see how turning attack off simulates non proc melee swings for aggro... I've never had a problem, in a raid situation, at holding aggro when needed especially if AE taunt hits properly. So to me Fortitude works just as well as furious in most situations and oftentimes better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for tough raid mobs i can see going either way. getting agro slower with fortitude on a single mob isnt going to mean much. it just means calling assist a little later. and it is safer.<br />
<br />
but in exp groups on those really bad pulls that happen every once in a while furious allows you to gain significant agro on all the mobs not just the one you are swinging at. though i usually duel wield i try to switch out a high damage 2h for furious using hotkeys. furious with a 50dmg weapon on 4-5 mobs can do quite a lot of total damage as well as total agro. its fun too.<br />
<br />
on the other hand there are those da moments. you know the time the cleric ch gets interrupted because the cleric moved or got whopped and you are staring at 5 percent hp and 2 mobs beating on you and you wish you had a divine aura all of a sudden? id say fortitude there.<br />
<br />
then you have those times where everyone decides to zone and SOMEONE cant find the zone and you dont want to zone before he does because you have all the agro and hitting fortitude could buy him time to zone ... and (sigh) yeah he STILL cant find the zone and dies anyway. oh well :(</div></div><hr />

Like in that xp group in CoD last night when I accidentally pulled 4 instead of 2?   :)</div></div><hr />
