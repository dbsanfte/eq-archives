<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sooo I saw this wonderful Copper Hammer of something linked the other day and getting a good taunt weapon (and Force Shock is pretty much equal to the SoD's Anarchy) is not that easy here I tried to do some research on the free sites I ended up with not much. Even asking around in serverwide channels got me like 5 different places where he might spawn.<br />
<br />
I found a decent map, however it only has very few locations marked on it<br />

<br />
Also a rough guess of what kind of fight we should expect down there would be nice<br />
<br />
Thanks :]</div></div><hr />

I went in with a group and had the hammer in 20 mins. I have yet to be impressed. It doesnt proc all that often and the stun is always resisted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the mobs there are lvl 59-61 and 2 of the 3 types are casters.  I wouldn't say &quot;cake&quot; but ... ever fought in Cazic Thule?  Same type of mob, hit like little boys, lotta hitpoints, easy to single pull, quick respawns...  No mobs see thru invis that I've found, so worse case, try it, die, run back invis, res, and do it again.  I'd have to say that mobs are between Nadox lugands and CT lizards in difficulty, only cause they have more hitpoints and they don't cast bane of thule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the king camp last night with my 57 war, 65 wiz, and a 65 bard friend. Healing up between fights sucked, but we had no problems taking any of the gobbies down, including the King.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh this camp can be duod with a decent druid or cleric... I have a feeling in the near future SOE will add in a common drop on king to cut down on mudflation; because otherwise, the server is going to be absolutely packed with these.  Camp is taken 24/7 on bbane, and I saw 7 drop in 7 hours once.</div></div><hr />

Little avatar, little blood of saryn, little breath of ultor = Copper hammer of striking that I only used for 1 day hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok we are sitting in King room right now with 2 groups of average level 52. I doubt we could have come even close to here if the agro radius was large...</div></div><hr />
