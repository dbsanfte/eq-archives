Currently in Beta the Tribute system equates to buff bots.<br />
I know this idea has popped up here before, with mixed emotions.<br />
Based on what I have been able to play with so far, you give items/pp via a UI with the Tribute master in your home town(read out of the way places) and are able to select a number of different effects, like hp regen, atk buffs, and other effects.<br />
Their are various lvls of these buffs, like 5 ranks, and they scale not on the amount given, but based on char level.<br />
The effects don't take up buff slots, but each one has a timer accociated with it. Currently they are aruond ten minutes in duration. You can spend that just run back and forth between your home town and your hunting grounds.<br />
The upkeep is about 200pp for a full set of these buffs for 10 minutes.<br />
I'll play around with it some more, to determine their full effects.</div></div><hr />

Newbies can't afford that kind of cash and people who can won't need the effects, especially if they last 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
What would be nice is to be able to turn in old no drop items after they are outgrown or replaced for some kind of xp reward.</div></div><hr />
