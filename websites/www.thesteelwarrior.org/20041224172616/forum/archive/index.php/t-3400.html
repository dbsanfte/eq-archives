<br />
I have a historical question about hate value assigned to stuns cast on mobs.<br />
<br />
Did sony, at some point, raise the hate value of stuns?<br />
<br />
I remember in the kunark era, back b4 i ever played melee, that paladins were not highly desired in most exp groups because: they were mana sponges.  Did we just _not know_ back in the days of kunark that stuns generated large amounts of aggro?  Or did the playerbase not understand the advantage of stun aggro lock (not that i'm saying it's a good thing, but...)  Or, did Sony change the hate value assigned to stuns?<br />
<br />
I know cease and desist came with luclin.  Did sony change the hate value around luclin timeframe?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to remember back in Kunark in Howling Stones a Pallie being a wise guy showing off that they could grab agro anytime they wanted.  This of course being the days where our defensive and AC were quite a bit different between the classes the rest of the group asked him to cut it out.  So I seem to remember them being able to generate agro on demand as far back as that.<br />
<br />
I think a Pallie from that era could answer the question for precisely however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stuns always had that much aggro.  You nailed it on the head in your post though... they weren't desired because they were mana sponges.<br />
<br />
VI siginificantly improved their ability to take damage (tank), so now they have both the ability to stun aggro lock (which they always had) and the ability to tank as well as a warrior (for all practical purposes) in an exp group.<br />
<br />
Also, aggro lock wasn't as important back in &quot;the old days&quot; because mob DPS wasn't as high.  If a mob wasn't slowed immediately it wasn't a big deal... heck, in most places slow was a luxury and a group could do just fine without it.  And, if the mob beat on a chanter for a few seconds it didn't usually result in a dead chanter.<br />
<br />
Knights also received several other fixes to make them more playable/desirable in groups, including new spells, mana and exp penalty removal, and greatly increased DPS through the two handed weapon change and itemization.<br />
<br />
I hope that answers your question as to why knights are highly desired now when they used to be the whipping boys of EQ.<br />
<br />
Of course, many feel that the &quot;fixes&quot; went too far and now the situation is reversed, but that is covered (read: beat to death) in the class balancing and outhouse forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sangiovese, thanks!<br />
<br />
Another question, has anyone tested the proc rate on the 2 ykesha augments?  I'm trying to figure out if there's a difference in the two ykesha augments other than 25 damage.<br />
<br />
The whole reason i'm asking is becase i'm trying to decide between augmentations for a couple weapons I intend to keep around a long time.  I don't wanna put the obvious aggro choice, ykesha, on a weapon if I have _any_ reason to suspect sony will nerf stuns one day.  If they do nerf stun aggor lock I'd do a jig in the street, but would also be cursing adventure points I blew on ykesha when I could have gotten anger iii.  If Sony had upped stun aggro at some point, then I'd feel comfortable thinking it was intended and will not change, ever.  I'm over-analyzing this, I relaize that.  Thanks again for the info.<br />
<br />
Your post brought to mind another question if someone feels like answering.  In general, what type of defensive boosts did the mana sponges (pallyz I mean) post kunark which made them a tanking class?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I could find was defined in these articles<br />
<br />
9/20/01:<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3784<br />
<br />
<br />
Went live 10/8/01:<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3831<br />
<br />
Excerpt:<br />
&quot;Paladins and Shadowknights, besides the benefits they gain from the two-handed weapons change mentioned above, have also been moved to the same combat tables as warriors. In the future we intend to examine the existing one-handed weapons useable by knights for possible upgrades. We are also increasing the Taunt skill cap for these two classes to 220. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Gordon's explanation:<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3829<br />
&quot;-Paladins and Shadowknights-<br />
<br />
The Knight classes receive some of the biggest benefits from this melee balancing. Our evaluation of knights showed that in many cases they were doing just over half the damage of a similarly equipped warrior. This is simply not enough damage to make them highly desirable in group and raid situations. The changes we are implementing put knights at a bit over three-quarters of the damage potential of a ranger or a warrior. This represents a significant upgrade from their current status, without threatening the desirability of the ranger or warrior classes.<br />
<br />
The first thing we did was to move knights to the same damage tables as warriors. This damage table is now shared by all melee classes, except the monk who is on the higher tables described above. By placing knights on this table, they will now hit harder with the same weapons than they did previously.<br />
<br />
The second change that greatly benefits knight classes is the upgrade to two-handed weapons. While this isn't a knight only upgrade, as the premier users of two-handed weapons it has a profound effect on their damage potential. The two-handed weapon upgrade is discussed in more detail in the previous section.<br />
<br />
For knights that prefer to use a weapon and shield combo, we plan to go through existing weapons available in the game and upgrade them in cases where they are not doing enough damage. These upgrades, as well as any new weapons we may add, will begin to be seen in game in the near future. One thing to note- a knight using a two-handed weapon will do more damage than a knight with weapon and shield of similar quality.<br />
<br />
The final change we are making to knights is the increase of their Taunt skill cap. This increase begins at level 51, increasing a few points each level until it caps at 220 skill. Taunt still follows all the previous rules with regard to taunting things above your level.&quot;<br />
<br />
==================<br />
I couldnt find the change to defensive attributes but I think it occurred in the same time period....I'm sorry I just realized that was your original question and I'll try to hunt it down ;-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the list of major boosts to knight abilities since December of 99, as least as well as I can remember them. It's been a long time, so my order and timing compared to expansions is no longer reliable, but I'll try anyway.<br />
<br />
Pre-Kunark:<br />
-Knight HP is given a boost to bring us to a level between that of rogues/rangers and warriors. Previously, a naked level 50 rogue would have more HP than a knight. He still out tanks us, though.<br />
<br />
Kunark:<br />
-SK Lifetap progression is altered, so that the level 60 tap is 338 HP, rather than 150.<br />
<br />
-Harm touch is given a damage boost post 40, and moved to the lifetap resist table. HT has ever since remained in relatively close <br />
proximity to a high end wizard nuke. <br />
<br />
-LOH is given a serious boost in damage healed, approximately doubling it.<br />
<br />
-Hybrid mana pools are -greatly- enhanced. First, our mana-per-stat-per-level is set equal to casters, removing the nine level penalty. Second, our spells are set to cost the listed mana cost, not twice it, and in the case of the SK's lifetaps, three times it.<br />
<br />
Velious:<br />
<br />
-Hybrid /discs are introduced. Rangers and bards win big. Knights don't get much.<br />
<br />
-Knight defensive caps are raised from 225 to 252. We can finally out mitigate, but not out dodge, a rogue. Warriors still out dodge, out parry, out riposte, and flat out out avoid and out mitigate us. This is as it should be. <br />
<br />
-The Great Two Hander Change. This is described above, but the -real- bonus is a seperate, nearly concurrent change.<br />
<br />
-Hybrids are flat out given detrimental spell haste on all dots, stuns, DDs, taps, snares, etc with a casting time of 3.1 seconds or greater, not including items. Further, the act of casting a spell no longer causes 'next melee attack' timer to restart. Previously, wielding a 45 delay weapon meant I would swing 4.5 seconds after my last swing, or 4.5 seconds after finishing my last cast. Now, it means I will swing 4.5 seconds after my last swing, unless I am casting at this time, in which case I will swing immediately after the cast is complete. The timer then starts again at 4.5 seconds. This means that I can cast 'between' melee attacks. <br />
<br />
Luclin<br />
-Our taunt(WTF?) skill and dodge skills are raised, though still inferior to warriors.<br />
-Stacking knight buffs are introduced: Brell's Mountainous and Cloak of Akheva.<br />
-Cease and Desist are created, as are Torrents.<br />
<br />
PoP<br />
-High end paladin stuns are created, allowing stuns against  55+ mobs.<br />
-Fear stops working as fear for exp mobs, and starts working as super-enraging-blow, thanks to a cap put in place to keep necromancers from soloing Vox and Nagafen. :rolleyes: <br />
-Spell lineup allows SKs to consider themselves much more viable damage classes, to a degree. <br />
-And, of course: Fast, heavy hitting mobs vastly inflate the importance of slow and hard burning exp groups. <br />
<br />
I think that's most of it. Correct me if I'm wrong. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cuedyen2</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like was said previously, stuns have been high aggro for a long time (since I started during Kunark).  However, it was not until the advent of KEI, flowing thought items, easily attainable wizdom/mana items, etc.. that casting stun so often was feasable.  I did try in Kunark/Velious but groups would get angry that the &quot;tank&quot; had to stop and sit to recover mana.<br />
<br />
I personally don't think the changes to damage mitigation/avoidance was that huge of an impact.  PoP with the need for snap aggro and the unlimited (well it feels that way) mana pools is what pushed knights up.  How would groups really feel if a knight had to sit every 2-3 mobs to recoup mana?  Probably more balanced then it is now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eumerin</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard the number 300 thrown around for stun agro.  OTOH, I don't recall seeing any actual testing, so its anyone's guess how accurate it is.<br />
<br />
Paladin agro generation has and hasn't improved since Kunark.  It was still possible to get agro, but it wasn't as easy to smother a target as it is today.  This can be traced specifically to two things.<br />
<br />
First is the availability of more than one lower level stun.  Pre-Luclin, paladins didn't get their first stun spell until level 30.  Then the next one came at level 49, and once Kunark was released, a third stun was made available at 52.  Each of the higher level stuns cost significantly more mana, particularly since there was:<br />
<br />
1.)  No KEI<br />
2.)  No Flowing Thought<br />
<br />
So once you fired off one of those spells, you were in for a longer wait while your mana regenerated - and you'd have to do it standing up at 1 point per tick (3 minutes just for casting Stun).  An enchanter in the group changed this, as Clarity and Clarity 2 greatly improved mana regeneration, but if you didn't have them in the group or easily available, then you weren't going to have Clarity.  The half hour duration meant that you couldn't buy it beforehand and expect it to last much longer than the time it took to reach your camp spot (if you were lucky).<br />
<br />
Cease made things easier, although it still didn't make it perfect.  I play a level 60 paladin, and with an FT1 item, I still need to watch my mana if I don't have KEI (which happens sometimes).  I can generally hold agro with Cease, but it isn't hard to start spending it faster than I get it back.  It'll take a while to run my mana down, but it will happen (even if I don't start using heals to keep other characters topped off with hp, pacify mobs, etc...).<br />
<br />
KEI is, I think, the single biggest reason for paladins to be so much more effective these days.  This can best be illustrated with my experiences with the new paladin stuns.  No one in their right minds uses the Quellious' Words of...  spells for agro generation.  They consume too much mana (and they also have that annoying push 10' factor which drives melee classes nuts).  The effective post 55 mob level stuns are Force of Akera and Force of Akilae.  Akera is available at level 53, and works on mobs up to level 61.  Akilae is available at level 62, and works on mobs up to level 65 (there's also the Divine Stun AA, which is manaless, and has a refresh timer on it).  While I don't like to do so, sometimes on the higher level mobs I will switch strictly to Akera, which has a mana cost of 70 (compare with Cease at 15 and Stun at 30 - oddly enough, Akilae has a lower mana cost than Akera, and since Akilae was around before Akera, no one's quite sure why this is).  Its difficult, and I have to be very careful with my mana (which means that I'm pretty much not casting anything else), but it is possible to tank almost strictly using Akera (you're going to need Cease from time to time even if there isn't an emergency - if there's emergency, then Akera alone won't do the trick) - provided you have KEI.  If you have KEI, you can almost do it with just Akera.  If you don't, you can't.  With Akilae it should be very doable (since Akilae has a lower mana cost), although the lower level stuns are still needed for emergencies.  Recast times make it impossible to chain stun a mob without the lower level stuns.<br />
<br />
And then I end up in one of those high level groups that sees me tanking mobs of level 62 or higher, and promptly switch back to Cease and Stun.  After all, if Akera doesn't actually stun the mob, what's the point in using it?  Might as well save the mana for something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aabidano</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Watch an enchanter drop one or two of their non-ancient nukes 3-4 minutes into a raid-level fight.  It's generally good for an instant summons.  The stun component on all of them causes some serious agro.<br />
<br />
I've heard 300 mentioned before, but I'd bet stun agro is much higher than that.  &gt;wants a SoD (or two) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best/highest level enchanter nuke does not have a stun component (only a knockback of 1 component). It still carries a fair bit of agro, but not nearly as much as their previous nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually if i remember correctly... old age has a tendency to do that, hehe...<br />
<br />
I believe that the aggro generated from stuns was signifigantly increased prior to Kunark. This was done to prevent from stun/lock/mez of mobs from a distance.<br />
<br />
It had nothing to do with Knight aggro generation, and everything to do with pure casters using stuns to completely incapacitate mobs while they were killed rather easilly. I know this is still done in aoe groups to some extent, but at the time a lot of things were different that prevented the aoe groups from being as effective as they have been recently. Mana regen being one of them.<br />
<br />
Overall, the Biggest Nerf to melee classes, has been and continues to be Mana regen abilities. The incredible rates that mana is regen'd  now take all of the 'downside' of being mana dependant out of the game. There used to be an advantageto not being a slave to the mana bar, there no longer is that advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, mana regen is big deal.  If those paladins had to stop fighting and med once in a while, they would be far less desireable as tanks.  <br />
<br />
Also changing from class armor to all/all gear with no trade-offs.  Paladins and SKs wearing the same gear as warriors, because it is the best for both ac/hp and mana.  This started in North ToV and has been repeated in VT and Plane of Time.  I thought they had finally figured it out with elemental armor (although you could argue that the gap is wrong, at least you can control it).  But then of course they went back to the all/all or all melee gear in Time.</div></div><hr />
