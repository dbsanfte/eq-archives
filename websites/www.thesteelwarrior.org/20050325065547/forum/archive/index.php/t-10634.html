<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we 3boxed 5 Old world mobs.<br />
<br />
The bandits:<br />
70 warrior  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1171039<br />
70 bard (roomate)  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=953799<br />
66 druid     http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=719508<br />
<br />
The victims:<br />
Klandicar  (6-7 minutes)<br />
Sontalak   (6-7 minuets)<br />
Gozzerem  (10 minutes)<br />
Telk            (10 minutes)<br />
The Statue of Rallos Zek (15 minutes)<br />
<br />
We would have done AoW if we had our normal 6man group of Cleric SK Bard (same) Warrior (same) Shaman Rogue.  Statue was fun ... bard managed to single pull him through the entire arena, including vindi and his guards.  The armors which were tethered to Statue were a bit annoying.  We highsunned them for the first 10 mins or so before saying fuck it ... killing all 3 of them at once the next time they came charging around the corner.  Killed all mobs unslowed, taking advantage of a 200pt dmg shield.  The druid was 2boxed by yours truely.  We wanted to get a ST key for our druid-bot, but when kland took a dirtnap infinitely quicker, we thought &quot;what the heck ...&quot;.<br />
<br />
I remember wiping on these mobs with raids of 50 several years ago.  Sontalak, in particular, was a very nasty bitch.  Kinda sad how easy it is these days.  It's a shame Tormax wasnt up ... was looking forward to trying him with 3 toons as well.  I know folks have done this kind of stuff before with low low numbers, but frankly i was surprised we pulled someof it off with a druid healer of Forestwolf's (the bot) calibur.<br />
<br />
High ac = teh win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe ... its a shame dozekar wasn't up ... kinda wanted to do his bracer quest for haste even though it's very out-dated.<br />
<br />
Think we'll 4box seru today for old times sake.  Roomate will probably bot a shaman to keep him slowed and dot ... burn him down over the course of an hour or more with leet dmg shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrinx</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if your gonna let the DS kill seru why even slow him?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slowing him would defintely be pointless if you are counting on damage shields as dps.  Also with level 70 mitigation his dps output is nothing short of a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
correct me if i am wrong but iirc Sonty is lv 70</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seru fight is so long with a few, lowest I have done him with was 5 adn that took like an hour and 53 minutes, be sure to take a piss beforehand!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1h53m from engage, or from porting in to done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did him with 6 a long time ago. <br />
<br />
Bard<br />
Cleric<br />
Warrior<br />
Shaman<br />
Necromancer<br />
Magician<br />
<br />
Took us 45mins to kill him.  Casters started off trying to just manage aggro over the course of the entire fight, toning things down a bit and not maximizing dps.  Later we figured it would just be best for them to lay into him thick ... camp out to wipe aggro ... come back rinse and repeat.  After a few camps they just finished off with a hard burn.  Probably would have taken us close to 75-90 mins without them relog aggro clearing.<br />
<br />
20 second stuns that land on 500MR are a pain.  I wonder what 5 levels and 575 MR will do to change things though ... would be nice if i could go the whole fight unstunned.<br />
<br />
Would probably take druid bard warrior shaman 2+ hours to kill him.  Basically using bard + druid dmg shield and shaman dots to do 1 million dmg .... yuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're considering doing it with 2 - warrior &amp; shaman.<br />
<br />
4 is easy, 5 is easy and quick with the right group.<br />
<br />
3 is slow but doable.<br />
<br />
So far we haven't made much use of damage shields, something I was considering the last time we did him with 4.<br />
<br />
Necros are 'leet. <br />

He can be a bit mana intensive, but you should be ok once he's slowed.  Go go twink ST keys and Velks spellbooks!</div></div><hr />
