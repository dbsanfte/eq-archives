<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bourbon</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, my main is a Rogue but I refuse to post on any other boards so I'm askin it here.  I'm not in a guild so right now I'm lookin for a DPS upgrade path.  What I've been thinking is I have a CoF I could put in back slot, drop the Freebringer and replace it with a Velium Gemmed Dagger, 16/20.  I know that I won't notice the 4% haste loss with Chanter haste but the Gemmed Dagger is gonna cost me 50k and I'm wondering if the higher damage/lower delay in my offhand will give me a DPS boost over loosing the 40Atk from the Freebringer and would it be worth 50k.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I have the Aug to aug my main to 16/19 I'm just waiting for the aug removal patch to go live so I don't have to destroy the one I got in there.  Man-jello is linked in my sig.</div></div><hr />

However, I'd *guess* that a 16/20 offhand would do more damage than a 15/25 with 40atk. It really is a guess, but that's what my opinion would be. I guess it partially depends on how much the attack affects your mainhand damage, which I simply don't know. Does attack affect backstab damage? If it does, then it's very possible that the attack bonus WOULD be significant enough... Basically, it comes down to me not really knowing the impact of attack on rogues well enough.<br />

also wondering why you would put the 16/20 offhand and not main for backstabs.</div></div><hr />

The Gemmed is 1 damage more and 5 less delay.  That's why i posted the question here, if anyone knew if the +1 Damage -5 Delay would be higher DPS over the loss of 40Atk from dropping the Freebringer.</div></div><hr />

Ragebringer makes up for over half your worn ATK, which is quite low even with it. That 40atk is more vital than you might think.</div></div><hr />
