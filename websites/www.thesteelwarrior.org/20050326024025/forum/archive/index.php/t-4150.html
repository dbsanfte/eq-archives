<br />
<br />
I'm a 64 war, and my best friend in EQ is a 65 shaman. I was wondering if we could duo Severilious in EJ for my green scale (and/or other lewt)<br />
<br />
<br />
I buff up to about 7100HP easy.<br />
<br />
Shaman has a 4kish mana pool and gets 5k HP buffed...<br />
<br />
<br />
My magelos in sig (war) but shaman doesnt have one (yet).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've two boxed Sev four or five times with my shaman, he's quite easy. You do need to get your poison resist up (100+ at least, 150+ is better) and magic resist as well (200ish at least, getting close to 250 is better though). <br />
<br />
It may be possible to do with lower resists but it's a pain when your healer gets stunned or feared... or you're stunned/feared the whole fight doing little damage. Keep in mind shammy can make some resist potions in addition to normal resist buffs... if your shammy friend has never done alchemy, check the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Oh, when I refer to resist levels I mean buffed of course.<br />
<br />
Something useful for the shaman to have as well is Radiant Cure, since Sev will probably try to Malo both of you.</div></div><hr />
