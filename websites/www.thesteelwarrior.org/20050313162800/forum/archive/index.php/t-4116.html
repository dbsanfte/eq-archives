<br />
Last week we were going to try something which I don’t know how many ive tried and since the fight is so easy anyway might just make it easier. Has anyone tried to pull Fennin Ro to Tables and AoW in SE corner ? we pull all of fire there and AoW so I don’t know why Fennin wouldn’t work. Melee can avoid AE ramp and he wont climb the wall. Has anyone tried anyting close to this ?</div></div><hr />

There are corners along the path to castle. The most notable being where the &quot;tree&quot; near the start of the path is (about 1/3rd of the way up I guess).  Can push easily into a corner there.  This is not past his leash point.</div></div><hr />

Don't see why you would pull him all the way up his ramp...</div></div><hr />

I'm in Krassus's guild and that's pretty much the same thing we do...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, we position him to the right of the door way a little more, but he can still climb 300 feet up the wall sometimes when our achery pushing is too much.</div></div><hr />

Just arrow and casters. Fairly easy to do and rarely go more than one tank. Tank engages him at the edge of the doorway.<br />

 We have issues clearing 5 clerics most nights. FR we can usually get 6-7 maybe if half our heavy MT's play clerics. Range fight would just last too long and give too much room for us to fork it up=P</div></div><hr />

<br />
He seems to get stuck on those big stones with his face on them for us on the initial position.We use Paladins to stun push him into place as the tank cna't move to far ahead because off oor of heals obviously.<br />
<br />
It happens only rarely but it is a bit of a pita when it does occur.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for meleeing him, We simply have everyone melee and make sure that the melee have show npc spells on and we move oor when you see the fennin begins to cast a spell message.In the time it takes you to run out to that invisible lava wall you can run back in again and start meleeing without having to rely on a caller.<br />
<br />
If you choose to melee him,convice your rogues that Lev is important in case they run toward the lava(leave out the invisble wall part ,This is important).Once the orgues are leved and in range happily Bsing Fennin, Work yourself in behind them and start to walk forward.If all goes well you will be able to safely melee Fennin with your rogue Human Shield if you push to hard Rampage wil kill your rogue instnatly in all likelyhood and you will have to find yourself a new one.<br />
<br />
This is alos effective with knights and ore pleasing but knights have a greater chance of living through it and moving away from that area for fear of it happeneing again.This is why rogues are best.<br />
<br />
You wil probably go through a few rogues,My record is 5 in one fight,So make sure you convince many of them that lev is essential.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bakkal2003</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as pulling him outside the castle to the ramp, we did it that way the first time and it worked so we've had no reason to change it. We always get the pull as soon as we want it, so we continued it.  Doesn't seem where you pull him is much of an issue.  If you can get a corner anywhere, he sits well in it as has been posted by others in the thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No need to be a jerk about, everyone understood what he was talking about.</div></div><hr />

Well it did for us, anyhow :P</div></div><hr />

That's my theory and I'm sticking to it!</div></div><hr />

He got pushed up, summoned MT and OOR for ch's...grats wipe.<br />
<br />
Anyone else do him in this area? Those that take him inside, aren't the elites a PITA and respawn fast?<br />
<br />
Sorry for all da questions, only been on 1 FR raid to date. Tonight we're going back.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
