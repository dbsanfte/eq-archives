<br />
Answer:  At least 652 according to the Website I just went to...<br />
<br />
I just included the 10 most commonly purchaseable cheeses in most grocery stores.  If I had my way, there would be all 652 cheeses with a stack of crackers in my work's break room every day.</div></div><hr />

Customer: It's not much of a cheese shop, is it?<br />
<br />
Owner: Finest in the district!<br />
<br />
Customer: (annoyed) Explain the logic underlying that conclusion, please.<br />

Owner: Well, it's so clean, sir!<br />

Customer: It's certainly uncontaminated by cheese....</div></div><hr />

My vote goes for munster at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I couldn't agree more about the American cheese palate.  However, the cheeses represented here are the generally available cheeses at an American grocery.  If you aren't American, this poll has to be hard for you.<br />
<br />
Where are the people from Wisconsin to vote on the brick cheese?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm guilty of voting, but...NERF POLLS!!<br />
<br />
Pretty soon there will be a  CAKE vs PIE poll !!<br />
<br />
o-0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Voting on a poll on this board doesn't bump the thread, so as soon as people like you and me stop posting on it it will fall off the page, no matter how many dipsticks come by and decide they need to share their cheese preference with the warrior community.<br />
<br />
Just one more reason this place is better than EZboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mokor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">what where is the smoked gudda!!!<br />
<br />
the monostary near here has a little store like thing where the monks sell surpluses of wine, cheese, bread, and stuff they have no special name for it or anything it's just cheese, but when peple know a batch is done it's sold out in 30 min. the wine is like purple sewer water and the bread is like brown brick hard ...t</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">there is chesses on that poll I have never heard of in my life.</div></div><hr />

There's one I haven't heard in a while.  Folks at the office think I've lost it for laughing out loud at my desk.<br />
Why are we even having this poll? The worst cheese I ever had was pretty damned good, and it goes with almost everything...wine, beer, meat, bread....all the important stuff. :)</div></div><hr />
