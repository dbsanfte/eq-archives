<br />
We had established the ground rules that I would pull, tank and he'd be main assist.  This was understood.  Nods all around the group.  OK.<br />
<br />
But then when we get into the heat of battle, he had to keep &quot;proving&quot; that HE could pull better by darting off on his own when the druid was OOM and bringing back adds!<br />
<br />
I was patient.  I really WAS.  I calmly explained that &quot;we-cannot-be-pulling-things-while-the-druid-is-still-medding-because-thats-a-real-good-way-for-us-all-too-die-so-please-do-not-pull-things-because-that-is-my-job-and-you-are-supposed-to-be-assisting-me...&quot;<br />
<br />
But, somehow he didn't get it, even though I was speaking PURE CLEAR Elvish.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The druid would say &quot;OOM&quot;<br />
I would say &quot;Guarding manna medders&quot;<br />
Dingleberry wouldn't say anything.<br />
I'd look around, where's Dingleberry...?  He was here a sec ago...?<br />
No Dingleberry in site.<br />
Then, outa the blue he comes running back with two or three mobs in pursuit.<br />
&quot;ROOT!&quot; I scream.<br />
The druid calls on his severely depleated mana to root a couple of the mobs<br />
&quot;PULL BACK!&quot;  I cry.<br />
But Dingleberry doesn't listen.  I pull back and concentrate on the one monster that wasn't rooted, but Dingleberry doesn't assist me, he's off doin' his own thang, battling the mobs that are rooted....<br />
<br />
This is where my patience ENDS, and I become the lord-have-mercy-on-me-SUPERBITCH-from-hell.<br />
<br />
It was tongue lashing time.  Dingleberry appears to understand.  It appears to be sinking in.  Yes, he agrees not to pull stuff.  Yes he agrees we need to let the druid med up.  It was sinking in.  A smile began to crawl over my face and then.....<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
...we reach a little bone of contention... cuz he doesn't get why we have to wait for the druid when HE has mana too.....he can hit AND he can cast so he oughta be able to do both, shouldn't he oughta...?<br />
<br />
Arghhhhh.  There was no sense trying to make him understand.  He simply could not.  He wanted to be the tank, didn't like being main assist, screw the group cuz HIS EGO was on the line here!<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
See why I prefer soloing most of the time?<br />
<br />
Zhenobia<br />
*Doesn't believe grouping is ALWAYS more fun than soloing*<br />
<br />
Edited to add this disclaimer:  The above story is based on actual events, but the names have been changed to protect the guilty, why I'm bothering I have no idea, must be some vestage of ethics I'm still clinging to, in any case no Dingleberries were harmed during the writing of this story though I wish I coulda THROTTLED his scrawny lil neck...</div></div><hr />

Rangers like this are like Charles Bronson without the cool. They have an innate death wish that gets their groups killed almost as often as them. I know one personally; good guy, terrible ranger. He has a built-in desire to &quot;just have a look&quot; which invariably gets him aggroed. Then, instead of hanging his head in shame, realizing his stupid mistake, he brings the critter back to the unsuspecting group and wipes them.<br />
<br />
Still, he makes a pretty good chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL Charles Bronson... thats funny :)<br />
<br />
This guy might have been a decent addition to the group if he just would have done his job as main assist.  No biggie :)  Just funny.  I like venting in a creative way, telling a story and making it sort of entertaining.  Truth be known, he didn't piss me off all that much, and I didn't bitch him out, just asked him to stop .<br />
<br />
I don't take this game as seriously as some folks do, that may be another reason why I don't enjoy grouping much.  I play to have fun, as a break after a long day at work, and I prefer to group with like minded, mature people who are fairly laid back about it.  <br />
<br />
This guy was not laid back about it at all, he wanted to be the big leader, the one pulling, the one in front... and he didn't seem to care how that effected the group.  My guess is he was probably a kid, or at least a very young adult.<br />
<br />
Nothing against kids, but there are times when I wish they had an adult-only server and a kids-only server. I have no idea how they would ever police that... so I guess its really not feasible.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I like the Firiona Vie server is because for the most part  I've found the players are more mature, easy going, and into role playing which I also enjoy.  They stick closer to character, don't get bent out of shape about loot, and generally are a blast to play with.  I previously played on the Karana server and got tired of the constant OOC chatter and the whiners.<br />
<br />
Anyway, me and my fiance and a few of our friends enjoy playing EQ together when we can, when we can't it can be difficult finding decent groups.<br />

We have our share of stupid groupies too.Like the ranger wqho got adds every time pulling BoT OS, when I told him to just let me pull the response was &quot;Warriors cant pull&quot;....I proceeded to shut him up by not having but one add all night and thats because it spawned by the door on a pull.<br />
Same situation in IS at another time.BoT IS is even easier to pull,yet a monk wanted argue with me on pullling duty.<br />
Always gonna be someone that insists on doing it their way and to %$@&amp; with the rest of the group.In that situation, if a group member repeatedly pulled when not supposed to I would give him a warning and if it continued to /disband him.</div></div><hr />

Just out of curiosity.  If you don't like grouping, why did you make a warrior?  <br />
<br />
Oh, I like grouping.  With mature, easy going people. Like my fiance.  And my friends.<br />
<br />
Why did I create a warrior?  Because I happen to like the class.<br />
<br />

&quot;Its been swell, but the swellings gone down.&quot;<br />

<br />
Just noticed you had mentioned several times, like when the druid helped you that you prefer soloing.   I understand liking the class as I have enjoyed my warrior immensely.  It just isn't an easy class to solo to me and most people who don't enjoy grouping tend to make something other than warriors.</div></div><hr />
