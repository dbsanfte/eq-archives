<br />
I've been waiting until I and my friends are level 20 to try an instance as that was what yet another friend recommended.  Then again, we keep doing quests and battles that we are told time and again we shouldn't yet be doing so... I guess it might be a good idea to try one tonight since beta is going to be ending soon anyway!</div></div><hr />

It was quite interesting.  People were really used to soloing and didn't understand the loot rules/policy and the binds when equipped/picked up thing.  But they learned.. Our Warrior did a really good job.  I was playing my Warlock (16ish then, 20 now).  We had a mage, rogue, warlock, warrior, and priest.  Everything went pretty well, but helped me realize that I didn't want to play a Warlock.  Everything dies fast so DoTs are useless, and his DD's are too slow casting.<br />
<br />
Also the Warlock had too low of HPs, so when I got jumped in Contested Zones, I'd die before I could really do much at all.<br />
<br />
Since then I've been on my warrior pretty much all the time.</div></div><hr />

There's a little portal where you'll have a loading time that marks going to the instance from the static spawn caves.</div></div><hr />

*edit* Ah, NM, Ragefire is in Orc capital! Can't be going there.  I'm told that Wailing Caverns, however, are good for alliance at around that same level and they are in The Barrens*/edit*</div></div><hr />

Man, whenever I get told stuff like that, I go do it just to prove how much of pussies my acquantainces are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went back to WC last night with a 17 war, 16 hunter, and me (17 shaman) and found the zone in to the instance.  It basically looks kinda like the swirly portal you see at the log in screen, located at the back of the static portion of WC.  Its one of the few spots I've found that you actually have to &quot;zone&quot; into like we're used to in EQ.<br />
<br />
First thing we see when we zone in is an NPC that tells us that we need to help kill the reptiles in the cavern so some guy can be free to do his thang.  I didnt notice at first, but when you talk to the NPC you get a nice lil druid buff that up's your stats =)  Very cool.<br />
<br />
First few mobs we're pretty much the same as the outside mobs, lvl 17ish elites that were no problem for us.  Then we ran into a lvl 21 druid 2 rooms into the instance that whooped our ass.  It looked namedish, but the hunter said he saw a few more deeper in so its apparently tough trash mob.  We never got past this first meanie.  We tried about 8 times experimenting with different approaches and ended up just not having the healer mana to keep the tank up through the whole fight.  So after about an hour or so of banging our heads on it we decided we'd need more peeps to hang there and opted to leave (it was getting late).<br />
<br />
While there we learned that after about five or so Shaman rezzes they start making you wait 30 sec, then 2 min to accept the rezz.  I didnt rezz the tank anymore after it told her wait 2 min so I dont know if the wait gets any longer.  I was surprised at the message at first, but it kinda makes sence.  By the time that message started showing up the tanks durability was pretty much shot anyways.  Interesting penalty for repeatedly rezzing.<br />
<br />
When you get boared with questing and killing normal mobs, go check out one of these instanced dungons.  Apparently they are tuned to the level of the group so at higher levels they will be equally challenging.  Im just jazzed that my lowbie hooves gets a chance to fight against mobs this hard.   These truely are some kick ass dungons!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing my group noticed in the first stress was that shammy heals just do not seem to be enough to keep a tank standing thru elites.<br />
<br />
We remedied that problem and now we're kicking ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe did you roll up a priest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, we felt pretty much the same way.  Did Deadmines last night with a 20 Paladin, 20 Druid, 18 Hunter.  We could clear down to the final fight, but could not beat it.   Final dude (a huge machine with fucking scary buzzsaws) calls two friends to help...which isn't that big of a problem with root.  But at 50% health he calls another two...which is, um, a bit harder.  It was fun as hell getting down there, though.  Two bosses along the way and they are similarly hard as hell, but solo at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me the weak death penalty encourages folks going in and trying harder mobs than they &quot;should&quot; be fighting =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vig, thats nowhere near the end of Deadmines ;)   You have a few more mini's and then vancleefe to go :p   The adds seem new, you sure it wasnt just the room spawns?<br />
<br />
Some of my best memories of the WoW beta (after 6-8 months it is very :( now, hah) was grouping with 2 good EQ friends, doing crap like deadmines with a 17 pal, 18 pal, 16 rog and beating up through the first few bosses (to finish the paladin weapon quest for both of us), or a level or two later doing Blackfathom for bracer upgrades and rings, praying we never got more than 1 ae mob at a time.<br />
<br />
WoW is very doable at levels lower than you &quot;should&quot; be able to do things.  We cleared uldaman with a l50war, 35war and 37 mage, and sunken temple with a 50 war, 45mage, 42war just to show it was possible (of course we kinda exploited  a few things in ST)<br />
<br />
Get a good group of  EQ'ers together and you will have 0 problems at any stage.  Play with diehard d2 and wc3 players on the other hand...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, I rolled up my final warrior race today, a level 3 mage comes up to me and laughs, then he goes back out and kills.<br />
<br />
When I hit level 4 and he's still 3, I run by him and laugh and head back out to my stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now that WoW Beta is over...Im suffering major withdrawals.  Im going to put in some major family time this weekend, hehee.  Need to build up a useable account balance with the wife.  I know next week, Im going to go crazy.  Uggghh...5 days w/ no WoW.<br />
<br />
Ive been soloing in Ragefire as a 20 Shaman.  Just to see if I could, it was cool.  The double pulls starting at the base of the first bridge can be a a pita, though.<br />
<br />
What server you guys going to play on?  Anyone have any clue on names?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said that they will not be releasing server named before it goes live to try to help prevent overcrowding on any one server.  They will also be staggering the release of servers so hours after the first set are opened up, others might become available, etc to try to help even out the load.  At least that was the last I had heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a completely retarded excuse (Blizzard's).  Not releasing names just ensures mass chaos.<br />
<br />
Moreover, their other brilliant release decision completely contradicts that excuse.  Staggering the release of servers just ensures that they WILL have overcrowding on specific servers (namely those first released)...which makes me tempted to wait to start playing.  But I'm probably too impatient so meh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some companies do it to avoid the yantis companies buying up all the domains to turn into plat/gold farm destinations and other such nonsense. Just take what you hear from a PR person with a grain of salt in this industry and you'll learn to read between the lines to get a general idea of what / when / why :b</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before final stress test ended I managed to complete the full Deadmine's/Van Cleef instance.  To be honest, I had more fun in those 2 hours than I've had in EQ in the last 6 months.   :) <br />
<br />
Before we started, I would have sworn we were doomed to failure; it was my first time doing this instance, it was a pickup group, and 3 of the people were German and 2 of them didn't speak English.   :eek: <br />
<br />
However, our MT (a Pally, btw) had done the instance several times before and guided us through flawlessly.  It was funny watching him type out instructions in English only to see the 1 German guy immediatly typing out the translation in German.   ;) <br />
<br />
After only a few minutes it was clear this group was gonna rock ... everyone was assisting the MT, no one was grabbing aggro excessively, and the healer (a Druid) actually knew he was supposed to heal instead of DPS.<br />
<br />
Since this was my first instance, I was amazed at the amount of blue gear dropping.  I had previously spent all my time either solo'ing or doing the many, many quests available.  I had a full supply of green gear, but still managed to score like 5 peices of blue gear.<br />
<br />
So far, this game rocks!  I just hope it has an end-game that can keep my attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugle, A few of us are probably going to be on the same server.  No idea what that server is right now (leaning Central myself, non-PVP).<br />
<br />
Me and my boyfriend are picking up copies at midnight and will start as soon thereafter as we can get home and install; I'll post where I am at least and you can hang there or run screaming, whichever your choice may be.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Experience and skill counts for a lot in instances.  You can experiment but there are times when you just have to be smart.  (i.e. when I repeatedly tell the level 17 guy [17 being at least twice his maturity] in the group &quot;Do not get near the ship's hull as there is a chance of chain aggro&quot; and he then gets on the %@$#ing hull and wonders why a dozen mobs showed up and beat our asses AND THEN DOES IT AGAIN)  I have done Deadmines as a paladin and being the main healer.  I have done Deadmines as a warrior main tanking.  I tried Deadmines with a hunter in a four person group and nearly beat it (killed Van Cleef but got wiped by the adds).  Honestly, I have had a lot of fun in the instances.<br />
<br />
The only bad times that I have had in instances were when raids first went live and dumbasses ruled the world.  Frustration is going into an instance with 10 people, 7 of whom are immature idiots who could not find their ass with both hands handcuffed behind them.  I remember running through Westfall and hearing someone in the General chat say that Deadmines was impossible without a raid and responding that I had done it with two different characters without raids... morons.<br />
<br />
I'm going Mountain time zone server on release.  Splits the difference between my guild's eastern and western sides.</div></div><hr />
