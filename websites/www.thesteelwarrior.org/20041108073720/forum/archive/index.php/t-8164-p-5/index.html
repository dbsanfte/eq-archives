it's the gear, pure and simple. If you can kill a named, you can get a nice upgrade for somebody..... And sure, it's a risk - so's a raid, for that matter, by those standards.<br />
Which pretty much explains the reluctance of &quot;higher level&quot; players to do Difficults with pickup groups. The groups are willing to gamble AP for the chance of getting loot. The only &quot;upgrades&quot; for me in LDoN are the vendor bought augments and I generally pass on the *cough* &quot;loot&quot;.<br />

Thus, &quot;lower level&quot; Warriors are not really competing with &quot;higher level&quot; Warriors for LDoN Difficult pickup groups - most of us aren't interested.<br />

<br />
The stench of your arrogance is foul to the nose.  Just because &quot;you&quot; may not be interested in the drops for LDoN difficult pickup groups doesn't mean you can speak for every single semi-EP or higher geared Warrior in the game.  Some people play unusual hours and do things like LDoN hards to pass the time.  Your preferences aren't the &quot;only&quot; ones in the game.<br />
<br />
And the fact of the matter is that pickup groups won't do a LDoN hard if their tank is perceived, by their standards, to represent too great a risk of failure.   So if you show up on the scene, then yeah suddenly they'll be gung ho to do a LDoN hard.  But if it's someone like me, Haass, or Partha, you better believe they're throwing on the brakes on that idea muy pronto.  They perceive the risk as too great.  It really doesn't matter what my opinion is or whether or not I'm willing to do it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I do LDON, I do hards only because:<br />
<br />
1. I wont do a pickup group, period.. and<br />
2. I can do them in 35-40mins with the people I generally play with.<br />
<br />
That being said, LDON is about as much fun as gouging my eyes out, even if im multiboxing which generally makes things slightly more interesting. I can see where the casual people are coming from in this respect.. LDON just plain sucks balls. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I know people who arent in raiding guilds and by putting in the effort in GOD they are now farming Kodtaz and Ikkinz trials for elemental/time quality items in many slots. These arent fictional people, theyre real characters I know. They play on a different server to me, so its not like theyre relying on me to step in and tank for them, they have a tank that theyve geared up off this content as they went.<br />
<br />
The combination of some LDON, some GOD, some bazaar gear CAN fill out a character very respectively and definitely is enough to be able to kill PA/RI/HS in ikkinz trials now theyve been made into total creampuffs. An appropriate group-build can also farm Kodtaz for nameds in the right spots with ease. If I can 2box a named there with myself and my clericbot, im confident a 6k unbuffed tank can do it with slows and 2 healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want very much to say you are where you are becuase you are trapped. PoTime Warriors are keeping you out of LDoN pickup groups, they are running all the way to Droga and perma camping the weapons, and other hooey.<br />
<br />
The truth is there is a path. No one is preventing your progression except yourself.<br />
<br />
But such things don't suit your purposes. If LDoN is brought up, then it takes too much time, we can't get groups, the RA BP is only 200HP's auged, we'll never make it, .....<br />
<br />
Oh, if someone has the termitity to point out that high level players AREN'T competing with you for LDoN Difficult pickup groups and why, then you'll ignore the pursuisiveness of their argument and confirmation by others and label them as being &quot;arrogant&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes Glatius, those that have posted there is a path are either liars or arrogant, those who display Magelos showing they have walked that path are making their Magelos up, you are where you are in the game because everyone is out to get you.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This isn't massively complicated really.  There needs to be a viable progression path for raiders and a viable progression path for non-raiders.<br />
<br />
I don't like the argument that raiders &quot;work&quot; for their gear and therefore deserve better.  Raiding ought to be fun in itself, and raiders should raid because they want to - not because they have to raid in order to get the gear which'll enable them to get a pickup group.  That's just bass ackwards.<br />
<br />
I also don't like the argument that non-raiders should be able to get raid-like gear without doing anything particularly challenging.<br />
<br />
For casters, Velious struck the right balance, with the Coldain Prayer Shawl quest.  That was tough and time-consuming, with a real story, and it had realistic requirements for the reward.  It was obtainable by anyone, regardless of guild or flagging requirements.  Not putting something similar in for pure melees was an error: you ought to have been able to exchange your Coldain Prayer Shawl for a weapon or piece of armour of equivalent value.  The 10th Ring wasn't the same because it required a guild.<br />
<br />
LDoN got it wrong.  LDoN Normals are too easy, and too time-consuming, and the rewards are disproportionately skewed so that pure melees get less out of LDoN's than other classes, and there's too little story.  Obtaining LDoN gear is more about patience and play time than about overcoming challenges.<br />
<br />
GoD was better, because anyone with enough LDoN victories and enough guts to eat the deaths along the way can get to Ikkinz.  You don't need a guild or PoP flags to do it (I speak from personal knowledge).  There's a story to it and there's variety in the encounters.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz is disproportionately tough compared to KT/Yxxta, though, and it's the new &quot;glass ceiling&quot; for non-raiders.   Ikkinz ought to be progressive, rather than three zones of roughly equal difficulty.<br />
<br />
Hope the task system for OoW doesn't suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know BB, you say there is a path but that is like saying there is a sky.<br />
<br />
Is the path a walkable one for casuals and non-raiders or is it burning coals, broken glass and gators?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't done Ikkinz since the changes. The impression that I've gotten is that while maybe (I'm not saying they were) they were adjusted it was not as much as the content below them, I suppose because they aren't required individual flag content any more.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know if a non-raider can do them currently. I suspect when OoW and level 70 comes out they will be able to do them.<br />
<br />
However, there is a whole pile of content between a level 65 Wariror at 5500HP's unbuffed and Ikkinz and I believe a path from 5500HP to Ikkinz exists. By the time a player walks that path, OoW and level 70 will be out and progress will continue uninterrupted.<br />

No Gerick, the path is easy peasy. First you go to Sebilis (you'll have to complete a key quest to get in) and camp a ToD (that's a Truncheon of Doom) from the Armsman.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had a thought last night that has sort of changed my perspective on this collection of issues.<br />
It does seem to me that some cases of flagging, particularly PoP flagging, is a barrier to entry for a fair percentage of the casual population.<br />
But it also seems very unlikely to me that the flagging system will change; it even is starting to seem to me that there's little chance that LDoN will be expanded to include much variety, either on the level of difficulty settings, instanced zone layout, or another level of better gear.<br />
I had this thought because I considered the matter from SOE's beancounters' point of view: would you spend your resources adding to expansions people had already bought, or would you make a new expansion incorporating desirable features into the new expansion, and then sell everyone the new expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">would you spend your resources adding to expansions people had already bought, or would you make a new expansion incorporating desirable features into the new expansion, and then sell everyone the new expansion?<br />
<br />
Certainly this is what SoE will attempt to do.  They'll leave the status quo in the game as it stands today and attempt to fix what they decide may be wrong in their new expansion.  The problem with this approach is that it requires faith on the part of the player base that in fact their concerns are properly addressed in the new expansion.  Faith is in pretty short supply when it comes to SoE these days, at least from the people I've talked to.  And along with a lack of faith comes the realization that if they're not properly addressed the problems then you've already paid the money and the chances of SoE coming back and making changes are pretty remote.  They'll just promise to address the problems in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Brabble, are you eager to lay down another $40 for a new expansion that may or may not include content for your level of play?  Are you willing to take it on faith that the content for you that SoE will undoubtedly claim is there, is actually there?   Are you willing to invest that $40 based on the promise, empty though it may be, that SoE is actually not setting OoW up as another uber guild player play ground and that more run of the mill players will actually be able to explore, have fun, and progress?  If so, you are far more of an optimist than I am, or most people for that matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, well it seems unlikely I'll be eager. I haven't bought GoD yet. The entire fishing-for-plat thing when that expansion started got my goat. It was obvious that the fishing prices were in the expansion to get people who could not otherwise make much use of the expansion to buy the expansion. As soon as sales dropped off, fishing got &quot;nerfed.&quot; Which was not a surprise, but really I just thought the whole thing was cheesy.<br />
Believe me, my untwinked warrior could have used the plat. And his fishing skill was already 160 or so--it's not like I object to fiddling around in game. But I dislike buying an expansion so I can do yet more bazaar shopping for l33t. <br />
I don't buy plat online, so why should I buy an expansion to fish for it?<br />
Still, I'm going to get GoD pretty soon, I reckon. I like to fight in nasty places I have no business being, so hey. I have some scores to settle with a few Kael residents and some Hole mobs first, though.<br />
<br />
The next expansion will have some other flavor of candy waved at you by the sweaty bigman as he opens his cardoor and darts his tiny piglike eyes back and forth and says &quot;hey kid, wanna look at my expansion...&quot;<br />
<br />
My character would be much more advanced if I weren't so damn contrary, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was recently ordered to spend a little time there by my GL ( Iyacc ) to look for an unguilded cleric that can play at an earlier time then many of my guilds clerics as to get the jump on clearing to targets. <br />
<br />
People complain about BoT being bad exp ... but it's not because you don't get decent exp per kill there, but because you never get to actually kill any mobs since every 28 seconds some asshat/retard/cockholster/moron would run around with 2-30 mobs chasing him spamming:<br />
<br />
 &quot; LOLZ! train 2 teh zone  ( courtyard/pad/broom closet ) OMFG !!!!!11 &quot;<br />
<br />
And then there's the famous:<br />
<br />
&quot; WTF my invis dropd can ne1 plz kil teh mobz &quot;<br />
<br />
I have remained doggedly determined NOT to play anywhere where I'm forced to encounter these players; The potential for jackasses to disrupt raids on elemental bosses is too high, and there are far too many people like this in the unguilded population ( not unguilded because of some chioce or philosophy ... unguilded because no decent guild would admit them ) to risk opening up Elemental zones.<br />
<br />
Before you jump in and say &quot; But asshats like this exist in the EP's now&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grumbam,<br />
I believe BoT is the exception not the normal.  The zone is setup for exp grouping.  You never see these types of calls in CoD or PoTorment or HoH or PoTactics and they are open.<br />

<br />
&quot;oooo...lvl 62, i can go train a graveyard in an new zone now!&quot;<br />
<br />
I dislike it as much as you do.<br />
<br />
What we're asking for is opening up Elemental planes via alt-flagging quests or some other method friendlier to non-raiders. Vigdis has mentioned, and I agree, that these flags shouldn't count for &quot;planar progression&quot; and eventual access to Time but merely for exp and the opportunity to aquire meaningful drops on our own instead of buying them from guild or raider bazaar mules. We want to earn access to content we paid for without having to sacrifice our playstyle on the alter of &quot;Raid or Bust&quot;.<br />
<br />
And you can't tell me there aren't entire guilds of asshats who enjoy being asshats together and make everyone else's life difficult at all levels of play. Pleasant personalities aren't a requirement for competent raiding and I've been steamrolled by hardcore raiders in a non-raid zone more than once. ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, tanks are more gear-dependent.  I don't think that's big news.<br />
<br />
How d'ya fix that for the non-raiding tank, tho?  Stick more Droga-weapon-style easy camp tradeable drops in?  Stick some war-only stuff on LDoN vendors?  Make certain raid gear tradeable so you can buy raiding warriors' castoffs?

You're right, it's old news. However with the GoD release it's been brought to a head, because there is single group content that we're suddenly out-classed for. Previously, the out-of-our-league stuff was locked behind flags.<br />
<br />
The other thread on this board has some ideas. Personally, I'd REALLY like a set of quested visible slot gear a'la ornate with the components dropping throughout GoD trials or some such. Stats somewhere between ornate and elemental, and tuned per class. A full set of ornate/ldon and appropriate AA and a warrior can reasonably tank sewers. A couple of the new pieces and the all/all drops from those zones and I would hope that toon could tank vxed for his next piece. Hopefully tipt would be reasonable at that point.<br />
<br />
Some better warrior weapon options from ldon would be nice though. Dual stun/eb proc combos are damn rare for non-raiders.<br />
<br />
I REALLY don't thin LDoN is the answer to the armor problem, without major changes to the points system /etc.  BattleBlade's 3000 moss snakes analogy is pretty appropriate to easy ldons in particular.</div></div><hr />

To make sol ro an XP zone repop needs to come down. (No issues) And Some way to keep unflagged off the flagging mobs. Easiest way is to make the Pot's check. Guess you could lock the door to that flag... Not sure how that'd work.<br />

Sol ro is smaller than many think. <br />

As I just noted in the sister thread, I take offense to the suggestion that content needs to be blocked in order to protect the raiders.

Spent any time in BoT lately? <br />
<br />
I was recently ordered to spend a little time there by my GL ( Iyacc ) to look for an unguilded cleric that can play at an earlier time then many of my guilds clerics as to get the jump on clearing to targets. <br />
<br />
People complain about BoT being bad exp ... but it's not because you don't get decent exp per kill there, but because you never get to actually kill any mobs since every 28 seconds some asshat/retard/cockholster/moron would run around with 2-30 mobs chasing him spamming:<br />
<br />
 &quot; LOLZ! train 2 teh zone  ( courtyard/pad/broom closet ) OMFG !!!!!11 &quot;<br />
<br />
And then there's the famous:<br />
<br />
&quot; WTF my invis dropd can ne1 plz kil teh mobz &quot;<br />
<br />
I have remained doggedly determined NOT to play anywhere where I'm forced to encounter these players; The potential for jackasses to disrupt raids on elemental bosses is too high, and there are far too many people like this in the unguilded population ( not unguilded because of some chioce or philosophy ... unguilded because no decent guild would admit them ) to risk opening up Elemental zones.<br />
<br />
Before you jump in and say &quot; But asshats like this exist in the EP's now&quot; <br />
<br />
Yes, yes i know they do ... but at least there aren't very many of them, if the ele planes were open there would be too many to avoid.<br />
<br />
Hey now, I didn't &quot;order&quot; anyone to go to BoT. I just suggested that rather than logging to alts, tanks &quot;might&quot; be able to come up with some good candidates that hadn't considered life in a raiding guild....   jackass   :p</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't complain if there was a non loot dropping version that spawned 8 hours later That would enable those that kill said mob to get the flag. (Same difficulty just no loot) That's another idea. But the way the zone currently is? <br />
No.. I can't see allowing it for &quot;Free&quot;  also You shouldn't get the flag for zoning out if you aren't flagged.<br />

<br />
I've addressed this already, several times.  Then, when you ignored it, I told you several MORE times that I'd already addressed it and pointed you to the posts.  <br />
<br />
The first raid boss mobs were never restricted by any of those things.  Because Naggy and Vox were originally intended to be single-group encounters.<br />
<br />
Level requirements, as noted above, are irrelevant to this entire discussion.<br />
<br />
Hordes of yardtrash is irrelevant to this entire discussion.<br />
<br />
Gatekeeper mobs?  Maybe Trak, Aary and Emp.  But I've already addressed that.  First, it was one zone.  Second, with the exception of VT, the others are completely doable today with casuals.  VT will be doable.  RZ will not. So, uh, your point that blahblahblah was always the same as blahblahblah isn't correct.<br />

Actually, that is no longer true and hasn't been for some time.  Even when it was true, you and I both know that raiders completely bypassed this with what you now claim is an &quot;unfortunate work around.&quot;  Regardless, this is completely irrelevant.  The progression model in PoSky is what it should be - progressively harder content.  I don't see the Bee boss on Isle2 cockblocking anyone who needs the remaning isles. <br />

Gunnar, wtf?  Why ask someone if he's read this thread when your next question only shows that YOU haven't read this thread.  I and others have explained in detail exactly why we want in to the elemental planes. <br />

I don't understand your comment that &quot;guilds still have to gear through that content.&quot;  Could you please explain what you mean by this? <br />
<br />
I completely agree that mroe content would be good for ornate+ people.  You and I in fact reached agreement several pages ago that elemental-equivalent drops ought to be available on the elemental-equivalent mobs in LDoN or instanced zones.  My only disagreement was the likelihood that such a thing would ever be implimented.  I think it far more likely that Sony would impliment a quest to permit access than that Sony would spend development time designing new content entirely.  An additional point of contention is that it would not address that seemingly-trite but actually-quite-important issue of nonraiders simply wishing to experience the current content.</div></div><hr />

Its called open raids.  It may sound silly but for a long while on our server, there was a pretty good group of people doing open raids for elemental access.<br />
<br />
Some of the raids weren't pretty and there was a lot of trial and error.  And we had our share of wipes.  But that group got a lot of flags done.  I was fortunate enough to participate in a lot of the raids and got a lot of my elemental flags that way.   I don't think the group ever got Sol Ro done but I am not sure on that one.  I did get carprin, grummus, saryrn, mm, hoh trials, agnarr, and probably one or two others i can't think of, done outside guild.<br />
<br />
And as far as gear drops go, there is still a lot of very nice gear in the elemental planes.  Doesn't make sense to discount it as old and dead.  Frankly I don't see how anyone can survive in GoD zones without a healthy amount of Elemental gear.<br />

<br />
Thing is, the progression path isn't static.<br />
<br />
I did a load of zones before the nerfs and the revamps.  Farmed a full set of Hate armour pre-revamp, ST pre-revamp, etc.  (I'm not a non-raider.  I'm an ex-raider.)  I camped Ragefire for 375 hours (my main's a cleric).  I did the access quests for BoT and HoH.  Hell, I've camped stuff like Grimrott that few people nowadays have even heard of.<br />
<br />
Then they gimped the zones so Hate's easier to farm and ST keys are easier to get and everyone's twink cleribot has their epic and anyone can walk into the zones I worked to get to.  So it goes, you don't see me crying about it.<br />
<br />
The EP's will be gimped for easy access at some point; this is EQ, it always happens.  Some day people will skip the EP's and Time the way they skip VT nowadays, xp group content will let them move straight to Qvic.<br />

At least you're honest about it and don't claim that from the &quot;impartial perspective&quot; of an uber geared Warrior you know that the non-raiders are completely blowing smoke.<br />
<br />
Okay, you say that you're not thrilled with the idea of elemental access for those who didn't work their butts off the way you did to gain your access.  Fine, lets set elemental access aside for the moment.<br />
<br />
Now, if we assume that you're correct, solely for the point of discussion, and it's not realistic for people to survive in GoD  without a healthy amount of elemental gear or something very like elemental gear, where does that leave players without that gear?<br />
<br />
Obviously they're not gaining it from the elemental planes.  Obviously to get the gear in GoD you almost have to be geared well enough to begin with that it isn't that major an upgrade.  Obviously people aren't gaining that caliber of gear from LDoN and add to that the fact that very few people are getting a large volume of LDoN gear at all, and where does that leave us?<br />
<br />
Are non-raiders just supposed to accept that GoD really isn't an expansion for them?  Or are they merely supposed to wait until OoW introduces the next 5 experience levels and hope that makes enough of a difference?   Where is the incentive to continue to take the chance on purchasing expansions that can very well be completely useless to the non-raider? Where is the game for the non-raiders?  Back in LDoN, two expansions old?  Are we supposed to be satisfied playing in the outer edges of PoP and continually rehashing the same content in LDoN?  Why bother if that's all we have to look forward to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand why you ask this question when I already answered it.  Get other people together in the same situation and go get flagged.  Yes, it requires raids to get eplane flags done.   But that doesn't mean it requires a raiding guild.  It just requires some people to get together and cooperate.  Difficult: Yes ... Impossible: No<br />
<br />
On top of that, there are some nice drops on the flag raids too.  Take a look at my Magelo.  I'm still wearing shoulderpads I got from HoH Trials.  I did not get that on a guild raid.  I got it on an open raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">So it is your opinion that if we want to play in GoD, we should become raiders?  That's the ONLY possible answer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not saying you have to be permanent raiders.  In fact, you can't get to Ikkinz with a raid.  Vexd and Tipt are one group trials.  Not only that, but the Smith Rondo event (which requires a raid), can be skipped by doing sewer trials which can only be done by group.  And the sewer trials are easy.<br />
<br />
But the primary objection that I hear to raiding is that people don't want to be slaves to a guild in order to get higher end loots.  Open raids don't require that kind of committment.   So what's the problem with them?  Get your flags and move on.<br />
<br />
BTW, I hate to break it to you, but if and when they open up elementals, the good drops still require raids to get them.  I guess maybe they can change this and make it like ornate.   There are currently some nice one groupable loots, but  not many.<br />
<br />
I haven't read this entire thread (I don't enjoy pain that much), so I'm sure I'm hitting something that's already been brought up but I'll step in it anyways.  BoT used to require the PoStorms parts to go into it.  Those parts where a pain to get and pretty much required a raid, unless you came across a group with parts rotting and they let you loot them.   I didn't have to do that quest because by the time I got to a high enough lvl to think about it, they made the zone available to all 62+.<br />
<br />
Well.....<br />
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying that doing the key part quest makes you a good player.  And I'm not saying that if you don't do the quest, you aren't a good player.   But I can certainly say that I came across a lot of people in BoT that I sure wished had to do the quest before they could get in.  That place served up more trains than Karnors ever did.  (as an aside the thing I still can't understand is people taking a train from Deep South out to the entrance when they can just step on the stupid platform to the Courtyard).<br />
<br />
Okay, laying it on the line here.   My final post on this thread.<br />
You really want the bottom line no bs answer as to why the elementals haven't been opened?  Here it is:<br />
<br />
Making elemental access hard is the primary thing that covers up the fact that Sony royally screwed up by not making Time a fully instanced zone.  It's bad when a few guilds on a server get time access and have to schedule it.  Open up elementals and it will be a zoo!  My understanding is that they are working on making time instanced.  It is better now than it used to be because it resets quicker.  But its still not fixed. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, none of this really matters.  I'm sure they will open them.  They want more people to go to GoD.  That's the other thing that covers up the Time problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Glatius,<br />
<br />
As many people have posted, there is content in GoD that does not require EP quality gear.<br />
<br />
Some have posted that in their opinion some content can not be done by a casual group that has never raided - the example given was the Ikkinz Tials. I don't know the veracity of this one way or another. I believe not many casual groups have reached this content and that level 70 and OoW will be available before they do, making it easier.<br />
<br />
Higher level raid quality content has never been initially doable by any single group. However as time goes on some mobs and zones become single-groupable and others do not.<br />
<br />
You know all of these things. You know single group gear has always been regulated by their CAPABILITY to take down targets they can reach while facing competion form better equiped raiders.<br />
<br />
You feign ignorance and leap at the most intuitively obvious statements as if they were new, significant and proved a point.<br />
<br />
When I as a group only player in part Crafted/part Bronze armor saw Mills walk through the EC tunnel weilding the first Paladin Epic on my server, I was neither consumed by jealouy nor compelled to remark how unfair it was that the uber raiding guilds got all the good stuff.<br />
<br />
I will admit that I was a bit miffed when a uber guild killed the Sleeper on my server. I felt the ubers being able to experiance content and make sure that no matter what I did I'd never see it was unfair.<br />
<br />
But this isn't the situation in EQ. The content is still all there. You can see it. If not as a hardcore raider, then later as a penciled in invitee to an uberguild raid, or in a pickup raid, or later in a public raid, or still later with 18 players, or still later with a group, and maybe even solo.<br />
<br />
And you've got content in front of you that you haven't completed that will allow you to progress.<br />
<br />
You didn't use to whine and wring yuor hands and declaim that you were owed stuff. You used to play the game and be happy with your victories. Just tired of the game and feeal like complaining? Or do you really think if you cry big tears and hold your breath that mommy will cave it and let you have a pony?<br />
<br />
Were you always like this or was I mistaken?<br />
<br />
You are making the same argument Knights made for Defensive. They claimed there should be no difference between Knights and Warirors - you disagreed. Suddenly you seem to embrace the idea that there should be no difference between hardcore raiders with 50 flags earned after a year of effort and those who can't or choose not to take on that set of challanges and opted instead for the non-raid part of the game with perhaps doing the raid content later when it had become trivialized.<br />
<br />
Were you consumed with jealousy when that first uber player was showing off his raid obtained BP in the Bazaar?<br />
<br />
Sadly, the next step in your progression is right in front of you and always has been.<br />

Fwiw, you're right, but I don't have to like it. Open raids don't encourage good raiding (in most cases), they are zerg fests instead. People get flagged  that should never get flagged, just by being on at the right time, showing up and sitting around. Entry quests would be a FAR better filter of quality players into the EP's at this point in time then the current system, IMO.</div></div><hr />

It is not necessary to eliminate raiding guilds for casual players to obtain superior equipment OR to compell players to raid 7 nights a week in hardcore raiding guilds.<br />

No self-respecting raider should be worried about the EP's, that stuff's four expansions old.  Wanting non-raiders to stay out of the EP's is equivalent to someone during early PoP complaining about newbies getting into Sebilis back when the keys were bugged.<br />
<br />
If you're a real raider, your Sekrit Uber Places Where N00bs Can't Get To are KT, Yxxta, Ikkinz etc., okay?  PoP's dead and stinking already, and when we're all level 70 it'll be a ghost town.<br />
<br />
Personally, I consider Pop one expansion past. LdoN and LoY (those the other two everyone refers to?) offered no raid progression. OMG, no progression.....<br />
<br />
Yeah LdoN has the raid junk, but it was buggy as hell the couple times we tried it and must not have been worth the effort for those who did make it work as evidenced by the fact that noone does it.<br />

I attended somewhere between 50 and 75 public PoHate raids on E'ci. Public raiding was effective enough that one of the 3 highest level guilds on the server regularly would have players show up at public raids to make quicker progess. (There was already a &quot;calendar&quot;).<br />
<br />
I did a very early killing (one of the first dozen on the server) of whoever the boss mob is in The Hole that death touches.<br />
<br />
I did a very early semi-public (you had to be known pretty well to get in) killing of Trak.<br />
<br />
Ditto Vox, Naggy, etc.<br />
<br />
I have never attended a failed public raid.<br />
<br />
I have done a very large number of pick-up Epic raids. One failed - the Royals at Chardok.<br />
<br />
My public and pick-up raidng ended when I joined larger and more capable guilds - but public raiding continued.<br />
<br />
While the success of mid-level and high level guilds has cut into both the quantity and quality of public (except on a few selct servers)  and pick-up raids..........<br />
<br />
IF as has been contended the majority of players in EQ are not members of these guilds THEN there must be plenty of motavation and manpower to successfully organize public and guild alliance raiding.<br />
<br />
I have in fact experianced what I talked about. Not for PoP flaging or doing Rondo Smith, but on what was then pretty close to the borders of what mid high-level guilds were accomplishing.<br />
<br />
You can't make a softball league without people organizing a team and play schedule. Why would you think a raid intensive game like EQ would be so dramticly different?<br />

Just that this is how it is.<br />
<br />
It should easy to understand then why non-raiders are pissed off about it.  Particularly when at least some raiders want to poo-poo it all and claim that it isn't true.  I blame SOE for making the expansion the way it is.  I blame others for trying to portray it as no big deal that any player willing to raid can deal with it.  We don't want to raid.  If we did, we would.  Pretty easy, isn't it?<br />
<br />
If SOE insists on catering to the raiding game the extent they obviously have, then it's pretty natural those with no interest in raiding as a primary play style aren't interested in their new products.</div></div><hr />

There's raiding in every halfway decent MMoRPG that I'm aware of with the notable exception of Ultima Online - funny how that game turned out isn't it? All players that raid don't raid 7 days a week. In FFXI Dinamus raiding isn't an everyday thing. Perhaps Doom3 will better meet your needs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BB I can see why our opinions differ, in this case. Just to give you an idea of what i've done so far, I've been on 11 failed mb attempts,  3 failed bert attemps, 2 failed agnarr attempts, 9 failed rd attempts, and 15 failed rztw attempts. The rest of them i've gotten on the first try or only failed once, i think.<br />
<br />
In the case of both MB and RD, I finally got tired of losing and had to lead the events, I'm about to get that way about RZ, but I'm not confident enough of my understanding of the event to do it yet.  <br />
<br />
While I understand losing is part of raiding, and if you did these events with a guild rather than being backflagged you may well have failed them even more than I have, the difference is that EVERY time I fail it's with a different crew of noobs, who don't know the event and try their hardest to botch everything up.<br />
<br />
I maintain that this has been a huge waste of time, and until EverQuest becomes EverRaid, I refuse to accept that it should be a required part of viable character progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ hasn't always been &quot;Raid Intensive&quot;  and doesn't have to be now. Thats why we're having this discussion. For you, EQ may be raid intensive. For me it isn't. EQ wasn't always raid intensive, and damnit I believe I have the right to choose. Obviously, I can choose to leave, but I believe there could be a better solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Bardiel,<br />
<br />
For you EQ wasn't always raid intensive. At level 46 or so I was faced with a choice - I could continue duoing with an Enchanter outside KC or play EQ.<br />
<br />
It was the group game that was a failure for me. I tried the raid game. First in public PoHate raids and then in guild raids. The difference was night and day. There was a target list, a plan for progression, fun!! Woo woo!!<br />
<br />
EQ for me became grouping AND raiding - they aren't mutually exclusive ya know.<br />
<br />
Do you suppose you could find like minded players and take on only those raid targets actually needed to advance a little further to get some better loot or a flag or an Epic?<br />
<br />
Sound too complicated? Do you have your Epic? How did you get it? There's always been parts of the Epic you could do with a group and other parts that you needed to do with a raid. Pretty darned good quest to send you so many places and teach you fundamental things about EQ.<br />
<br />
One needn't raid all the time. EQ needn't be raid intensive. However just like your Epic, there are some things it takes a raid to do ocassionly. It's not as if Verant/SoE owed you an Epic was it?<br />
<br />
There's a path at least to Ikkinz that can be done just grouping, however it isn't going to get you to everyplace you might get to in the game.<br />
<br />
You could also choose to only solo, but that's not going to get you everywhere either. Although that's what I did when I first played - EQ wasn't always about groups ya know. Of course by level 12, I finally realized grouping was more efficient and I chose to do it.<br />

No, it wasn't raid always raid intensive for ANYONE you retard.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember there being only 2 raid mobs and 2 raid zones in original EQ, and that carried on thru Kunark.  That's nowhere near the ~50% of content that's being aimed at you fucks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">It wasn't always group oriented either. I soloed to level 12. But it sure seemed like 90% of the content was group intensive.<br />

<br />
I won't play Ultima Online and neither apparently will most people. You woulda loved it - no raiding.<br />
<br />
50%? You want to list the zones in GoD where you can group and the zones where you can only kill mobs with a 54 person raid? Besides chief, if you don't raid why do you care? All you need is enough zones to group in. I think there's plenty of both.<br />
<br />
nm, I'll try to list them myself but I might make some mistakes<br />
Can group -<br />
Natimbi, Ferubi, Barindu, Qimini, Riwwi, Sewers 1, Sewers 2, Sewers 3, Vxed, Tipt, Kod'Taz, Ikkinz Singular Might, Ikkinz Twin Struggles, Ikkinz Tri-Fates, Yxtta but mostly a raid zone, still a useful off any mob drop<br />
<br />
Raid only<br />
Yxtta see above, Ikkinz 1, Ikkinz 2, Ikkinz 3, Uqua, Qvic, Inktu'Ta, Txevu<br />
<br />
Most of the raid zones are get through them and get everyone flagged and hope you never see them again zones. Not strictly speaking places where you want to raid and farm named mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Battleblade, your basic argument at this point is raid or leave.  We've already made it clear we have no intention of raiding as a primary function.  Ergo, you'd like us to leave.  Perhaps you're right and now is the right time to leave EQ for something different.  But, do you really think SoE is keen on the idea of you telling their customers to suck it up or get out?  Do you really think they'll make no attempt to retain people like Haass, Gerick, Partha, myself and others that see the game the way we do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Each of you has a progression path that only involves doing that content you prefer.<br />
<br />
I think SoE prefers players to have fun, a role, and a distinct reason to play a unique class in all environments - solo, group, and raid.<br />
<br />
If you CHOOSE to throw away a significant portion of the game, it's not SoE's responsibility to eliminate raiding and raid content.<br />
<br />
Looking at the flagging requirements yet again, I realize even players who choose to never, not even once, raid in GoD will be able to see most of the content.<br />
<br />
I don't care if you choose to group. I care if you fabricate stuff about zones you've never experianced and try your hardest to convince non-raiders there's nothing for them whatsoever in GoD.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to argue like Paladins did that Vxed and Tipt are still too hard, feel free. Maybe SoE will adjust them once again. But if you argue 5000HP Warriors can't do them, I'll tell Gerick to gear up - the gear, the augments, and Sturdyness AA 500HP's is already in the game.<br />

<br />
Now most mobs were easy but a few had some massive damage spikes.. Nearly lethal. <br />

Now I know I have good gear. My shaman has ok gear I guess. Still not full ornate. I would kill for ornate Chain boots :) <br />

But I can't beleive that a GROUP of 6 can't kill the mobs I was faster easier. And more effectively. True the Ferubi mobs get worse as you head in and I stayed Safe. (Zone in)<br />

<br />
 And considering that in classic EQ, that wasn't the case, in Kunark that wasn't the case, in Velious that wasn't the case, in Luclin that wasn't the case - a strong point could be made that part of the original game that made it popular WAS the idea that one could see most of the content. It's troubling to those of us who were around to see the gradual shift away from actual continents where you could go to all but one zone just by playing everyday. Gearing up was a necessity, but it wasn't a breakpoint - you could still do Velious mobs in Crafted, if you wanted to.<br />
<br />
 PoP I consider an aberration BECAUSE it was specifically targeted to the 46+ population. In fact, it was a good expansion to give people 'elbow room' again. Casuals like me for example didn't even mind the tiers and progressions simply because we were still viable tanks at the content we could access (Tier 1 and the occasional Tier 2/3). LDoN increased that power for lower levels, albeit at a MUCH longer progression rate.<br />
<br />
 However, it's pretty clear that despite the fact that you CAN do some stuff casually in GoD, it's a small minority of the expansion unless you're geared almost exactly as well as a raider, which is something that most casuals aren't. The AA's, as has been mentioned, were tuned with raider XP rates in mind. (Read: EP xp groups.) Once again, you've gone from expansions with a small number of locked/keyed zones to an expansion with half of the zones locked/keyed to past progression, and tuned to hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
 No one has talked about getting rid of raiding. We'd simply like (I know I would) to go back to the original model - with instancing now, it should be cake to do. Lock one or two zones. Make them obviously 'raiding guild only' material. Leave the rest of the content to decide who can do it, not a Dev.<br />
<br />
 EDIT - had to address this post.<br />
<br />
 You can complain about it or you can just say That I can go over HERE instead.  <br />
<br />
 Of course, part of the well noted problem is that when the hardcore raider isn't doing his hardcore raids, he's off over HERE farming stuff trivially most folks still need multiple groups for. He's taking not only the content aimed at him, but the content aimed for people below him too.</div></div><hr />

It is one thing to have an &quot;advantage&quot; that you've earned.  It's something else again to have that &quot;advantage&quot; become the &quot;bare minimum' necesary to be considered viable.  You're probably right that a group could kill faster in Ferubi, if the tank can take the damage.  You talk about your monk having good gear, how good of gear are we talking about?  How much AC and HP do you have?  Because if you're pretty uber geared, how can you say that's representive of anything except what an uber geared monk with a shaman bot can accomplish?<br />
<br />
Raiders make a big deal about &quot;earning this&quot; and &quot;earning that&quot;.  I make a big deal about being allowed to play the game, even new expansions.  If they're going to provide new expansions they can either make it challenging for the masses, make it challenging for the uber geared, or provide the masses just enough gear that they can hack it while still making it somewhat of a challenge for the uber geared.  Right now it appears to be far more fairly tuned for the uber geared than for the masses.<br />
<br />
Okay, that means the masses aren't getting much value out of GOD.  And you don't think we should be bothered by that?  And that we shouldn't try and find a resolution for that?  I suppose when you can duo in Ferubi with your shammy bot you probably don't see the problem.</div></div><hr />

Frankly, personally I don't care a whole lot about EP access. I'm almost there, and it was a pain in the ass, but so be it. I DO think with the advent of open zerg raiding it's a pointless roadblock however.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind LDoN being more points per run, particularly for hards. I see no reason for 0 risk to have a decent reward while &quot;some risk&quot; (aka hard adventures) barely can attain the same rate of points if you never lose.

EQ caught on for what ever reason. However to argue raiding didn't contribute to it's increasing player base is probably wildly inaccurate. <br />
<br />
Flatworld games (everyone more of less equal and no raiding) like Ultima Online have all done terribly. Even FFXI which tries to minimize raiding ends up with players either grinding loot or grinding experiance. I know about 20 players doing FFXI and they ALL are just waiting for a game that doesn't suck to be released.<br />
<br />
You fib heavily, but I doubt that you do it knowingly. As a raider I did mobs you didn't see in a group for a very long time almost continuously from the time PoHate, PoFear, Vax and Naggy came out through every expansion.<br />
<br />
I haven't raided 3-6 days a week for 4 years because there hasn't traditionally been a humungeous pile of raid content in the game. That's propaganda.<br />
<br />
I won't sit grinding loot and experiance in a group any more. I barely log in for the group game - it's boring, it's always been boring. Wait, sometimes it's been tedious, I forgot the good times when it was tedious.<br />
<br />
They put out another LDoN and I know I'm gone. I fully expect to see GoD's end expansion content. And there better be more - lots more.<br />
<br />
Did I mention that they better put a whole lot of time, effort, and care in it? Higher end guilds are not all that happy with GoD. Not too many NPC models, the raids tend to be linear, the itemization is not well thought out, there are only 2-5 named max in a raid zone.... They need to make a very serious effort.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you, Haas, Gerick etc. couldn't use some more content here, but let's be honest - I've seen the Magelo's. Given that 7500 HP's unbuffed before even reaching the EP's is possible, y'all haven't even come close to finishing the content you've got.<br />
<br />

<br />
 I'm actually not sure about that, BB. After all, Classic EQ was never billed as '72 of your best friends and you' - GROUPING was the focus. It may have contributed to people staying, but not joining. I don't think any of us would have predicted PoP from even Velious, which at the time was the MOST seperating expansion ever. I mean, my gods, you had to be 35 to use the zones! I remember large arguments in DA about buying it for just that reason. <br />

 CoH is doing well atm, but point semi-taken. After all, who knows how much longer they'll be on the next guaranteed panacea? Some folks will never be satisfied by ANY MMORPG.<br />
<br />

<br />
 Let's put it this way: Nothing could have stopped me with enough time from gaining the levels and the gear to go into Sol or doing giants in Permafrost. In fact, I went to just those places. There was no sign on the door saying 'Bring 36+ or you can't go.' Nor was there any key needed for these places. You didn't have to kill a raid mob just to see the zone. If you were particularly suicidal, you could even get a gander at these mobs.<br />
<br />
 Key is, the CONTENT decided who was going to kill the mobs. Not a Dev. Not a key, or a door, or a flag. The mob itself.<br />
<br />
I haven't raided 3-6 days a week for 4 years because there hasn't traditionally been a humungeous pile of raid content in the game. That's propaganda.<br />
<br />
 The first raid ever on Brell was done by Minute Manaslayer. He told me the story of his uber raid to kill a griffon. He remembers using 3 or 4 Paladins in a LoH rotation to try and kill that thing. They failed. Nowadays a kiting class can take one in their low 20's. Same thing goes with every other mob in the game that's not behind a door or a flag. At some point the casuals get to do what you can do now. Well, until PoP. And PoP, as I pointed out, WAS an exception. And GoD, simply because it PRESUMES PoP to do most of it.<br />
<br />
I won't sit grinding loot and experiance in a group any more. I barely log in for the group game - it's boring, it's always been boring. Wait, sometimes it's been tedious, I forgot the good times when it was tedious.<br />
<br />
They put out another LDoN and I know I'm gone. I fully expect to see GoD's end expansion content. And there better be more - lots more. Did I mention that they better put a whole lot of time, effort, and care in it? GoD has a lot of cookie cutter zones and mobs in it. I think raid zones and mobs done like some of the best in the game will be needed.<br />
<br />
 Okay, now we've come down to the nitty gritty. You don't like the XP game or the group game. You like the raid game.<br />
<br />
 WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT. What we want YOU to understand is that there's a great deal of us in here who don't or can't invest the time, and we've seen the game go from one where the group was paramount to one where you need the raid to do more than a fraction of the expansion's content.<br />
<br />
 What you don't remember is that once the raiders have moved on, the casuals end up doing it too, some time after them. Sure, I couldn't do Hate with DA back in the day - I can now, if I want to. I've tanked in all the old planes but Growth, and the only reason I never did that one was too many damn Elf Druids in the guild. I've tanked in Velious, everything I've come across up to the permafarmed names. I've tanked in Luclin, even in Ssra helping people get key parts. I've tanked mobs all the way up to/including Tactics, although I've never even casually tried for the flagging, even the stuff I know I can do. Did I do it at the same time as you? Hell no. And that's ok, as long as it's there to be done at a later date.<br />
<br />
Save the cookie cutter zones for the groupies. 90% of them just grind anyway. <br />
<br />
 No, because both playstyles should be valid and enjoyable. THIS is the crux of the problem - too many people are forced to the 'cookie cutter zones' for gear to move on. They're living on hardtack, and you're telling them that they should have hardtack and fucking like it so you can keep your caviar. Ideally the 'groupies' shouldn't have caviar, but they should have spaghetti and pizza and chicken and beef stew too, because hardtack, even if you LIKE hardtack, gets old after the first couple of years. And giving them those menu options doesn't mean you can't have your caviar, either, or it shouldn't. Don't force people to choose between your playstyle and moving on - you're no more a majority than I am. That's setting yourself up for a loss.<br />
<br />
 And if I see groupies struting about in gear as good as mine after killing their 3000 moss snakes, I'm all done too. <br />
<br />
 Somehow, I doubt the gear in EP for example is 'as good as mine', especially since you're well into the GoD progression. And, of course, your definition of 'moss snake' has probably changed over the course of YOUR progression too.  ;) <br />
<br />
Do you suppose 100 raiding guilds quitting EQ simultainiously might effect EQ's viability when the gaming news magazines and Ezines found out?<br />
<br />
With Afterlife, Reconstructed, FoH and I don't know how many other high end guilds jumping ship, I doubt SoE will intentionally see if they can acelerate the trend. Don't think for one moment raiding guilds are all that happy with GoD. SoE will need to do much better to retain us. The original game model you lust for won't nearly do. PoTime isn't even really all that good. We need elaborate zones like ToV - phases/stages bite.<br />
<br />
 Actually, I wonder what percentage left not because of GoD but because WoW is impending. Even eating caviar for multiple years every day gets old, too. Regardless -<br />
<br />
 I agree. Now that they have the ability, through instancing, to make raid zones not require unlocking to access, that they can instead make the content difficult for raiding guilds and impossible for casuals, without the need for hoop jumping to see even half of the content if you ARE casual. They can't make expansions any more for just one group and not the other - is it any wonder that the alltime favorites for people (Kunark and Velious) are also the two that had bucketloads of content for both groups? And that LoY and GoD, two that had restrictions on the content for one of the two groups, are the most hated?<br />
<br />
 EDIT - Dammit, man, quit adding stuff afterwards!  :p <br />
<br />
I'm not saying you, Haas, Gerick etc. couldn't use some more content here, but let's be honest - I've seen the Magelo's. Given that 7500 HP's unbuffed before even reaching the EP's is possible, y'all haven't even come close to finishing the content you've got. <br />
<br />
 Well, no, honestly, I haven't. Part of it's guildies not wanting to go. Part of it's the timeframe needed to go, or the numbers requirements. (VT, perfect example of this.) Part of it is that, as I've mentioned before, raiders not only take their content, they also come back again and again and again and again for content they left long ago - it puts a crimp in progression when they keep mobs permakilled.  :D  Part of it is also my lifestyle - second shift sucks for raiding, especially pickup raids.<br />
<br />
 Thing is, though, is that content is still waiting for me. It's not behind an artificial barrier, the only things stopping me from killing it are other players or my own bad play. The EP's don't exist to me, frankly - I wouldn't consider them at all if GoD hadn't been tuned for EP tanks.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy your VL personality too much to post what I think.<br />
<br />
I'l leave it at if SoE changes things to be supportive of casual players that only group while being scrupulously fair to every other player based on all their accomplishments and effort then I'll have no problem.<br />
<br />
If they decide to give you a 150 stroke handicap because I play scratch and you play like whale drek (because of personal circumstances or choices), I'll be annoyed. This is not golf - you don't deserve a 150 stroke handicap.<br />
the alltime favorites for people (Kunark and Velious)<br />
Hated both. Far and away PoP was the best expansion ever - it's not even close. Hopefully they up the level cap to 100 someday or you'll decide to raid and discover that I'm understating how much better it is than all other expansions. They should never change the flags. Legendary content shouldn't be disfigured.<br />
<br />
Actually when they lowered the key requirements for BoT, casual players got a taste. Some of the rest is even better. Why do you think 3-8 guilds per server are doing all those flags?<br />
<br />
GoD is almost second, but it's not attractive to look at, itemization in some raid zones is awful,  and some of the raids are harder than pulling nails with your eyelids.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Agree with you on the stroke thing, but on the other hand, if the idea is to build a golf course that the most people will plunk down their money to play on, you have to make a course that allows the average golfer to play and feel successful - you can't make money on a public golf course if you build all the holes to be challenging to Ernie Els and Tiger Woods.<br />
<br />
 And as far as the removing of BoT flags, I can just imagine the screaming about GoD if Ornate wasn't even available in the Bazaar at under 200k a bracer.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">:cool: Well this is why I keep raising the possiblily of alt-Keying ToSoRo. It makes more Ornate mold droppers available, but it also exposes some early flag mobs that probably shouldn't be exposed.<br />
<br />
In truth, I think casuals will be able to open up some of these zones by selective raiding once there are a lot of 70's around. One thing might well lead to another and a logjam which IS perhaps a bit too severe will be eased.<br />
<br />
Golfwise, I don't think its in SoE's interest to build a par 4 public course. I think they need to build a world class golf course and have the players enjoy the fact thaey they aren't using the short tee, but playing it just like Tiger Woods - they aren't in competition with him.<br />

<br />
Why is this a problem? Well actually it isn't except for SOE.<br />
<br />
Raiding as an end game is SO much better than the make your own fun PvP endgames of Lineage2 or DAoC. (btw this is the main thing I don't get about the &quot;non-raiders&quot; complaints... do you know how crappy the alternatives are... do you realise that every other game except FFXI has an end-game where you need to stop just single grouping too?)<br />
<br />
The problem is that raiding as an end game takes far more resources and so SOE has difficulty making enough content for the raiding and for making the non-raiding game (which raiders take part in too) fulfilling aswell.<br />
<br />
But still raiding end-game &gt; all others I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">After 73 pages and a lot of good points from every angle, I'm going to have agree. Level 70 will make a bunch of the problems go away. Player stuck behind the curve with PoP, and by virtue, GoD will be able to catch up very fast to full-tame raiders. Full-time raiders will be beating their head against the wall with new content in OoW while the rest are grinding level 70 and new AAs, running flag raids and loot runs in PoP with the already known strats and tactics coupled with higher level spells and abilities. I think the level increase will by unlike any other in the history of EQ, casuals are going to be on turbo mode, seeing and doing more than what was previosly possible with the flag and loot requirments in PoP/GoD.<br />
<br />
I can't actually think of any of the main issues listed in this thread that won't be addressed by increasing player levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Adding levels to the game, eventhough it may solve some problems with the casual player advancing in the current game, does not address the core problems of the game.<br />
<br />
As I see it, the developers need to consider alternative paths to reach the end game of any expansion.  The raid approach should always be the fastest way to progress through the content; however, having an alternative way to reach the end game of expansion with a maximum of 2-3 groups should be in place as well.  This must be a longer path then the raid path (in time) but one that is achievable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Welp, there's plenty of content you can only access or progress through in the single-group environment.  LDoN and GoD got that right.  So I don't see why there shouldn't be content you can only access or progress through in a raid environment; it's okay to have two different paths.<br />
<br />
It's also okay to have haves and have-nots, we aren't communists.<br />
<br />
Single-group encounters before GoD didn't really require any particular strategy or knowledge of technique.  GoD changed that; we have single-group encounters that you need to figure out, and in some cases, die a whole load of times figuring out... and the rewards are appropriate to the risk imo.<br />
<br />
The raider has one progression path.  The casual has another one (LDoN).  GoD stuff provided a progression path for the non-casual non-raider, and personally I was pretty happy with it.  The feeling of walking into Ikkinz for the first time and getting pwned so hard it felt like an old-school Fear break was fantastic.  :)<br />
<br />
Ceiling's too low, though, and Ikkinz ought to scale as I said... working up from trial 1 (a bit tougher than KT/Yxxta) through to trial 3 (about as hard as trial 1 is now).<br />
<br />
I think trying to hang onto the PoP progression path is silly, frankly.  I mean, you wouldn't expect a young guild nowadays to go through two dozen ToV clearings, two dozen ST clearings, and Seru/VT; that's old outdated content which can be skipped.  With level 70, the EP's are going to go the same way that NToV did, so it's time to open them up as an xp zone for non-raiders.<br />
<br />
Were I a SoE dev, I'd devote a bit more time to creating challenging and interesting instanced single-group content.  That content will be used by raiders soon, non-casual non-raiders fairly soon, and casuals eventually, so there's a great deal of reusability.  I'm hoping OoW has plenty of instanced single-group content which they've really thought about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually this is wrong about DAOC. DAOC has plenty of grpable content and raids up to over 100 people (Caer Sidi with the mob Apocolypse even before I left). They just started 2.5 years behind and frankly people look to the grping and raiding to augment the PvP raiding that is the focus of the main end-game. There is in fact a RPS named Gaheris that is like FV but lets you play like 45 classes. And frankly their AI in some of their encounters is far superior to EQ. The problem is lack of absolute depth relative to EQ due to time and focus. That and their lastest buggy expansion (ToA), go figure. They also tried to make the &quot;casuals&quot; into raiders and got crushed as a result (ToA instituted trials that took raids but that were essential to endstate progression). In short they jamed a hardcore raid playstyle not only on non-raiders but also casual raiders.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Shadow, you have to have raid gear to do it in the first place, that is NOT a two way street.<br />
<br />
I can tell you from personal experience that this is false.  Even for warriors it's false, let alone other classes (who indubitably have an easier time on the gear upgrade ladder).<br />
<br />
When GoD came out, I made friends with a warrior who hadn't seriously raided since early Luclin.  He had the best of bazaar gear plus maybe 15k LDoN points worth of stuff.  Another friend was an enchanter.  All three of us were ex-raiders (in fact, all three of us were ex-raid guild leaders from much earlier in EQ's life cycle) - but our early EQ raiding stuff was entirely superseded by ornate, LDoN stuff and LDoN High Risk drops.<br />
<br />
The only thing we really had over most casual players was a whole lot of /played time from the earlier days of EQ and the attitude that comes with it - i.e. being able to die a dozen times to the same encounter, keep good humour, and come back to try it again a slightly different way.<br />
<br />
The three of us made a chat channel and chugged through the GoD trials, replacing a lot of our stuff as we went.  (I still remember how it felt when, the first time we did a Sewers trial, a 45/33 2hb dropped - in an experience group!  Some beastlord won it and he got quite emotional.)<br />
<br />
We were in Kod Taz well before they made the trials easier.  It was more about getting a regular group of people who knew what they were doing than having uber gear in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">After reading all this I guess the conclusion I would come to is that with a regular group of friends that is committed to advancement in GoD it's very possible, although difficult, to progress with nothing more than bazaar/LDoN gear.  <br />

With pickup groups, it's much more difficult, if not impossible, simply because people are not doing pickup groups in GoD at present, and those that are will not be likely to accept a undergeared warrior that they don't know in anything difficult.</div></div><hr />

The EP's are either going to be progression content into a PoTime that players still judge to be worthwhile - in which case, lowering the bar beyond that which occurs naturally through mudflation is not fair<br />
<br />
OR Like Seru/VT/Ssra, the EP's/PoTime will be seen as content which can be skipped.<br />
<br />
One can't in effect have it both ways - &quot;it's such great content that they should make it easy to get into.&quot;<br />
<br />
The quest to get into VT still remains the quest. If that's too much for your guild to handle compared with the reward, why you don't see it.<br />
<br />
GoD has just barely begun to make one group content a &quot;challange&quot;. Groups are certanly not entitled to the same endgame as guilds,<br />
<br />
I suppose my thinking goes like this - there's an epic story of a company of adventurers (guild) that overcame (the list of 40-50 accomplishments) and killed Quarm.<br />
<br />
By the time 6- players can accomplish each and every thing the guild did, Quarm is very old news indeed - much like killing Rumblecrush with a group is today after doing the PoTime flags. Sure, that's the same endgame, &lt;shrug&gt;.<br />
<br />
Alternately all that effort 100 players, 50 accomplishments a years' effort scales down to a group's capabilities and needs and groups get an alternate end - they kill an open zone single-groupable mob that any group can reach, Hooray!<br />

Everyone knows 2-boxing a Cleric doesn't just allow you to PL (I don't, a BIG mistake early in my career IMO). Having a regular experiance group helps. Anytime you can find other like minded player that want to advance you CAN advance more quickly. That's what a regular experiance group and *gasp* a guild is all about.<br />
<br />
Run around EQ not forging social bonds and not working with others and you will not achieve the optimal result.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Battle, I have more social bonds than you care to know the thing is they are not all 65, out of the 669 players in my guild(270ish single people, not counting alts) I personally know and care for close to 100 people.<br />
<br />
Here is the thing tho, they are not all 65, they are not here to serve me, and you know what? that does not bug me in the least but how am I to progress without leaving my guild? I really can not do anything but rely on pick up raids and groups which is what I have been doing for the past year.<br />
<br />
I never had a problem with it up til now, and the reason for that is most players wont let me tank for them, and even more refuse to step foot in GoD because of the lack of graveyard, soul binders and a zone out that you can sit at LFG without fear of trains. (brillant move sony, lets make the zone in/zone out a soul binder and make train city the only half way decent spot to wait for a group)<br />
<br />
most days I load up on invis potions and make my way to ferubi, berindu and riwwi and check to see if I can get a spot, then after waiting an hour (if I have no success) I check out LDoN, and if that is a no go, then I do BoT and wait for pickup raids, I have never been above traveling, but plenty people are above letting a 5khp try tanking working for them :(<br />
<br />
Thing is I can't leave my guild, it would break my heart to abandon so many people that depend on me as a tank and a friend, but I can't grow stagnant eather because stagnation drives me NUTS<br />
<br />
Something needs to be done to make the player base spread to some of the GoD zones and also get more players into sol ro, that would help the game alot.<br />
<br />
Sol ro for when you have a few hours you want to make count, GoD when you want to go after some upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Nice of you to chime in with your vaunted opinion.  Haven't seen you saying much of anything except to throw out little barbs now and again.  Nice to know you care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">The EP's are either going to be progression content into a PoTime that players still judge to be worthwhile - in which case, lowering the bar beyond that which occurs naturally through mudflation is not fair<br />
<br />
OR Like Seru/VT/Ssra, the EP's/PoTime will be seen as content which can be skipped.<br />
<br />
One can't in effect have it both ways - &quot;it's such great content that they should make it easy to get into.&quot;<br />
<br />
The quest to get into VT still remains the quest. If that's too much for your guild to handle compared with the reward, why you don't see it.<br />
<br />
GoD has just barely begun to make one group content a &quot;challange&quot;. Groups are certanly not entitled to the same endgame as guilds,<br />
<br />
I suppose my thinking goes like this - there's an epic story of a company of adventurers (guild) that overcame (the list of 40-50 accomplishments) and killed Quarm.<br />
<br />
By the time 6- players can accomplish each and every thing the guild did, Quarm is very old news indeed - much like killing Rumblecrush with a group is today after doing the PoTime flags. Sure, that's the same endgame, &lt;shrug&gt;.<br />
<br />
Alternately all that effort 100 players, 50 accomplishments a years' effort scales down to a group's capabilities and needs and groups get an alternate end - they kill an open zone single-groupable mob that any group can reach, Hooray!<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Damn cant stay away. BB I agree, but dont expect me to buy the next expansions just to be able to play the last 2. That is simply not fair and not a valid business model (I strongly believe that time will validate this thought).<br />
<br />
 If you dont design content that the average player can get then I doubt the carrot of 70 will be enough for many, but rather a decision point that some will conclude means its time to go.<br />
<br />
So you can have OoW with 50% non-raid content doable by decently equipped non-raiders or you can have 90% raider and open the past. You cant have no new content and only the levels and expect people to pay for it. And dont tell me the task system is it. Been there done that and frankly it sucks (DAOC).<br />
<br />
In the end it all comes down to that GoD didnt offer anything to 50%+ of the players other than AAs they can afford and except in minor cases dont want anyways. And by the way, perception is everything. Cant convince the masses then it doesnt matter.<br />

All numbers like that 7K HP's buffed are pulled out of thin air player conventions. When BoT groups commonly asked Warriors how many HP's they had and the frowned when someone said 6K HP's and got cheerful when the Tanks said 7K HP's you got the idea pretty fast. Like I said, it was the commonly accepted number when I was there.<br />
<br />
Since you are in a guild, then it behooves your guildmates to support eachother. It's in their interest for Warirors to be a better MT's, the Cleric to have a deeper manapools, focus items, and FT. Being in a guild isn't a matter of sharing the same tag and having /gu filled with people saying &quot;Could someone come res me in Crushbone?&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can not logically persist in the position that yur AC, HP's, are important and SoE should do something about them if you won't.<br />
<br />
Find the proper forum and post a gear check stipulating bazaar, LDoN, group and very light raiding only - How do I improve? It won't be unansewed and you've got more than plenty of opprotunity to improve.<br />
<br />
I guess that's the real difference. At 5K HP's unbuffed, I thought, sweet there's a lot of equipment out there that will improve me instead of woe is me. BTW, I happened to be in a four month period of guildlessness at the time and there was no LDoN.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />

Open raids don't encourage good raiding (in most cases), they are zerg fests instead. People get flagged  that should never get flagged, just by being on at the right time, showing up and sitting around. Entry quests would be a FAR better filter of quality players into the EP's at this point in time then the current system, IMO.<br />
<br />
Okay, so I lied when I said I wouldn't post again on this thread.<br />
<br />
What you say is certainly true of most open raids.  However, the ones on my server were pretty much run like a guild.  Except that the individuals were members of several guilds, or no guilds.  <br />
<br />
There was a raid leader.  There was actually a group of 3 or 4 raid leaders.  There is a discussion board on scheduled raids and rules and regulations of the &quot;alliance&quot;.  If you violate the rules, you are not invited back.  Simple as that.<br />
<br />
If you do not do your job on the raid, or if you disobey what the raid leader says, you will be dropped from the raid.  <br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, there was one other nice thing.  If you don't show up on time, expect to be left behind.  Most guilds aren't that brutal about it.  Kinda refreshing actually.<br />
<br />
The organization (or lack thereof) of an open raid is what we make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>beeafraid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">I'd say out of all those mains we have maybe.... 30 65's, and 20 45-64's<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Most of us in this thread know exactly where you are coming from Gerick.  We've all been in a guild we liked very much and thought we'd be playing in it until we stopped playing EQ.  But the reality is that very few of us started in a guild at lvl 5 and stayed with that guild till lvl 65, and are in that same guild raiding Time.<br />
<br />
The sad truth is, the guilds that are raiding Time (or GoD zones) have pretty much always required you to be at the highest available lvl in order to apply.  In order to do this, people have to leave the guilds they grew up in.  So the &quot;uber&quot; guilds are essentially parasites on lower guilds.  It's an aspect of raiding guilds I've never liked.<br />
<br />
But there is a very good reason for it.  Higher end zones require a commitment that requires higher end guilds.  When you have a guild that has people from lvl 5 to 65 you do not have a cohesive unit for raiding.  <br />
<br />
You've got some people who are very casual and that's all they ever want to be.  And even though they claim that is the case, watch how offended they are when you routinely go raid in zones they can't play in (either because they can't enter, or shouldn't be caught dead in). <br />
<br />
You've got other people who want to charge after everything the game's got to offer.  And unless they are making significant progress towards Plane of Time, they won't be happy.  If you want to piss these people off, go raid Kael once a week for a year.  They won't stay in your guild long.<br />
<br />
You've got still others that are in between and aren't sure what they want.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, you can't work with that.  And so family guilds work great... as long as that's all they ever try to be.  Try to turn a family guild into a raiding guild and you will have significant problems.  The same problems you are describing.<br />
<br />
I have been in 4 guilds total on my primary EQ server.  I still have good friends from all 4 guilds.  I routinely help them with quests, help with epics when I can, group with them when I can, etc.  It's not really different than being in the same guild, except that they are moving at their pace and I am moving at mine.<br />
<br />
You may choose not to move on and that's great! <br />
<br />
Ultimately, Sony makes a convenient target to pin all this on, but IMO, the problems we are discussing have more to do with human nature than with game design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>beeafraid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Something from an earlier post I'd like to clarify.  I said that you need elemental lvl gear to survive in GoD.  In my mind that is true.  However, I was referring to GoD progression.  Not just playing in GoD.<br />
<br />
If you want to kill turtles in Natimbi, or go to Qinimi and kill mobs, you certainly can.  If you want to go tradeskill in Abysmal Sea (which I highly recommend), obviously you can.  If you want to go to the sewers and do groups there, those mobs are very easy and you can do that.  All those things in GoD can be done without eplane equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
But if you want to kill Smith Rondo, it will require a raid.  And at least some of the people on that raid will need to be well equipped. <br />
<br />
And even though the vexd and tipt trials are one group encounters, if you go there as a tank and you are not eplane-lvl geared, you might want to be prepared to fail... a lot.  Can it be done, yes.  But it will take you to the very time limits of the trial and you will likely be receiving a lot of rezzes.  And you will likely be spending hours getting to the boss mob only to have him chew you up and spit you out.  Some classes can get by in tipt and vexd without good equipment.  Tanks can't.<br />
<br />
But then, the whole point of doing vexd and tipt is to get to to be flagged for Kod'Taz.  And the primary point of Kod'Taz is that it is the entry point for Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
And Ikkinz is primarily a raiding area.  So why bother with tipt and vexd if you don't plan to raid?<br />
<br />
Which brings my to my primary point.<br />
<br />
I mentioned this on a previous post but it was ignored.  People are complaining about eplane access because 1) They want the nice drops that can be sold for good money in the bazaar, and 2) They want the nice gear that drops in the eplanes so they can play in zones like GoD.<br />
<br />
Sounds great but there are two problems:<br />
<br />
1)  The reason the items in the eplanes are expensive is largely because a small percentage of the server population can get them.  Open the zone up, and the price comes down.  On our server, there are a lot of guilds getting eplane access righ now.  The prices on several items have plumeted.  For instance, stonewood saps used to go for around 5k. Now its around 1-1.5k and they don't sell fast at that.  It's still not bad money for an item that drops off trash.  But what happens when the zone is opened up further?<br />
<br />
2 and most importantly)  People are saying they don't want to have to raid in order to reach eplanes.  But the fact is, if you want the nice armor drops in the eplanes, you will have to raid.  Trash mobs don't drop elemental breastplate molds.  It would be nice.... but it doesn't happen.  As a matter of fact, even raid lvl eplane mobs don't drop elemental greaves molds (except maybe on very rare occasions - which I haven't witnessed).  Those drop in Time.  And Time cannot be done with a group.  It requires a raid of at least 3 groups.<br />
<br />
So what you are asking for isn't really just revamping the entrance requirements of the eplane zones.  You are also asking them to go back and redesign the zones to include content that doesn't currently exist.  That could happen I guess, but if Sony was in the habit of fixing old zones, the trees in Greater Faydark wouldn't be two-dimensional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was possibly true before they made the trials easier, but really, both Tipt and Vxed are all about your group makeup and choice of technique.<br />
<br />
Give me a group of Enchanter/Enchanter/Enchanter/Ranger/Cleric/Warrior and I'll complete either trial in under 2 hours - and I don't care what the tank's gear is like.<br />
<br />
But then, the whole point of doing vexd and tipt is to get to to be flagged for Kod'Taz. And the primary point of Kod'Taz is that it is the entry point for Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
For the non-casual non-raider, Tipt is worth doing because you can augment your LDON breastplate to +200hp just by farming the Enraged Maternal Cragbeast, and because of the chance of picking up a 42ac 135hp bracer.  Vxed is well worth doing for a variety of items which can fill gear gaps.<br />
<br />
Once you've completed Tipt, you get simultaneously flagged for Kod`Taz, Yxxta, and Ikkinz.  Kod`Taz is worth farming just for the 140hp mask which drops off yard trash - particularly because that mask has a type 8 augment slot rather than type 7, which is valuable to the non-raider.<br />
<br />
The named in Kod and Yxxta drop more hp augments and loot roughly equivalent to phase 1/phase 2 of Time, and it's well worth doing for the non-raider.<br />
<br />
And Ikkinz is primarily a raiding area. So why bother with tipt and vexd if you don't plan to raid?<br />
<br />
Ikkinz is also an area where you can get EP/Time-equivalent loot with a single group.<br />
<br />
The reason the items in the eplanes are expensive is largely because a small percentage of the server population can get them. Open the zone up, and the price comes down.<br />
<br />
This is, indeed, the point.  Thank you for recognizing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I do Tipt quite a lot.  In fact I did it just yesterday.  And yes, it was harder before the &quot;correction&quot;.  But mobs still tear through your hit points very quickly there.  So quickly that clerics rarely have time for complete heals.  They have to cast fast heals, which obviously cost more mana. <br />
<br />
If the warrior doesn't have many hit points (i.e. elemental quality gear), the cleric will use more mana.  If the cleric doesn't have a deep mana pool (i.e. elemental quality gear) then they will be out of mana a lot.  <br />
<br />
Yes, Tipt can be done like that, but it will require more med breaks, which puts the group in more danger of repop because Tipt doesn't have that many safe med spots.<br />
<br />
And yes I know there are good drops there and it is great xp and all that.  That's part of the reason I don't mind when a guildy asks for help there.  <br />
<br />
And yes, Kod'Taz is a great place to group and has nice drops of its own.  But again, the mobs go through your hit points like butter.  <br />
<br />
And as far as the price coming down goes, yes if you want to make items from the drops thats good.  If you are planning on making a fortune selling them, that's bad.  I guess it depends on your perspective.  But regardless of your motivation, the prices are already coming down... at least on my server.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm still using the LDON breastplate myself.  And yes, I do hope to get some of those augments.  I have one or two of the augments from there now.  Still one slot open on bp.  I've seen a link floating around where someone really blew the stats on it up with hp and ac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uber or not uber isn't really the issue.  Time flagged or not isn't the issue.  Raiding vs. non-raiding (or perhaps semi-raiding - a guild in transition) is.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that it's only the time enabled guilds doing this.  I'm saying that any &quot;raiding guild&quot; (one that raids almost every night and expects its members to be on for almost every raid), regardless of how &quot;uber&quot; it is, will take players away from guilds that are lower level than it is.  Sometimes, the lower lvl guild is still a raiding guild that just hasn't progressed as far.  Almost all raiding guilds, regardless of how far they have progressed, currently require lvl 65 as a minimum, with a certain number  or type of AAs as minimum requirements for membership.  That means the player needs to have gotten that experience somewhere before they ever apply.<br />
<br />
I'm also not saying that it is sapping the life of the lower guilds.  But it is taking away players that they have had a part in making.  <br />
<br />
It's kind of like free agency in baseball.  A team recruits a college player and that player goes through the farm system and eventually earns a spot on the big league team.  That player learns a lot from his existing team.  That team recognized talent in the player when perhaps no other team did.  It grooms the player into a real asset.  <br />
<br />
Then the player's contract is up.  The player decides he wants to find out what his value is on the market.  He gets a better deal and moves on (usually to the damn Yankees).<br />
<br />
His previous team isn't decimated, but there is no question that the new team is benefitting from experience he learned from the old team.  And the old team no longer is.<br />
<br />
It happens in real life, and it happens in game too.  It will continue to happen and I understand that and I have been faced with that decision, and made the choice to move on.  But that doesn't mean it's fair to the guild left behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a lick.  <br />

 And some raiders maintain accounts and log out enmass when new expansions are released because they don't want to have to 'break' the new content, they want the drops after it becomes farmtime.<br />
<br />
 Talking about raiders as a 'core' might make sense in terms of resources invested, but given the numbers, hardcore raiders are a fraction of the total EQ population, and I'm willing to bet a higher percentage of them left upon GoD's release then casuals.<br />
<br />
 Secondly, if your idea of playing different MMORPG's means that you 'come and go as your fancy dictates' - where does that put the Afterlifes and FoH's? They just can't hack it anymore? Are THEY suddenly casuals?</div></div><hr />

This is a legitimate point, and it's clearly true the high end game has taken a big hit also.  But for different reasons.  Raiding guilds have always had more attrition.  I've sat back and watch the same guild cycle through new generations of &quot;comets&quot; - folks who level in a hurry, get flagged, geared, play obsessively and burn out in a flame.  They come, they go, and there were always bodies to plug in.  <br />
<br />
Unquestionably GoD was a fiasco, and it's ironic a raiding expansion was hated by raiding guilds.  It was mistuned and the content was not appropriate on release.  Plus, it's ugly.  <br />
<br />
But all these things effected everyone, some to more of a degree than others.  I've never seen an expansion be such a ghost town on release.  I remember folks of all stripes crowding the docks to explore Kunark and Velious.  <br />
<br />
GoD was a disaster, but the seeds for EQ's decline were planted in PoP.  <br />
<br />
PoP progression was a bad design decision.  Lots of good associated with it, but in the long run it hurt the game worse long term than anything else - including a faulty release of GoD.  Velious was released half-baked and not really finished too, and it now lives in lore as a high light in EQ.  GoD may yet have that same status, but it dug itself into a far deeper hole than Velious did.  <br />
<br />
But progression is too stilted and artificial, and overly rewards a narrow gamestyle.  If you raid just a little bit, you are vastly better off than a hardcore casual player who might &quot;work&quot; x4 times harder.  I'm a &quot;casual raider&quot; if you want to use that term.  I can't be sure really when I'm going to be on, but I like raiding, or any kind of purpose.  That's pretty much what I hope the guild is doing when I log in.  <br />
<br />
Some degree of this separation is a good thing.  Too much of a good thing is not a good thing.  <br />
<br />
EQ has a lot of problems, and a lot will be riding on OoW.  If they get it right and stop disenfranchising players, then it's fine.  If not, it will continue to wither.  <br />
<br />
What's noticeable now is the subscriptions have finally run out on accounts folks canceled some time ago.  A huge number of &quot;hardcore&quot; non-raiders left and went elsewhere.  If you can't see that, you are blind.</div></div><hr />

DX9, mis-tuning of GoD, CoH, and WoW beta all affect who continued playing and who didn't.<br />
<br />
Players didn't leave in droves during PoP. PoP's been around for 2 years - don't make up stuff. Yes, PoP has raidng content. BUT, no one says you can't pick and choose. Ever hear of LDoN?<br />
<br />
I have 1 (one each) upgrade for my BP. How many do you have. If anything the further you progress in the game, the fewer choices you have.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to say you'd like to see less linear content. It's another to say you want zones unlocked because you can't or won't do the flags. If I posted that Uqua and Ikkinzz alt-flags should be given out on the Overlord's Sanctuary so guild X could farm QVic armor, I'd be laughed right back to n00bie Town - right where I'd belong.<br />

<br />
Wrong!!! I'm one of those casuals, and I play 25-30 hours in a week. I have to be logged off before midnight though, and doing open raids that form up slow and move to the target even slower will leave me on way past my bedtime.<br />
<br />
Now if I got myself into a really good raiding guild,  the raids would go faster. There are two problems with that:<br />
<br />
1.) I play with real life friends who are even more &quot;casual&quot; than I am. I do not wish to leave them behind.<br />
<br />
2.) Any guild that could blast me into the EP's won't even talk to me because I'm not already EP flagged. They hate backflagging more than I hate &quot;forward&quot; flagging, and once you have 2 good warriors that log in every night, you don't need more.<br />
<br />
By not making serious inroads into PoP I'm already 2 expansions behind. So what happens when OoW makes mobs that hit twice as hard as GoD mobs? A GoD pickup group would laugh at my 6k unbuffed-ness now. <br />
<br />
Generally speaking I disagree with your notion that I could move straight from LDoN to GoD and be effective. There are posts here that suggest you need 8k unbuffed for some of the later  trials and raids.  You can't get to 8k without Raex's and some augments at least.  Most time-geared warriors are right at 8k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Now it's not all bleak, OoW will increase the level cap. Would all those open pickup raids that are losing to RZ at 65 start winning at 70?  So you see there really is an upgrade path that will be available about 4 months after the release of OoW when we're all level 70. I could be in Raex's next year IF us casuals can find RZ up.<br />
<br />
AHHH, now there's a very big IF. We've all seen the cockblocking/permacamping/pondscum tactics from people who's only interest is to keep others out of &quot;their&quot; zone. Our best revenge against Sony for not taking command of this issue would be canceling our accounts and moving to another game.<br />
<br />
So next time you get the urge to kill a mob just so somebody else can't, just remember you might be killing the game you love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Iyacc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Uber or not uber isn't really the issue.  Time flagged or not isn't the issue.  Raiding vs. non-raiding (or perhaps semi-raiding - a guild in transition) is.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that it's only the time enabled guilds doing this.  I'm saying that any &quot;raiding guild&quot; (one that raids almost every night and expects its members to be on for almost every raid), regardless of how &quot;uber&quot; it is, will take players away from guilds that are lower level than it is.  Sometimes, the lower lvl guild is still a raiding guild that just hasn't progressed as far.  Almost all raiding guilds, regardless of how far they have progressed, currently require lvl 65 as a minimum, with a certain number  or type of AAs as minimum requirements for membership.  That means the player needs to have gotten that experience somewhere before they ever apply.<br />
<br />
I'm also not saying that it is sapping the life of the lower guilds.  But it is taking away players that they have had a part in making.  <br />
<br />
It's kind of like free agency in baseball.  A team recruits a college player and that player goes through the farm system and eventually earns a spot on the big league team.  That player learns a lot from his existing team.  That team recognized talent in the player when perhaps no other team did.  It grooms the player into a real asset.  <br />
<br />
Then the player's contract is up.  The player decides he wants to find out what his value is on the market.  He gets a better deal and moves on (usually to the damn Yankees).<br />
<br />
His previous team isn't decimated, but there is no question that the new team is benefitting from experience he learned from the old team.  And the old team no longer is.<br />
<br />
It happens in real life, and it happens in game too.  It will continue to happen and I understand that and I have been faced with that decision, and made the choice to move on.  But that doesn't mean it's fair to the guild left behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
We don't force people to join our raiding guild. There's no way possible to do so. Many guilds don't even actively recruit. We have no need, we get app requests daily, regardless of the requirements we post or their class being open or closed. <br />
<br />
We offer something that these people obviously want. Yes, it sucks for the guild losing members, especially if a lot of effort went in to helping them reach the point where they feel that they have outgrown the guild that got them there. I've been on the receiving end of that plenty of times. It's human nature though. Some people find out that the grass is greener, and some find out the opposite.</div></div><hr />

It occurred to me tonight that the only times I've seen this much rancor and spitting - and threads this long - was over warrior aggro, and later knight tank viability in GoD.  This indicates to me that there is a significant issue, and I'm willing to bet no-one on either side has a perfect view of the whole thing.  Both of the earlier issues were eventually adressed by SoE in some fashion, and I expect that with OoW's release (not solely its content) we're gonna see little hot-gluing over the non-raider's progression path.<br />
<br />
I am willing to accept that GoD does that well now: I left before the retuning, however, and have to take it on faith. Nonetheless, it's gonna be a long while before the first impression of GoD has faded from the collective EQ mind - there is a huge bulk of players that do not track changes, or check the boards.  But when retuned content starts seeing the level 70's it was originally intended for, yer gonna see a lot more peeps there, and them that rely on pick-up groups will find a role there too.  I wish I coulda dragged more guildies there, even before the tuning there were a few scary but doable spots with decent trash drops.  And at least it was difficult content that I could survive, for as long as my group was awake.  But, overall, GoD was not gonna be any help to me without a lotta sleepwalking through LDoN, much of it with 4 unknowns, and one house dr00d frustrated by their ineptitude. ;)  And, after that, there wouldn't be blessed much that I'd have opportunity for in GoD that woulda improved the toon.  Not without ditching the guild ... 30+ hours a week of that scenario rankles quickly.<br />
<br />
When I left, I was better than I needed to be for all the content I could get to without leaving my guild; pick up raids were failing me miserably, I could not conceivably get equipped for the real meat of GoD, and the first press of OoW soundeded like PoP 2.0, and I disliked PoP for more than that I was shut out of most of it as a non-raider.  PoP was about as beneficial to me as LoY was for a strong raider (my alts liked LoY plenty, tho); I have enjoyed some of the events tho I haven't found any that pressured me greatly, or required much attention from anyone.  Just a little bit from everyone. *lol* I have no interest in looking for 5 unkowns to help me get to where I wanna be, either, and of the dozens of EQ /friends I've had, few remained after GoD.  I gather that things have changed, and I expect that to continue with OoW (I'm anticipating a GoD meets Velious approach, something along those lines.)<br />
<br />
All that story of me is there, for them that give a damn, to get a sense of how so many non-raiders who love the game and there allies in it came to feel so frustrated, shut out, and pissed off.  It's one tale, not the universal truth.<br />
<br />
Threads like these will disappear around OoW's release, if my hunch is right, otherwise players will.  This thread and its cousin, in particular, has brought some of the worst and best rhetoric I've yet seen on these boards, and a few surprises. Running thru a list in my head, about 9 of you have surprised me by how out of line you could be, and 1 of you by showing moments on non-assery betwixt all the posturing.  Plenty of snippy bitching on all sides, and a solid army of straw men; many folx getting dogmatically myopic, but all  of that will blow over no matter what happens.  My *word to the wise* is that it's likely that the dill-hole getting your goat is likely not so nutz as your impression of him tells you he is.  I've been momentarily impressed by a couple of the more annoying of y'all, disappointed by a couple of the best, and just plain flabbergasted by a couple, and none of those reactions are a complete image.  Probly the only frequent poster that has not disappointed me in either thread is Haass.  I think I actually appreciate his style more than ever!  :D<br />

EDIT :: Sidebar, largely for Battleblade :: PoP did have a huge part in my frustration, tho it had been long released by then.  I was hammering my head against its impediments, faced with a new expansion that was largely held to *require* completing PoP progression to contend with (and many said that that was long overdue at the time), and a pending expansion which gave every impression to pick up on the far side of those two expansions.  In short, I was convinced that I was fucked if I wanted to move forward in EQ, but that I would have the freedom of sitting around with my thumb up my ass for a year if I so desired. Now, it is recognized that that is not as true of GoD as it seemed at first, and details of OoW now out appear more friendly, and SoE is obviously doing a lot of groundwork for people like me now.  But then, over a year after its release, PoP became HUGE in my feeling that EQ didn't want me 'round no more.  And I certainly wasn't the only one.  It was as if GoD confirmed my suspicions about PoP, and OoW was a dark omen indeed.</div></div><hr />

Partha's right about (a number of things, including that) this is a huge issue, up there with warrior aggro; notice how the casual player issues threatened to hijack the guild summit responses too.<br />
<br />
This thread has steadily impressed me with one something: non-raiders and raiders cannot be having much contact with each other in certain cases; certainly the &quot;feel&quot; of the game is dramatically different for the two groups.<br />
<br />
When BB says the following, if I assume he's not just blowing smoke, then it makes me think that much of his view is driven by an entirely different EQ experience than mine:<br />
<br />
&quot;The casual players aren't a core. They come and go as their fancy dictates. This week it's EQ, next week it's Ultima Online, Diablo, DAoC, CoH, or WoW beta.<br />
The truth is, many casuals maintain accounts and log in enmass at the release of any new expansion and log out as soon as they've consumed the easy no effort content.<br />
Will some casuals eventually stop loging in? You bet - they've got damned near nothing invested.&quot;<br />
<br />
If I could change BB's mind about one thing, it would be these statements. Yeah, some casuals are 15 year-olds who do exactly as BB suggests, but the implication is that most casual players fit this description. But another category of more respectable casual players (and far more casual than most of the posters here) are indeed a significant portion of the playerbase. And, for them, the content they do is challenging. And they're not lazy or retarded or afraid of &quot;risk.&quot; Lots of them have been around since 1999, at least on my server. At one point some of them were among the most powerful characters in the game, because they worked through quests, did massive faction work, were good players, worked well with each other, and so forth. There just weren't 36 of them in the same guild online at one time several nights a week.<br />
<br />
As long as BB thinks that casual players of this general type are a trivial part of the player base, it's quite logical for him to argue that raiding ought, over time, be a requirement of larger and larger percentages of all new content. I'd argue that merely because these kinds of casual players are invisible to you does not mean they do not exist. They do, and they generate significant revenue, and significant portions of that revenue help pay for the development of zones that are designed for players who have raided their way through PoP.<br />
<br />
I've posted before that unless this game remains fun for a wide range of characters and players, revenue falls and the pace of new content slows. Raiders need this core of casual players. Just as casual players need the core raiders. <br />
<br />
It also, however, seems to be unlikely that PoP's flagging system will change. It would be far more cost effective for SOE to introduce new lines of gear from a series of single-group mobs  in a new expansion. More profitable to create a new expansion that provides a casual work-around than it would be to add such a work-around to an expansion people have already bought.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many of you would vote with me to put this thread out of its misery?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Brabble, players who were once some of the most powerful players in the game, who have numerous contacts and have maintained them, that are eager to take on whatever challanges EQ throws in front of them, and remain interested in advancing their character are not:<br />
<br />
1. At 4K HP's or even 5K HP's unbuffed.<br />
<br />
2. Would know that to advance their character it would be best to locate 5 like minded/uber &quot;casual&quot; players to work with them reqularly for mutual goals.<br />
<br />
3. Would do the work - if that meant LDoN for an RA BP, Legs, and some augments, then that's what they would do.<br />
<br />
4. Would be in GoD doing that content that benefitted them.<br />
<br />
5. Would fully understand that there are zones they had not earned entry into and would be reconciled to not seeing them until their equipment earned them entry - former uber players in my experaince are not beggars, they have pride.<br />
<br />
These are not for the most past those casual players that have posted in this thread. Oh there certainly are a couple at 6-8K HP unbuffed players deep in GoD and advancing. But they aren't casual players - they are uber players that can't or prefer not to play with the frequency of some hard-core raiders. And they are not here whining it can't be done - they are doing it.<br />
<br />
There is nothing that prevents such players at you mention from forming alumni or senior circuit guilds that accommote their playstyle and take into account their uberosity and desire to maintain it. I've seen a couple of attempts to do exactly this. The problem with pulling it off is that guilds remain interested in their members and try to recruit them while other members are just burned out and eventually quit.<br />

DX9, mis-tuning of GoD, CoH, and WoW beta all affect who continued playing and who didn't.<br />
<br />
Players didn't leave in droves during PoP. PoP's been around for 2 years - don't make up stuff. Yes, PoP has raidng content. BUT, no one says you can't pick and choose. Ever hear of LDoN?<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
If in reading this whole thread it's not apparent to you that frustration with PoP progression didn't drive off a huge number of folks who were committed to EQ, then you aren't even trying to participate in this discussion legitimately.  <br />
<br />
LDoN, hah!  <br />
<br />
This is the standard answer for someone with no argument:  Just stay in LDON, the prison for non-raiders!  <br />
<br />
You wouldn't do it of course, because you think it sucks, but you're quick to tell others to do it.  Personally, I think LDON is a souless disgrace, and a pitiful attempt at game design.  But some clearly like it, and it certainly stemmed some of the worst problems with the developing gaps in the playerbase.  <br />
<br />
But it's no substitute for actual content and it does not replace everyone's hopes for progression.  People don't mind waiting longer or working harder so long as something is still possible for them.  Picture a bell curve, the fringes are by definition outside the scope of reasonableness.  If the curve moves, a ton of people who were once happy become unhappy, and they quit.  <br />
<br />
I think EQ needs to move the curve back through alterations in the style of progression.  Give folks a lifeline, and they'll be hooked again.  Give them LDON only, and they'll quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Gart,<br />
<br />
I agree, give them LDoN only and they will quit.<br />
<br />
But they don't have LDoN only, unless they make a great deal of non-effort to make that the case.<br />
<br />
I started making a realistic Magelo of a level 65 WARRIOR (you know, the class that needs more than any other to focus on equipment and every Warrior knows it). I'm not quite done. But,<br />
<br />
Camp some items that can be sold for pp (there're a lot of them) OR better yet do some flagging and collect the components yourself and get Bloodmetal Earrings.<br />
<br />
Get some PP and buy Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance.<br />
<br />
Do the Vampire Troubles Quest.<br />
<br />
If you are in a casual guild put Lcae Katta on your kill list and get that uber visor.<br />
<br />
Do LDoN and get an RA BP and Legs, aug every possible slot with LDoN augs.<br />
<br />
Get a 31% haste belt or better. Such things do NOT only drop in the EP's and PoTime.<br />
<br />
Make that and simular effort for every slot and you WILL be at 7-8K HP's unbuffed and will find progressing in GoD possible and profitable.<br />
<br />
You can't on the one hand say that you lack the ability to organize even a group of like-minded players to pursue mutual goals and dismiss LDoN completely. At one time every possible armor and weapon slot on my character held an LDoN aug. Don't even say I wouldn't do LDoN - I have and a whole lot more than many that have posted here. And that was before Augment reuse and Merchant bought item buyback.<br />
<br />
It's NOT a bell curve. I submit players are bunched towards 65 because that's the only characteristic that reflects only that you kill experaince mobs. They are further clustered in to hardcore raiding, casual raiding, hardcore grouping, and casual grouping. Yes, they have to make every way of playing the game fun, but they need not share all of the same content nor the same equipment end results.<br />
<br />
There is really not much of a point to adding extensive content for those players that have not completed the content on their plate right now and this has always been the case with casual players. Their problem isn't that they have no content. Their problem is that they have so much content that moving through it seems like a very long journey, especially at the pace they maintain month after month, year after year.<br />
<br />
Many casual posters here don't want a progression path - there is one. They want to be in the EP's NOW and Kod'Taz NOW and that's pretty much what they've said.<br />

The reason what you would call &quot;Casuals&quot; didn't quit in droves in pop is because they were able to do the early content. Now that they're getting around to seeing RZtW and  realizing that a lot of players probably won't ever see elementals, we see this backlash. It's pretty logical, actually. The people hitting GoD now were busy in mid-PoP content until recently - they leave and the next &quot;Generation&quot; as it were (don't take that out of context) takes it's place in that content.<br />

 I agree with many of the points you've brought in that last post, except for one:<br />
<br />
 You can't on the one hand say that you lack the ability to organize even a group of like-minded players to pursue mutual goals and dismiss LDoN completely. At one time every possible armor and weapon slot on my character held an LDoN aug. Don't even say I wouldn't do LDoN - I have and a whole lot more than many that have posted here. And that was before Augment reuse and Merchant bought item buyback. <br />
<br />
 How many multiple slot armor pieces did you have? Any? Yes, getting 1100 point Type 8 augs  for a piece of armor is a pain. Then again, so is getting an 1100 point type 2 and type 3 aug for EVERY piece of visible armor.<br />
<br />
 It's not dismissal of LDoN completely, it's the fact that where you're spending 1100 points for a type 7 or 8 aug for a piece of Raex versus the 1492 they spend to get RA and THEN having to put another 2200 in it for augs. If you didn't like doing it for 1100 a piece, imagine having to grind 3500 per piece.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hello there,<br />

While Absor has his views of the game and spells, they are not the &quot;Vision&quot; of SOE and should not be taken as the direction of the development team. I know Absor and I assure you that he was being sarcastic (his trade skill of choice). As we all know, sarcasm does not always carry well in text. <br />
<br />
While it may be true that you do not have to acquire every spell to play the game, we do understand that it is nice to have them. For many players it is a goal to acquire them all. I think you will see some changes to allow for easier acquisition of some spells in the very near future.<br />

<br />
(There is Ldon and single group content in GoD but until the mid levels of the GoD progression the gear is not elemental level)<br />
I don't get it. Why should the entry-gear of an expansion give you stats that rivals near end-game armor of the previous expansion?<br />
<br />
(People are now able to solo and single group much of kunark and velious content that was former raid content)<br />
<br />
(The gap between the haves and hav nots has grown)<br />
<br />
So, in essence, 1 grouping Kunark and Velious allows these 'have-notes' to become 'haves'. Interesting. Rediculous, but interesting.<br />
<br />
I've seen people who've never even been to BoT put together groups to do this stuff.<br />
<br />
(They still have not provided a single group path that provides rewards even close to what can be gained by a raider)<br />
I've one grouped Zlandicar, Klandicar, Yelinak, All of Ntov minus Vulak ring, King Tormax, Yelinak, AoW(with bots), ST, Cursed, Some of Vex Thall... Do i need to continue? These mobs used to be raids for me. They are now 1 groupable, or at the very least mini-raidable.<br />
<br />
They also give the same rewards they used to give. Raid rewards. They were raid rewards for me.  I think your problem is that you want todays raid rewards by taking an experience group someplace right now. Wait a little bit, and you'll get the same rewards. Otherwise, tell me why your 6 peoples rewards should rival that of my 54 people -- at the same point in time?<br />
<br />
You still haven't given me any facts to back up your claim that the designers view is decidedly anti-...well anti-you. All you've shown is that you want the exact same rewards for less overall effort, less overall risk, and less time spent.</div></div><hr />

Now that they're getting around to seeing RZtW and realizing that a lot of players probably won't ever see elementals, we see this backlash.<br />
That's probably the most profound thing posted in this entire thread.<br />
<br />
For some reason players didn't believe or didn't care that VT/Ssra/Seru was inacessable to them. I guess there was sort of a &quot;sweet lemons&quot; attitude - if that's all there is, then so what, I can do just fine without those zones.<br />
<br />
But the Ep/PoTime progression was something else. Both the gear and completing them represented an &quot;I won EQ!! :D &quot; *cough* endgame that we've never seen before. Unfortunately, once you realize you can't reach them, the implication is &quot;I lost EQ  :( &quot;<br />
<br />
Players will insist they don't need to do EP's and PoTime to enjoy the game. BUT, to some extent they really do want nearly the same &quot;rewards&quot; in order to &quot;keep pace&quot;.<br />
<br />
In truth, without augs and concidering Royal Attendent armor has multiple augment slots, the visable armor set gap isn't all that huge:<br />
Kizrak: 298AC 530HP's<br />
RA: 314AC 625HP's<br />
Raex: 492AC 1335HP's<br />
<br />
AND hardcore raiders do fight mobs that hit a LOT harder and their better armor on that basis alone is justified. But, this is not the outcome many casual players want to see. Thus you see casuals focusing on their belief that the 20-30 PoTime+ Warriors on their server wearing their uber equipment unfairly come out of the uber content and directly compete with them.<br />
<br />
We are all chasing a carrot we will never catch - casual players look at theirs and compare it to a hardcore raider's carrot and think theirs is small, shriveled, and embarassing in comparason - tiny baby carrots. They'd just as soon see the carrots the same and the same distance away.<br />
<br />
Some of it is carrot envy, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
The post Inferna quoted pits what appears to be one insider's intepretation of part of an SoE game development philosophy squarely opposed to casual player desires and the result in some cases is &quot;#$^ it, I'll quit then.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Frodlin, since you are the class correspondent and because I sort of liked your question, I'll quote it:<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I suppose my question is this:<br />
<br />
If there's so much resistance to doing LDoN, which is in essence the ability to acccumulate fairly powerful gear through relatively easy content, as evidenced by a lack of people who've acquired such gear, how can the request for additional content aimed at the same crowd that's rejecting that which they're asking for be taken seriously?&quot;<br />
<br />
My answer would come in parts, I guess. First, there are a number of ways to arrange content so that players have to do certain things to progress in gear. <br />
One method is to make the mobs harder and harder the farther you go into the zone/expansion. <br />
One method is to make the progression incremental: LDoN adventure points (and, I guess, tradeskills).<br />
Another method is to put content behind events that require several groups of people to work through. The casual objection to PoP/flags is basically what Haass said a long time ago in this thread: content here is blocked not based on how skilled you are, but how many people you play with. There are all kinds of real life things that can prevent you from being a reliable member of a raiding guild or even getting in on some sort of pick-up league, and thus the concept of a higher and higher percentage of the game over time being &quot;behind&quot; this sort of barrier is not a happy thing to contemplate.<br />
<br />
LDoN has some problems for sub-65 characters as a progression path, but aside from that the main problem I think many casuals have with it (and raiders too, I would think) is that long before you get far in the progression the sameness of LDoN adventures/zones becomes, uh, really boring. I realize of course that some aspects of the game are equally as boring for raiders. But you know, saying that the product is fine because it bores everyone (!) is not the most common slogan for successful companies in any part of the entertainment industry. The other thing about LDoNs is that one reason casuals haven't maxxed the armor they can get from these things is that it would take many of them years to do so. It's not that many casual players think the top LDoN stuff is junk. It's not--it's pretty damn good gear. There's not really a better path for someone who has my schedule and RL circumstances, that's for sure. However, I don't think all arguments I might make for new content opening to me ought to be viewed as &quot;not serious&quot; until I do several hundred (thousands?) of LDoNs to show that I've &quot;exhausted&quot; that content. Very few players have exhausted Qeynos Hills, let alone LDoN, but no one is arguing that everyone has to camp Hadden before they can seriously expect to see new content.</div></div><hr />

Don't tar everyone with that brush, Frod.  I've got 20k+ LDoN points; at one stage I was in the top 30 on my server LDoN board (presently 70th); and I prefer single-group progressions where possible.  I'm far from unique in that.</div></div><hr />

 Not characterizing you as being unreasonable, actually, just pointing out what some people (I didn't say you, here, either) forget - adding augs to existing raid equipment is a bit different from exclusively LDoNing - in the case of RA, it's a minimum of 500 adventures to upgrade maximally.<br />

You are correct, VT/Ssra/Seru can be skipped by those who went into BoT, ToSoRo, etc. and used that's as a subsitute way of gearing up for PoP higher level content or even to alternately skip EP/PoTime and go directly into GoD open zones and start Sewers, etc.<br />
<br />
LDon represents a third way to achieve the same thing.<br />
<br />
But at some point, it's fish or cut bait. SoE is unlikely to have robust, stand alone content in every expansion that let's you skip all previous content. It's a progression game and eventually you have to progress to keep pace with it.<br />

I don't get it. Why should the entry-gear of an expansion give you stats that rivals near end-game armor of the previous expansion?<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
So, in essence, 1 grouping Kunark and Velious allows these 'have-notes' to become 'haves'. Interesting. Rediculous, but interesting.<br />
<br />
I've seen people who've never even been to BoT put together groups to do this stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've one grouped Zlandicar, Klandicar, Yelinak, All of Ntov minus Vulak ring, King Tormax, Yelinak, AoW(with bots), ST, Cursed, Some of Vex Thall... Do i need to continue? These mobs used to be raids for me. They are now 1 groupable, or at the very least mini-raidable.<br />
<br />
They also give the same rewards they used to give. Raid rewards. They were raid rewards for me.  I think your problem is that you want todays raid rewards by taking an experience group someplace right now. Wait a little bit, and you'll get the same rewards. Otherwise, tell me why your 6 peoples rewards should rival that of my 54 people -- at the same point in time?<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
You still haven't given me any facts to back up your claim that the designers view is decidedly anti-...well anti-you. All you've shown is that you want the exact same rewards for less overall effort, less overall risk, and less time spent.<br />

I think there should be a path for non-raiders but its not my game.<br />

Forgive me but arent' you progressing pretty nicely in GoD?  From what I've seen of what you have written you're at best sympathetic with the complaints of non raiders, but not necessarily &quot;complaining&quot; in the sense that others are.    <br />
<br />
I mean, if I were to hold someone up as an example of what can be done, you'd be in my top 5 list.  The thing is, you've taken advantage of every opportunity that's presented itself.  Thus, if you're concerned with further progression, I'd be a lot more inclined to give heed to what you're asking for.<br />
<br />
A LOT of folks quite frankly, don't seem to me to be doing anywhere near what you've done.   I'm not going to point fingers because people don't like to be pointed out, but I'm not real impressed with people who don't or won't take advantage of current opportunities yet ask for more opportunities so that they can have more excuses why they're not taking advantage of those opportunities while asking for more opportunities.<br />
<br />
Yesterday out of curiosity, I decided to see what old world mobs were around.   Burrower Parasite, Thought Horror Overfiend, Xerkish the Creator, King Tormax, Lord Yelinak, Lcea Katta, Ring of Fear, Tunare, All of NToV, Lord Inquisitor Seru were all up, sitting there unmolested.  I didnt' even check for more, but people aren't taking advantage of opportunities as it stands.   I mean... Geez, if someone wants small raid acquirable armor that's between Tak armor and EPlane armor, they need go no further than Lord Inquisitor Seru.   Heck, there's not even a level limit on his gear.<br />
<br />
I have a real difficult time listening to complaints and considering them valid when people aren't taking advantage of opportunities that exist now.   To me that makes no sense.   If you're not taking advantage of current opportunities (not you specifically, but in a general sense), then why should you request additional opportunities?</div></div><hr />

The key is actually a gate item which gates your entire group into the arx from anywhere in eq.  Only 1 key is needed per raid, but it would be good to have the key on a caster for easy gate outs to get more groups in.<br />

From what I've seen of what you have written you're at best sympathetic with the complaints of non raiders, but not necessarily &quot;complaining&quot; in the sense that others are.<br />
<br />
In fairness, Frod, my main isn't a warrior.  I do know a warrior who progressed as far as Ikkinz while unguilded and mostly not wearing raid gear (he's guilded now) - but my main's a cleric.  Because I'm not as gear-dependent as a warrior, this stuff is indubitably easier for me, and you won't see me flaming the casual warriors in this thread because I don't share their experiences directly.  People don't ask me how many hp I have when I join a group.<br />
<br />
(Okay, sometimes I'm asked for my FT count, but in the unlikely event that you make it to KT without capping FT, you'll soon cap it out while there.)<br />
<br />
I do feel that the GoD progression for single-group content is a huge advance over the efforts from previous expansions, and I feel that a lot of casual players are likely to be using this content when OoW comes out and caps levels at 70.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I'm not progressing &quot;pretty nicely&quot; in GoD any more.  Once you're Ikkinz-capable, no further progression is possible in the single-group environment.  (As I'm certain you're aware, the stuff that drops in Kod`Taz/Yxtta/Ikkinz single-group content pisses over LIS's drops from a great height; it's roughly equivalent to Time p2/3.  So farming bosses from previous expansions simply doesn't apply... I could single-group LIS or whatever, but I already have a 200hp breastplate.)  I'm at the glass ceiling, and I'm basically just farming and helping friends get through trials until OoW comes out.<br />
<br />
What I would wish is for the three Ikkinz trials to be a progression, where 7 is easier than 9 (this is the reverse of the situation at the moment; the least difficult trial is 9, then 8, then 7 is the toughest).  A boss like the DD should be in 9 rather than in 7, and the drops collected in Ikk 7 and Ikk 8 should enable the non-raiding non-casual warrior to become capable of tanking the final boss.  In this model, the DD would be the &quot;Quarm&quot; of single-group content, with an appropriately wide and deep loot table.<br />
<br />
However, my greatest wish is this:  That with level 70, the existing LDoN content be expanded to include a level 70 &quot;High Risk&quot; setting which would represent a really serious step up from level 65 High Risk.  Not only should yard trash hit for ~2k, but there should be handcrafted bosses with AE's and AE rampage and whatever that are designed with a real progression in mind.<br />
<br />
For example, one way to do it might be this:  one theme (say it was BB) could be the theme you're intended to complete first.  Once you've finished farming twenty-odd successful boss kills in the BB theme, you could be expected to have gained sufficient upgrades that you could move to another theme (say it was EF) where the monsters hit harder and the bosses have different powers... do you see?<br />
<br />
Imagine a raid-style progression, but in miniature, where each encounter is designed to be completed by a single group in 90 minutes.  The present GoD trials are good like that, but overly demanding in terms of time invested for a real non-raiding player; sewers trials are totally trivial for me now, but it still takes me three or four hours to grind through them if I want to flag a friend.  Two hours of challenging stuff would be far better than three or four hours of watching TV while I play.</div></div><hr />

In your capacity as class rep, ask SOE if they would give you a breakdown on warrior levels and power, screening for obvious bazaar mules. <br />

<br />
What I'd like you to find out is the mean level of non 65 warriors, and the number of them (or percentage of them); the mean AC/hitpoints of 65 warriors; the mean AC/hitpoints of the bottom 75% of lvl 65 warriors; the mean AC/hitpoints of the middle 50% of 65 warriors. Ask the same questions concerning AAs. <br />
<br />
Also, the percentage of accounts in EQ that have no character at level 65.<br />
<br />
the percentage of accounts that are played &lt;20 hours a week; 20-30 hours a week; 30-50 hours per week; &gt;50 hours per week (or some like breakdown in play time).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">Would just like to add a slightly different viewpoint on the casual vs non-casual debate. <br />
<br />
Looking at my magelo, some may think I am no less than a hardcore raider, but in fact I'm pretty far from hardcore. I frequently take extended breaks off EQ due to work, RL etc. And even while playing, some weeks I am only on for a few raids. I started playing at the start of Luclin and have only this 1 character with 210 AA and a couple of augs. (Yes, I don't even have LDoN points for the second aug on my EoE yet) Compared to many that's pretty slow progress. Rare are the days I spend more than 5 hours playing (our raid time). <br />
<br />
I started off with small family guilds and worked my way up to bigger and better untill now where I am in the top guild on the server. Even tho some raiding guilds in theory may require their members to log on 80% of the time, they too are often realistic when it comes to RL issues. Some in the guild may resent my fairly casual attitude, but I personally feel it is better to play when you feel like it in stead of burning out completely as I have seen many far more hardcore people do. I see EQ as fun on the side, as the game it is. For this reason, I have always declined to become an officer or anything along those lines.<br />
<br />
For sure, I'll never be the first to receive the best loot (my guild is in Qvic), nor will I be the first choice on some of the harder mobs, but the more hardcore warriors in my guild are far more capable at that anyway. And in the past I have done my fair share of main tanking with a low warrior turnout. Mostly, I think it is better to have the extra backup I can provide than not have it. <br />
<br />
So, to some up, I think you can be perfectly casual as a raider; some guilds may resent this attitude, but I think many would rather have the extra help than not. The debate then I feel is not really wether you have enough time to be in a raiding guild or not, but wether you are willing to raid or not. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">Esvee, I believe that some times people here in this thread have assumed that casuals are non-raiders or vice versus.  The debate at the moment is not centric on &quot;casual&quot; or &quot;24x7 play time&quot;.  The debate is more of the &quot;raider&quot; vs the &quot;non-raider&quot;.  The &quot;I play with 5 others&quot; vs &quot;they play with 71 others&quot;.  The &quot;I have 30 poeple total in my guild&quot; vs &quot;they have 100 people&quot;.  I am most certainly not a &quot;casual&quot; player but would never consider my self a &quot;raider&quot;.  Anyways, just saying that there are 4 types of players in EQ.  Casual-Raider, Casual-non-raider, Play-a lot-raider, play-a lot-non-raider.<br />
<br />
 Warriors on their server wearing their uber equipment unfairly come out of the uber content and directly compete with them.<br />
<br />
They do though, read the post from Raaj directly above yours and the almost derailed Lord Seru comments.  BB, wether you &quot;see&quot; it or not it is happening at the least on my server.  We have Time geared farm teams in CT, BoT towers, SolRo, Earth, LDoN, and Kael.  Log on to CT into bazaar and check out the items that are for sale on the SAME trader.  Rallos Zek helmet, BoC, Ornate, Acid Bracer, Earthen Rings, etc...  There are numerous sellers like this and their warez is constantly being replenished.  When one seller has 10 Amy masks and 10 earthen rings for sale there is only one reason.<br />
<br />
casual players look at theirs and compare it to a hardcore raider's carrot<br />
<br />
No, non-raiders trying to move farther in the group settings get laughed at by raiders when they are asked their unbuffed hp / ac.  Non-raiders are laughed at when they put in for Guild apps in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
The differences between your carrot and mine has grown significantly different and the &quot;middle&quot; area that allows non-raiders to be &quot;accepted&quot; by groups / guilds is becoming more and more difficult to fill.<br />
<br />
As the &quot;raiding&quot; guilds move further away from the &quot;non-raiders&quot; and recruite from the &quot;family-guilds&quot; the classes that are not highly gear dependant it pushes us further and further away from each others &quot;carrot size&quot;.<br />
<br />
The &quot;non-raiders&quot; are simply asking for a go between Raex (ac54 hp150) and Warlord's Steel Gauntlets (ac34 hp90).  There are no gloves between these two and the &quot;carrot&quot; size is outstanding.</div></div><hr />

One drops from a duo-able mob in an instanced LDoN adventure ... the other drops off a myriad of raid mobs requireing 36+ people working together.  If you had told me a year ago you could get 34ac 90hp gloves off an xp mob, i'd have told you you were smoking something funny.<br />

Content has to reflect content.  In GoD there's literally a dozen pieces of gear which are as good or better than existing EP armors.  Does this bother me?  Not at all, because the content is difficult enough to warrant it.<br />

I get a vastly differnet message from Raaj's post than you do. Frodlin posted that he did a named mob survey and found roughly a dozen named up and playing Diablo out of boredom.<br />
<br />
I suppose this would depend to some extent on local condidtions. I seriously can not remember the last off our target list named mob my guild has done... wait, I can - AoW two years ago and Seru about six months later. If a guild is making decent progess in the EP/PoTime or QVic, it doesn't have time for Shei.<br />
<br />
The PoTime+ farmers are likely, as suggested elsewhere, PA purchased toons intentionally farming content for pp and indirectly $$.<br />
<br />
BUT there is another explanation. When a guild farms PoTime or the EP's where to you suppose their upgraded dropable items go? That right, the bazzar. A guild that hits Potime and GoD rather quickly puts 50 or 60 Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I do know of players that have farmed x, y, or z when not raiding that one or two nights a week. Did you know Ornate molds and patterns drop off random mobs in ToSoRo? You can not with a single group camp the entire zone. You can not camp all of the BoT Tower named or all of CT, or all of the EP's, or VT, or VP, with one group simultaiously. <br />
<br />
What high level player needs or wants the trash drops from outside the content they are doing. If you can bid on items from PoTime cause they are rotting for your twink, what do you need KT for? PP? To buy what. Look at my Magelo please, what in the heck can I buy????? A horse? A Dwarf Warrior on a horse, on purpose?<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to bully you. But I am pointing there are a lot of pre-EP targets and that PoTime+ raiders understandably spend a lot of time raiding.<br />

You don't need PoP to hunt turtles on the beach. You are correct, VT/Ssra/Seru can be skipped by those who went into BoT, ToSoRo, etc. and used that's as a subsitute way of gearing up for PoP higher level content or even to alternately skip EP/PoTime and go directly into GoD open zones and start Sewers, etc.<br />

But at some point, it's fish or cut bait. SoE is unlikely to have robust, stand alone content in every expansion that let's you skip all previous content. It's a progression game and eventually you have to progress to keep pace with it.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
It's a progression game for raiders, not for everyone. Ultimately this view (progress or else) is what is now wrong with this game. It's why this game is no longer fun for many. Suggesting that this remain the same is not only stupid its also dangerous to the long-term viability of the platform.<br />
<br />
All the raiders (you will notice there is very little cross-over of opinions in this 79 page thread) can deny this fact all they want, but non-raiders (call them what you want) want equipment, content, progression, aaxp zones, etc. in EVERY expansion, after all they pay for it too (in fact more than the raiders due to #s). With the old, &quot;you will eventually see it 2 expansions later&quot;, this was doable. Its not anymore since PoP and its driving a wedge between the player groups. This is the crux of the problem. Much like warriors, paladins, etc. have felt disenfrancished in the past now many non-raiders feel disenfranchised because they feel (rightly or wrongly) that the content is all being developed for raiders now.<br />
<br />
I would love to see the GoD sales figures. I would love to see them even more if non-raiders had been allowed a week in the expansion (even today) without paying for it. I would guess less than 20% of non-raiders would have bought it (and likely some raiders too). So far there are no indications non-raiders are going to get any more than last time other than the 70 bone and maybe epic 1.5, oh and spells they may not be able to get and of course they will be worthless because they will need focus 5 gear that they cant get (nothing to indicate otherwise so far based upon prior trends unless they put them in LDoN).<br />

Imo all players all tossed into the same game world togeather and what distinquishes them are the challenges they face.Most level 65 people raid a little bit some raid alot.I will never catch up to BB or say Gooba on my server, because, I don't raid/play anywhere near as much.It's not just time invested it's the challenges they've gone through.We don't spend enough time raiding to meet those challenges at anywhere near the same pace.Course I don't care at all hehe. :) I have very limited playtime in comparison ,but, I enjoy it a lot in good company and can do my job well for my friends at our content level.I'm lucky that I found great company that steadily progresses albeit slower than some.<br />
<br />
Gerick may have come to a place in the road where he no longer shares the same playstyle happily with his guildmates.I dunno... it's just the impression I get from his posts.If he's happy staying with them has their heavy tank and progressing slower that's kewl if it makes him happy.The game is about fun after all.<br />
<br />
Some folks(stessing not all here) seem to want to push group rewards to the point of making raiding anything less than time/god unprofitable and well silly.It's not a measure of how much time you spend sloggin away ...it's the difficulty of the mobs you hit that determine the phat rewards.Yeah some quests and erm LDON do reward problem solving and persistance well on an individual level,but, to get the real candy you need friends to help and thats really the prupose of EQ.To bring people togeather to confront ever more difficult encounters.<br />

I agree that pop increased the challenge and reward of raiding.I agree that more content should be in place to allow for alternatives for progression...tho GOD will be very good at 70 with more to come I'm sure.I'd love to see the balance brought back in line for grouping.Not to increase quality of drops against mob difficulty,but, to add more fun content for people with that quality of gear to progress through.Make lots of it no drop omg.<br />
<br />
EQ is about adventure.Big mobs that eat goups for lunch drop big loot...makes sense.Thats why you get friends togeather.Yeah,I wish they could keep raid forces smaller for the sake of not making people feel lost in the crowd.There are a lot of degrees of perception in this thread and a lot of non raiders posting here essentially agree with me imo.Although ,they may have varying opinions on reward balance hehe.<br />
<br />
PS.Make stuff no drop and get rid of the pa $#@.Yeah,I know... fat chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Apolyon is correct.<br />
<br />
Any guild that is farming time and GoD zones is going to expect most of its applicants to be subpar equipment wise to that.<br />
<br />
Yes, its nice to get an applicant that is already time flagged and shows up ready to play.  But that comes with its own share of questions....<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... That other guild is on about the same level we are.  I wonder why they left that other guild?  Were they invited to leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
There is often a reason, and its not about equipment.  Its about attitude.  Sometimes you are better off doing some backflagging. <br />
<br />
Gear is easy to fix.  As a guild progresses, its amazing to see how much stuff that has great stats is at the verge of rotting... and sometimes does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may be different in Raaj's guild, but for most raid guild players, skill is simply not a factor.  I've never seen a raid guild that wasn't full of people who can't find a loc, can't download a map, can't remember to pack essential supplies like arrows or spell reagents, totally suck at positioning (in any raid encounter at least a third of the melees will be pushing the wrong way - this is henceforth to be known as Shadowfrost's Law), and far from being skilled, many raid guild players use their superior gear to compensate for their lack of technique.<br />
<br />
There are, of course, many exceptions, but in general this is true.<br />
<br />
The entry qualifications for most raid guilds are basically:<br />
<br />
1.  Do you possess enough flags and AA points to play with us?<br />
2.  Do you have a computer and net connection which doesn't suck?<br />
3.  Can you promise to devote five or more evenings a week to playing Everquest for the foreseeable future?<br />
4.  Are you prepared to spend your evenings playing Everquest doing exactly what we tell you to do?<br />
<br />
If you can answer &quot;yes&quot; to all four questions, then you're raid guild material, irrespective of skill.  Only if you've totally screwed up your reputation on the server beyond all redemption will you be refused entry to most raid guilds.<br />
<br />
If you can answer &quot;yes&quot; to the first three questions, but your answer to the fourth one is &quot;hell no&quot;, then you're probably what I've called a non-casual non-raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure there are many guilds that fit this description which you would consider a raiding guild. You probably would be surprised at how many do not fit this description though.<br />
<br />
My guild(Rathe away from Time) sets minimum AA requirements, HP, blahblahblah. Most raiding guilds set requirements so that an incoming person will have some chance of contributing and not being a burden for a long time. Gear is easy to improve either through raid drops, or xp groups in higher zones that people gain access to once we've helped flag them.<br />
<br />
Our number one issue is attitude. Our app process is designed to weed out jackasses and people who just don't fit in with our member base.<br />
<br />
We make exceptions as needed for people short on AA or flags or whatever. You would be surprised how many skilled players with good gear and Time flags we've turned down, simply because they couldn't fit in to our closed society or turned out to be a jackass. We try very hard not to make exceptions for a persons personality and attitude. <br />
<br />
I can gear your character, get you flags and help you learn how to raid. I can't teach you not to be a jackass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Yup, sorry shadow /disagree heh.We take people with sucky connections and little online playtime.Some of our bards can't pull for the lag omg...tho they manage to twist ok when they are in my group.Raidleaders die ,lack time and they don't see everything.Our players are expected to be proactive.We don't care too much about gear though a little aa is good.Having a good attitude and reasonable class skill is what we look for.<br />
<br />
We also get tons of apps in with ep/time gear and unlimited playtime and turn them down regularly.We have often taken people from luclin and early pop content even tanks hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">Sure, sure, I know that every raider who posts in this thread believes they are in a guild full of the very best of EQ players who are also wonderful people IRL.<br />
<br />
I understand this.  There isn't a single human being alive who believes that they or their friends are the ones who suck.<br />
<br />
It remains true that the entry qualifications for most raid guilds boil down to this: have a retardedly large amount of EQ time, be a good little robot and do exactly as the inflated egos tell you, and be able to breathe.  This does not generally attract quality players; it simply attracts the housebound, the invalids and the unemployed - people who may be quality EQ players, but sometimes are not.<br />
<br />
The truth is that raiding requires very little skill, because each person is performing one or two highly specialized tasks repeatedly, and most raiders are watching TV while they're doing it.  It requires a small amount of strategy, although not very much; the behaviour of the foes is so predictable that it really doesn't take a genius to figure out how to beat them.  So as a general rule, it's more important to have a raid leader who's very patient with stupid people than to have one with the tactical mind of a Kasparov or a Fisher.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that non-raiders necessarily play any better than raiders; a lot of non-raiders suck too.<br />
<br />
But to portray any raid guild as full of people who're &quot;skilled&quot; is - at best - stretching the truth.  Face facts, guys:  perhaps some of the people in your guild are attentive players with a solid understanding of technique, but your guild also contains its share of idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">In my experiance the qualifications have been a lot more like:<br />
<br />
1. Be able to make the majority of raids and not take extended breaks to play CoH, DAoC, or Doom3. Guilds make a lot of progress in 3 months. Take that much time off and you likely will never catch up.<br />
<br />
2. Do not have have a bad reputation. This includes arguing in /gu, loot disputes, ninja looting, guild hopping, ebay, general argumentativeness.<br />
<br />
3. Have a good reputation. Follow instructions. Be prepared to do it the guild way and not necessaritly the &quot;right&quot; (your) way. Know how to play your class. Not only know how, but have had some accomplishments to indicate you have put into practice what you &quot;know&quot;. If you want to characterize this as being a good robot, fine. I characterize it as being a team player.<br />
<br />
4. Be more of an asset than a burden. Your quests, need for a CoH, a Rez in Gunthark, back-flags etc. often come second to guild goals during a raid.<br />
<br />
5. Did I mention being able to PLAY your class. That includes picking up the untanked unmezzable mob in a 4 or 5 pull with death adds the punishment for error. NOT killing an Enchanter. Not stepping forward that one foot and attracting an add. Picking out the 1 unmezable on incoming in a four pull. Not saying rez please after every tanking assignment when the mobs are hitting for 2K and sometmes quad.<br />
<br />
I'm just talking Warrior here. Other classes in raids are equally challanged. Healers decide on the fly who they must let die, who get's that heal and how long they can delay. Who gets a cure. How their mana is holding out. Efficient or fast.<br />
<br />
Imagine an underpowered group in LDoN Difficult taking on a 6 pull. That barely touches on how truely focused and near perfect in execution players frequently have to be in hard raids.<br />
<br />
If you are error prone, refuse to learn 'cause you know it all, can't be there most of the time when needed, and don't do as told by the Raid Leader then you aren't wanted. You will NOT make the cut. You will be not a raider but group only and not by your own choice.<br />
<br />
High level guilds get many many more appicants then they need. They can be and are picky.<br />

<br />
Well, I've pretty much stayed out of the whole raider vs non-raider or casual vs. non-casual debate. It's a no win situation and I don't think SoE realistically CAN make both sides happy. <br />
<br />
It's easy for a guild to outfit someone in these zones if they have been in them for any length of time. Many established members no longer need some pieces. Many people will go there and do xp with a new member in hopes of getting an xp named drop that is an upgrade for someone in the group. <br />
<br />
Would a random pickup group be able to do the same? Not so much. Many/most of the drops still require some sort of raid force, whether it's 4 groups or 12.<br />
<br />
<br />
The EP, as they stand now,  are raid zones that happen to have some good places to do xp. There's a lot of reasons, some posted for why this is. Is it right? /shrug, not for everyone. Could changes be made to even it out? Sure, but I don't know that it's worth the programming effort to do so. I think it would make it much much harder for guilds coming up after this change to get into Time. I know that wouldn't bother everyone, but it would affect a sizable portion of the player base. <br />
<br />
I know that a lot of people feel that they are locked out of content that they can't see because they can't or won't play the game in a different manner. That's all well and good, but it's not my fault as a raider. It shouldn't really be raiders vs non-raiders. We didn't program the expansion this way. If you want it to be non-raiders vs. someone, then how about non-raiders vs. SoE? The only real power you have in that arguement is with your wallet. If enough of you make enough noise, perhaps SoE will make changes in hope of keeping you as subscribers. Ultimately, your only real way to affect them is with your money. <br />
<br />
I think raiders typically have always received more love from SoE because they are usually guild of raiders and when a legitimate complaint is voiced it's coming from a larger block of subscribers. For non-raiders or casuals to receive the love is harder in my opinion because even though it may be a larger overall number of subscribers, it's not organized and doesn't have the effect. <br />
<br />
The thread here on a different forum is a good idea. I hope it helps at least bring light to the problems/issues perceived from those groups of players. Some comments are made that we(raiders) don't see the issues. Well, quite frankly that's normal. I can listen to you and understand and sympathize but for the most part, it's still not an issue to ME in the same sense. <br />
<br />
EQ needs all kinds of players. The biggest part of why many of us play EQ is the social element. Take away any significant portion of the player base and some aspect of the social part of EQ is gone.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm not even sure where this whole reply started. Been swapping in and out to other windows here at work. Looks like it's ended up being way longer and way off topic to the post I was replying to. Oh well, at least it's still somewhat related to various parts of the thread overall.</div></div><hr />

Yep, mudflation was the key to keeping non-ubers (technical term) happy in the past until PoP shut that down. The glass ceiling has gotten a little lower on a relative basis as a result. Hopefully lvl 70 and other OoW stuff brings the feeling (notice I didnt say must be real, said they must feel that they can) of progression (content, aas, and equipment) back to many of the non-ubers. If not I think we are gonna see some large subscription loses. I doubt the casuals will organize like the ubers. They will just leave and they may do so quick enough for SOE not to respond in time (say move to WoW en masse for example).<br />

SOE hasn't regained enough trust from me and the people I play with to have earned the money they're going to charge for OoW. I don't think the previously disappointing pre-sales numbers of OoW are going to be as shocking to Sony as the low retail sales numbers I'm expecting them to see when OoW goes live. <br />

<br />
I suppose you think ths is a debate - if that's the case, you really should let someone else to the debating for your point of view.<br />
<br />
Let me see if I can paraphrase the argument:<br />
It takes no special skill to raid, If I joined a guild I'd get ph4t loot, therefore I shouldn't be preventend from getting ph4t loot merely because I can't/won't join a guild. Afterall, raiders suck as players and haven't proven anything.<br />
<br />
Don't waste your time applying to my guild please - I only get one vote, but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't get permission to raid. If you don't see a qualatative difference between LDoN and Uqua then you would be helpless as a raider.<br />
<br />
You don't have to join a guild. The ph4t loot is out there and the GAME hurdles necessary to reach it are in place. Go get it chief.<br />
<br />
You have to kill Quarm to get his loot. It's necessary to clear the various phases all over again of PoTime to get to Quarm. You even get a break. You only have to kill the various Elemental Plane gods once to get to PoTime. Add infinitum. There's a progression.<br />
<br />
Sure, a guild can help you to get backflagged. Guilds are raiding/social organizarions that have rules and pool their effort to meet mutual goals. If you are a member in good standing, then you reap th rewards. If you are not, then you don't - pretty simple really.<br />
<br />
But, you can join or organize public raids. You, personally, have to jump the hoops to get to the content. How you choose (if you choose) to do that is up to you.<br />
I can join a guild and get flagged for time by doing 4 PoP bosses, nothing more, nothing less.<br />
IF you are accepted by a guild in a position to do this, then they MAY backflag you and allow you to benefit from their effort - that's their choice. I say their efforts because sir you can not do somethings alone. Raid content strangly enough is easier in a raid.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand, they may never reach PoTime or even be beyond it. Joining a guild doesn't get you into PoTime. Joning a guild doing that content and willing to do backflagging does.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if you do all four Sewer trials or Smith Rondo. Raiders get a break on backflagging because we often do it so much. Sometimes we don't even need to backflag. In some zones a raid over a certain size can get unflagged people into the zone.<br />
<br />
You stated in a nutshell why I've loooong opposed applicants that have only been in low level guilds and LDoN/bazaar applicants - they haven't to my mind EARNED their way to the content. However my guild entertains some applicants without strong raiding qualifications and they are adjudged by our other standards. They don't get into PoTime by joining however - we're past that content. Having not been involved with getting the flags, they don't get to see the content.<br />
<br />
You can buy a PA character with all the flags too, but that doesn't prove anything either.<br />
<br />
Faced with a 20 foot wide ditch, the members of a guild build a bridge. Faced with the same barrier, you try to jump across it alone and the complain it's too wide.<br />

SoE could have, like in PoTime made you endlessly beat the early phase mobs to reach Quarm - to repeat part of the progression every single time you go after Quarm. Flags are just a way of indicating you have met a challange and SoE is not going to make you repeat that part of the progression again.<br />
<br />
Can't beat Juggernaughts then you don't see Trak. Can't beat Phase One, no Quarm. Can beat Rathe Council even once, no PoTime. CoH or drag and rez doesn't work everywhere in the game - sometimes you have to fight your way to content.<br />

Now you all say that's not enough we got to have elementals.. Now I agree that it sucks certain tradeskill drops are hidden away in locked places. Then they go and make them rare :) Please don't play it's not fair card either. Life isn't fair. <br />
Never has been never will be and this game is more fair than life is. There's a set of rules. For the most part they are enforced. And you know what you have to do to get to Z. Yes that answer requires raiding. Since you put your z in a place that can currently only be reached that way. Course the fact taht you could go to y1 and z1 and get other things doesn't matter. I said it in a notehr thread GoD's itemization is horrible it's got huge gaps. That should be fixed. <br />

Afterall, raiders suck as players and haven't proven anything.<br />
<br />
Dunno about the rest of the posters in this thread, but please don't read that into my remarks.<br />
<br />
I was saying that it takes very little &quot;skill&quot; to raid.  Raiders trying to portray themselves as being generally &quot;more skilled&quot; is pretty funny to me, because it's obvious to me that many raiders really aren't &quot;skilled&quot; at all.<br />
<br />
This is not the same as saying that all raiders suck at EQ.  It is also not the same as saying that raiding doesn't merit rewards.  For the avoidance of doubt, I'll say explicitly:  Some raiders are good at EQ, and the extremely large investment of time from raiding does merit a reasonable level of reward.<br />
<br />
EQ isn't really a skill anyway.  You couldn't teach a college course in Everquest Gameplay, could you?  When someone is described as &quot;a skilled player&quot; in Everquest, what is really meant is that that person is usually paying attention, knows the correct techniques for dealing with most situations, and can generally apply those techniques appropriately.<br />
<br />
Because much of my gameplay is in zones like Kod and Ikkinz, I meet a lot of raiders.  Some of them are attentive players with a solid understanding of technique.  Other raiders are inattentive and stupid, but they nevertheless become members of a raid guild and think of themselves as elite.  The raid guilds don't usually appear to suffer too much from having inattentive and occasionally stupid members, which is why I conclude that raiding doesn't take any &quot;skill&quot; even as EQ players define the word.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm of the opinion that someone who can get to Kod`Taz without raid gear or guild backing is considerably more worthy of being called &quot;skilled&quot; than someone who can do the same thing with full Time equipment and a guild to help push them through.  :)  From my viewpoint, the main reason I sometimes feel resentful towards raid guilds is because they push people into KT/Ikkinz/Yxtta who really don't have what it takes to get there - but they've been &quot;carried&quot; through the trials by their guilds.  In other words, raid guilds are polluting zones which you really ought to need &quot;skill&quot; to reach, with &quot;unskilled&quot; players, some of whom are even lacking in basic AA's.<br />
<br />
Other raiders are very good and have every right to be in KT, of course.  But I do wish they wouldn't keep bringing their gimp friends into zones they're not ready for just because they share a guildtag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It remains true that the entry qualifications for most raid guilds boil down to this: have a retardedly large amount of EQ time, be a good little robot and do exactly as the inflated egos tell you, and be able to breathe.  This does not generally attract quality players; it simply attracts the housebound, the invalids and the unemployed <br />
<br />
This is untrue in my experience of raid guilds.Certainly there will be bad players in high end raid guilds some will slide thru and some will have short lived memberships.The majority of people that raid with a guild through pop/god content can't suck or the guild won't make it anywhere.<br />
<br />
Imo statementes like this are no better than raiders saying most non raiders are lazy#$^% who can't manage to get anything done in the game.In fact while it is true that a lot of the decent players here could get through higher content the way most have if they decided to expend that TIME and EFFORT ;Shadows posts about raiders are often ridiculous and without any merit at all.<br />
<br />
He in no way represents my perspective or those of most raiders so don't present him as such.<br />

PS.My guild is made up of primarily working people between 25-55.Most of us have relatively low eq playtime and many cannot log in for all the raids(10 - 20 hrs a week raid time averaging less than 10 in the summer)but many adapt their rl schedules to the best of their ability.Our primary concern with recruiting is about attitude and reasonable class skill.</div></div><hr />

Here we go again with this stupid line of thought. Raiding is not about time and effort, but rather about time and effort in the context of that time and effort being agreeable to not only you but also somewhere between 53 and 71 of your closest friends (well maybe not friends). I know many non-raiders (or casual raiders) whose time and effort far exceeds that of uber-raiders, its just not 7-12pm EST 4-6 days a week.<br />

Hmm.  I know I said &quot;raid guilds&quot; - but that was probably the wrong choice of phrase, I really didn't mean to refer to guilds who're still in the EP's.  I do appreciate that an EP guild might well think of itself as a &quot;raid guild&quot; - justifiably so, I hasten to add - and it's true to say that guilds who're that far back do often contain time-restricted players.<br />
<br />
I should have clarified that my remarks were aimed at those guilds who've basically stopped bothering with PoP, with the possible exception of the odd visit to the Time candy store.  Maybe I should have said &quot;uberguilds&quot; although that's also a bit misleading; imo an uberguild is one that's past Inktuta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There also comes a time when you can get the best you can get as an &quot;uber raiding&quot; player, and there is no more real progression. It's not like casual gaming has an &quot;end&quot; but raiding can go on forever. Guilds do eventually hit the &quot;end&quot; of an expansion and have nowhere left to go but farm the same zones over and over again (similar to farming LDoN's over and over again). The only difference is when you hit the top of uber raiding, you have better equipment than if you hit the top of casual playing. It makes sense, that doing the hardest content possible with 60 people would reap better rewards than the hardest content possible with 6 people, doesn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">Quarg, raiding ends in a candy store.  There's a defined &quot;Top Dog&quot; mob (Quarm in PoP) with a wide and deep loot table.<br />
<br />
Non-raiding play ends in a kind of pathetic whimper.  The &quot;Top Dog&quot; mob is the DD, which ought to be in the last Ikkinz trial and changed to provide a wide and deep loot table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">I agree that single-groupable stuff should probably have more varieties of loot to cover all slots, but the quality of these items is far from sub-par already. Back when I played, I met plenty of people who had more hp/ac than me who were not in raiding guilds and did it purely through LDoN and lower end GoD. My guild was in PoTime. <br />
<br />
Simple reason is that it's much easier to gear yourself up when you get a reward from *every* single thing you do (exp, LDoN points), with a 1 in 6 chance at getting every loot... <br />
<br />
When you raid, you put in more time, with more effort to organize large scale battles with 50+ people, and you have to share any loot that drops with 100 or 150 or more people depending on the size of your whole guild. This means that the majority of the time, you spend a whole night raiding, and get zip, nada, zero for your time, except maybe a tiny bit of aaxp from raid exp, which is offset by the reg exp lost from multiple deaths.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, top-end raiding really does hit an end. GoD is the first expansion that many people are still having trouble with as the next expansion is ready for release. All other expansions had people farming Kunark dragons and VP/NToV/Aten/Quarm over and over and over again waiting for the next expansion, getting maybe the occasional upgrade for a new member or whatever, but mostly twink gear or stuff that rots. And in this case, they don't even have the choice to give up what they're doing and follow a different path (ie a casual gamer giving up LDoN and joining a high end raiding guild).</div></div><hr />

He did say most raiding guilds at one point. ;)  And, I'm willing to bet that if it isn't *most*, it is *many* - but not many of them that come here to the forums.  You come to look around, trade ideas, learn your class - odds are higher that you're either in a saner guild or looking for one.

<br />
Sides I could train my friends silly and they wouldn't care.Would the majority of my guild hang around if we got stumped forever on content....<br />
<br />
It is harder though.More effort socially,more struggle at beating content that takes hours or days to recover from.Especially being one person ,or, a couple can easily demo a raid for 72 folks just by not being quite good enough at the right time.More having to fit your wants and play times around a large group for the sake of the group.Lotsa stuff makes it harder and more challenging.Risky?....Well maybe.The social risk is inherantly far higher.Reputations, long term investment...It is a video game tho.Not much risk at all in a group ...cept a couple hrs of wasted time at the worst...where you prolly still got xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not strickly true Gunnar.  If your group of friends become tired of the tedium and snail's pace progress involved with the single group game, they may very well leave the game or join an uber guild to see what they're missing.  And for raiders the risk is burn out and then leaving the game as well.  Rarely do raiders leave the game because they haven't made progress, they do frequently leave the game because the commitment involved is too extreme and they stop having fun at it.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole &quot;raiding guilds require more work in the social aspects&quot; arguement, maybe for you that's true.  But I couldn't tell you the number of raids I've been at where the only conversation in group was about buffs and job duties and the only communication in the raid channel was about tactics and job duties.  Frankly, when people raid, at least in my experience, social interaction goes down, not up.  I don't think either of us can speak for the majority of players, but obviously our experiences are not the same so you can't really conclude that your experiences are necessarily more typical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">Well social experiences in eq are largely up to the individual and a bit of luck.<br />
<br />
Your friends decide to leave thats fine.The particular encounter and their difficulty with it doesn't create that risk.That's just a matter of their overall gaming experience and what they choose to do with it.I am in favor of more content for ldon+ level stuff so they would find eq more entertaining and stick around ,but, you now this  as i've said it many times.<br />
<br />
Single encounters do cause guilds to collapse - hence the risk.Though, I still don't think much of the risk issue in eq as I said above.<br />
Raiders do leave the game (at least temporarily ) when their guilds collapse.They put a lot of energy into their guilds over time and seeing them dissolve is difficult for many people.Also ,having them simply leave and reguild ,play alts or whatever will still leave many feeling bereft of something they have put a lot of time ,effort and emotional energy in.So there is really more risk in a single encounter for a raid guild than in a group.Nevermind blown spawns,lost hours of work to get ready for the encounter amd lots of frustrated people.<br />
<br />
Social aspects of raiding to me include the way in which people communicate and get the job done.Doing this with 50-70 people is more difficult than 6.Really most of this social interaction(not idle chatter unless it is bolstering morale etc) is something that you would see develop over time and become focused on a raid .Not so much in attending raids here and there.Pretty subjective I guess.</div></div><hr />

I hope you dont really believe this bullshit? EP+ drops exceed all LDoN/GoD (single grp doable by people not having EP+ equipment). The only classes that even come close are casters because LDoNs can help with focus/FT. In the case of warriors this is absolute falsehood. Obviously you guys made no real efforts to farm Time if this is true. We used to let 125hp+ non-visible rot all the time. The highest non-visible LDoN item is like 80hp, btw. Now assuming you can aug it for hp and AC (unlike single slot Time 1-3 drops) you are still likely 20-40hp short and maybe flat AC. As far as GoD goes there are some decent 1grp achieveable non-visible drops but nothing better than high-end EP/Time (which are allowed to rot by a guild farming Time). As far as visible drops go, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO COMPETITION.<br />
<br />
And guess what it takes the average LDoNer over 30 hrs to get an item or about 6-8 raids. If you get 1/6 your rate is likely equal or better and you get better stuff. But that doesnt fit your argument. If I was in a time guild+ and had lower HP than a non-raider I would quit for embarrassment (assuming I had be in the guild for more than 3 months). Even with several gimped spots on my guy I am the 2nd highest non-raider on my server and would be #1 if I finished sturdy. Not because I am uber but rather because he fed off of the raid gravy train at some pt. There is simply little to no comparison between being in Time and being a non EP+ raider.<br />

<br />
The 135hp Tipt bracer is often an upgrade for Time-geared people, and I know plenty of people who're farming Time who wear the 140hp mask that drops off yard trash in Kod, or the 160hp Ring that drops off the Rav Wossname at the entrance to Ikkinz 9, or the ring from Yxtta or KT named.  You can get a 50hp augmentation from Kod Taz named that would make the KT mask 190hp or the Ikkinz ring 210hp.  Using nothing but LDoN-purchased items and GoD-dropped augments, you could be wearing 150hp arms or a 145hp hat.<br />
<br />
My gear doesn't have quite that many hp on it but that's because I've sacrificed augment slots for certain focus items necessary to a caster - but I do know warriors who made it into KT/Ikkinz without raid gear, so this is achievable for you as a non-raider.</div></div><hr />

Groovdog, you are understating things.  LDON offers many non-visible slots at 90-100hp.  In many slots this LDON gear was a vast upgrade over the previous best non-raid non-EP gear.  People can equip themselves quite well from such sources.</div></div><hr />

I guess I was a &quot;casual&quot;, who was so starved for content I joined a raiding guild. It was okay for a while, then the guild imploded and I haven't had the interest to restart. At this point, I'd cut my arm off before I'd sit for yet another Earth ring, or spend another 3 hours or whatever on a Saryrn/KoS backflag raid.<br />
<br />
But what pisses me off is the attitude of a lot of &quot;raiders&quot; that &quot;casuals&quot; haven't paid their dues. That's bullshit. When I was &quot;casual&quot; my playtime was certainly more than that of a lot of raiders -- it just wasn't leveraged the same way. There are plenty of casuals with AGGREGATE playtimes that exceed raiders. They either don't have it in sufficiently large blocks of time or they don't enjoy mass group raiding WHICH IS THE ONLY MEANS OF PROGRESSION. I certainly know plenty of time+ people who are complete morons, whose only qualification as an EQ &quot;uber&quot; is the ability and willingness to devote 4+ hours at a time several nights a week farming mind-numbingly boring rings or doing whatever the raid leader tells them to do. I worked HARDER as a casual trying to make do with less than I did as a raider -- and got a hell of a lot less to show for it. <br />
<br />
The gap in power between the camps is FAR FAR larger than the relative game time inputs.<br />
<br />
And there's the problem -- the fact that mass group raiding is ultimately the only way that exists to progress. If that's the kind of game SoE wants to sell, then fine -- I'm out. That's a pretty brutal limitation for a game, but if that's the way the game is played now, then I hope those of you left playing it enjoy yourselves. EQ didn't used to be all about that.</div></div><hr />

Will some casuals eventually stop loging in? You bet - they've got damned near nothing invested.<br />
<br />
Progress from a 4K HP level 65 Warrior to a 7k HP level 65 Warrior even just grouping is ABSOLUTELY possible. Some &quot;casuals&quot; won't make the effort and other despicable &quot;casuals&quot; try like mad to convince them it's impossible.<br />
<br />

Sorry BB, but this post is absolute crap. There are a world of people who you call casual who have a HELL of a lot more invested than &quot;damned near nothing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once again: the rewards for &quot;raiders&quot; and &quot;casuals&quot; are vastly, incomparably, immeasurably out of whack relative to game time inputs -- never mind just getting to look at new scenery. I've played the game at both levels, and that conclusion is simply inescapable.<br />
<br />
Progression in EQ is currently only about mass group raiding, unlike the EQ of the past, and I'm sorry to see the game become so self-limiting. PoP was a flat-out catastrophic release for the non-raider. <br />
<br />
P.S. Have to laugh to see BB say he'd quit if another LDoN type expansion were released, and then later offer LDoN to Gart as the answer to the non-raider's problems. It's not good enough for BB, but should serve to shut up the non-raiders?</div></div><hr />

And if someone wears Trakanon items?  Old VP items?  AoW items?<br />
<br />
Are their points invalid?<br />
<br />
If you progress through the game without the use of a raid, you are then doing &quot;non-raider&quot; progression, trying to invalidate it with any kind of excuse you can throw out there is completely unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

If you have items whose strength is not curerntly obtainable without a raid force then you are not in the demographic. You can buy or single group those items or items of equivalent level. It's not about the item itself, it's about the power it gives.</div></div><hr />

Pff, he was stuck with that situation 75 pages ago, and he's still trying to talk in circles so he doesn't have to admit that he was a fucking dumbass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">Well ,hopefully soe reinforces the group game.There are people popping up here like Fyn already that have made good gains in group upgrading they just need more alternatives.Course,we'll have to see what level 70 and Oow will bring.Personally,I think there is room for group progression in the game and hopefully more to come.However,I agree that soe's sense of balance has skewed towards the raid game.Not in terms of raider vs non raider gear quality(not getting into that balance in this post hehe),but, in terms of design philosophy.<br />
<br />
Imo the world shouldn't revolve so heavily around raiding at the high end(too late now I thk.They seem to expect eq 2 to solve this...erm),but, there has to remain a distinct differance in quality of gear between raiders and non raiders to make raid content justifiable.Like knights vs warriors in the mitigation argument;the exact ratios will always be in debate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">Groovdog, you are understating things.  LDON offers many non-visible slots at 90-100hp.  In many slots this LDON gear was a vast upgrade over the previous best non-raid non-EP gear.  People can equip themselves quite well from such sources.<br />
<br />
DOES EVERYONE MISS THE FACT THAT HE SAID HE IS A TIME GUILD???????????? Ok maybe not farming Quarm but that opens up realms of possibilities that a single grper dreams about at night. <br />
<br />
Comparing 1grpable LDON/lower GoD mobs (anywhere in the game) to EP+ raid drops is on average a weak argument and most of those GoD drops would be hard for a tank not already wearing some of that kind of stuff. THOSE TWO FACTS ARE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS THREAD!<br />
<br />
And yes there are some nice items in Tipt/KT but not as readily available as Time (when being farmed). I am also not debating that LDoN has good stuff relative to the past but not comparable to EP+ raid targets (as it should be in most if not all cases). That being said as far as LDoN goes you must be talking hard drops not AP buyable stuff. The Tak BP only has 100hp. There is no buyable non-visible item with more than 85hp (www.eqdiva.com if you dont believe me). My pally has the hard gloves and like them but nowhere near EP quality (as it should be).<br />
<br />
As far as HP goes, if you bothered to check the flags you would see EP, Time, KT, etc. This character has benefited from raiding but no longer does because I cant raid nights EST enough to qualify for a time guild on my server (hell even an EP guild for that matter). He is only high HP relative to non-raiders due to this fact. I routinely point out that he is unusual for the argument I am making (that one grpable content needs to be improved) but the point is if a prior raiding warrior can find much of this challenging or feeling somewhat capped in my weak slots just imagine how a non-raider feels. And for the record I am running my chanter in a pre-VT guild &quot;right now&quot; even though he is VT/EP flagged so I can relate to the older content today, not 2-3 years ago like some on this board. Farming insignias is boring for a chanter, btw :)<br />
<br />
As far as believing my bullshit I guess I can use allakhazaam better than you cause any fucking idiot can see what I am saying is true. If it wasnt, EVER RAIDER HERE WOULD BE BITCHING AND DOING THAT CONTENT IN THEIR OFF TIME OR INSTEAD OF RAIDS.<br />
<br />
And dont point to one item (a common raider fallacy) to show that things are great. If they are so great why do magelos of people in time for 3+ months of hard-core farming have none of it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Well if you make groupable stuff drop gear equal in quality to ep raid targets then you seriously undermine that part of raid progression that many guilds are still passing through.It seems this has been done to some extent already,just look at Fynepisa's magelo.It also makes no sense that 6 people can drop a mob that 60 of their fellows have difficulty with.Loot should reflect this differance in mob difficulty ,or, the game loses a sense of integrity and continuity.If loot quality has nothing to do with mob difficulty than what is the point of the game?...comparing magelos?We should all just solo and get = loot for however many hours we play then. :( <br />
<br />
The big dragon that can kill 60 of you and your mates should obviously drop a couple pieces of loot of much higher quality than one that is a challenge for 6 of you.<br />
<br />
Raid availability is part luck and part what you make it.You could raid on Stromm with your hours and playtime most likely if you so desired.You may have to begin in lower content with a guild coming up /shrug.Better that way Imo.</div></div><hr />
