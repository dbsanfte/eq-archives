We are an Elemental guild and average 5-6 warriors a raid....in my eyes this is planty considering we have a good batch of Sk's and Palies. If im wrong in my thinking ill be the first to admit i am but I thik we have plenty of warriors atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We feild about the same, sometimes less sometimes more.  I have noticed that we have a larger amount of knights then most of the other guilds on my server, so that helps out on those days when we only have 3-4 wars and they all go down.  We cycle through the knights while the wars get battle rezzed 8D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomercy</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We feild on average 5 warriors a raid( this is fact because i just came from our DKP board and figured it all up over the last 2 months) I didnt figure the knights but its safe to say we have anywhere from6-10 knigts per raid as well.  <br />
 <br />
Off topic Im not happy about reopening recruitment. I fell that until we cant progress  or lose members that we are ok. There has yet to be any mob in the Elm planes that has given us problems so i can only asume that the powers that be feel its better to be safe than sorry. The last thing i wanna be known for is being in a zerg guild. Sure there are a couple of classes we could use a few more but to reopen recruitment on a whole boggels my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first joined my guild (about 7 months ago), I was generally the only Warrior who raided.  They were pre-vindi, pre-WToV.  Now we are up to AL/HP/XtC and AoW and have about 6 full time Warriors who rarely miss raids (some recruited, some just started playing again).  Now, I'm 4th or 5th in line.  Kinda sucks not being needed, but I also can box a 63 Cleric, 65 Shammie or 62 Druid, so at least I have something to do when I'm not off-tanking.<br />
<br />
It really depends on how much your Warriors play.  IMO, my guild now has too many Warriors.  Most of us are just rangers without spells or good range DPS, hehe.  During bad AE fights (like AL), I often leave my Warrior out of the fight to conserve mana and in case he needs to emergency tank while we camp a cleric.  4-5 Warriors should be more than enough if they play frequently.  Not sure about how many are needed in upper PoP, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're averaging that many warriors and knights, keep tank recruitment closed to all but EXCEPTIONAL tanks. There's no reason to dilute the plate drops even more. Knights can offtank in EPs very nicely, as well as tank trash, and 5 warriors is plenty for any raid boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brackon</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having five warriors at the raid, and having five warriors capable of doing what needs to be done at the raid are two different things. Are all five of you equally equipped, or is there a desparity between a couple? <br />
<br />
 We typically field seven to eight Warriors per raid, all of which are capable of doing anything that is asked. It really just boils down to gear in the end.<br />
<br />
 If you have five warriors who are all geared well, I would say do not add anymore. You can easily use the hybrids for off tanks in PoP. The one thing you seriously want to watch out for is over crowding a class with GoD out there. That expansion is designed to maximize minimal people, so a lot of people get left out which causes a whole new set of issues.<br />
<br />
 If you do add someone, only add someone who comes in ready to go, gear and AA. Gonna take you too long to try and gear up a project at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had about 6 guild wars in PoP elem times.  But a ton of them went inactive.  We'd end up with lots of raids w/ only 1-2 wars.  So we recruited some more and then some came back.  Then we ended up with some nights in Time with 7-9 warriors, which is too many, or other nights where we could barely get 3 for TZ/VZ.<br />
<br />
Now we're generally getting 3-6 wars per raids and it semi-rare, but does happen, that we only get 2-3 wars for a raid, which isn't enough for most.  Our roster atm is around 13-14 warriors to get this kind of attendance tho..<br />
<br />
Those with Raex BPs, tier 5 legs, dbotw, etc don't log in as much anymore.  So it's mostly the lesser equipped wars that are most active.  We usually have 1-3 well equipped wars per raid, no more.  Out of about 6-7 well equipped.  2 just came back for GoD, 1 still gone, 1 left guild recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 5 warriors a raid, on most big raids. Sometimes one of our 5 wars doesn't show up, but usually its all 5.... Sometimes a few as 3. Usually 4 - 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has about 10 warriors only about half active but I agree with everyone 5-6 Warriors is plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomercy</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly i just looked and our guild has  20...yes 20 warriors   of those 7 are full time raiders 4 are inactive due to being in the military 6 hardly log on and if i had my way we would boot em and the other 3 are new. In other words  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is in EP atm, we average 4-5 per night. Occasionally up to 8 depending on prospects/friends and guildies that rarely log on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We require an attendance of over 90% for the duration of the application period (generally 6 weeks.) Seems to work well for us, if somebody plays that much they're bound to be an asset of the guild; and if they don't there's a trillion other warriors on our server to pick from.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah.....36 warriors 36 clerics.  In all seriousness, we have about 3-4 warriors per raid.....we need a couple more active ones though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most of the time my guild fields 3 of our own warriors, two from the guild we ally with ( all of them are 9k+ and at least 1500 ac)  I'm not counting tanks with less than 8.5k buffed hp and 1300 buffed ac.<br />
<br />
At current we can kill all the air avatars,  and are about at the gates of Fennin.<br />
<br />
Our MA (BoW, and almost 10k hp buffed with  1700 ish ac) plays about 70% of the time, but we make it work without him alot.<br />
<br />
We DO have freak nights with 10 ish warriors on, and most of these nights are really boring.<br />
<br />
Go with 5-6 wars, at max times, just tell your guild, ugh, no more lousy wars, get clerics!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we ahve 13 on our roster. regular attendance is about between 6-9 but there is some disparity with the top end ones over 11k and 2k ac and the lower ones like me just pushing 10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We generally average about 5-6 warriors a night, 4 of those are well equipped while two are a bit behind.  We also have a few stragglers who play when they can but nothing really consistant.  I refuse to recruit more at this point due to our large number of knights and I feel that 5-6 active warriors is a pretty good number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is about to open the app process and was wondering about how many warriors per raid do some of you guys get? <br />
<br />
Actually the key question is how good are those warriors (attendance/gear being set aside) that attend?  <br />
<br />
Do they actually get enough work as mt/st/rt to be sharp and step up to the plate when needed? <br />
<br />
If you get to a point where you have warrs hanging on as &quot;dead weight&quot;; aka warriors that don't get a shot frequently at doing their job as mt/st/rt/off tank then you have too many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have about 4 hard core raiding warriors. But about 8 are on when we kill RZ. How odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my guild there are only 2 atm, have had a few apps but they seem to just disappear due to RL stuff, So its usally me and our guild leader. I MT most of the time and i am enjoying but we really could use atleast 2 more imo (well Geared)..3Sks and 4 Pallies we just finished up doing RZ, We still clear out VT and are currently back flagging like crazy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">13 warriors on roster...<br />
<br />
2 are curently inactive<br />
1 has decided to take a break (Class leader and MA for last year)<br />
<br />
So that leaves 10 of us...we get usually 6 or 7 per raid..but HPs vary..1 tank over 10k, 1 at 9900, 1 at 9500, 3 at 9300, me at 9100, 1 at 9000, 1 at 8800 and 1 at 8000 :(<br />
<br />
Guild decided to DKP EP plate from the start, so warriors have to battle with 25+ other plate users for loot...I currently have no Raex despite being in EP for 10 weeks, mostly cos I blew all my DKP in VT before we got in EP :(<br />
<br />
So for us 6 to 7 warriors is needed, cos the lower HP ones tend to go splat very quick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Average is 5-6. When doing prime targets that drop juicy loot ir flags we usually got like 7-8 sometimes more. But our main tanks that are on like every day, bout 5.</div></div><hr />
