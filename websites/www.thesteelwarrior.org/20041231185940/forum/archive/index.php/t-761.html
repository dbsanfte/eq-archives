<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, am new to these Forums, have heard of for awhile, but didnt come here as much as I should.<br />
 <br />
Got a few questions for some of the other Mighty Warriors out there thoughout.<br />
<br />
First will start with some Background on myself.<br />
<br />
I am at Level 56 Dark Elf Warrior, In a Average Family Style / Raiding Guild, our Current Raids are ones such as, (Trak, VS, Va'Dynn, Old World Planes) (Upcoming Hopes of Vindi, Velk, Doom)<br />
<br />
Current Magelo (www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131975) <br />
<br />
I currently Have a Unbuffed AC of around 1125 and HP of about 2850.<br />
<br />
First Question is the Age Old AC or HP, based on the Mobs my guild Currently Takes and the Game as it is today.<br />
<br />
Wondering would it be more beneficial to Give up some AC for more Hp or Give up Some HP for More AC.<br />
<br />
Looking like would it be Good to Change out my Current Shoulders for say Choki Shoulders for the More HP.<br />
<br />
Other Question is Weapons, what weapons could be suggested for about say the 15K range or would I be good sticking with what I got, or if not what ones would you suggest selling.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you may be able to give me...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol I have the Pleasure of having no Bosses in Office today, and Boss called and told me to just look busy, so been reading boards, with work sitting in front of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are ally to CoV, you could do the draconic pauldrons quest in WW for a pretty good shoulder item and save the IGS for when resists are needed.  I'd replace the wolf claw earring with an earring of the solstice and the glimmering mithril torque with a clattering bone necklace.  I think that in those cases, the loss of AC is worth the HP that you'll gain.<br />
<br />
As for weapons, I have to recommend a frosty.  A friend of mine used a frosty/debility blade as an aggro combo for a long time and had extremely good control with them.  From what everyone is saying though, I'd be saving up for a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slagfest</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cloak of Maelstrom should be a good upgrade too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Weapons. Ditch the Bed Leg Club. Work on the epic and get a Frosty in the meantime. Sell that Great Maul of Hatred. On Zeb you would be able to get a Frosty with that sale.<br />
<br />
2) Gear. Hunt in UP and get the Moktor Legs. They will be a significant upgrade to your current ones. Get those or buy cultural or Thurg legs.<br />
<br />
Replace the wolf fang earring with the ME 4arms drop, Vah Shir Claw Earring. It is a fairly common drop and should only take you an hour of hunting (Do it at the Akheva zone) to get one.<br />
<br />
Do the Draconic Pauldrons quest if Ally to CoV.<br />
<br />
Get more Thurg gear (Helm and boots are better than what you currently have)<br />
<br />
3) Ac vs Hps. Conventional thought is for Pre-PoP get to 1250 AC then look for raw hps. I would recommend getting over 1200 unbuffed and then going hps.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the Advice, I picked up a Frostbringer last night, and will be watching for some of the other items, along with trying to camp the guy for the Clattering Bone Necklace.<br />
<br />
Should be getting Cultural Legs tonight 40 AC / 40 HP<br />
<br />
Which shoulders would be suggested as better the Draconic or Chokidai Hide Pauldrons.  Will be looking to get one of them, am almost Ally to CoV, and have the Boots and Gems sitting in Bank just waiting for me to hit Ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EgatBearskinner</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is The Appointed in HoT yet?  And if you guys aren't, why not?<br />
<br />
That armor is still worth the time spent in getting it, especially the gauntlets.  I know you are agnostic so that means there are a couple other pieces that would probably be a decent upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
Lemme know how that axe works out that I found for ya, I am especially interested in proc rates and if that little pique thing actually does what it is supposed to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes The Appointed is in HoT, we seemed to have had a Break recently, but were there before I got 55 and couldnt attend, but been once since I got 55, but picking back up alot more now and going again next week.  I have the Boots from HoT, just gotta get my Lazy butt the rest of the Faction I need, am Amiable to CoV right now.<br />
<br />
And so far from usage of the weapon, I was averaging 2-4 Procs per Fight last night while Duoing with my Brother (57 Cleric) in The Grey, the Proc does I think it was 50dd and Has message saying the Mob Twists in Anger.  Have yet to try with Full group with a Slower, but in the Duo, I held agro for the Full fights, no loss duing CH or anything.</div></div><hr />
