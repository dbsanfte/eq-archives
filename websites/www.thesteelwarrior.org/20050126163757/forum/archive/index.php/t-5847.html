We are starting to think about raiding some and it happend that at the moment i am the highest war in guild (yes we are lacking).  When all this talk started about raiding and me being main tank, i started getting nervous about my gear.  Can you guys have a look and tell me if i am doing ok.  The warrior wasn't my main until recently when i got bored with the 57 mage, 55 sham, and 53 cleric, LOL.  He has been sitting idle for about 5 months now.  <br />

Your gear is in better shape than mine was the first time I tanked Vindi / started raiding more seriously, so once you put a few more levels behind you your gear should hold up.  <br />

Look at replacing the bits of cobalt with more cultural and everything else is looking good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exuviae</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I just did the neck and arms, so only cobalt left is the helm and gauntlets.  The only problem is on xev they want 6-8K to craft a helm, 6-8K for the guantlets, and 12K to craft the 42 ac legs.  Right now I can't afford that =(  I am thinking of farming rings and stuff with my mage from veksar and selling that for the stuff.  Still seems high for those prices considering i paid 3K for the other peices!</div></div><hr />
