<br />
WTF?<br />
<br />
You can now put PROCS on your Plane of Time gear? <br />
<br />
That has to be wrong.<br />
<br />
It has to be type 8 can now take type 1 to 3 augments.<br />
<br />
Cause a warrior walking around with a Ykesha proc on three of his armors and an anger proc on 3 of his armors ... well, warriors may dig it, but it's kind of silly don't you think?<br />
<br />

LMAO .... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blech, just when I thought LdoN was cool, unless I misread the thread they saying the 40hp aug albeit replaced with a 50hp? aug is going to be some slot no one but th e&quot;upper&quot; folks will have?  how gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wubao is alright, he just has some strange ideas sometimes. But what do you mean about ykesha/anger proc on armor? They only go on weapons, unless take off your breastplate and start smacking things with it hoping it procs ykesha. And the augments are fine the way they are, they don't need to fix them. They need to fix some other things *cough* melee *cough*. Heck, they even need to fix the 2hb animations, as funny as it is watching wubao poke stuff with a staff, it's annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually they do need to fix some augments.  like a) they actually going on my fierce heraldic stuff<br />
<br />
b) the armour itself having agraphic although a nude ogre tanking Rz I guess would appeal to someone out there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dunno, putting a proc on your boots that could go off when you kick sounds like fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about Ykesha when you slam your shoulder into those pesky mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would be permafrost somthing or other so we could call it &quot;The cold shoulder&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How many of you have seen LDoN procs linked ?<br />
<br />
Nah refrase, how many HAVENT seen a LDoN proc ?<br />
<br />
Come one, how hard was the Primary/Secondary/Range to miss :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, they should leave cultural items alone! Wahh, you can't put a nice little +2sv disease augment on there.. Oh nos!  <br />
<br />
Be glad you can wear the stuff, because it sure does suck putting in the hours to get SS armor that is a bit worse then RZ/Trib cultural, when you can buy a full set for like ~40k or less.<br />
<br />
Yah, I'm bitter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bin I agree Dwarf cultural sucks ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, but even that is better then Wood Elf Karana Plate armor... oh wait, there was no culture stuff for us rare few =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The horrors of the deity armor arguement (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=734&amp;highlight=diety+armor) <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't pull it again thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All I am saying about Dwarf cultural is this.  Brellium is the second best under underfoot but they both have the same god damn stats.  It sucks I don't see why that is.  It makes no sense what so differant.  Bah why cant underfoot just be for warriors and give us some more HP than have mana on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Quit board camping me Emilia!<br />
<br />
I still don't like your armor augment ratio idea!<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
And yeah, LoK (now going by trmonk) was right, it was knee-jerk reaction before I stopped to think about it.<br />
<br />
Which is doubly stupid on my part since I've applied about four different procs already.<br />
<br />
We all have brain freezes from time to time.<br />
<br />
It's still a strange bit of coding for them to be implementing. A lot of people think it's going to SIMPLIFY the augment process, but I have a feeling it's going to break more than it fixes (I really don't trust SoE to fix its own code properly on patch day).</div></div><hr />

Yes, but even that is better then Wood Elf Karana Plate armor...  <br />
<br />
That's what you get for worshipping that candy ass god..oh wait  :mad:</div></div><hr />

At least you're half-elf and can wear the cultural. I, on the other hand got the shaman Cazic-Thule armor :mad:</div></div><hr />
