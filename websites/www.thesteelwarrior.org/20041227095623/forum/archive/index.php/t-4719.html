Looks like good stuff to me. Although, fellstrike seems like it fits in more with timer three than timer two. Not much of a difference, though.<br />
<br />
Also, thank you very much for stopping by. I really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw, the current reuse time for evasive at lvl 65 is around 7.5 minutes. Is the increased reuse time intentional?<br />
<br />
Just thought I would ask since you might un-intentionally have assumed defensive and evasive currently had the same reuse at 65 and thus given them the same reuse in the new system. <br />
<br />
But evasive is currently lower reuse than defensive because we get the evasive disc at an earlier level than defensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sineral</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heres my thoughts:<br />
it might be good to move spirit of rage to another timer. i can see a warrior using a timer1 disc(ie defensive), spirit of rage, and a dps increaser disc all in a single fight, especially a warrior who is not first in the tank order(or even the first war in the order if you do planned switches and dont kill him). the current setup locks out spirit of rage if you use any dps disc other than fellstrike.<br />
<br />
<br />
is there any reason why you set it up with 4 timers? would asking for 5 or 6 different timers be out of the question? its obvious why some discs share a timer, like the 3 timer1 discs, but something like spirit of rage could be put on it's own timer and not be overpowering imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you do switch any of them around, i'd like to see evasive/defensive/stonewall and spirit of rage and fortitude stay on 3 different timers. that way a tanking warrior has his basic 'take a beating' disc, an aggro boost disc(spirit of rage), and an 'oh crap a cleric died/went ld/went to watch tv' disc(fortitude) ready at all times.<br />
<br />
i'd also like to see healing will stay on a seperate timer from the dps discs, since dps discs are just about the only thing i (and i assume most other wars) use when soloing, and being able to toss healing will in w/o locking out any of the dps is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what is a tick again? 6 seconds?</div></div><hr />

I like where they have fellstrike now. I think this falls into the have-fun category :)<br />
<br />
If fellstrike was on timer 3 with aggressive it would never be used(in fact I cant even remember the last time I used fellstrike). But with fellstrike on timer 2, you can use aggressive as you normally would, and then finish off with some eyecandy high hits from fellstrike ;)<br />
<br />
In fact this unhooking of discs has me alot more excited than the opening system. There is alot of different tactical opportunities that opens up with the various combinations of AE taunt/fortitude/defensive/riposte you will soon be able to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, I'm excited about this also. I always get jealous over monks using disciplines over and over, whereas i'm inhibited by the though, &quot;I might need to /disc defensive on the next pulll...&quot; It will interesting to see some of the strategies we come up with once we have the option to experiment.<br />
As for the way they are broken down into separate timers, it's hard for me to really form the basis of an opinion without being able to experiment, but for the most part the distribution of discipline:timer looks about right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you asked me, I'd say that looks fine. All of the important discs are unlinked and put into categories of offensive, defensive, or utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is great that you guys are trying to improve the disciplines.  <br />
<br />
I think some of the timers need to be totally reconsidered though.  Waiting 45 minutes for a discipline that lasts 2 ticks is very annoying and it makes people not want to use it as much.  Considering how much the game has changed since the disciplines were first introduced, the benefits are still not really that much with a 2 tick duration discipline when you consider that a fight might last 10 to 20 minutes with 70 people pounding on a mob.  <br />
<br />
I think the disciplines with the 2 tick duration such as furious should either have a longer duration or a shorter reuse times.  12 seconds of riposte is not worth using if you have to wait 45 minutes to reuse it.  If it was 30 seconds use with a 30 minutes recharge or 12 seconds use with a 15 minute recharge it would be far more useful and fun to use.  Fun being the key point here because if I am hitting for 150 average a riposte vs. a mob with 500k hit points, there really isnt any way I will make a huge difference using it for 12 seconds or 30 seconds.  Also consider that basically furious is wasted if the mob goes out of range or summons me when I am using it and then I have to wait 45 minutes to use it again as it is now.  If something messes up positioning, it doesn't last long enough to reposition and try to continue to use it.<br />
<br />
Ideally, I think all of the disciplines would all be between 30 seconds and 3 minutes duration and 5 minutes to 30 minutes recharge and every one on a separate times so you could stagger them for a little variety at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:  Oh and I forgot to add this but I would love to see a numerical countdown timer for disciplines like defensive with some way to transmit the time remaining to your group or raid.  <br />
For example:<br />
  &quot; /rs My defensive drops in /senddisctimer seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Bonequest tells the raid, My defensive drops in 22 seconds&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At last the offensive disciplines becomes useful again, I always saved my Discs for Defensive, Furious or Fortitude.<br />
<br />
As had been mentioned, Fellstrike is misplaced IMO.<br />
<br />
Some minor tweaking of the disciplines themselves could be done.<br />
For example, I think Resistant and Fearless should have their refresh timer cut in half since they really are minor disciplines. Possibly have them start at 60 minutes as they do now and reduce to 15 minutes at level 65.<br />
<br />
This should apply for all classes with those disciplines - Yes, even *gasp* hybrids.<br />
<br />
Possibly let /disc Fearless be able to break a fear as well, when engaged, would make it useful in a dungeon if some MOB casts Fear on you, so you don't run away bringing a train on your group.<br />
<br />
Possibly also raise the max resists that the discipline Resistant gives, lets face it, +10 to all resists might be nice back when introduced, but the resist system has been rewritten since then and MOBs have been given much more potent spells.<br />
I don't think +25 at level 65 would be all wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's about it though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My opinions:<br />
<br />
Evasive, Defensive, Stonewall. Thats a logical timer group, but would like to see evasive refresh lowered to its normal reuse.<br />
<br />
Timer 2 fellstrike doesnt seem to logically fit here. I would prefer it moved to a &quot;short burst&quot; category, leaving fort and furious as the get out of jail free disc category. Perhaps bring it down to 30 minute reuse.<br />
<br />
Timer3 I would prefer to see aggresive and precise moved to their own category for a sustained dps disc. This seems logical to me that short defensive discs are seperate from the defensive duration discs. I would also like to see spirit of rage placed elsewhere. Move fellstrike to this category making the final disc listing: charge, fellstrike, mightstrike and put all to a 20 minute timer.<br />
<br />
Timer4 resistant, fearless, healing will makes sense. The first two arent used often outside of special instances, healing will would get alot more use in day to day situations for xp groups and such.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, I would prefer seeing Aggresive and Precise moved to their own category, 23 min is fine but naturally, wouldn't mind seeing a slight decrease on the re-use. I would like to see Spirit of Rage moved to an independant timer, leaving everything else the way it is. Would be nice to be able to use any discs we want but then have spirit of rage available in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Of course, if disciples can be activated simutaneously, then leave fellstrike on timer2 so i can mightstrike with it. :P<br />
<br />
Quite excited about all of this though.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to see Spirit of Rage moved to timer 4 with the other &quot;utility&quot; disciplines as well as it's timer changed. 30minute recharge for 12 seconds is a bit out of line.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike should be with charge/mightystrike.<br />
<br />
A 5th timer with Aggressive/Precision would also make sense as they're the &quot;longer&quot; offensive disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious and fortitude should never last longer than they already do, theyre 'oh shit' discs, I wouldnt even lower the reuse time on them personally<br />
<br />
I could see lowering the timers or lengthening the duration on mightystrike / fellstrike and the like maybe, but furious and fortitude are melee immunity discs for the most part and would hurt the game if they were lengthened.<br />
<br />
Raising duration on fearless to 3min would be very nice, then we would have to make a decision of whether to use fearless or defensive / evasive on CT, Inno etc.. Why we never got the fearless AA I will never understand heh, even making warcry 3min would be very nice, even if it was self only<br />
<br />
I also hope evasive being raised to 10.5min was an oversight, its been my disc of choice for quite awhile simply because of the reuse, I would rarely if ever use it with a 10.5min reuse timer opting for the new lvl 65 disc in every encounter I can think of offhand including xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really dumb question- But I can't seem to find a description of what the post 60 disc's do?<br />
<br />
I understand Stonewall is some sort of long duration defensive disc, possibly better then defensive and evasive, and that Spirit of Rage is some sort of aggro increasing disc, but I missed healing will, and the numbers/etc on the first two?<br />
<br />
My apologies if this information is posted elsewhere. I don't see it on Lucy or on Search, although I could just be an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spirit of Rage increases your Agro Multiplyer by 50% (meaning you do 1.5 as much agro as before...).  From what Frodlin and others say, this stacks with the Voice line from SKs (max 12%...probably the Visage line from Enchanters too, max 10%) and the Time BP for warriors (15%).  It affects increases the amount of agro you generate during that time...50% is huge, IMO.  Apparently it affects Provoke as well.<br />
<br />
Healing will is a 100hp/tick for 5 ticks regen with a 5minute re-use.  Not bad for an occasional boost to top you off.<br />
<br />
Stonewall is the same as Defensive, same duration and re-use.  The difference is instead of lowering the amount of damage you do as a balance, it snares you instead. (You become like stone...stone isn't very mobile on it's own, you know :D)  So you get the defensive ability, and you can still do your normal damage, but you can't move around easily...but hey, if you decide to corner the mob, you aren't moving anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumb</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks wonderful, thanks again for posting to keep us in the loop, and for letting us have a voice in the changes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot... Yeah, that works out well. Spirit of Rage and Stonewall, I mean, I can't see using Healing Will at my level of play, but I can definately see it being usefull to non-raiding warriors.<br />
<br />
Stonewall seems awesome, if you are in a situation where ping-pong won't be a factor. I could see this killing a shammy who decided to cast slow from halfway across the zone in an exp group setting.  And that may not even be a factor with Belittle. But it will only kill stupid/careless slowers (IE, someone casting slow on incoming on a mob that NEEDS Stonewall), and quite frankly, I'd rather get a DPS then a stupid/careless slower.<br />
<br />
Rage could so be overpowered if it wasn't such a short disc... with it affecting the Provoke line, it should be very usefull on raid level mobs, as well as a miniboss in an xp group. I would almost suggest a longer duration at the expense of less of a % upgrade, to give more of a chance of an aggro proc... But with the provoke line basically garunteeing an aggro proc, I can see the uses.<br />
<br />
Healing Will would be great on a 5k warrior farming Kael for Armor, for example. I don't see it helping a 9k warrior xping in Elementals, but not all discs need to be aimed at the higher level warriors.<br />
<br />
In short... I think this could be a really good job, Rytan and the Rest. I have to say, assuming this work as I seem to think they will, Good Job.</div></div><hr />

 10 was garbage when it was new also=P Anyhoo, right now on test it's 20 to resists after level 38. 5 min duration. Should really be 50ish resists methinks though.<br />

I'd say leave it in the set that it's currently in.  I do like the idea of a 5th set for utility.  The more you open up the more that's going to get used.  Already I can see which disc's I'm going to want to leave up over other skills in that disc set...just like defensive is now just on a larger scale.</div></div><hr />

I guess that's to avoid problems like ghost refreshes when you die before a disc runs out and such.</div></div><hr />

Cut the re-use time on Fearless and Resisant in half.<br />
<br />
Much as I'd like to have a lower refresh on Furious and Fortitude, they are &quot;oh shit&quot; discs and the timers should probably stay as is.<br />
<br />
Healing Will - any chance to boost that to like 200 or 300 a tick for 5 ticks or extend that 100 a tick out to 10 ticks?  500 hp of healing for a 60+ warrior is minimal, even for those who aren't in Elemental/Time gear.  It's not like 1000 hp of self-healing is gonna make a huge difference either but it is a bit more effective.<br />

-edit- or go with what Demorgoth said and a % heal for Healing Will<br />

A percentage would be good, but 1% on a 10K tank equals 100 hit points... 10% would be a better option, still only 1k on a 10K tank but on a 5K does 500.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What me wonder about is the reuse timer on Mighty Strike.  It's already been halved, me knows, but still too long.  Now, if Crits were not inherently broken, perhaps this would be a good reuse time, but when the average crit is for far less than max normal damage this reuse will make it unused to keep open for other discs on that timer.  I think it's a really fun discipline and use it on the last mob of any LDON...heh...when I know I'm gonna sit for an hour splitting loot and getting another group/adventure.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps you would consider just looking in to fixing critical hits?<br />
<br />
you slash for 252<br />
you slash for 236<br />
you kick for 42<br />
you slash for 89<br />
Raznok has critically hit for (89)<br />
um....yippee!<br />

I also would like to see Spirit of Rage with the other utility discs on Timer 4. It makes way more sense to get it out of the group of Offensive discs.  I also think that it would be nice to group the long term offensive discs on their own timer.  Group them like Defensive Discs, OMFG Discs, Short Burst Offensive Discs, Utility Discs, Long Term Offensive Discs.  Makes more sense that way.<br />
<br />
Now about Fellstrike, I'm kind of torn.  What someone said about keeping Fellstrike with the oh shit discs and being able to use back to back offensives discs does make sense.  You could hit Mighty Strike, then fell strike.  Or Fell then Aggressive, etc., in any combination you want.  Dunno, now.  I'm kind of liking that idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't believe people are getting all this -- and worrying about the evasive timer. Maybe evasive shouldn't have been cycling when it did. The new system looks great and stands on its own. If we lose 3 mins on evasive recycling, big deal.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant believe people are actually advocating moving fellstrike to the same timer as aggressive. Do you actually use fellstrike over aggressive currently, and if so why? Moving fellstrike to timer 3 just means it would never get used.<br />
<br />
Besides maybe Coirnav there are NO mobs where it would ever be better to use fellstrike over aggressive.<br />
<br />
Quick math:<br />
You do X dps.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike:<br />
Extra damage generated = 2 ticks * x * 100% = 2x<br />
<br />
Aggressive<br />
Extra damage generated = y ticks * x * 33% = y * 0.33x<br />
<br />
Solving for y we see that after 6 ticks(36 seconds) the 2 discs will have generated the same amount of extra damage. Any ticks after that is FREE extra damage for aggressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Timer 5<br />
Precision - Level 57 - 30 ticks - 23 minute reuse<br />
Aggressive - Level 60 - 30 ticks - 23 minute reuse<br />
<br />
Option 2<br />
<br />
Timer 1<br />
Evasive - Level 52 - 30 ticks - 10.5 minute reuse<br />
Defensive - Level 55 - 30 ticks - 10.5 minute reuse<br />
Stonewall - Level 65 - 30 ticks - 10.5 minute reuse<br />
<br />
Timer 2<br />
Furious - Level 56 - 2 ticks - 45 minute reuse<br />
Fellstrike - Level 58 - 2 ticks - 25 minute reuse<br />
Fortitude - Level 59 - 2 ticks - 45 minute reuse<br />
<br />
Timer 3<br />

Spirit of Rage - Level 61 - 2 ticks - 30 minute reuse<br />
<br />
With Option 1 put Fellstrike with the other short burst offensive discs, and move the longer term offensive discs, Aggressive and Precision, to another timer.  Some might say this would be overpowering, but you can probably mitigate that by making the endurance cost for Aggressive and Precision high, which would make sense anyway since you're using them for a long time.  This would prevent back to back powerful offensive discs.  Also with option 1 spirit of rage would be moved to timer 4 with the other offensive discs.<br />
<br />
Option 2 is if the devs don't want to move Aggressive and Prec to a different timer.  Then I would advocate LEAVING Fellstrike where it is with the &quot;oh shit&quot; discs, and just moving Spirit of Rage to time 4.  <br />
<br />
I like option 1.  That way you can use a good offensive disc, maybe have a cool down to regen endurance, then use some shorter burst offensive discs, or use your defensive discs etc.  I think it gives the most flexibility with the new system.  But I do think at the very least Spirit of Rage needs to be moved to the timer 4 with the utility discs.  It makes no sense where it is right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the MT they can choose to up initial agro, use an &quot;oh shit&quot; disci to settle in, then pop defensive/stonewall/evasive, while allowing a warrior who will most likely never be MT in the encounter the options of chaining 2 offensive disci's. <br />
<br />
i like it, i like it alot, just as it is. i dont want to be able to do everything with seperate timers, i like the idea of having to make choices and sacrifices while STILL being able to do alot more than we can currently.</div></div><hr />

Fellstrike - Level 58 - 2 ticks - 25 minute reuse<br />
Mighty Strike - Level 54 - 2 ticks - 30 minute reuse<br />
Charge - Level 53 - 3 ticks - 20 minute reuse<br />
<br />
in this setup, timer5 is the burst dps discs, and timer3 is the extended dps discs. putting those two different types of discs on seperate timers makes sense, and with 20-30 min recycle timers letting a warrior chain 1 burst disc + 1 extended disc is not overpowered imo.<br />
<br />
spirit of rage on timer4 with the other utility discs make more sense, will allow a better mixing and matching of disc combos, and again is not overpowering.<br />
<br />
some variations on this could be to move furious and fortitude to timer4 with the utility discs, since immunity to melee is sort of an utility type ability, and would force a warrior to make strategic decisions on which type of utility is best for the current fight(hmm, use fearless now, or wait and save fortitude incase something eats a cleric), and would result in only 4 different timers again(if that matters). another variation is to put fortitude and furious on timer4 and then move spirit of rage to timer2 all by itself.<br />
<br />
i like the healing will discipline just as it is. with its fast 5 min recycle, and availability to mnk and rog also, it looked like they were trying to throw a bone to soloing pure melee. 500hp every 5 minutes is equal to 10hp/tick regen, thats like tossing a free mini fungi tunic on us pure melee soloers, or giving us 1 free bandage every minute. you definitly dont need a healing disc in group and raid situations, you already have healers there. and fortitude/furious cover any short duration healing mishaps, if you're missing heals for longer than that you're screwed anyway(they arent going to give us a 10k hp over 2 ticks disc for example). so i like healing will as it is, it will make a noticable improvement in our ability to solo when we're bored or cant get a group and wont be overpowered even in that context imo.<br />
<br />
i also think asking for our dps discs to refresh any faster than listed above is asking for too much. we're not a big dps class, we're a tanking + decent dps class. thats why our tanking discs have fast refreshes and the damage discs have long refreshes. 1 burst dps disc + 1 extended dps disc both inside a 30 minute window is already 4x what we can do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ONLY offensive discipline worth using at all for us as they stand is Aggressive... The rest are simply to short a duration and completely unreliable (too much luck is involved)...  Fellstrike is a perfect example..  Ive used this discipline a TONNE when Im bored hoping for that ever elusive MASSIVE crippling hit.  its duration is FAR too short and its reliance on regular skill checks make it an utterly useless skill.  The only exception being when your REALLY really bored and want to see how high much damage a fellstrike crippling hit can do.<br />
<br />
After a quick look...<br />
<br />
The Timer1 set looks good but I gotta ask why Evasive got its wings clipped?...   It was hardly overpowered as it was and the extra bit of time made it marginally more useful (in certain situations) than defensive.  Clipping it back has made it on par with Defensive thereby removing any REAL choice....  Most warriors will take the noticeable damage decrease rather than the increase in misses/procs... /shrug  As to the rest:<br />
<br />
Timer 2<br />
Fellstrike - Level 58 - 2 ticks - 25 minute reuse<br />
<br />
is a joke... If this were a spell it would be on page50 or deleted...<br />
If it were 4 ticks with an increase melee skill check of say 65 ot 75 than I could see it being somewhat worthwhile from time to time. <br />
Really this discipline should allow to unload GODLY damage in a very compressed period of time.  As it stands it not even remotely worth using and is in dire need of a revamp.<br />
<br />
Timer3<br />
Charge - Level 53 - 3 ticks - 20 minute reuse<br />
Mighty Strike - Level 54 - 2 ticks - 30 minute reuse<br />
Precision - Level 57 - 30 ticks - 23 minute reuse<br />
Aggressive - Level 60 - 30 ticks - 23 minute reuse<br />
Spirit of Rage - Level 61 - 2 ticks - 30 minute reuse<br />
<br />
I cant even recall the last time I used any of these.  Mighty strike is basically good for a laugh and thats pretty much it...  Even unhooked from other disciplines im not sure how often I would use it.  Making it even MORE useless you hooked it onto the same Timer as Spirit of Rage... Now I dont know about anyone else but personally Charge/Mighty/Precision would NEVER be used as they currently are AND at the cost of graying out a 50% aggro multiplier.  If you want to make these WORTH using you have to scale them to that which we give up in using them...  eg.  Make it WORTH loosing a 50% aggro multipler for 20-30 minutes.  As it stands right now with Aggressive hooked on the same timer as Spirit of Rage I would REALLY have to rethink EVER using that discipline at the cost of NOT having Rage up for 23 minutes.<br />
<br />
Idea... Move Spirit of Rage to Timer4 maybe? :)<br />
<br />
Timer4<br />
Resistant - Level 30 - 50 ticks - 30 minute reuse<br />
Fearless - Level 40 - 10 ticks - 30 minute reuse<br />
Healing Will - Level 63 - 5 ticks - 5 minute reuse<br />
<br />
Heh sorry but is this another joke?  30 minute refreshs for level 40 disciplines that basically NO-one post 55 or 60 can even remember using... (Wait I think the last time I used Fearless was against Gorenaire... and I realized than how utterly useless it was) Discipline Resistant Im not even sure of the last time I used..<br />
And on to the new one... Healing Will; 100hp per tick over 5 ticks is nice for ooo a monk maybe... but for a WARRIOR?... thats a drop in the bucket... Hell at 63 with regular gear this is going to do exactly NOTHING for you.  It wont decrease downtime... it wont save you ascii in a bad situation.  If it were 500hp per tick over 2 ticks I could see it being useful in a clutch (eg when your not quite sure if that cleric CH is gonna land on time)  Even make it 500hp per tick over 4 ticks make it a HUGE stamina drainer... Now if your thinking, &quot;Well thats kinda cool but essentially it would be that if you used this discipline judicously chances are you would NEVER die&quot; you COULD slap on some more fields to it to limit its usefulness.  For example if the intent on this is to decrease downtime than slap a &quot;decrease melee mitigation by 75&quot; and &quot;decrease movement by 75&quot;... Its a good idea... I just think that the current incarnation of the idea is well in the same category as Fellstrike and Mightystrike... Kinda cool but essentially useless. heh if you REALLY want to make it so its downtime only slap a deaggro on it :)<br />

So yes Stonewall is better than Defensive because more DPS is still more DPS.<br />
<br />
As for healing will, 100/tick looks a bit weak, but I don't think it was intended to be an actual heal you count on to save yourself.  It's just extra HPs that you otherwise won't have if the opportunity represents itself.  And who knows, maybe there are focus or AAs that improve that.  % heals aren't a good thing for pure melees to have.  Just look at Mend.  I'm sure it was not originally designed to heal for 4000+ HP on a critical mend.  I think it'll be great if healing will starts at 100/tick and you can get say a 25% +healing focus that's tradeable, and work your way up there.</div></div><hr />

Woo these changes look terrific to me.<br />
<br />
Ditto all that would like to see Spirit of Rage moved the the &quot;Utility Timer&quot; - I don't see why it belongs where it's listed up top.<br />
<br />
I think I've only ever used Fellstrike once, and Mighty Strike a few times.  I generally burn one &quot;Eye Candy&quot; disc a night, on the last pull.  The timer refreshes while I bank, hit the bazaar, get buffed the next day ... I like Charge, it's prettier.<br />
<br />
I dunno if this is what I prefer, but here's a notion to spark some thought.  It may be duplicated above already, apologies if so.  So far as I see, it's in line with many of the suggestions already here.<br />
<br />
Timer 1: The &quot;Can't Touch This!&quot; timer.  The MT stuff.<br />
Evasive<br />
Defensive<br />
Stonewall <br />
<br />
Timer 2: The &quot;Whittle It Down&quot; timer.  The rogue lite stuff.<br />
Precision<br />
Aggressive<br />
<br />
Timer 3: The &quot;Flawless&quot; timer.  The 100% Guarantee (limited time only!)<br />
Fortitude<br />
Furious<br />
Charge<br />
<br />
Timer 4:  The &quot;Pinball&quot; timer.  The eye candy - fun stuff, when it hits.<br />
Mighty Strike<br />
Fellstrike<br />
<br />
Timer 5: The &quot;Utility&quot; timer.  Utility!<br />
Resistant<br />
Fearless<br />
Healing Will<br />
Spirit of Rage<br />
<br />
Timers and refreshes ... largely look okay to me.  The tanking timer could possibly use a tweak.<br />
<br />
The new discs look nifty ... I can, for example, foresee the MT using Defensive while the MOB gets positioned, with the ST ready to Stonewall if he falls.  Fun, fun stuff.<br />
<br />
I don't do a lot of raids yet, but I've only seen a few full raids MOBs jostle during an encounter, tho I've seen warriors pop defensive while they take 20 seconds or so to put MOBs in the right position.  Or scenarios like the named in Storms where they never stand still and there aren't corners available to drag them to.  And so I figger Stonewall fits in nicely as a &quot;situational&quot; tank disc.<br />
<br />

anyway leave evasive on a shorter refresh add at 62 a eveasive disc like stonewall the lets us keep our dps but snares us call it shadow form or something make the mob think their are 3 of me and he tries to hit the other 2 shadows, but im moving so fast to keep the showdows up i cant move anywere else.<br />

add one at 64 for dps combine fellstrike mightystrike charge. call it strike of anger or something 3 ticks or 5<br />

I really appreciate the devs taking time to post here and like an earlier poster, I'm more excited by the new disc options than I am about the openings system.  <br />
<br />
I agree that some of our really old disciplines need to be looked at because they're basically useless, but overall I'm very happy to see the changes they're working on now.<br />
<br />
Of course how useful having the disciplines divided up like this is dependent on the endurance costs being reasonable.  Hopefully they are.</div></div><hr />

I am not very impressed with what I have seen from the opening system, but then with the 1 DI reduction mitigation boost, the provoke line, and the untethered disciplines, that hardly matters.  The new disciplines are also quite pleasant surprises.  <br />
Ohh on a side note, it appears that the mitigation boost lowers DI across the board, as I was frequently being hit for 1 damage on my level 25 testbuffed warrior vs level 20-25 mobs.  These mobs hit for over 50, so the only way to get a min hit of 1 that I can think of would be for N to be able to be 0.  <br />
Reliable aggro to start a fight, innate mitigation boost, and unlinked revamped disciplines ... life is good.  I am going to treat the openings as just a bit of lagniappe.</div></div><hr />

Also...I'll say it again...heaping fell strike with the other offensive disc's currently are will hamper your options to use your disc's in a fully offensive way; it would make the other disc's in that group get used less.</div></div><hr />

I love the concept of this... I think the execution of it loves a TONNE to be desired...  This will be novel for o about the first use... After that I can see it falling into the Charge, fearless etc category.<br />
<br />
One of two things need to happen to it to make it even marginal desirable to use;<br />
<br />
A big BURST of hp at the risk of snare or immobilization. Say on the order of 500 per tick for 3 ticks with 100% movement decrease and a slight avoidance decrease (20% or so).<br />
<br />
eg. Get out of jail-free-or-when-that-ch-might-be-a-tad-late card...  Use wisely its a lifesaver...<br />
<br />
OR (and my preference is for this)<br />
<br />
A very slow but long increase of HP.  Something like 100hp per tick over 15 ticks.  85% movement decrease, massive endurance cost (it should you know.. Your FOCUSing your mind to close the wounds... thats GOTTA be taxing) blah blah.<br />
<br />
About all I know is that I cant really think of a situation post63 where this would even be marginally useful as a discipline  the way it is currently.<br />
<br />
Khvok and Rytan PLEASE look at this more closely...</div></div><hr />

A good number of 63 warriors don't have over 5khp unbuffed, nor are they dealing with 500hp/tick DoTs.  I agree it should be tuned in size/duration/re-use a bit to make it more worth using, but I do not agree it should be an end game toy.<br />

No it won;t be useful in raiding, i completly agree.  It might be interesting in LDoN however . . . at least if you are snoring through a normal adventure.  I only get healed every 3 mobs, with this maybe i can make that 4 mobs hehehe.</div></div><hr />

I agree it should be dropped, but im sure it wont be dropped in elemental where only 2% of warriors can get it, but then again it needs to be dropped off rune drop mobs ect but at a much rarer rate as you are only dealing with 3 classes instead of 13 or so. 5k hps is a joke to get at level 63, exp if you have nd 3 and planar durability.  You have to realize that level 60 was the cap for 2 years, where most people who havent started recently, were level 60 by the end of luclin at the very latest.  61+ discs are obviously going to be tagged toward pop since pop added those levels, and with 5k hps unbuffed you really cant tank shit outside of tier 1.  Once you get to that point 500 hps is 100% useless, and althought it may be of minimal use in ldon you have to remember that pop granted levels 61-65 so the discs will be tagged toward pop content, not ldon.<br />
<br />
Also about the 500 a tic dot, grummus is 300 a tic i believe, behemoth is 4k dd.  Its quite apparantly that huge aes start early in pop so you really dont have much of an arguement there.</div></div><hr />

4800 hp's with 47(minimal?:p)AA doesn't = 5khps - and this character of yours must've been farming HoT for quite a while to have near full Myrmidons,  is obviously a Barb or Ogre to get 240 plus strength and Stamina, not to mention had plenty of cash for the Bloodmetal earrings etc. :p<br />
<br />
Face it, 5Khp is not quite so simple to get as you've assumed when you're levelling up into the end game - especially playing casually. The amount of time 'casual' players put into raising funds, camping components, questing items to allow them to compare favourably with their Uber guild brethren is pretty staggering really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are assuming that a person can use racial armor . . . . I am dwarf and agnostic.  Many warriors myself included say once you ding 60 continue on to 65 before getting any aa, except maybe run3.  In all liklyhood you will see warriors with under 5khp's and level 63, but they were the unfortunates who chose no diety, and are not in uber raiding guild, you also missed a step with Champ's armor from kael.  I am not going to sit here and debate you, just acknowldge that simply there are many warriors out there who don;t worship RZ, and are in guilds who prob can;t make it through HoT without wiping; but they can grind in the mess we know as BoT, PoD, etc once they get buffed enough.</div></div><hr />

5k+ hp at 65 is above average.<br />
<br />
Im sorry but this I actually have some difficulty believing... at 65 I had FAR above 5k hp and I wasnt in any hardcore raiding guild... I was slogging it out in Valor IN myrmidons (heck that gear isnt far off from what I DID have) grinding out AA's etc...<br />
<br />
P.S<br />
<br />
I left Kael out figuring that its often seems to be bypassed completely for some reason (difficulty mabbe) and due to the fact that I never had one piece of cultural or Champ armor... heh  o and btw... grinding out 47 aa isnt that hard... Good valor group you can grind out 2-3 aa a session.<br />
<br />
Rather than create ANOTHER post on this here's something for you to mull over...  Your logic is a tad flawed.  You start with the premise that because the level of the disc is 63 than that is what it should be based on... For the most part I would agree with you WERE the discipline ramped UP at 65.  Unfortunately it is not.  By your logic you think (unless I misunderstand) that because roughly 3-4k is the average HP for a 63 warrior than  the discipline is fine as it stands...  Here's the thing.. While I (and others) approach this from the stand point of an END game warrior (base hp of 7.5K+ give or take) and you approach from a &quot;casual&quot; player point of view.... <br />
<br />
Casual: Neat disc... Helps with downtime... and damn thats a lot of hp being healed... Like it just fine any improvement to it would make it LoH or Mend type.<br />
<br />
Raider/Highend:  What garbage... Im tanking stuff that is hitting me 3x that in a ROUND.  Heck it barely worth pressing to lessen downtime other than for laugh.  This needs tuning a HUGE way to be even worth considering using.<br />
<br />
Those, in a nutshell, are the two viewpoint being expressed (admittedly I could have expressed it better)...  The thing is that concentrating on the fact that the LEVEL of the discipline is 63 is extremely shortsighted.  Sixty-three comes and goes in the blink of an eye and make no mistake, this IS an &quot;endgame&quot; discipline&quot;.<br />
As it stand this is a discipline (Healing Will) that when you get 63 youll pop it a few times, think, &quot;Neat...&quot; and probably never use it again.   Than you'll hit 65... Maybe come into some better gear.. Punch Healing Will and think, &quot;Wow damn... that really does jack now... gay discipline...&quot;  The point is that the UTILITY of a new discipline shouldnt be based solely on the level at which you get it... But also on the levels above and the potential increases that a given character might see over that time.  Otherwise your simply saying, &quot;This is a 63 discipline.. As such it will be balanced according to the base hp of the casual 63 player... It shall be static and unchanging.&quot;, rather than, &quot;PC's gear and base HP changes dramatically from level 63 to 65, as such this discipline will be balanced with that in mind...&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
All im trying to say is that Healing Will SHOULD be ramped from 63-65... For alot of warriors right now this discipline as it stand is, essentially, useless.<br />
<br />
Barring the extremely casual players of course :D</div></div><hr />

Especially your comment on not being able to tank stuff higher than Tier 1 with under 5k hp unbuffed is laughable.  My beastlord tanks PoStorms with 3k unbuffed with 50% slow, I fail to see how a Warrior could not.  If the giants are slowed 75%, I could even tank in BoT with my current AAs.<br />
<br />
You can get 63 in a week, without even stepping higher than PoV/PoS.  Yes, under 5k at 63 is entirely possible and is definitely done.  People don't skip Kael because of difficulty (if you think Kael is difficult then what the hell are you doing in the planes?), they skip it more because the drop rate is pathetic and now LDoN makes things even more easier than sitting in a corner pulling giant after giant hoping for a random drop you might need, then camping gems hoping you get three of the ones you need (because they're selling in the bazaar for 300-500 a pop).<br />
<br />
No, I do not play a warrior, until these changes there's nothing at all special about them except /disc defensive/evasive.  That's it, anyone else can do the exact same job, and I regularly do.  However my comment was based on your point about Healing Will needing to heal 2500hp to be useful at all to a warrior that can use it.  That's almost a LoH over time (LoH without AA upgrades is about 3k, give or take a few hundred hp), and I know many many great warriors who do not fit your &quot;this is how things are&quot; ideals, some are 65 and are just NOW reaching around 4.5k unbuffed.  I can only assume you're clueless about what is in fact possible thanks to PoP/LDoN.<br />
<br />
uhm exactly... if your not in TOV-NtoV equivalent armor by the time your 63 AND or some racial armor (which should on its own put you at or around 5khp unbuffed) than that means your still running around in what? Crusty?.... Cobalt? Gaurdian armor?... I mean seriously... Thurg, LDoN...various other mix and match pieces, for the most part.  And before you make a comment on just get Tak/Mir LDoN armor, here's a little clue in for you.  Did you know that below 60, you don't even get 30 points per win?  You have to be over 60...perhaps even 63-65 to even start getting enough points per win to not spend 3 weeks getting one damn piece of armor.<br />
<br />
Not everyone has 50k+ to spend on equipment either...two bloodmetal earrings and two valoriums?  Bloodmetals are 20k on my server, and Valoriums are 6-8k thanks to the recent price rise.  You'd be lucky to find 4kpp on some of these warriors, although LDoN is helping there.<br />
<br />
4800 hp's with 47(minimal?)AA doesn't = 5khps - and this character of yours must've been farming HoT for quite a while to have near full Myrmidons, is obviously a Barb or Ogre to get 240 plus strength and Stamina, not to mention had plenty of cash for the Bloodmetal earrings etc.<br />
     Face it, 5Khp is not quite so simple to get as you've assumed when you're levelling up into the end game - especially playing casually. The amount of time 'casual' players put into raising funds, camping components, questing items to allow them to compare favourably with their Uber guild brethren is pretty staggering really. I agree with that statement wholeheartedly.  When you're a casual player, you don't have time for 8 hour farming sessions.  You're playing because you want to have fun.  You spend a lot of your limited time camping stuff and getting exp.  I applaud LDoN ,and to a lesser extent PoP, on the fact casual people can actually get nice exp AND decent equipment only playing a few hours a day not having to camp some freaking rare drop/mob or conflict with someone else's farming for the bazaar.  I also applaud LDoN for actually putting some money in the pockets of lower levels (especially clerics).<br />
<br />
Check out the reuse time on Healing Will.  5 minutes.  It's designed to be used often, where a smaller amount of healing is beneficial.  I agree it does need to be tuned, maybe closer to 200-250, or on a percentage if it was possible, with a higher endurance cost or a slightly larger re-use to balance it.  To up it to 2500 will require the re-use to be placed around 30 minutes minimum, if not a full hour, and a huge chunk of endurance.  If that's the road the developers want, then go right ahead, but if I had that ability, I'd prefer a small amount useable more often vs something I'll completely forget I have because I'd never use it or the cost isn't worth the gain.<br />

Right now, I see Healing Will as a farming type ability (mebbe it needs to be tuned, not arguing against that).  It looks like that's the way it's meant to go, and I know I first read about that kind of warrior ability here, in a brainstormin' for warriors type thread.<br />

At a long shot, it's a &quot;crap I have 1% HP and so does the mob&quot; xp grind ability in melee type scenarios.</div></div><hr />

Even for the casual player I don't see this skill as very helpful at all.  Rading makes it even more worthless.  Only thing I thought is for LDoN you could extend the time between heals even further, but then again all the clerics would be even more nuke happy than they already are.  I think it needs to be tuned more . . . heck make it 1000-1500 and at least that's almost a swing from a raid mob . . .</div></div><hr />

If it was an instant 500 HP heal then it would be useful in XP groups if it looked like a heal was going to land a little late.  With it split up over 5 ticks it's useless for that.  <br />
<br />
I guess if you like soloing you might like it but soloing as a warrior is IMO a total waste of time.  I think the last time I did any soloing was around level 50 soloing sonic bats in solb.  For that matter soloing in EQ as any class is a waste of time.  This is a multiplayer game.  As a multiplayer game it's pretty good.  As a single person game it sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the comments about a 63 warrior doing something wrong if they have less than 5k hps unbuffed, I think that's a pretty silly comment.  There's a wide range of players in this game.  Some are hard core raiders, some are purely casual players, most are somewhere in between.  Sure it's possible for a 63 warrior to break 5k unbuffed, but most won't be there without cultural armor.  <br />
<br />
I got most of my SS armor doing HoT with anywhere from 6-10 people with me as the tank and doing my best to hold aggro with a frosty and a lammy.  I couldn't afford cultural.  My best haste was an FBSS.  I was wearing Thurg armor at the time and it was a pretty rough camp at level 60.  Most casual gamers probably wouldn't be up for that level of challenge.<br />
<br />
Also as others have pointed out, the majority of warriors won't have any AAs at 63 other than maybe run speed so you're looking at unbuffed HPs WITHOUT ND.  Most people levelling up their first character won't have access to a lot of money either.  I'm in a raid guild at the moment and have cash to burn, but when I was still in a casual guild I frequently didn't have money to buy food, let alone gear.</div></div><hr />

i have quarm loot and a raex bp and other time goodies, i have single tanked quarm and vz from start to finish, if thats not end game i dont know what is. and soloing and pvp are important to me. i imagine that stuff is important to plenty of high end warriors, not everybody logs on only when a PoTime raid is called.<br />
<br />
my point about the timers still stands. nobody tanking a high end mob would use a LoH-over-time over a straight up 12 seconds of auto riposte or complete melee immunity. and i'll be awfully impressed if anybody manages to talk soe into turning Healing Will into a LoH-over-time or a big heal and NOT put it on the same timer as fortitude/furious or defensive.<br />
<br />
trying to discount the usefullness of the disc in non-PoP because its a 63 disc and you couldnt get 63 until PoP came out is some crazy logic. regardless what came out when, right now 99% of the people that are 63+ have pop and lodn and everything else, and 99% of the people that will be 63+ in the next 12 months will have pop and lodn at roughly the same time as everything else. any level 63 person will be doing content appropriate for his level/gear in each of the expansions.</div></div><hr />

Check out the reuse time on Healing Will. 5 minutes. It's designed to be used often, where a smaller amount of healing is beneficial&quot;<br />
<br />
I am sorry Kaesorn but when i have to tank hard ldon, with mob hiting me for 990 and engaging a new mob every say 1.5 min. I dont feel &quot;Healing Will&quot; very usefull.<br />
<br />
For me it should heal a % of total hp the warrior have.<br />
<br />
Let s take yourself in 1 year, u will all have lvl 65 with at least ldon armor and so more than 5k unbuffed. What will u think of &quot;Healing Will&quot; ? will u still use it ?.<br />
It should be designed to serve us till the end of EQ (if it will ever happen :p ) not only the few incoming months.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I consider myself a casual player.  I've never been in a raiding guild, I've never spent more than about 10 hours a week on EQ over the long haul.  The best no-drop loot I have comes from Halls of Testing, because that's the best my non-raiding guild can kill.<br />
<br />
I've also put a lot of time, effort, and attention into equipping myself, gotten lucky on a few drops (cleared 200k plat winning a /randomed ornate chain tunic pattern on a pickup raid), and had some rich friends who would occasionally throw me a bone.  I've done enough LDoN adventures to buy two pieces of the 1492 Tak armor.  I'm doing about as well as any casual player could ever expect to do.<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=672331<br />
<br />
I'm a level 65 warrior, and I have 4663 hit points unbuffed.  Barring the time to join a raiding guild (unlikely, as I'm a single parent who has to work), I'm within a few hundred hit points of the best equipment I'll probably ever see.  And I have fewer than 5k hit points.<br />
<br />
I ran the numbers on AA's through Magelo.  And yes, if you handed me 17 AAs on the spot, I'd break 5k.<br />
<br />
4663 (no AAs)<br />
4755 (ND1)<br />
4895 (ND2)<br />
5128 (ND3)<br />
5221 (PE)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I'm presently playing EQ once a week, for two hours; enough time for one LDoN mission.  Which gets me roughly 1/2 of an AA point.  <br />
<br />
That's 34 weeks to get that 17 AAs that you speak of so casually.<br />
<br />
Don't tell me that if I don't have 5k+ hit points, I'm &quot;doing something wrong&quot;.  I've done a hell of a lot of things right, and I'm justifiably proud of my accomplishments in the game.  Some of my friends even flatter me by telling me that I'm nearly as good as a Shadowknight, unless they want to tash or slow the mob.<br />
<br />
But this game is far, far harder on the casual player than you seem to realize.  I'm an agnostic ogre, and I've spent probably 400,000 plat on items over the years to get where I am today, probably 200,000 of which is still on me.  And I'm still not over 5k hit points unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Does that answer your question?<br />

VERY nice equipment given the amount of time you are able to put into the game.<br />
<br />
You are absolutely correct, while you could add maybe 100 more HP's relatively cheaply by upgrading a few slots going beyond that will be tougher for you.<br />
<br />
You obviously know what you are doing in equipment selection and focusing on obtaining Ornate and LDoN stuff is, as you know, your best strategy.<br />
<br />
The &quot;doing something wrong&quot; comment was out of line.<br />
<br />
5k HP's may be theoretically attainable, but reaching that goal in the next couple of months is not a realistic expectation and does not diminsh the results of which you are justifiably proud.<br />

<br />
You are not the standard level 65 warrior.<br />
<br />
I agree that it is silly saying someone did something wrong if they dont have 5K, but you could have easily obtained it. /shrug<br />
<br />
BTW, what level were you when you started LDoN? If you were 65, and finished 60 or so missions, you should have at least 30+ AA's banked.<br />
<br />
Silly argument in any case, but seriously, with the amount of time and energy you have invested, you could have done it easily. You just chose not to, which is fine too.<br />

Where are you fighting exactly that they DONT want to do this? :blink:<br />
<br />
Graa Beastlord 65 <br />
<br />
Wait so let me get this right... You have a 65 beastlord which you probably spent an equal amount of time leveling as your 65 warrior...  eg.  Time you COULD have spent getting your warrior better gear/items you spent leveling another class...  Either way as Cily stated previously, you wasted time and more HAD you maintained one character over that duration than you could EASILY be breaking 5khp and very likely be much higher.<br />
<br />
The point is that at 63 having close to 5khp is VERY attainable, at some point, you chose not to invest the time/energy into reaching that.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=672331<br />
<br />
14 AA spent:  and as Cily said you wasted a wack of em.<br />
<br />
4663 base hp. Current AA's: Innate Run3, Innate Regen3 (6)<br />
                                             Combat Fury1, Ingenuity3 (8)<br />
                                             14aa total<br />
<br />
Compared to what you COULD have:<br />
<br />
4895 base hp. Current AA's: Innate Run3, Innate Regen3 (6)<br />
                                              ND2 (6aa)<br />
                                              12aa total with 2 banked to ND3.<br />
<br />
PLUS you have 2 pieces of 1492 Tak armor... Yet you only play 2 hours once a week... Which means that if you STARTED Ldon at 65 (51 adv pts per) than it took you (*grumbles about math*) what about 14 MONTHS to get those kind of points?.... If you started earlier in level than it would take you even longer to accrue that kind of points with the play schedule you outline...  Please its kind of obvious that you play a BIT more than you let on.<br />
<br />
Nevermind the fact that doing 2984 pts worth of Tak missions would net quite a bit of aa exp...  Probably around 30-40 or so... Which would easily get you ND3 PE PD et cetera...<br />
<br />
Maybe Im just confused... or maybe you did something wrong :)<br />
<br />
P.S<br />
<br />
400,000 plat on items <br />
is nothing in terms of leveling from 1 to 65...  If people actually added up all they have bought and sold (how many 15k items have you changed?) than I wouldnt be surprised at all that by 65 most have spent FAR in excess of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think the general consensus is that we would like 5 timers, one each for long defensive, short defensive, long offensive, short offensive, and other disciplines.  Perhaps consider some changes to Healing Will after we've had a chance to play with it a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone here have any major beefs with the 5 group split on those lines?  Can we give the above to Kavhok as our answer? (provided he is still paying attention)</div></div><hr />

The heal...eh.<br />
<br />
I like the Stonewall, sounds great.  Just makes it where people absolutely have to control agro.<br />
<br />
Besides, how much input do you think we actually get with SoE?  So, be happy with what we are getting, which is a lot.  I really don't think we are going to be lucky enough to get Stonewall + Agro Disc + Aggressive.<br />

I for one am loving the new disc system.  I cannot wait until Thursday! ( /prays they do the patch that day)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually that's a lot more than some people get from 1 to 65, especially now that PL'ing thru a lot of it is so common.  Particularly in many lower tier PoP camps, loot is almost nonexistent.  You have to know the right places to go and of course as item prices drop, even those spots are worth less.  My regular exp group did a nice job in earlier PoP days of finding the right camps and having some tradeskillers, so we farmed valorium rings, unseen amulets, rings of judgment, and blood metal earrings among other things and made out okay on plat.  Many of our guildmates were doing practically worthless PoP yard trash camps though.<br />
<br />
That's okay though... I've long suspected some of my guildies of throwing all their plats in a big hole.  :D  I know of no other way to explain why a L65 character would complain that a low end horse is simply too expensive for them to buy.  Like 8-9k plat is a massive amount of money... /boggle  Maybe they won't say that anymore now that LDoN is around with some consistent plat drops.  I made enough in plats and lottoed items that I sold from just 20 or so normal missions to pay for a cheap horse a couple of times over.</div></div><hr />

Read the next line from what you quoted, you'll see my actual point and that I agree with you:<br />
I agree it does need to be tuned, maybe closer to 200-250, or on a percentage if it was possible, with a higher endurance cost or a slightly larger re-use to balance it.<br />
<br />
The point I was trying to make which seems to elude people is that it's designed to be a small heal with a quick re-use (think Mend), not a LoH-over-time like a 2500hp heal would be for a huge amount of warriors at 63.  I hope they do in fact do something like make it heal up to 20% of your hp over 5 ticks, I want them to keep the quick re-use.  Really, what's the point in getting powerful abilities for balance if you can only use them once every hour or 2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;you should have X hit points at such and such level&quot; arguements are nice and all, but can we save them for another thread<br />
<br />
Actually it bares directly on this topic... If you want to change it to a set percentage being healed than HOW exactly do you arrive at the &quot;correct&quot; percent?... Do you base it on the &quot;casual&quot; player or on the &quot;hardcore&quot; player?  The difference in base hp can be VERY large.<br />
<br />
It also serves to illustrate the VAST differences of opinion on this skill and whether it needs or warrants tweaking or ramping up... To a 63 Warrior with a base hp of say 3.5khp than a 500hp/5 minute reuse discipline is nothing short of, &quot;SHHHHWEEET!&quot;...  To a different warrior at level 63 with a base of 5khp than it really becomes a marginal discipline that ranks about the level of, &quot;I clicked it.... I THINK it healed me... :blink:&quot;<br />
<br />
To the highend warrior where his/her base hp may exceed 8khp than this discipline simply becomes a joke.<br />
<br />
Its been said before in this thread and my apologies if Ive derailed it at all but EVERYONE needs to stop looking at this from a standpoint of &quot;...this is what I have...&quot; and start looking at it with the standpoint of &quot;...how good IS this discipline when I get to where I want to go...&quot;<br />
<br />
Im not saying every warrior should have 8khp or anything of the like... Im simply saying (again) that a much longer viewpoint needs to be used when your saying whether a discipline is good or not... And MANY highend &quot;hardcore&quot; warriors with over 8khp have posted again and again that this discipline is garbage as it stands... <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=672331 <br />
<br />
Sorry to use you for an example but your magelo was handy heh...  Take Gront here... He has 4663 base hp... Fantastic.. You pop Healing Will during a fight and you will actually see your hp bar MOVE... Hell man you just SELF healed close to 10% of your total hitpoints unbuffed.<br />
<br />
I have 8410hp unbuffed... I pop Healing Will as it is right now and Id barely see my HP move... Grats I just healed myself for less than 2% (1.6 actually) of my total hp's not even counting either character being buffed.<br />
<br />
2500hp heal would be for a huge amount of warriors at 63. I hope they do in fact do something like make it heal up to 20% of your hp over 5 ticks, I want them to keep the quick re-use. Really, what's the point in getting powerful abilities for balance if you can only use them once every hour or 2? <br />
<br />
This discipline NEEDS to be ramped up... otherwise its just going to fall into the &quot;I got it.... I never use it except for a laugh.&quot; category... Sure the 2500 overtime might be excessive.  No arguement there.  But it most definately needs to be ramped up from where it is now in order to even make it marginally useful at higher levels.  Say something like lvl63 100hp per tick over 5 ticks , level 64 150hp per tick over 5 ticks  with it ending at lvl 65 200hp a tick over 5 ticks.<br />
<br />
It doesnt need to be percentage based at all... It just needs to ramp up at 65 rather than being static.</div></div><hr />
