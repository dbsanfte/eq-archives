I really havent had that much time to play with work and my recent vacation.   I am not of level to use them yet since the required level is 15. I know of them but I do not know anything about them<br />
<br />
<br />
How much of improvement over regular enchanments?  Can you combine the DO and SO with the same DO or SO like you can  with regular enchantments?  I am guessing that DO and SO will have that same types as regular enchantments such as Accuracy buffs, damage, and defense am I correct with this assumption?<br />
<br />
<br />
I know these are all noob questions and I know I have to sit down one night and read that damn game manual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to see a SO enhancement, but the DO enhancements come in two flavors, from what I've seen.  If you are, as an example, a mutant, you'll see DO enhancements that are technology/mutant and magic/mutant that you can use.  One type won't combine with the other, but you can combine a tech/mutant with a tech/mutant and so forth, within the particular type, like a generic (damage with damage, endurance reduction with endurance reduction).<br />
<br />
Also, you can use DO enhancements at level 12, as I recall. <br />
<br />
I can't speak as to how much of an improvement they are since it's very hard to judge with the naked eye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DO are suppost to have a 3% bonus on their effects, such as a generic that gives a 3% bonus would give a 6% as a DO, and SO give a 6% bonus so you would have 9%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual numbers are:<br />
<br />
Generic: 8.3%<br />
<br />
Dual origin: 16.7%<br />
<br />
Single Origin: 33.3%<br />
<br />
You can equip Level 15 store bought dual origins at 12.<br />
<br />
You can equip Level 25 store bought single origins at level 22.<br />
<br />
Glatius is correct on the sequence of combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just find it to hard to believe that the DO Enhancements are twice as good as Generic I just don't see it.  I have two 20 Attack ones and two 20 Endurance Reduction on one of my Axe and it deals maybe 5 more dmg if that and still takes the same Endurance if it changed it's not noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first one is twice as good as the training enhancer. The SECOND one is twice as good a BONUS TO THE FIRST ONE than a training enhancer would be in the same slot.<br />
<br />
The real noticable ramp up in power is the SO enhancers as they're really REALLY more powerful than trainers. And twice as good as 16 percent is still a pretty hefty jump in power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you also have to take into account that they are percentages, so if you only see 5 more damage on a certain attack after adding these then the base damage must have been small from the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And DO's do combine with each other. I have done it. TO's (or training origins)  with TO's, DO's with DOs (as a natural I have combine bith natural together) and SO's with SO's.</div></div><hr />

Am I understanding you to mean that you can combine a magic/mutant accuracy DO with a science/mutant accuracy DO?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, so long as part of the DO is your origin i.e. in the above example mutant, you can happily combine them.</div></div><hr />

Interesting, I hadn't thought that was the case.  I'll have to check it out.</div></div><hr />

Nice chart here: http://home.comcast.net/~mrastigue/enhance.htm</div></div><hr />
