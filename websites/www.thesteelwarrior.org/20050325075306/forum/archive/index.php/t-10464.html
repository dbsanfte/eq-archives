<br />
Certainly not as broken, far from it.  Still, there are issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The miss rate is a bit higher then stated 5% baseline (more like 11-12% on average) <br />
<br />
The talent trees could use some refinement / changes. Right now you're either a ms/fury monkey or a protection instance tank. The same can be said about other classes tho with lack of viable talent paths.<br />
<br />
The other gripes are minor at best. Sunder &amp; revenge is tanking bread and butter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lot more flexability than that in builds, and more of them are pretty effective.<br />
<br />
We're a bit low powered in solo and PvP, but thats about it.</div></div><hr />

Every class has their issues.  Granted, some classes are more fun to play than others, but I'd say Warriors are far from broken (or if they are broken, then at least half of the classes are broken).</div></div><hr />

Hello?<br />
<br />
/Frog waves to Honey Haass<br />
<br />
Frog has always posted this way<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
We can solo, but not nearly as effectively as most (or all) other classes. <br />
<br />
We seem to be tremedously bugged (check the Devs have spoken post and the post it has linked). I don't think any of the bugs are small for warrior play.<br />
<br />
We are better than paladins at getting agro--though they can far outlast us if they can get agro. We are likely to be the one and only raid tanks. <br />
<br />
I would probably rate us 2 starts of 5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, warrior has been vastly enjoyable most of the time and incredibly depressing/annoying some of the time. After much analysis and response from the development team, much of the hardship is due to key bugs that shipped that impact our &quot;rage generation.&quot; Rage in WoW is the bar that powers our special abilities.<br />
<br />
Rage generation against multiple enemies in defensive stance with a shield works exceedingly well right now. This aligns well with personal experience as my favorite experiences have been doing deep dungeon runs with my guildmates in 5 person expeditions.<br />
<br />
Rage generation in a solo environment is actually quite manageable up till about level 45 I would say. Getting the absolute best weaponry available to you is key to solo execution due to rage generation issues. If you are going to play in the Horde then working with a Shaman using a totem to give you a proc for a chance at multiple swings will REALLY make a night and day difference.<br />
<br />
I would say the point at which rage generation is simply not enough to keep warriors competitive with other classes in 1-1 solo scenarios is around the low 50s. It gets quite annoying and you will find yourself soloing against mobs that 3-4 levels below you to keep the gameplay and xp gain tolerable. Bandages and quality food is key here to reduce your downtime.<br />
<br />
One thing is for sure: warriors shine in duos or groups with a person who can heal you. There is nothing more satisfying than equipping a gigantic two handed axe, charging into battle, switching to berserker stance, using the whirlwind attack to lay down huge damage on every mob with huge &quot;splat&quot; critical hit sounds going off :)<br />
<br />
On the whole, play a warrior if you like to be a heavily armored player with the ability to do damage and take damage as the situation demands. The class will be getting some badly needed bug fixes &quot;soon.&quot; So now is an excellent time to start!</div></div><hr />

The talent trees and miss rates are issues for most classes really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We need tuning and talent adjustments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my biggest concern with warriors is that tactical mastery should have been set without prereq and that it should have been 3 ranks (+10/20/30)<br />
past this, I think it's a good wow class that will be more enjoyable after the next patch (rage bug correction); and I do think it's the best version of a warrior that an MMO offers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After 58 levels I don't really see that we're broken.  You do have to look at any class in terms of PvP and PvE, as each is almost a different game.  The main issue is that in PvP we start with a disadvantage, no rage.  This often times limits our effectiveness due to the fast nature of PvP.  Imo we need someway to generate rage, out of combat, that does not cost health.  Granted my PvP experience is very limited so there may be more PvP issues.<br />
<br />
PvE, I have no problems.  Tanking, doing damage, soloing.  You just have to use all your talents, stances, and abilities to maximize your effectiveness.</div></div><hr />
