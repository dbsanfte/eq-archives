<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for info on how to trigger the stomach event in Torment, featuring Baraguj Szuul, and any additional info about this event...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its been a while but I think we just went in &amp; started fighting him (he is in a little tower/house deal in torment), then we were ported into the stomach area, killed a buncha mobs, got crapped out, killed him &amp; got the key part &amp; never went back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think you have to kill 4 Avatars in different locations and get a piece from each to trigger the event.  I'm extremely foggy on it but I think that's right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 4 avatars each drop a sphere for the key. They're combined in the container that this guy drops at the end of the event.<br />
<br />
You just attack him, like Gallerus said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, you don't have to do the avatars before the stomach event necessarily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Camping those 4 avatars to get a key is the most asstastic thing I have ever done.  Every second spent in torment seems like an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good info guys, thanks. This event doable by a single group of 65s ~150+ AAs with ornate/equivalent gear including chanter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">take 2 groups, or group and half with some spare healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is it possible to take a single group just to camp/farm the stomach area?  Or does the event itself require that kind of firepower, or is it just actually going back and killing him that needs 2 groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One group could prolly do Stomach event part easy enough, especially once ya know it. But killing the big octopus at the end would be tough, he triples for 1250 and isnt slowable far as I remember, and has quite a few HP.  Good part is he doesnt despawn, or at least we managed to make 4 tries at him the one and only time we did it till we finally won, and getting back to him is fairly easy with invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">blood from this event to your guild's tradeskill people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">blood from this event to your guild's tradeskill people. <br />
<br />
Exactly why I asked whether it was conceivable to farm this area w/o intending to take down the named or exit the event (well, at least that was my intended question).  :)  Will probably try and give it a whirl sometime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye that's one reason I asked - want those BA4 shackles for the shammy I 2-box...great info on this one from all - appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The event itself is broken into I think it was 3 levels. You get ported into the first area, Open a trap door, and jump down a tube or throat into a stomach with mobs. Once you clear that area, ya jump down to the next area. There is no way to get back up, and I dont know if the mobs inside will eventually respawn, or if they like LDoN and only spawn when you first start the event.<br />
<br />
When you leave the final area you will find the real mob spawned but I am pretty sure you come out outside of his aggro range, but we did land on a couple of tormentors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did the event last week for fun with a group 10 folks.   Very-very-very interesting encounter.  =)  There is one level in particular that the next time we'll probably go through and see if it respawns (the one with 2 down tubes).  The hope is that if we simply clear the 10 or so skinless creatures on that level then wait 25 minutes, they'll respawn like normal zone mobs...if not, then supposedly it should be possible to egress out of that area, fight back to Baraguj and get reported back in...so long as you don't kill the 'Unimaginable Horror' at the bottom.  If you do, after he dies you will be ported out to 2-4 mobs...at the top of the ramp/entrance area to Baraquj's tower.   He'll be respawned at the previously empty base of the tower, and he's not rooted, hits extremely fast, seriously mitigates slow, and was pretty tight with 10 people (1 cleric, 1 druid).<br />
<br />
Note:  if you do go to the tower and the Baraguj you see is the one at the bottom of the tower (not the top) then someone has killed the stomach event, but left the 1300-hitting named up...he won't port you to his stomach again (have heard of folks getting that surprise on their first trip).<br />
<br />
On one stomach clearing, we got 2 bloods.  (oi).</div></div><hr />

Follow the link in the 7th reply - that will take you specifically to a thread regarding this named mob.<br />
<br />
I play a necro main. I know for sure that many necros would appriciate the company at least, if not the extra DPS doing this rotation. Hit one up and go duo there.</div></div><hr />

Maybe that's why it's called the Plane of Torment lol</div></div><hr />
