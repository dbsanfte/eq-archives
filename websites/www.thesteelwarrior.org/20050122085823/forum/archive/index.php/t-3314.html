<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Misty</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HI, please please tell me if my equip is alright for my level and if I need any upgrades in any slots. I'm starting to worry about my HP, since im getting close to lvl 60. Anyway i have a tight budget (only 6k in bank) and my guild can do kael arena fine, but have not tried HoT yet. Any advice is appreciated ty! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zandorf</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your fairly well equipped for your lvl, the only thing I would worry about is replacing those cobalt arms for something with some hp.  Maybe hardended grey flesh, I know theres an ac hit but 6sta/35hp would be worth it to me.  As for that your pretty well set till you hit SS/Kael armor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arms and BP were the only things that stuck out to me, Thurg or SS MQ for arms or BP is good and cultural for arms also works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice stuff bro, seems that you are working hard on becoming a good warrior, I agree with what is posted above..I wished i had the weapons you do at your level.. @ 57 I used a Club of the Ocean and frostbringer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Misty</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">slammer im a girl, so using &quot;bro&quot; was an incorrect term :P but thanks for all your advice. i'll look into upgrading the bp and arms</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viladdar</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You got a pretty damn good stuff there, Miss Dwarf.  I think it is fine, but if you look for perfection, here are some things I would upgrade (besides arms and BP but it has been already said) :<br />
<br />
- Get an another mask, something with more AC and HP. Gantru war mask is cool, maybe a bit expensive. Face Mask of Frozen Mana from LDoN is nice too.<br />
<br />
- Drop your Jagged Bone Hoop for something like Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement, if you have the cash. Mosquito Leg Earring is very cool too, plus they dropped much in price.<br />
<br />
- Boots. The 15 sta on your Chokidai boots are nice but 8 AC sucks. And neg10 sv disease sucks even more. Even the cheap and simple Crusty boots would be a slight upgrade to that, at least not worse (I NEVER ever equip something that has neg stats, but it is a personal choice, and neg5 cha is better than neg10 disease, plus Crusty boots have Str). Barbed dragonscale boots are not bad too, you would loose a bit of HP but gain AC.<br />
<br />
- Gauntlets : Kylong ones are great. If you cant afford them, you can still camp  or MQ the ones from Thurg, it would give you a little HP upgrade. The best even would be the ones from Skyshrine, if you have the faction and your guild raids HoT.<br />
<br />
Anyway nothing from what I said is a priority, it would just be cool and add some HP / AC, but if you have to farm cash or put much time into that, it would probably not be worth the trouble for the gain. The only thing that really needs to be changed are the arms, everybody seems to agree on this point ;o).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Misty</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what are some upgrades for my arm slot? i saw cultural or thurg/ss and the flesh sleeves, any others that are easy to acquire? thanks for the input btw :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">umm..wow. &lt;3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the &quot;760&quot; armor from Mir might have some upgrades for you as well if you do LDON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In your spot I would not spend 1 pp on vis armor,  if your doing kael and soon hot get your quest armor.  Some will say get FH armor but its a lot cheaper to get Myr from hot.  My first MT in hot was about your lvl and I had chain tunic so your in great shape.</div></div><hr />
