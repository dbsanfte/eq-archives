<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember it had with mobs above us. <br />
How about taunt working 90% of the time.. on blue cons only?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well until level 60 you can't taunt yellow mobs.<br />
<br />
It was thought that you had higher success rates on lower level mobs, but I think Brutul's (really long) post kinda broke that theory. (but I'll be honest, I didnt read much of it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;Well until level 60 you can't taunt yellow mobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is INCORRECT.<br />
<br />
You CAN taunt yellow cons in your 50s.<br />
<br />
THIS HAS BEEN FIXED.<br />
<br />
AGES AGO.<br />
<br />
IN A PATCH.<br />
<br />
IT WAS ANNOUNCED.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
I consistently taunt yellow and red cons with my level 52 warrior.<br />
<br />
I have more success taunting dark blue cons. BUT, I have ACTUALLY TAUNTED YELLOW CONS. <br />
<br />
Because they FIXED THIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wubao's correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not really mobs level, but the mobs level compared to your level.  As Wubao said, it was fixed quite a while ago so that you can taunt mobs higher than you during 51-59 (the only period you couldn't previously).  Though I'm curious where you got your 90% success rate from, as all the tests I've seen have come up with a 60% success rate on blue con mobs.  Iirc, green mobs have the same success rate, but higher mobs have a lower rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't recall it being parsed lately, but Wubao is correct that you can taunt yellow/red cons before level 60 now.  I think your success rate will be lower, but I'm  not sure if this is still true either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've heard rumblings around here that they can/have actually altered the taunt success parameters in different expansions, zones, (i.e. Taunt works better in PoP than in Luclin). not sure if that's an old wives tale, down to other variables like itemisation  or actually correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've heard that you cannot taunt a red con when you're at 65 (meaning the mob is 68 or higher) except with AE Taunt.  Truth or False statement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">False. I've blown ae taunt on Time-RZ and Time-VZ in the past and then gotten aggro with regular taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taunt definitely behaves differently in different zones.<br />
<br />
I haven't done Plane of Sky since mid Luclin era, so I don't know if it's still the case, but you cannot taunt any mob level 52 or higher there.<br />
<br />
Try it sometime - port up to island 1, go stand under the Thunder Spirit Princess, and taunt away.  She will not aggro.  My record for patience was 10 taunts before I just whacked her.  :)<br />
<br />
Kedge is the same way - you can't taunt Phinegal.<br />
<br />
Can't speak to luclin zones vs. PoP zones.  Someone else may be able to lend insight here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 56, I was literally unable to taunt knights in HoH.  Not 1 ever succeeded - ever.  Record was about 6-7 in a row (normally a proc brought the mob back to me, but had a bad streak once). <br />
<br />
In Drunder, at 56 I was very able to taunt piggies and ___ of Zeks.  Normally they turned on just 1 taunt.  <br />
<br />
Reasoning?  *Shrug* All red to me anyway at those levels (all like 65ish).  Probably coded as tauntable/non-tauntable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by Krowbar <br />
False. I've blown ae taunt on Time-RZ and Time-VZ in the past and then gotten aggro with regular taunt.  Will be looking back for a concurrence, but gotcha. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The 51-59 taunt restriction was evidenced mostly in ToV.<br />
<br />
This was a hold over from old original EQ taunt coding, where you could NEVER taunt a mob 51+. This problem with coding was most readilly apparent when they redid the CT zone,and taunt didnt work at all for a while.<br />
<br />
The way taunt works IS dependant upon Mobs Level AND upon the Zone characteristics.. these events show that. how it has been fixxed.. no one really knows, because SoE has never given us a straight answer on how Taunt actually works.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wish they would just come out and explain the way it work, really. Spell stacking and effects etc.. are all known.. hell melee damage etc is well known.. Its not like we can Hack the code to make a difference, but after 65 levels as a warrior you would think that maybe someone could trully understand Taunt...<br />
<br />
Until they explain it, all we have are theories.. no matter how good and accurate they appear...<br />
<br />
The 3 biggest mysteries I would like explained in EQ are...<br />
<br />
How EXACTLY does taunt work,what are the variables..<br />
<br />
How EXACTLY is spell aggro determined..<br />
<br />
How EXACTLY does rampage work, explain the anomalies..</div></div><hr />
