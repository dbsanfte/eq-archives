i need to work on my armor, i know... but any specific tips you can give me? on good weapons, good armor, whatever? i also want to know how you get procs on weapons or what weapons have procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 31 I would think that marus seru and dawnshroud peaks in Luclin would probably have some groups available.  An alternative would be frountier mountains although the population there has taken a huge drop over the last year.<br />
<br />
At level 31 I wouldn't worry to much about procing weapons as of yet.  Many of them don't proc until you get into the mid 40s or early 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember soloing in maru seru from 30 to 35 easilly. And you can buy bandages and sell loot in sanctu seru just near. Just pull the stonegrabbers near sanctu seru. the guard will protect you ONLY against the aggressives foes, so if you aggro them and you can't handle them dont hesitate to train to the zone.<br />
At 35 you could move to Dawnshrout peak, although it seems you should LFG there, for fast xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenna</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i kinda went to dawnshroud once just to look around, but a wandering wolf nearly killed me. so im wondering, what are the specific camps in dawnshroud? i'll try the marus thing though, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't  wander around in DSP; the wolves are very dangerous for the unprepared.<br />
<br />
There are no real camps in DPS; just general locations where to hunt, like the GE zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 31, I would suggest, if you can get the people together to do it, exploring dungeons.  Dalnir was my big dungeon at that level.  Exciting, challenging and great exp.  You could look at SolA(think there is still good exp there at 31), Kaesora(need an evacer for it) or probably even Splitpaw.  The nice thing about all those places is that exp is good, cash drops are good, and the named drop things that on Stromm might still be worth something.  Another good zone at that level is Great Divide.  Eventually you will be most likely wanting to get Thurg quest armor, and to get yout Thurg(Coldain) faction up, you can hunt drakkel wolves and, carefully at first, giants.  There are a number of other good zones at your level, and most importantly, I recommend you take some time and explore a bit.  I think I had more fun in my 30's than any other time ingame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides those places already mentioned, if you got a group together you could got to HHK or do cyclopses in RM.  Once you get a little older (35ish) you can get a group together for SolB or graduate to the hill giants in RM which is pretty decent for pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one goes to Dalnir here though, and I havent seen any dalnir loot on bazaar yet. The problem with most 30+ dungeons is that their ZEM is just slightly above outdoor zones (75outdoor vs 80 in SolB / LGuk) and that just doesnt cut the extra time invested..#<br />
SolA however has a huge bonus and the gnomes carry you to 40 easily. not being able to buy a tinkerers bag was a big thing like.. 3 years ago :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol A/B and Upper/Lower Guk  are not very easy to solo in as a warrior, every mob runs at low health in these dungeons. Grouping however, they are fantastic XP all the way from low 20s to the low 50s.  Still the best designed dungeons in the game, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a long time since you have been in Guk, right?<br />
It's horribly bugged in some places, you get 30+ trains because something agrod from 3 rooms away on you sometimes, the exp is very bad considered to the other 30-50 spots I mentioned.<br />
Upper guk is the exception really, but that doesnt carry you even close to 30</div></div><hr />
