<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Playing a warrior's fun and all, but i'm ready for a change(sort of). So i'm wondering what other people have been doing for alts. I'll only be playing this alt when i can't get a group, and i don't want another pure fighter, so no monks, rogues, or berserkers. Thanks in advance! ~_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">go with a druid if you like good; go with a necro if you like evil.<br />
<br />
both classes; well; you won't need a group to see 65. or hell, probabally 70.<br />
<br />
my old alt on terris thule was a druid; was quite fun being the treehugging hippie and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive tried most other classes but the most fun i had was with a necro.<br />
its just an amazing class to play, and so many different ways to play one. <br />
<br />
solo ability, group saving ability with FD/rez, you can make like a wiz and nuke, or  just dot.  also get to play with a pet. not forgetting mana taps, group heals etc for utility.<br />
<br />
last but not least, your never dependent on kei and im hard pressed to ever go oom in exp groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like my beastlord myself.  BLs are good 2nd options to wars because they solo so well, and theyre fun.  Plus you can be either good or evil (i made an ikky one myself).  But choose what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I'm an alt addict.  I have a 65 druid, 65 cleric, 60 bst, and 45 enchanter.  The war and cler see the most play, tho.  If you wanna solo, I'd reccomend the druid or beastlord.  If you wanna group, I'd do a cleric.  Very hard to NOT find or make a group as a cleric, in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want complete flexibility, go bard. Lot of soloing you can do as a bard (tanking, slow, cc, pulling, basicly anything you want to do).<br />
<br />
Mages are a lot of fun, as are necros. <br />
<br />
Honestly, best option for you, imo, would be to use those 7 char slots and play each and every class for a while. No one can tell you what you will like the most, or what will fit with your desires. The best option is to start using char slots, play them to 10 or 20 (easy in a day or 2 each) and then go back and decide which one you enjoyed the most. <br />
<br />
Happy hunting</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;if you plan on frying your brain go play a bard&quot;<br />
<br />
myself; my first toon was a bard. i swear my fingers are still to this day twisting songs when i type :D</div></div><hr />

I had a necro one once though ^_~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">necros are much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poll results:<br />
<br />
Paladin    0 0% <br />
<br />
The poll speaks for itself, they're a crappy alt as well as main.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given the conditions of soloing and &quot;something different&quot; from a warrior I think the necro option is probably the most powerful at the moment. The beast option is good if by &quot;different&quot; you mean &quot;melee is still okay&quot; and by &quot;when I can't get a group&quot; you mean &quot;I'd still like to keep grouping options open with this alt&quot; -- beasts are a very handy and powerful class at the moment.<br />
I don't see so many druids coming up through the ranks. Perhaps I hang out with the wrong crowd, heh, but I have a feeling that over the last few years druids have taken a few power hits relative to other classes. Yet I know a druid who has been playing since early 2000 and she's very good indeed at playing the class. It's truly an eye-opening experience to go from grouping with her to grouping with an &quot;average&quot; druid.<br />
One of the signal aspects of warriors is that they might well have the largest gap between &quot;ability to generate plat&quot; and &quot;need for expensive gear to play well.&quot; If I were going to start (yet another) alt, I might consider what class has the narrowest gap between &quot;need for plat&quot; and &quot;ability to generate plat,&quot; at least pre-65. I'm not sure what that class is, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehee, I voted for BL.  I love mine and he is a blast to play.  I can solo, very well...or group with ease.  Very much a stress reliever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilamdar</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehehe I picked a BL, even know my main is a BL and alt a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for all the votes and replies! i started my BL alt today when City of mist was empty except for me...I made him an iksar cuz i like the scaled wolf warder. Seems fun so far through 5 levels  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Runnin</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally when I want a change of pace I enjoy loggin on my Enchanter. Totally different from tanking (obviously) but you still have the pleasure of manipulating mobs  :)  Yes, for me, second-best to a War is a good Enc. Make a Gnome Chanter while yer at it too, that way not only can ya have a GM Jeweler but also a GM Tinkerer all in 1.... like me.  ;)  Pays off $$$ in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i swiched to a bard because my guild needed more bards, it's fun. For some reason, since i don't twink alts very much, people think i'm a true newbie. Oh well, it's netted me some free gear  :p <br />
<br />
-Rogue isn't there because i didn't want to play 2 pure melee in a row-</div></div><hr />
