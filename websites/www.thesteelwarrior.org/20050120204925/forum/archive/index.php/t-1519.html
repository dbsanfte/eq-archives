<br />
WTF!</div></div><hr />

<br />
•Proclaim it passionately <br />
–Frankly, you better mean it—they’ll notice if not <br />
–So have the person you have talking mean it even if you don’t  <br />
<br />
Early community team<br />
<br />
•A key evangelist: someone passionate about the “heart” of the game –Best if comes from one of co-opted communities <br />
<br />
Once the game goes live they mention it might be best to 'gag' the evangelical believer ;)<br />
<br />
plenty more.... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have been leaking leet info to you for years, perhaps we were to subtle. However, we ARE glad you finally found some. We are looking into the Taunt issue this very moment and hope to have something changed in the near future. Also we plan on upping the defensive and offensive abilities of Warriors to a much greater degree than what other classes could achieve (no other classes will be affected by this change) This is all in accordance to my original Vision, and remember, your in our world now!<br />

*gag*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, it just looks like common sense to me. Spin is the way to go, I won't fault any game company for understanding how groups of people work and making use of that.<br />
<br />
I swear I've seen this before. Wasn't there something like this a while back that was written under some official names but was in fact the product of some totally different and unconnected to MMORPG management?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">think this is hosted on raph kosters site isn't it? The majority of it I have no problem with (which leads me to believe it's not a hoax), some of it, though, suggests that these days deliberately misinforming, play acting at being hurt by a troublesome poster to prevent his views gaining support and other premeditated manipulations that aren't 'honest' are just one more trick in the bag. <br />
<br />
That may be 'the way it is' but it's still kinda sad to see....<br />
<br />
Politicians do it a lot so I'm sure it's fine though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using words such as &quot;suck&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; in those contexts indicates this is not a proper business document.<br />
<br />
They would use bigger words to make themselves sound smarter and placate the more conservative higher ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the looks of it this was (assuming it's for real) the bullet point summary around which a conference of people could discuss the practical side, not neccessarily something for display to impress general management. As such a bit of informal language might be considered good to keep the atmosphere  light etc...<br />

Dunno :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;shut up and pay your ten dollars a month; my porsche needs a new exhaust pipe&quot; or something like that.</div></div><hr />

I think it was up at the Safehouse and the link removed because we were badly lagging a co-hosted MUD with the website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like a chintzy presentation for the head of something at Sony.  I bet someone made that shit up.  It is all common sense from a cynical person's point of view, and why the fuck would the head of Sony's online gaming division tell competitors in a fucking conference their business plan.  <br />
<br />
It just reeks of a hoax.</div></div><hr />
