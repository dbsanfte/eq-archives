<br />
Chanter slowed, took me 5 taunts + weapon procs within that period to pull it off.  Wizard was always getting aggro just standing there...not casting and not sitting..   Funky stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they did some weird things with it based on the classes present. If you have an enchanter/bard, proximity aggro may be higher throughout. That would have been the easiest way for them to accomplish the 'class-based' adventuring they were apparently looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the proximity aggro - ranger was getting aggro all night until I'd get right in the mobs face. Nothing we couldnt overcome - lvl 65 normal was fun, about POV type experience (half and AA in 75 minutes), and not too stressful. Cleric LD twice and we had to wait - so room for error. From what I hear, Hard levels are pretty rough so bring your good connections and best game.<br />
<br />
Experience wasn't bad but I'll still probably grind in the elementals. If I can bang out a AA in one mission on LDON (on hard difficulty) though, (takes an hour in earth for me) - I'll probably spend most of my time in PDON for exp.<br />
<br />
But don't let &quot;aggro changes&quot; scare you off. That's a problem for all warriors in all zones - not just LDON.</div></div><hr />

I bagged my Go4W which works fine in BoT/Tactics/HoH and I brought out the GBoS/CHoS combo.  Still had aggro issues.  Had at least two instances where taunt failed 3 or more times in a row.  Lots of aggro on the chanter even after a late slow.</div></div><hr />

Wielding a HG/BoC I constantly had pong from the BST to ENC to DRU to MNK, etc...  seemed about the same as anywhere else that has low hp (fast fight) NPCs though.<br />

The BST did most of the tanking after I gave up trying to taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggro was simply put....<br />
<br />
Screwed up beyond comprehension.   <br />
<br />
I will quote a group member (Beastlord):<br />
<br />
&quot;With Ferocity, Vengeance, Avatar, Haste and a Blade of War, you can't even take aggro from one slow?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Yes, with almost 1900 Atk and bard overhaste, and a Blade of War I felt like I was wielding a fine steel 2h sword.   <br />
<br />
I tried the proximity thing too... didn't work.   I was ON TOP of mobs and they still were ignoring me and hitting either the ranger from 3 feet away, or the Beastlord, who was the king of aggro last night.   With BoW DPS *and* two procs of EB, I was STILL not pulling aggro off of the beastlord.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it's the same god damned issue that was in Cazic Thule when it first opened, being &quot;Old World&quot; zones, taunt simply not working on mobs above level 50.  I dont' know what's the deal with mob hatelists in LDoN, but they need to get fixed and fixed fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seemed odd to me as well.  I had about the same issues I always have with initial aggro, but holding aggro was much more difficult than before.  I use Blade of Carnage primary, Blackout secondary, and Call of Fire from Gloves of the Crimson Sigil (65dd plus stun) for aggro.  In PoP I almost NEVER lose aggro once I get initial aggro.  In LDoN I was losing aggro pretty frequently to the wizard, the chanter, and the cleric.  At least AE taunt still works but I found myself wishing it was up about every 2 mins and using it every time it was.</div></div><hr />

She was slowing early getting resists, and only very rarely would it get through Arcane Rune before being back on me.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand for those noticing these problems, did you group with a paladin who had the same issues? That's one solution to aggro lock, remove aggro lock completely :)</div></div><hr />

Most mobs behave perfectly fine.  There are just some that seem awfully resistant to taunt or whatever you can proc on them.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this helps or hurts our class without seeing how Knights are able to deal with them.  Considring you can buy a stun proc (Ykesha) or a pure aggro proc (Anger 2) in the 300 adventure points range, I wouldn't be surprised if stuff in LDoN is indeed harder to effect with aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not even limited to warrior taunt/proc.  I was with a top notch SK last night, who can get agro and keep it with about one spell in every POP encounter we've done.  He was chain casting his highest-agro spells and he still couldn't keep agro.  My taunt almost worked better than his agro did. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, in the single group normal encounters it wasn't as if the mobs could really hurt our casters.  But it definitely hurt his pride.  And mine.  <br />
<br />
They changed something with agro, and when that something effects the highest-agro inducing spells in the game I'm scared to consider what it does to my weapon procs.  I'd like to figure this out before I start taking on the difficult themes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt is definately working.  I had a lot more trouble holding aggro on hard missions than I would in say an earth or fire exp group, but Im not sure if its an aggro change or just a group that is trying to work at its most efficient capacity (fast slow, fast and hard nukes, etc).</div></div><hr />

That is of course when we didnt have 3+mobs on us and no chanta.<br />

A tank heavy grp in LDoN seems the best route for me, kill things fast and dont have to worry about running oom.</div></div><hr />

We had a few overpulls, so I was doing a bit of root rotting away from the fight.  Previously, 99.9% of the time the WAR/SHD/PAL tank in the group will have all the agro they need by the time root breaks.  Last night though, almost every single rooted critter would come straight for me as soon as root broke.  It was never a big deal because I was standing right beside or behind the tank every time, but still very annoying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quoting myself from earlier today. This is inaccurate. I have followed up on it from where I originally heard this and it is inaccurate. The simple explanation as to why is:<br />
<br />
Actually, it's been specifically stated that all dungeons were hand-crafted. There is no randomization, thus no way to implement class distribution. I would say the groups your guildie was with were just less careful pulling because they had an enchanter with them.<br />
<br />
Played a few dungeons today with my Pally. Was only grouped with an enchanter in one group, and mob placement was not particularly close in that group. I later did another adventure in the same theme without the chanter and mob placement was identical. Some rooms were close, most were not. Most areas you'd get a 2-pull without pacifying first, sometimes a 3 .... several spots could be single pulled with no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalli</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did one in everything but deepest guk so far, enchanters using slow to pull for the most part, had next to no agro issues. <br />
<br />
Had a few occurrences where the mob  would beat on the slower for a little, but other than that, holding agro was really rather easy.  (Using boc + primal offhand, occasionally pulled out my GSo4W for the heck of it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sukrn</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose the agro is a little more flakey, about as flakey as Kalli stated above.  Nothing unmanageable though.  I used GSoT through most of the evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did two adventures last night on normal setting with my normal group of friends, all 65 but the 64 bard. BST Bard War (me) SK Cleric and Pally. <br />
<br />
No noticeable aggro issues other than the group trying to do max dmg on incoming because we were trying to &quot;beat the clock&quot;. Of course we beat the first adventure with 30 mins to spare that way. <br />
<br />
The normal mobs are no harder than Tier 1 mobs and their dmg output is a joke.</div></div><hr />

The one thing, in my short experience, which I seemed to notice was that taunt actually worked more successfully for me.  Granted, I did lose aggro often enough, most likely related to the level difference, but it usually seemed that one taunt brought it right back to me, a couple procs of my GSoT and it stayed pretty solid.  I guess I'm saying that the aggro did seem a little funky, but taunt also seemed more successful.  I'm wondering about the difference of experience many of us seemed to have though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If mobs are harder to taunt for everyone, then makes it better for warriors since we never had a guaranteed taunt to begin with so we're not losing as much as the Knights.  <br />
<br />
Although some of the aggro can be attributed to people trying to be more efficient, it doesn't explain everything I have seen.  Sometimes a mob just won't leave an Enchanter no matter what short of an AE Taunt.  It seems to me some type of mobs probably takes reduced aggro from any spells, though I have no way to confirm this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could aggro issues be camp specific?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eaglewar</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it does depend on the dungeon you're in.  The first night I did Deepest Guk, had problems keeping agro.  Last night I did Mistmore and didn't have any problems.  The interesting fact is that last night I was the lowest in the group at 61, in DG I had people both below and above me level wise.</div></div><hr />

As others said, proximity aggro seemed funny.  The bard was pulling and all I needed to do was stand infront of the bard and the mob would attack me, the bard wasn't fading or anything.  A few times it was hard to taunt off a snare or slow but other than that, nothing out of the ordanary for me.</div></div><hr />

SK still couldn't agro as well I could and I had many taunts fail.  <br />
<br />
It did seem to be slightly better, but I think that was a matter of us growing used to it and working around it.  <br />
<br />
One thing I would say I noticed is that it might be the case that mobs in these dungeons its harder to move up the agro list - and harder to fall off the top agro.  For instance, many times throughout the night I would agro all the adds and turn back to the main assist mob (the SK was main assist and I was add tank).  Usually if I do this I'll have to return to the adds and taunt/attack them a few more times throughout the fight just to keep agro.  Last night I didn't need to.  Hell, a few times I moved through the group (shaman and cleric) to get to the main assist mobs and all the adds stuck right to me - no turning back on the nearest creature as sometimes happens elsewhere.  <br />
<br />
I do tend to agree that whatever they did to agro in a few of these dungeons, it is a harder hit on the Knights than on the warriors.</div></div><hr />

Just meleeing, I'd keep steeling aggro (and no, it is not better weapons, we have about the same) without trying.  <br />
<br />
Also did mistmore on my 47 bst, even waiting on doing the slows (yes, I was slower) netted me aggro.  I so much as breathed, I got aggro off of the poor warrior who was going nuts. =(</div></div><hr />

First night I was in LDoN I had no aggro issues at all, through 6 adventures.  Today though, omg.  Aggro was a total mess, I couldn't get aggro off the BARD at some points for chissakes :mad: <br />
<br />
Another odd occernce, though this is offtopic for this thread.  First adventure we did today was the takish hiz.  Did a normal adventure, zoned in...  As SOON as we zoned in we got jumped by a 900 hitter, slower went down before we realized what was going on, I popped evasive after falling down to 20% hp almost off the bat, we managed to pull it off but damn.  A 900 hitter besides boss in a normal adventure at all is odd enough, but right at zone in aggro range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did two of the MM dungeons last night with a group of 65s.  Had a few problems getting aggro here and there, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.  Every now and again you just get a mob that will not turn to you for anything, seems to happen everywhere.<br />
<br />
That being said, the only problem that we had was on an assassination quest when the cleric cast a small heal on me at the initial pull and got hammered hard and fast.  Shaman had a hard time keeping me alive, but as usual did a stellar job.  Lost the cleric and wizzie in the fight, but the rest of us survived and the dead group members still got the quest completion points.<br />
<br />
We did a normal difficulry collection quest and an normal difficulty assassination quest and had a blast.  This was with me, chanter, cleric, shaman, wizzie, and ranger all at 65...well ranger might be 63 or so, but has trueshot and EQ.  The collection quest was closer than I thought it would be, but we had a lot of time to spare on the assassination quest.  If you like dungeon crawls, LDoN is well worth it...even for warriors.</div></div><hr />

Found I was mashing taunt alot, constantly losing agro but always getting it back.  EB procs seemed to make a big difference when they happened, but BoC proc rate is too dodgy to really rely on.<br />
<br />
Group included a REBB equiped monk and a rogue with some phat backstabb mod piercer and a SEM offhand though so they must have been cranking out the DPS.  The other side of the coin is that the mobs only hit for 300ish and not very fast, so when your group is used to XPing on mobs that hit twice as hard as long as the bulk of the hits are on the MT its not that big a deal.<br />
<br />
The mob difficulty seems to be at the level of Seb retuned for level 65's so its perfectly acceptable to pull 4 and have the monk offtank one while your wizard kites 2 round the room trying to root park them. <br />
<br />
Haven't tried a hard adventure yet, the need for better agro control might be completely different there.  Will wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Well, I was in MM, Rujarkian and Takish so far, and I noticed agro problems as well. Every agro spell I used (mostly snare/dot type) worked but as if  the agro from them was decreased. I managed to hold agro but had to cast more of everything, and it took more time to get mobs off other people than it usually does. <br />
<br />
The shaman in group said that he used his level 65 dots all the time so that it might be the reason why does it happen.. but then, it happened to others, not only to him, that the mobs stick to them longer than usual. <br />
<br />
Nothing really big, not a big bug or nerf.. but noticeable.<br />
<br />
Another SK in my guild also reported this, he was using Terror line of spells (pure direct agro, like BoC EB proc, non-damaging spells) and it also didn't work as it did before LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Wielding BoC/GBoS, and most of the time, if i didn't get a proc before slow went off, all i had to do is go over and taunt once or twice, mostly once, to get agro back.  I did end up using /shield a lot though, mainly because almost every pull we had at least 2 mobs, since they like to hide around corners.</div></div><hr />

Buncha MM and a few everfrost adventures done.  Didn't notice any aggro issues at all in MM, tho that might be due to undead aggro (i.e. heavily prox based).  Had a bit more trouble in everfrost, but still manageable.  BF + SoD + 305 dex + flurry + ambidex + ingenuity = pretty good aggro locks.<br />

SInce then I have started to think there might be something to it.  Sit agro seems huge, as does heal agro.  In a couple adventures I don't think the poor cleric ever got to sit down.  A bard I know mentioned watching an SK have real struggles with agro as well, and an SK friend stated that 'LDoN fucked knights hard' as far as agro.  I am leaning to believe that some changes were made in agro for LDoN zones.</div></div><hr />

Chanter would mez a mob. Before I taunt, he would boggle. Then I would taunt 3 times. I break mez, it goes for chanter. MoB at 60% life, 4-5 taunts and about 3 or 4 GSoT procs later... chanter still tanking. weee.<br />

That'd be a twist.  Of course since these aren't exactly &quot;random&quot; mobs that spawn, they can probably do a lot more twisty things such as going after the first person they agro until they die (the mob) or a player pulls a &quot;guaranteed agro change&quot; such as fading memories, escape, AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />

I think it's either tank classes generate less aggro, or non tanks generate more aggro.  Of course both of these are essentially the same thing.  Supernal Light seems to be mega aggro.  The big nukes are even harder than normal to taunt off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm. My experiences with this so far:<br />
<br />
-My most frequent groupings have been with my friend, who's an SK, as MT and me as puller.<br />
<br />
Obviously he maintains aggro off of me, because I feign. There have been one or two mobs that have been particularly annoying (the bugs in Guk, the little beetle things they hit pretty fast and for a lot and I had trouble shaking their aggro a few times).<br />
<br />
But for the most part business as usual.<br />
<br />
-When I played my warrior in one adventure, people made a lot of rookie mistakes so it was hard to judge. The casters were sitting on INC, the monk would not feign off aggro but was using an adamantite club. Silly stuff like that. So it was a lost cause for me to keep aggro. At one point I just switched from dual red blades to dual blue blades and gave up. They let a runner go a few minutes later and we all wiped.<br />
<br />
-In the sand elves place (Oasis, Tak-whatever), Paladin in my group held aggro well, but had a few occasions where it was shaky.<br />
<br />
- In mistmoore, I did a boss mob assassination with warrior as MT. He held aggro just fine, BUT, the bard kept drawing initial aggro. He was lower level (we were all 65, he was 59), and Snare from the ranger was great for getting aggro off of the bard, while the warrior got aggro with proc/taunt.<br />
<br />
I dunno. I haven't noticed any real problems here. The dungeons seem to be like any other dungeon crawls I've ever done. Things don't go smooth 100 percent of the time (god forbid a chanter tash/mez/slow and then sit down when the tank breaks mez). But eh, it's supposed to have some chaos in there. These encounters are supposed to test your ability to react to stuff that happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cleric perspective:  I think there are several sources of this problem.<br />
<br />
After 14 adventures, I haven't seen that taunt is noticeably worse in LDoN; while there may be a small issue there, a lot of the &quot;problem&quot; is that people behave differently.<br />
<br />
(1) No horses in dungeons.  Casters sit down to med, therefore pulling more aggro from the gitgo.<br />
<br />
(2) Time pressure.  Whether it's a slaughter, an assassination, a collection or a rescue, you still have &quot;X&quot; minutes to kill &quot;Y&quot; monsters - so your casters, feeling that pressure, don't think have time to sit around waiting for your tank to build aggro.  In their minds, they need to get doing damage right now, rather than sit around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for the tank's weapons to proc.  And yes, that attitude will pull aggro off a knight as surely as it'll pull aggro off a warrior.<br />
<br />
(3) No fear of consequences.  As a cleric I've spent a fair bit of my time in LDoN tanking unslowed adds, but it's not like tanking in the planes... those &quot;normal&quot; setting critters melee like wizards and I mitigate most hits to ~80.  To me, pulling aggro isn't lethal, just mildly irritating.<br />
<br />
I set up quite a few pickup groups and of late, I've consciously taken warriors over knights on those occasions when I'm fortunate enough to have the choice.  I prefer the extra damage output a warrior brings to the table and I'll accept that the casters are going to get thumped sometimes, because it won't kill them anyway.<br />
<br />
Warriors hate this, but I've taken to chain-casting Destroy Undead at times.  If I just stand next to the melees and open fire with both barrels, nobody's going to get seriously hurt because that mob will be dead too fast to do any appreciable harm.</div></div><hr />

It seemed much worse in the Hard missions (but the hard missions are alot more fun and challenging, i might add :)</div></div><hr />

As a VT equipped ranger i have no problem whatsoever tanking on normal... unfortunatly i haven't been in a group with the balls to do hard so I just sit back and go with the flow.  I've grouped with both warriors and paladins in LDON so far...  I did 2 missions where is was the MT totally and OMG did it rock,  if I got lax on my agro then the shammy could pull it off me sometimes, but for the most part the mobs were sticking to me like flies on that glue paper and dropping like the same.  The warrior I grouped with, although I can't remember the exact weps she used, wasn't toting anything fancy really but had not problem keeping agro it seemed aside from the usual initial agro sometimes.  The pally i grouped with was another story entirely... he just coudln't seem to hold agro no matter what he did... lol so me being the bigheaded gar that i am decided to show him how a REAL agro class locks it... and to tell you the truth, once the two of us got into it with the agro war, I was getting hit about 90% of the time and him the other 10%, but what was really nice was our 2 wizzies completely unloaded on all the mobs and didnt get so much as a tash cast on them (why do mobs turn on you even at good bow range just to malo/tash me? lol talk about annoying) it was a good time tho ill say that... even the boss mobs on normal hit for about the same as your average BoT mob.  I hate pallies btw, with a passion :) at any rate, so far as I can see warriors have faired better than pallies in LDON adventures.... sorry for the real agro class comment, i really love warriors and dont mean to offend anyone except for pallies lol, cocky bastards... i never get into an agro war with a warrior cuz after reading these forums for the last four months (one of which was just reading the ##### page taunt thread) I realized how difficult it can be for a warrior, hopefully they balanced out the tank classes a little in this expansion so everyone holds agro about the same... i'd expect a patch or two will be put in place to balance it out a lil more (anyone remember those 2 days when rangers could agro kite with nothing but a bow).

<br />
POP xp mobs all hit for 750-1200 and have about 35-50k hp, so there's no rush to do your damage to each mob and it generally goes pretty smoothly. We're suddenly fighting mobs with 12k hp and hitting for 1/2 to 1/3 as much. If you have a couple nukers with you they practically fall over dead before you swing. There is no debuff and aggro gain pause on each mob, there is no need for it, a cleric could tank an entire normal mission and the group wouldn't suffer tremendously.<br />
<br />
If i'm boxing the wizard anymore i just park him next to me and let it rip, mobs pop right back on a taunt and its dead by 2nd or 3rd nuke, no danger and higher dps. I'd imagine most casters are doing the same.</div></div><hr />

You just have to teach em how to group.  (or let em get agro for a minute then they'll be out of your hair while the do the corpse run :p .)    I'm almost always grouping with at least 2 pet classes and it's easier if I move after I get agro lock so they don't have to worry about repositioning their pets.  I tell everyone at the start that everyone hits from the front for a second and I'll spin around to the back after my first taunt (and to let me get to the mob first.)  That usually does the trick.  <br />
<br />
It was pretty sweet last night to realize I was holding agro with the GSoT and there was an epic'd ranger, BST, BST pet, mage pet, chanter pet, and necro pet all on the other side...;) <br />

The last one I did I literally meleed one mob down to almost 40 percent before getting aggro off the shammie who only cast a slow on it once.  Considering alone it takes me around 5 minutes to do that much damage (and I was alone on it) that's pretty screwy.  The shammie did nothing more but stand there and get hit the entire time.  Something is screwy, but it seems sporadic and possibly even intentional.<br />
<br />
Also, we had a ranger pulling (he was only hitting with an arrow) and it was taking half the fight to pull aggro off him, even with him doing nothing but jolting.  I realize that I don't have the best weapons in the world but that's just frigging ridiculous.  Hitting a mob with a single arrow should not cause that much aggro.</div></div><hr />

This thread is about commentary on the agro issues discovered in LDON.  If you can't handle being contructive or posting something worth reading, head to the Outhouse, Og.  Better yet, shut the  fuck up, ogre, and pretend to be an adult.<br />

<br />
As for the actual subject of this thread...Your experiences, Gora, are very similar to my own.  This is what I think so far (and could be way off):  SoE made it far more difficult to move down or up the agro list in LDON.  When you have agro, you often just HAVE it rock solid.  And when you don't, it takes taunt after taunt after proc after proc.  I don't believe my taunt is failing _that_ often.  I think its just not moving me up the list as it normally would.  My observations so far...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done 32 LDoN runs now, and I think there are differences from PoP, but nothing you can't work with.  First off, proximity seems to be a much bigger factor.  First couple of runs, I was having a lot of ping pong, but then I adjusted - switched from first person to chase camera (angled down a bit) and then got as close as possible to everything I tanked, pushing my toon right against the mobs, which is much easier to do from this viewpoint.  Also makes it a LOT easier to respond fast when someone grabs aggro and pulls the mob somewhere 30 feet behind you.<br />
<br />
Taunt seems to be working better than in pre-PoP, not as good as in PoP.  The low threat level can lead to casters acting like idiots, but there's not much you can do about that as long as they don't suffer any consequences of their actions.  Comes down to the quality of the people you group with in the end, just like the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />

Go figure.</div></div><hr />

People know stuff doesnt hit hard, so they dont really care.<br />
Do a couple of Hard, u'll see people paying more attention.<br />
<br />
What i find awesome is that LDoN has INSANE i mean TOTALLY insane<br />
PROXIMITY AGRO.<br />
<br />
3 mobs on me , wizard nukes the one i tank , cleric exilirs me.<br />
Rogue BS, Monk melees....<br />
Yet the 2 undamaged mobs (ok maybe by a riposte) stay on me.<br />
<br />
While the example is bogus, i have a feeling they increased proximty agro.</div></div><hr />
