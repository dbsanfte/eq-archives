This includes the dumbest text in the game, thrown in for free!<br />
<br />
Anyway, my guild needs +CoV faction.  We're gonna pull EW.. all of EW... and mass-AOE for faction.  If I /shield a caster, will I gain all those juicy faction hits?<br />
<br />
Man, I hope EW giants give +CoV.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to get faction you need to hit the mob, not mearly absorb some damage, therefore i don;t think your plan will work.  If you really want some +CoV faction you need to fight in kael arena, take part in a 10th coldain ring etc.  Best faction for CoV can be found killing the PoZ in Kael.</div></div><hr />

Better have disc defensive ready though. :p</div></div><hr />

From there, you enter the attacking mobs hate list, which gets spread to the other mobs around (the mobs getting ae'd).  Can't confirm this first hand on an AE pull, but that's about the best I could figure.<br />
<br />
Course if you can lay hands on an Earthshaker, you can just jump in on the AE pull. :P</div></div><hr />

All it does in a nutshell is let other people use your hp pool, inefficiently at that. Think of it as the warrior version of the necro &quot;twitch&quot; line.<br />

Do a tenth ring war for faction, it's allot more fun and you can get a nifty ring too!</div></div><hr />

there is no easy/fast way to get CoV faction I sugest leaching faction off Statue/Vindi/AoW as well as hunting in arena PoZ maybe good faction too. I assure you Ring War is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went into hibernation pre-luclin and have no knowledge of it but would be very interested to begin using it when the situation calls for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You type in /shield to use it, and if you do not have a target, it will tell you what it can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Semi hijack - you should be using /shield in normal situations. It really is a nice ghetto AE taunt, I use to protect people who debuff or heal early and get aggro (especially if the mob resisted a slow). <br />
<br />
In addition to stopping damage, it seems to make taunt work better and the mob more likely to turn and face meIt has a quick refresh of three minutes so you can use it in situations where you may not feel there is a dire immediate need for taunt (this is where you AE taunt). <br />
<br />
The only downside to it really is that your shielded target has to be very close to you, and a lot of non-warriors don't know much if anything about /shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've used shield since they gave it to us.  Absolutly love it for transfering aggro back on to me.  Even had a shaman bawl me out one night cause he &quot;dont need it.&quot;  He stfu right away when I told him i could care less if he got hit, I'm getting the mob back on me suckah!<br />
<br />
Think about when you've attacked a mob that became /shielded by another mob (mainly in soloing situations here).  Did you keep hitting the shielded mob or did you switch to the mob that is doing the shielding?  I've always hit the mob doing the shielding.  In my head I'm figuring well the full effect of the hit lands on the mob doing the shielding versus splitting the damage between two mobs.  I figure hell, if im gonna beat something down I aint gonna do it half way.  It seems that most mobs in EQ follow similar logic when beating on a /shielded person.  Once the target of the mobs aggression is /shielded one single successful taunt, or one kick/slam stun, or one proc stun, etc., is usually all it takes to get the mob back hitting me.</div></div><hr />

That may be a placebo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah ring war is crap faction (for CoV, it's probably really good dorf faction though). Narandi doesn't even give a faction hit at all (didn't he used to? not sure on this). <br />
<br />
Getting Vindi/Statue/AoW + their guards is a pretty good set of faction hits. Just hang out in Kael a lot while factioning, you'll probably get the opportunity to leech at least once. Some Tormax guards are also pretty good faction.<br />
<br />
IMO, what you should (if your guild is Vindi capable) is kill Vindi (since he's almost always up) then go kill the stuff behind him. The guardians of Zek, temple guardians, and Armors of Zek and such, along with all the PoZs/other arena mobs. <br />
<br />
If you just have a small group, you should probably do Tormax area.</div></div><hr />

Buffing someone doing the damage. Get your self a nice cheap Bracer of the Hidden and spam it a few times on a wiz when hes AE'ing. Grats you on faction from every mob. No aa skills required, no relying on procs, no having to try and hit every mob. Just good ol target and click a few times.</div></div><hr />

I think it's a placebo effect, but it's one which I've noticed before, that the MOB &quot;seems&quot; to turn to me more quickly, even between Taunt refreshes.  What I assume is that /shield buys me enough time for my proc, damage, or Taunt to tip the aggro balance onto me and off of the (usually) slower.  If it actually gained me aggro, so much the better - but I don't imagine for a moment that it does and it wouldn't change the way I use it anyway.<br />
<br />
I used it in Tactics last night a fair bit, covering the enchanteress while she was with us (typical application) and then on the paladin who came up to MT when she left, to spread out the un-slowed pain (new application).  I never pulled aggro off of the paladin using /shield, and I was using it fairly often (on every second or third MOB, when the paladin hit sub-30% before the CH was called).  (Yar, I know pulling aggro of a paladin is rare at any rate) <br />
<br />
I use /shield often: Utility is *wheee!*, I don't care what any hybrid utility-spell casting class sez :D.<br />
<br />
Here's the thread you're looking for  Daggorr: /shield? More like /HERO! (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2481)</div></div><hr />

While only 8 dmg, it will definitely put you on a lot of hate lists.  Only problem of course is with our 0 channeling, you can't get it.  Another decent option is the Ragefire BP.  Its clicky Sunbeam, which is AE blind.  I personally love flipping it in and Blinding a mezzed mob twice before I break (assuming I'm not rushed, like in LDON).  Never once lost aggro on a break after blinding a mezzed mob.  Then again, AE Blinding an AE group will make mobs run if they aren't in melee range of someone, so it might really screw it up as well.<br />

Actually it has been tested.  Have someone attack a mob that is non kos to you.  /Shield them.  Mob will still be non-kos.<br />
<br />
/shield adds no aggro.<br />
<br />
I don't think a damage shield would make any difference, but I will check on this for sure tonight.</div></div><hr />

I have a memory of reading somewhere that a DS adds aggro to the caster, and not the one cast upon (a patch from no aggro at all, iirc).  It sure seems that why for my g/f's druid hehe.</div></div><hr />
