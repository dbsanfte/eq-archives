<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure this is the right forum. <br />
<br />
Ok, I'm a 57 warrior, non-guilded, non-raiding.  I've been playing a long time (3+ years), but very part-time, so I'm in pick-up groups 100 percent of the time.  I try to be good at my class but I'm not super-knowledgable like most of the folks here. <br />
<br />
Everyone seems to understand that the rogue stands opposite the mt, but beyond that I encounter a wide variety of approaches from players.  My thinking is that all the other melees should stand more or less on the opposite side from the mt.  A lot of people do that - a lot don't.  I don't correct anyone but I'm wondering if I should.   Also, if I get an SK or Pally or another war who seems to be grabbing aggro a lot, my thought is that they might as well go ahead and stand next to me and let everyone else stay opposite.  Not sure if that's correct or not. <br />
<br />
Also, in a camp situation, where all the casters are grouped together on a wall, I try to tank facing the casters so I can get to them quickly when they grab aggro.  I don't know if that's a good idea or not - when I'm in groups where I'm not the mt, I have never seen the other tank try to do that so I just don't know. <br />
<br />
Another on -  I've grouped recently with a shaman who comes and stands on top of the mob right in front of me when she is casting slow.  I know that there may be minuses to that in terms of proximity aggro, but I like it a lot and it seems to work out well.  I'm wondering if that is in general a good tactic.  <br />
<br />
And lastly, this is not a positioning question but I'll toss it out anyway - a lot of clerics seem to have a percentage of my health as a target number and they are going to cast ch when I hit that no matter where in the fight we happen to be.  i.e. if they want to cheal me at 40 percent, then if the fight ends with me at 50 percent, they will wait and cast it during the next mob.  Others seem to make an effort to cast them towards the end of the fight or between mobs when possible.   The latter tactic seems preferable to me, but I have given up trying to talk about this with clerics as I guess I'm not 100 percent sure that I'm right and I get a lot of 'dont tell me how to do my job'.  I would like to know what others think. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any guidance on these basic questions.  In addition to the answers, I would like to know how much I would be justified in 'directing' other players in my groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is basicly what I do, especially if I have Rogues with me. If I recall correctly, the mob's AC is slightly lower for attacks from behind, so I try to position the mobs with the DPS classes to the back. Everything here sounds correct.<br />
<br />
 I try to tank facing the casters so I can get to them quickly when they grab aggro. <br />
<br />
Certainly worth doing. Sucks having a mob rocket past you to get on a caster who over agro'd and having to turn around/backup and reposition the mob. <br />
<br />
I've grouped recently with a shaman who comes and stands on top of the mob right in front of me when she is casting slow<br />
<br />
Thank this shaman and encourage any others to do the same. Much better for the mob to not shoot all over the place from slow/debuff agro. They might get a &quot;little&quot; more agro from being close, but it is much easier for them to slow, give you a moment to gain agro and back away slowly to make sure you have it.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as healing strats go.. I played (and still play/bot) a cleric. My preference is to have a heal land close to or immediatly after the death of the final mob/pre-pull. I simply feel safer knowing (especially when i am pulling) that I am starting out at max HPs in case we get a bad pull. With that said, it's also good to know the lowest % you can begin healing in general to land a CHeal for as efficient healing as possible which does save mana and keep the group moving faster.  If you are dieing a lot or are having close calls very often, by all means say something, but be willing to trust the healer to be able to keep you alive :) .<br />
<br />
Hope I was able to help you by confirming your methods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a dps advantage on the mob's backside.  Position the critter with its back to the PETS.  Non tanking melee should also move to the backside, if they don't you could let them know they will land blows more frequently from the backside.   But position the mob for the pets, which means you will be facing the casters, also giving you the best ability to respond to caster aggro.<br />
<br />
As for healing, ask for a pulse heal if the fight leaves you at 50 percent.  Stress the initial unpredictability of combat damage on the pull, until Mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
As for slower positioning.  It is thoughtful for slowers to come to melee range, HOWEVER, if they cast from a distance there is a reduced chance of aggro.  Range to mob is a considerable factor for aggro determination.  Also, if the Shaman is ranged you have time to Sit to bring the Mob back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I play my Shaman I always am shoulder to shoulder with the MT when I cast slow, so that way even if I do draw agro there is no flip of the mob to annoy the rogues. The proximity agro really is not that signifigant when measured against the total agro of the slow itself.<br />
<br />
One other reason you didn't mention for fighting the mob facing your walled casters is that  in that position, any wandering mob that comes into agro range will see you first, not the people hitting the mob from behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
drawback is the push will be insane<br />
<br />
much hate for pet clases with bs'ing pets who just send in pet and ask you to turn around so it can bs. ffs its your pet you position it. i'm nice then that in the group though and normaly comply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kraydak</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other PCs should have enough brain power to balance the DPS boost for attacking from the rear (and lack of riposte damage, and avoiding some smallish AEs) against melee push.  Of course, they usually are far too lazy and you have to scream and yell a lot.  Once you can enter BoT, you will get a graduate level course on positioning in the Air tower (and you'll learn to hate other freaking incompetant always AFK brainless melees who seem to want to get you summoned off the platform after repop occurs, thereby cutting you off from your raid).<br />
<br />
-Kraydak, who has suddenly found himself in BoT's Grand Central far, far too many times to find it funny anymore, if he ever did</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as a minor note, it can be helpful in raid situations to have lower DPS melee (mostly plate tanks) fan out in a semi-circle, thusly.<br />
 <br />
<br />
       Plate<br />
MT   MOB ROG/MNK<br />
       Plate<br />
 <br />
<br />
While the people on the right and left flanks of the mobs lose DPS due to dodge, etc, they still avoid the damage from riposte (Although the skill fires, the mob can only attack the frontal arc), and push is far more balanced than piling everyone on its ass. Better push control can win you exponentally more damage from your suddenly effective rangers/bolt spells,  and it makes the rogues a lot happier.<br />
<br />
As for cheal: Playing with your lifebar is the only fun a cleric gets most the time. :eek: Go for the purple, baby!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I main tank, I try not to look at my health bar.  If I die because the healer didn't do their job, then I bitch.  Up until that point, I trust them to know how to do their job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't watch my health bar either - my problem with the CHeals is the aggro.  If the cleric has to cast a CH early in the fight and gets aggro from it, then not only do I have to re-acquire aggro, but the mob is on the wall (assuming there is a wall - and there often is).   And in a pick-up group, re-positioning the mob after that happens is usually a pipe dream.  So the mob is on the wall for the rest of the fight.  <br />
<br />
That's one of the reasons I liked the idea of the shaman coming to the mob to slow.  BTW I have spent a few hours fighting with the shaman I mentioned and she only got aggro once - and I was able to re-acquire it quickly in that instance. <br />
<br />
I'm glad I asked these questions - I've gotten a lot of good information from the replies.  Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only time I ever look at my hp bar when tanking is if I'm nervous about the cleric...then I keep an eye out so I can pop furious if a heal is gonna land late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another basic positioning tip that I didn't see mentioned.<br />
<br />
If you have aggro on a summoning mob and they are being moved all over the place you can move them to where you want usually within 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Back away from the mob causing you to get summoned, then immediately back up again and watch them follow you pretty much anywhere as long as you still have aggro. <br />
<br />
The only problem I've noticed with this is pets getting inbetween me and the mob while moving it. Other than that, this has worked for me 100% of the time since I first noticed it a long time ago. This is similar to moving out of range and sitting to get a non-summoning mob to reposition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a rogue I prefer warriors to just stand still.  Dont worry about me.  <br />
<br />
My thought is someone in any &quot;formation&quot; has to be always right or it plays like chaos.  To me the person thats always right is the tank.  So tanks just walk up and hit the mob and dont turn the mob to help anyone (though pets obviously cant help themselves).  I find the quicker everyone gets set the quicker the mob dies.  The quickest way to get set is if the warrior walks up like he owns the mob and just stands there.<br />
Yes its true mobs die faster if people walk to the back.  But thats their problem.  The tank is the base and the quicker he sets the quicker things go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My only sole exception to this rule is walls.  Its important that the back be available in some form though its not the tanks responsibility to turn the mob imo.  But if the backs not available *at all* thats when the tank needs to use the shoulder rule. Some warriors seem to innately appreciate that if they are touching the wall with a shoulder the mobs back is always available.  So if the mob is drifting into the wall the best thing a warrior can do is straf to the side so he has a shoulder on the wall.  Other warriors seem to have trouble caring.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for tanks that like to view casters.  I understand this.  I get lots of useful info from staring at the casters and try to alert people if something is happening.  However the faster everyone gets set the faster the mob dies.  In LDON where its essentially a race a few seconds a mob adds up.  So  my preference is the tank just get settled as fast as possible.  If a tank is one that likes to see the casters I understand though.  So thats fine too.  personal preference I guess.  But I should note you can learn alot by having life bars near the chat box.  If nobodys life is moving there are no problems.  If the clerics life is falling you might want to look~.  Either way often the fights are so short for individual mobs that just eyeing lifebars and not moving can be informative enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gl.<br />
<br />
short version:<br />
as a rogue i neither expect nor desire the tank to flip the mob around to help me.  Just note that the back is there for the taking and thats good enough for me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the reasons its good to be facing the casters is so that when the mob makes a b-line for them you don't have to turn around to go find it. It takes me a good 2-5 seconds to do a back-up/swing around/re-aquire target before I can even start thinking about getting back into melee range. With 2-3 mobs in the camp it can become a mess quick.<br />
<br />
I prefer it when the rogue expects to stay on the casters side at all times vs the standard everyone staring forward with the rogue finding a spot. Also, I always give um a back. It's killing your group DPS not to.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
If everyone is facing the same direction you only know if the rogue has the aggro. With me facing the group, the second I see it's back I know to click taunt.</div></div><hr />

So you don't utilize /attack off on low health or try to back away to buy time for a heal.  Even /disc furyous if your in dire need.  <br />
<br />
Man thats just sad and sloppy imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Standing between the Casters and the Mob is not so bad as ppl. think, cause it gives you a bit more time for a taunt. Taunt has a very short range and when you stand facing your casters with the mob in middle it can often happen that the mob ( unsnared ) rushes out of tauntrange so your first taunt will be lost. When you stand between the casters and the mob you'll have a bit more time taunting and I often had the mob then standing behind me but hitting me cause of a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
Btw. try to stand as near as possible to the mob for a maximum of distanceaggro.<br />
<br />
I see lots of tanks taking their place until mob summons them then they take their new place until mob ... then ... . I find it better to try in each round to be in best position.</div></div><hr />

I slow from melee range, unless I'm trying to move a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chebbie</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could not find this post in the forums here. I am pasting the post from a save I had made some time ago.<br />
<br />
The extract below is from the Steel Warrior board, posted by Brokkah Narrow.<br />
<br />
There are sections that will apply to all classes.<br />
<br />
1) Mob Positioning <br />
<br />
What are the types of positioning required? <br />
<br />
i) Pin/Cornering - Vindi style fight. Everyone on the mobs back, MT in the corner. You can disregard everything said below if we are cornering as positioning is fixed. <br />
<br />
ii) Wall pin - Aaryonar style fight. Mob body is in the wall, head sticking outwards. Melee balance on either side to pin it in place. Positioning very important, melee must be constantly aware of mob drift. <br />
<br />
iii) Wall Walk - Dagarn style fight. Everyone on the mobs back and sides. MT walks the mob up and down a wall, calling swithces. Positioning not too important here, although all melee directly on the mobs back means more switches, which means a reduction in dps. Attacking from the back left/right quarter allows you to still avoid the mobs defensive skills whilst helping to reduce the speed of push. <br />
<br />
iv) Standard Walk - Eashen style fight. Everyone on the mobs back. Positioning quite important to avoid lateral drift. Melee must spread evenly across the mobs back, allowing the MT to walk in a straight line back and forth calling switches when needed. If you see the mob drifting laterally, attack off, reposition yourself to counter, carry on. <br />
<br />
v) Circle Walk - BoT Fire Tower style fight. Everyone on the mobs back. MT will spin/walk in a circle, positioning fairly important to avoid drift into walls or caster area. Pets especially need to be managed carefully. <br />
<br />
vi) Mob in place, non-rooted - Auliffe/Cursed style fight. Mob must be kept static. positioning is VITAL in these fights. Melee and pets must constantly reposition themselves to ensure the mob is not drifting. MT can reposition slightly but generally this tactic is used where space is at a premium and drift cannot be allowed to happen. <br />
<br />
Why is mob positioning important? <br />
<br />
i) To avoid harmful AE <br />
ii) To allow line of sight damage dealers to do their job (Mage, Ranger) <br />
iii) To allow rogues to Backstab <br />
iv) To keep main tank/raid in range of healing classes and nukers. <br />
v) To allow melee to maximise their dps. <br />
vi) To prevent corpse being unreachable to loot <br />
*vii) To avoid &quot;cannot see target&quot; messages. (see note 1)<br />
<br />
What are the limits on a MT's ability to control positioning? <br />
<br />
Your MT can control the direction the mob faces, thats all. He has no control over lateral push(strafe), speed of vertical push and to a lesser extent wheeling of the mob (ie where it seems to be pushed around in a circle). Also his level of aggro limits the amount of re-positioning he can do by summon/back up or straight moving. <br />
<br />
What factors effect mob position? <br />
<br />
i) Pets - Pet push is one of the biggest factors in positioning. In order from most push to least my experience shows that pets push in this order - Beastlord, Mage, Shaman, Necro, Enc Charmed pet. Others do not do enough damage to warrant mentioning. It is the pet caster's responsibility to ensure their pet is providing a balanced push on the mob. Be proactive about this, if you can see a mob drifting and your pet is contributing to that drift then back it off and move it to counter the push. Ideally before the fight starts, pets should be positioned evenly around the mob to minimize their push. The only exception to this is where we pin (or corner) a mob, in which case stick em all on its back. On a mob where we do not corner it NEVER EVER USE YOUR SWARM PETS. Seriously, the dps increase from it is not worth the insane push these pets can generate. <br />
<br />
ii) Melee - Melee damage contributes to mob push. It does it in a couple of ways - straight melee and special attacks. Straight melee weapons push in this order, most to least push - Blunt, Slashing Piercing. Blunt weapons can push a lot. Piercing weapons hardly push at all. Special attacks such as kick, bash, slam and monk flying kick all push more than normal melee. This can be used to your advantage in 'counter-push' situations. It is melee's responsibility to balance themselves around the mob they are attacking. Do not all stand in a clump, arrange yourselves so push is spread as evenly as possible. This will help prevent wheeling and lateral drift. MAX MELEE RANGE. There is a reason this gets screamed every raid. The further away from the mob you are, the less effect your melee has on push. It also helps with aggro management but I will discuss that later on. Finally max melee range will allow you to avoid some AE effects that you would otherwise catch, and if(when) we get to the elemental planes there are mobs who AE RAMPAGE for quad 2-3k damage. You need to be at max melee range to avoid it, so now is a good time to start practising. <br />
<br />
iii) Spells - Direct Damage and stun spells probably contribute the least to mob push due to virtually all bosses being immune to stun. However, spells with a knockback component can still move a mob. Again, try to not bunch up and all cast along the same axis, as this will just push the mob along faster. <br />
<br />
What do I do when positioning starts to break down? <br />
<br />
STOP ATTACKING <br />
BACK PETS OFF <br />
<br />
These 2 things should be done immediately it becomes apparent mob positioning has broken down. This will give your MT a chance to re-align himself. Now get back into position and start attacking again on the MTs call, arranged logically to push the mob in the desired direction using the suggestions raised above. <br />
<br />
Listen to your MT. He is controlling the direction of the fight, if he needs melee to move then do it. If he needs pets moving then do it. If he asks you to stop attacking then for gods sake DO IT. We dont shout and scream for our own amusement, it is to ensure mob slaying goes as smoothly and efficiently as possibl <br />
<br />
If in this situation you have aggro, try to move as close to the MT's position as you can. <br />
<br />
Can I help 'counter-push'? <br />
<br />
Be aware during fights. Experienced players will know roughly where a mob should be positioned during that fight. If you can see it start to drift then by all means move to counter it. On cursed for example, melee are constantly moving to balance the mob in an area roughly 5 foot square. The same tactic we use there will work on a larger scale if you think intelligently about the direction the mob is moving, and what you can do to counter this. <br />
<br />
2) Aggro Management <br />
<br />
What is aggro management, and why do i need it? <br />
<br />
Aggro management is the process by which you ensure aggro remains on the main tank, and away from you. It is necessary in raid situations to allow the healing power to focus on 1 person, and keep the mob pointing in 1 direction. This allows the rest of the raid to do maximum dps with the minimum of risk. <br />
<br />
Warriors generally tank boss mobs due to 1 discipline, defensive. This allows us to cut melee damage taken to as much as half, but has the side effect of reducing our own damage output by 35%. This makes us increasingly reliant on procs for aggro, and also the 'hit and hope' taunt button. Additionally some warriors will have the area taunt skill which has a side effect of being a 100% successful taunt button. Unfortunately it is on a 15 minute timer, so normally is not available more than once a fight. <br />
(* The &quot;incite&quot; line of taunt has been added recently, which does help somewhat.)<br />
<br />
These are the limits imposed on warriors, it is your job to work within the confines of them. If the warrior loses aggro once its established, its not his fault, its yours. <br />
<br />
How do I manage my aggro? <br />
<br />
All - <br />
<br />
WAIT FOR ASSIST. The main tank waits to call assist for a reason. It is to give the debuffers time to debuff, heal chain to settle and to ensure he has sufficient aggro to keep the mob on him for as long as possible. I dont care if you have a method for reducing your aggro, there is absolutely NO excuse for attacking a mob before the MT calls assist. You arent helping him, and potentially you will screw his aggro generation up. <br />
<br />
Do NOT sit on inc, or for the first few seconds of the fight. You are asking to get splattered. <br />
<br />
Keep above frenzy HP levels. Nothing a warrior can do including AE taunt will override frenzy aggro due to low HP. It is your responsibility to get out of AE range, get a heal, or both. <br />
<br />
On a tank switch - STOP ATTACK, CALL PETS OFF. Let the new tank regain aggro, he will call assist again when ready. Treat a tank switch as effectively the start of a new fight and you shouldnt go wrong. <br />
<br />
Melee - (* see Note 2)<br />
<br />
Cycle attacks. Your dps will massively overhaul the main tanks via pure melee. Just turning attack off for 1 round every 15 seconds or so will help him. <br />
<br />
Put your aggro proc weapons away. Any weapon proccing slow, root, stun, knockback, rune or pure aggro should be bagged or at the very least off-handed. <br />
<br />
MAX MELEE RANGE. A lot of mobs aggro is based at least partially on proximity. The further you are away from the mob, the less chance you have of getting unwanted aggro. <br />
<br />
Use your aggro reducing skills. Monks and SKs should FD, it has a fixed aggro reducing component (go to monkly-business and check if you dont believe me). Rogues evade, rangers jolt if it can stick. <br />
<br />
Hybrids, dont use aggro spells such as stun, snare, slow, ranger imbues with stun component. There is 1 situation this is acceptable and thats where you are the puller. In that case, go to town and transfer the aggro to warrior via AE taunt. <br />
<br />
Casters - <br />
<br />
Time your nukes/dots. Dont start chain casting your biggest DD from the word go. Start slow, and build it up towards the end. There is no way any Damage caster should be getting aggro from a warrior on a raid. <br />
<br />
Use your aggro reducers. Boggle, Concussion, Spell casting Subtlety, the tash aggro reducing thing from PoI. All are gonna help.<br />
<br />
(* my edits - Birdienumnum)<br />
Note 1.<br />
&quot;cannot see target&quot; -- Seems that this is dependent on whether the mobs feet are in your LOS (line of sight). In some cases this may be because of the terrain, in others because the mobs feet are in a wall. Levitation will help the casters LOS in most cases. <br />
<br />
Note 2.<br />
I would add a 3rd section here for Melee Management.<br />
Good melee management will aid the crowd controllers, healers and other casters.<br />
I would even go so far as to suggest that when in a raid situation, that someone be appointed as melee leader. This leader would NOT be a tank or pure melee class. A magician would be a good choice. The magician is far enough away to have a bigger picture of the fight. This person could call for tank switches, direction switches, and melee placement, as well as mob positioning. Good melee management will most probably save a wipe.<br />

...much hate for pet clases with bs'ing pets who just send in pet and ask you to turn around so it can bs. ffs its your pet you position it. i'm nice then that in the group though and normaly comply...<br />
<br />
While you're right that it should be the pet users responsibility to position a pet, think about it this way:<br />
<br />
If my pet is in a bad position, I have to /pet back off, run a loooong way around the mob, wait until pet arrives, and send it back in. In this time I cannot med or nuke, and my pet is not doing damage as it should. Now compare this to the &quot;effort&quot; for the tank to take two or three steps back or to the side.<br />
<br />
Of course it depends on the room you have to fight. I usually park my pet so that it is optimally positioned for a fight (in the pull path). Still in like 80% or so of all cases during the fight the mob gets out of position and the pet cant BS anymore. Very few tanks take care of this, and even if I tell them they soon forget about it again. Can only advise young tanks to practice this positioning and make it a habit...I'm sure it helps in the later career.<br />
<br />
As for pet push, backstabbing pets have the least push since they do not bash or kick. However, in a lot of cases pet users dont like to use these pets since, as I said, a lot of tanks are uncooperative with positioning, making the BS pets more work to use than other pets. In the long run, this hurts the group since it wont have optimal damage output.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm in a single group situation I generally adjust my positioning to give the pets the back in order to maximize dps (for the reasons you stated.)<br />
<br />
However, if I'm on a raid, I think the responsibility shifts to the pet owner.  When I'm tanking a mob and 30 people/pets are beating on it, I don't change what I'm doing if a pet (or pets) are screwing up the positioning due to push...other then yell at them to reposition ;) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of my preferences concerning non-raid exp groups, all other things being equal.<br />
I prefer facing the casters, in part because I can see them but also because it can make targeting the mob slightly easier for the casters if I'm not in the way.<br />
In some experience groups where puller is bringing mobs to a stable camp, especially in pick-up groups, the entire camp can drift as people engage pull after pull (basically, people rush the mob on each pull, and over time inch away from the initial camp). This is sloppy, and can be avoided if puller pulls to single spot and everyone knows where the spot is. <br />
I like it when puller pulls to the pets. I can grab agro (if I'm not pulling) and postion the mob so the pets are at it's back faster than the casters can move their pets . Also, if pets are &quot;guarding here&quot; then everyone in the group knows exactly where the fight will take place (or start, at least). Obviously, the pets should be guarding the right spot, heh.<br />
Basically, I figure that if I properly and efficiently position the mob, I add many times more damage than I do through my own melee. To do that positioning, I sometimes need my group to do certain things (or stop doing certain things). So, in stable camps early on  I'll often tell folks that I want to engage the mob right here (standing where I want to be) and that I'll position the mob so it's facing this way. It really only takes a second to get everyone on the same page, and unless you go out of your way to be an asshole, few people will think it amiss that the main tank wants to decide where the fight will take place, and everyone will know how to position themselves and it will be much easier for your groupmates to adjust what they're doing to increase efficiency.<br />
Don't be afraid to talk to people in pick-up groups.<br />
It does seem to me that the role of a tank in mob positioning is really one of the things that distinguishes good tanks. It also seems to me that eventually everyone who is learning how to play a warrior starts thinking about these questions.<br />
Perhaps there ought to be something in the library on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I turn mobs for pets, but I stopped turning them for rogs a long time ago.  Most rogs are very quick about getting on the mob's back, and by the time I turn the mob, the rog is usually on the other side and I just screwed them again hehe.  It is fun to see how many times a rog will run around the mob, but it seems to annoy them.<br />
<br />
As Izudin said, it is much more effort and much less efficient for a pet caster to move their pet than it is for the tank to turn the mob.  No reason they should have to do this, although a decent pet class will figure out that the tank is normally standing in a particular spot and park their pet so they will be behind the mob most of the time regardless.  On raids I don't turn mobs for pets.  The difference between a pet hitting from the front or the back is not significant in a raid situation, and you lose more dps making the rogs switch sides than you gain from the pet hitting from behind.<br />
<br />
To the original poster, I think everything you said is right on, and you sound like a good tank.  As far as the not looking at your health bar goes, you should know if you're getting low on health so you can turn off attack, use furious/fortitude, or even back up a few steps (you'ld be suprised how often taking 5 steps backwards will allow a close CH to land just becuase the mob misses one round moving to you).</div></div><hr />

     If I'm with a healer I'm comfortable with, and we're getting steady single pulls, I don't pay any attention to my health at all.  I do keep an eye on caster health, 'cause you never know when something will wander into camp uninvited.</div></div><hr />

I am very much in favor of trying to land a CH as the mob dies.  Going out pulling at 50% health just means that you are much more likely to die if anything goes wrong with the pull, causing major downtime, or at the very least causing the cleric to burn fast heals on inc, which are not mana efficient, and have a lot of aggro.  <br />
<br />
Letting your tank go out to pull at 50% health is not good mana managment IMO unless you are desperately LoM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding pets: I will always reorient to present the mob's backside to pets, simply because (as a pet user myself) I know how damn hard it is to move pets where you want them.  I rely on the pet casters to make sure their pets are all on the same side of the mob, however, so that it's &lt;I&gt;possible&lt;/I&gt; for me to turn its back to them all.<br />
<br />
Making sure the mob's backside is to the pets is relevant for other things than the backstab pet, though.  Melee damage is dramatically improved by the pet not having to go against the mob's combat skills.  Also, mobs that enrage can &lt;I&gt;chew&lt;/I&gt; through a pet's HP, but if the pet is behind the mob, it's not an issue.<br />
<br />
Regarding rogues: I don't reposition to turn its back to the rogue.  Rogues can move as well as I can, and I have other responsibilities.  I am &lt;I&gt;very&lt;/I&gt; careful, however, to make sure that the mob's back is not to a wall or tucked into a corner; there's no percentage in making the rogue's job difficult or impossible.  If there are pets present, I will reposition according to the pets, and trust the rogue to reorient accordingly.<br />
<br />
I developed these skills over the course of several hundred LDoN normal missions (I lack the defensive AAs for LDoN hard).  Those have also strongly shaped my attitudes toward the other topics under discussion: watching my HP, and pulling while not at full HP.  Therefore, please view my comments on those two from that perspective (well-geared warrior still stuck doing LDoN normal missions, usually with near-elemental or elemental-level groupmates).<br />
<br />
Watching my HP: in my experience, there are two distinct classes of healer: those with whom I have to watch my HP at all times, and those with whom I can completely ignore my HP unless things go &lt;I&gt;completely&lt;/I&gt; to heck.  It's not even really a gradation, in my experience; healers either have a sense of the timing, pace, and flow of the fight, in which case I can ignore my HP unless things get incredibly messy--or they don't have that sense of timing, pace, and flow, and I have to watch my HP at all times, even on simple double-pulls or what have you.<br />
<br />
I'm comfortable watching my HP, and doing things like popping Defensive, turning off attack, going Furious, etc.  But I generally choose not to group with such healers again--it's not worth the hassle, and it decreases my efficiency for other tasks (I regularly dual-box my warrior and my beastlord, often with primary slowing duty and Ferocity maintenance on the beastlord, as well as target selection on the warrior, so I can be fairly busy even in LDoN normal).<br />
<br />
With a &quot;competent&quot; healer (that is, one with that sense of timing), I just don't bother watching my HP except in true catastrophes.  It's just not useful.  Yay for competent healers!<br />
<br />
Pulling while not at full HP: usually, on LDoN normal, our enchanter, bard, or cleric pulls for us.  Yay Pacify.  But the stuff in normal hits for so little, and enchanter crowd control is so effective, that we almost never use CHeal, and my hit points at the start of a fight are mostly irrelevant.  *shrug*  If we were running LDoN hard missions, where the mana efficiency of CHeal can be critical, and where an unslowed mob can chew through my 7kish hit points in a surprisingly short period of time, I'd want a puller who waited until the healer had topped me up, and a healer who took the time to make that final CHeal land just as the mob turned and tried to run.  But at the level of difficulty cross ability that I've been playing at, it's just not relevant.<br />

<br />
I pay attention to the ebb and flow of my hitpoints to gauge my next move in an experience group situation, but in a raid it's harder to keep up with. Though it is harder I still keep a close eye on it, because if I'm waiting a tad longer for my heal chain than I feel comfortable with I want my options to be open.  Granted this has nothing to do with positioning a mob, but since this old thread was revived I thought I'd add my 2cp to the new posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course on raid mobs and named types these days even at full health mobs hit harder then 10% so thats all you hear.</div></div><hr />

The first time we had a chanter and mage in the group.  I couldn't keep the damn mobs off the walls.  The pets kept pushing the mobs to all the wrong places no matter how I tried to control positioning and both pet casters appeared to be oblivious to the melee push.  The mobs were easy so it wasn't dangerous.  It was just annoying.  And of course the mage pet would pull so much aggro that even with anger aug'ed 1 handers, I often couldn't just back up and get the mob to follow me.<br />
<br />
The next adventure the chanter and mage left and we replaced them with a bard and rogue.  No pets.  The mobs never got shoved up the walls because the melee classes actually paid attention.</div></div><hr />

1: IF I loose ago, I can tuant mob and be in range (even if slightly out of my view from running over me).<br />

For exp positioning (as original poster was asking), I just make sure the mobs back is free if rogue in group, and not in wall (not even a small toe) if a ranger is in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">im not good at figuring these things out myself so i look to others for my example. this is what ive learned so far.<br />
<br />
the shaman should stand behind you and slow on incoming. he times it so that the slow lands excactly one quarter second after the mob makes contact. if its a caster mob and it stops thats the MT's fault for trying to pull it so far. if he gets agro he waits about 2 seconds for the tank to turn around then he jumps over the tank and runs a zigzag pattern to lose the mob. when the tank (a stupid warrior most likely who cant hold agro worth squat) finally gets agro he needs to immediately sit to try to regain the manna he will need to heal himself. if this draws agro he says in guild chat what a bad warrior MT he has  and he spams the sit button until the mob finally leaves him. he curses in guild chat again and heals himself.<br />
<br />
the cleric heals when he sees the berserk message. if its a named mob he heals a little sooner .. like at 45 percent. anyone who gets down to 25 percent gets a complete heal including an enchanter who is being beat upon. i think this is because the enchanter is desparate for a heal and CH heals for the most. other than named no heal shall be cast when the warrior is not berserk even if the next room as 8 mobs because .. well thats what pacify is for.<br />
<br />
pets are sent in as soon as the &quot;INC&quot; message is given. this is called 'assisting'. if the pets end up in the other room where mobs are pacified then the next proper step is to curse in guildchat why the warrior didnt pull the mob into their own room.<br />
<br />
rogues are to position themselves on the opposite side of the pets. if this leaves them on the same side as the warrior MT  they are to curse in guildchat about improper warrior positioning.<br />
<br />
when a mob enrages and the pets are in front of the mob they should be recalled when they reach 10 percent health. if the pet dies they make a note never to group with this warrior again.<br />
<br />
druid has 2 options for snares. either he lands snare on the inbound mob or if the snare is resisted he starts nuking. positioning for a druid is like that for a shaman. he jumps over the warrior tank as many times as possible hoping the mob gets stuck on the warrior.<br />
<br />
positioning for rogues: once the MT gets agro the rogue positions himself in the next room using sneak to see what will be pulled next. after the mob dies the rogues stays there and waits for the enchanter to pacify and the warrior to pull. this is a good time if its ldon to start inspecting chests. by the way this last one on rogues i learned tonight.<br />
<br />
proper positioning if im observing right for rangers is to practice archery with their brand new 50 delay bow and see if they can get archery skill above 100 tonight.<br />
<br />
when a paladin pacifies in ldon if he gets a resist and 12 mobs chase him the best position to get a heal is by training the group and the cleric. by geting at least one mob on each and every member of the group he improves the chance of getting at least one heal before the group dies and he gets to curse the warrior mt in guildchat for not getting agro off everyone.<br />
<br />
seriously though Xene, i think you got the right idea on it all. you are better than most already and if you are asking here to fine tune your positioning then good. but really i think you have a pretty good understanding already.</div></div><hr />
