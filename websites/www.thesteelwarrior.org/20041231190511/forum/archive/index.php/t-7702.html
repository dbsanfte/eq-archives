<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izudin</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked in the library and searched for hit rate or hit chance, didnt find anything useful. Sorry it this appears trivial, but I'm curious :)<br />
<br />
What is the general chance to hit a mob (from front/rear?) The parses in the library seem to indicate that from rear you have about 60% chance to hit. From my knowledge, it should be about 50% from the front.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is how do skills like Tactical Mastery and equipment with Strikethrough effect influence the chance to hit?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Those 64 AA he has really lends an air of credibility to his posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess he was asking % to hit. I misread it as being able to get more hits in. If that is in fact the case then the chance to hit should remain the same. Just because my gear is outdated or I don't have tons of AA's doesn't mean I'm lacking knowledge of the warrior class so please refrain from attacking me as I did nothing to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Anyhow, they beat out the defensive part of the mob's skills. I honestly don't remember seeing anything on the actual percentages, but they're fairly low. Nothing TOO spectacular, and when the mob's riposte goes through regardless it's not a huge deal for warriors.</div></div><hr />

Check the magelo link.  Never seen a level 52 talking trash because someone &quot;only&quot; has 65 AA.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

  OMFG, lol. I didn't even check... sweet, sweet complete newbie troll ownage. /mourn Zorah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zorah</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">64, learn to read. And the warrior is my alt toon. My main has an unamazing 250 AA on a class that AA really does not do a ton of crap for, unlike warriors.<br />
<br />
Where was my attack, Payn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Open your magelo. Look at the level. It says 52 to both Brutul and I. I'll send you a screen shot if you want. Perhaps you should update your magelo. As a note, I have more AA AND more posts, so I can definitely tell you that you're waaaaaaaay out of line, you fuckturkey. <br />
<br />
<br />
  Where was my attack, Payn? <br />
<br />
<br />
Payn is still wearing Warlord's gear, so this naturally makes him a font of knowledge that can be relied upon time and time again.<br />
<br />
Those 64 AA he has really lends an air of credibility to his posts. <br />
<br />
  Let's see... wtf was that? Looks like an attack on Payn for not being uber to me. It had NOTHING to do with the original question, therefore you actually posted one of your 3 (4 as of this writing) total posts for no other reason than to be mean to Payn. That's an attack, and an unwarranted one no less. If you're going to be an ass, be an on topic ass like Haass is.<br />
<br />
  To the original poster: Nope, still no more info. Sorry!</div></div><hr />

Oooh ooooh, I also have a server first copper hammer of striking, if that helps!</div></div><hr />
