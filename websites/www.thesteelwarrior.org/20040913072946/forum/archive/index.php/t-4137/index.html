<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Absor, I have a quick question. I've /feedbacked this, and sent it to the dev's corner. Was hoping to at least bring it to your attention too, and maybe get an answer or just a response along the lines of &quot;I'll pass that on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Awhile back the cleric Alternate Advancement ability of Purify Soul had its refresh timer reduced.<br />
<br />
Monks have a similar ability in Purify Body.<br />
<br />
Is there any chance of monks also getting their Purify Body refresh timer reduced to equal that of Purify Soul?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm...the thought occured that this shouldn't be on the warrior board...but then I remember Absor doesn't post on Monk board.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes because someone leaked LDoN info (chuckle)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">exactly why I posted it here. I don't think I could get a response of any kind if I posted it on a monk board.<br />
<br />
I put it in the tavern, since that's the one forum that I could make a case for not being completely warrior specific.<br />
<br />
Sorry if it offends any warriors that I ask a monk question here.<br />
<br />
It is something I would like a little feedback from Alan on, since it's a pretty basic question (really, just an &quot;I'll pass that on&quot; would do me just fine).<br />
<br />
And he's been rather responsive here lately.<br />
<br />
So I've got my fingers crossed (luckily I don't play a bard, so I can keep em crossed, heh).</div></div><hr />
