<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ansoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following is a walk-thru compiled from many different sites and my personial notes.  Forums information drawn from are here, Champions of Cabilis. and The Unfinished Quest Board.  One thing to note I did not include Trivals for any of the Weapon Combines, as all were trivial at 180.<br />
<br />
There are three sections.  First section is the In order of quests.  Second Section is a list of zones and what you need from those zones.  Third Section is the Recipies for the Combines.  Hope that it helps up and comming Legionnaires.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Ask him &quot;what Geozite tool&quot; to recieve a 2 slot pack that you put 2 Large Scorpian Pincers (FoB) in and return to him to recive a Note.  Now run into Field of Bone and give that note to Warlord Zyzz. If he does not give you a box for Charred Bone Shards. Repeate until he does.<br />
<br />
Kill and loot 4 Charred Miltia bones.  They can be found upon Miltia Skeletons that spawn inside of FoB to the right of the path leading to the pit (near FoB Book) from Town.  Combine and return to Warlord Zyzz.  Bring his note back to Drill Master Vygan in the Legion Hall.  You will gain Geozite Tool.  Something you will become very farmilar with over the course of all the rest of the quests.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wow! nice walk through.  bummer its primary/back only, I wouldnt mind the final weapon as an off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ansoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the proc works when its in the back slot..  Read that somewhere. Ill try and confirm or disfirm that tonight.<br />
<br />
____(EDIT)____<br />
If anyone wants to copy and past from the above thread, Feel free I dont give a D@mb bout reccogination for it, Though I wasnt the first to gain the Pride, I am the only Iksar on Saryn to wield it. Currently helping two other warrios to gain theirs.   Anyway Copy paste whatever you need wherever you want. Give me credit or dont give me any.  I do not care, just so long as it helps someone else out.. Thats all that I care, that it tiss usefull for someone else.  I mean ive got mine and a spare warlords in bank incase i decided to try and find out What that starmetal is and where it is from..  <br />
<br />
Im thinking there *might* be one more after this as the pride is iksar warrior only and all other of the iksar weapons, armor are Class Specific but All Races..   Even Greenmist for cripes sake which is supposed to be &quot;The iksar holy weapon..&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway feel free to cut, copy whatever you want out of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just a comment, the plans aren't used to do the final weapons but the crowns themselves ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ansoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a comment, the plans aren't used to do the final weapons but the crowns themselves ;)<br />
<br />
You sure.. I could have sworn that i needed to use the plans in the final combine i am 99.9% sure.. atleast thats what my notes i took when i did it said, as well as what grugle said when i talked to him last.<br />
<br />
I will do it again to double check.  But why on earth would the final not need the plans when combine the crown/head to the pike when all the others did require it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow. Awesome compilation. And yeah, I don't play EQ anymore. But it made me smile to see they finally went and fixed/finished this broken quest line. Heck I wasn't even an iksar warrior. But damn it's nice to see this quest series complete.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to those who complete it. And special congratulations to those that waited so long before being able to finish it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well in fact the plans are called &quot;a # pike/mancatcher head plans&quot;<br />
<br />
Watch in the forge interface to verify the combines (crown combines are stored in the forge interface) and it's allways (except for the last that I miss actually, kaigek didn't drop the medal 2 time I got him) Raw crown/head + gem + plans + geozite tool, and after: crown+rod+hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless its been fixed you can just start from the 2nd to last pike.</div></div><hr />
