<br />
<br />
I'm getting pretty efficiant with this setup healing/splitting/etc but I havnt tried it on any hard hitters yet. <br />
<br />
My question is this, are there any hp augs I could farm with this duo? I 2 box with eqwindows (cringe) so lag can *sometimes* be a factor but usually I have no problems swiching on the fly.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a few hp augs to round out some rough spots hp wise with my gear. (ie: hopefully bring every slot to 100hp+)<br />
<br />
Also, are there any good AA spots I could grind 2 boxing with this setup?  I was thinking about trying PoV outer and slowing with willsapper etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance guys</div></div><hr />

Gem of the Chosen Ones (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70031)<br />
<br />
Only downside is rare drop rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm told there is a 25hp aug in DS, would i not be able to duo it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Facet gem drops at the restless soul camp.<br />
<br />
There is a 25hp aug in DS, Ruddy Garnet (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70514), but the mob it drops off of can hit around 700ish, He has procs too, and has 3 adds that will come with him no matter what and are immune to snare/root.  They can hit for 300ish. I tried him with a 70 Cleric. Didn't work too well. The adds kept interupting his spells and he forgot to mem the right spells.<br />
<br />
Kyv Headhunter (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16201), mob who drops aug, spawns on the right wall facing the Kyv balcony (or left facing the bf zone).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a similar situation as you are. Level 66 now and have a 66 Shaman on 2nd Computer.<br />
The restless Souls camp is easy this level (even solo). Most mobs are LB and only single pulls. Experience is crap though and the aug seems to be a rare drop. I killed the named &quot;Tumio Lehio&quot; (spelling?) several times and didn't get one.<br />
Some places i can duo for AA are PoV, BoT, Bloodfields, PoTorment (2%AA per kill if i remember correct). Im looking for the optimal duo spot myself, tell me if you find better places :)<br />
My general problem is that my DPS is pretty low. On the other hand i can last really long with Shammy slowing and healing with Quiessence. I almost never run oom as long as i dont get too many adds.<br />

Luck mostly, but you have a druid so just evac until you get it right.<br />
<br />
Duo'd him with a bst lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaneis</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, found the other post I with em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riggor, how hard to the pets hit? without a bst pet to offtank it might be tricky, but usually i can handle 3-4 mobs at a time (mostly pulling light blues around bloodfeilds entrance for faction, as well as E-whatshisname the thrall) with a little med break in between. <br />
<br />
So the trick is to pull a wanderer within agro range of the pets, without agro'ing the headhunter? i can see how this would take some practice. did you tag with a bow? incite? about how far away should the mob be from the pets to keep headhunter from assisting? i may try this camp tonight or tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">12-11-2004, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a 25hp aug (type 7) that drops in Dranik's Hollows instance from a named rat.  I can't remember if it was the wandering Pixtt in Qinimi or one of the named mobs in Natimbi, but I duod an hp aug from there for my alt (not the one from the named ghost).   Two flavors of non-lore 35hp augs (and an assortment of other hp augs) drop in Kod`taz if you're flagged, but they're also all type 8.</div></div><hr />
