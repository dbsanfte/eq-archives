<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been in GD killing giants for a while but im gettin bord of it! Any one know of any good places for exp at 40? Please help. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CC may still be good at 40.  Gulf of Gunthak 'till you're big enough for Dulak's harbor, which you should be really close to now, at least for some of the stuff there.  OT/Dreadlands, OT will be slowing down for you at 40, but it's easier and still gives decent xp until 43, DL is tougher but better xp.   DSP should still be good in low 40's.   Guk is always an  alternative too.  If you're looking for dungeons to byog to, Kaesora is fun, so is Tower of Frozen Shadow.  Those are all I can think of at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok thanks for all your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kremib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dreadlands is great exp to 48</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a big fan of Gunthak and Dulak.  Definately hit those zones up.  My 47 druid is currently parked in Dulak, hunting yard trash and making good cash and ok xp, even at 47.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you are big enough for Dulak, go to Echo Caverns (entrance by the short and stout side of SHaven) instead.  Easier to get to, and you get the dungeon exp modifier.  <br />
<br />
I like Dulak, and hunt there on alts a fair amount, but only if I am trying to clear a ship for specific loot, or if I'm going for the higher level mobs on the two ships on the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok thanks ill head to dulak!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aegamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dulak is a great zone, but it really depends on which server I believe.  I'm from the Tribunal and the few times I've been there,  it really hasn't been busy.  So not getting a group after running all the way is a bummer (and I hate having to run through the warrens.:p), but you can bind right at the lighthouse.  That's a plus.  I did bring my own group the other day and we mopped up the exp and got some nice drops.  So if you can, bring your own group...just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the replies! I went to Dulak and it is great!!! Thanks so much.</div></div><hr />
