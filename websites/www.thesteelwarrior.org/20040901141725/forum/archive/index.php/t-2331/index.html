Dear Sony Online Entrainment employee,<br />
<br />
The melee classes of EverQuest are writing to tell you we are sick of the imbalance and unfair itemization that you have made, caster classes get MANY helpful effects and focus items, all we pure melee's get is vengance, regen and a few other effects along that line, this is something that needs to be looked into<br />
<br />
We are also sick of the advantage that Spell book hybrids have over us pure melee's, we gave up the book to be good at what we do, instead we get a slap in the face, this again is a gross imbalance<br />
<br />
We are also sick of almost all items that are warrior useable in PoP and luclin are also knight usable, and no better alternative is offered, making it harder for us to get gear, as well as giving knights more stats and hence, more use per item, on top of this, we are sick of not having many decent warrior only weapons as the masters of armed combat we should have at least a little more distinction over knights in our weapon choices instead of the now infamous combo's that sell for 60k a peace in the bazaar, this leads me to believe the only good warrior is a tweeked warrior<br />
<br />
We are also VERY upset over how we are ignored with each expansion, the gap seeming to get larger between us and hybrids, who gave up nothing to become great at tanking while we gave up all things magical outside of a clicky item that knights may also use<br />
<br />
your gross overlooking of new and inovative melee skills is just plain WRONG, in EQ online adventures for playstation warriors have special combat abilities, this is also true with EQ2, why not treat your original customer base with some respect? <br />
<br />
WHAT HAPPEND TO THIS??! is it dead!? get a frickin cleric over to the pure melee classes<br />
<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp<br />
<br />
this needs resurrecting most of all, the corpse timer has 3 seconds left<br />
<br />
Warrior <br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle. <br />
In closing the **** has got to stop, show pure melee's some respect we are getting pissed and dissident<br />

thank you for your time folks, lets hope this makes it before the next patch, maybe we will at least get another promiss</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bogonia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sony has said multiple times that form letters are completely disregarded.  <br />
<br />
If each person were to take the time to write Sony separately and express their concerns in their own voice...  it'd still probably get looked down upon as a spam campaign :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thread Failure! <br />
<br />
Spamming SOE isn't going to get us fixed anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Frankly, I haven't seen any approach suggested that gives me the feeling that it will have a significant impact on what SoE does.  Which is retarded as hell.  Here is basically a company which has a fairly significant number of their customer base unhappy with how they're doing business, but just not quite unhappy enough to leave, yet.   And they're apparently ignored.  And not only that, but there is no particularly viable way to get the company's attention and get them to really acknowledge there's a problem to be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">guys listen for a moment, we are not vocal outside this board, even if we have to eat their email sever bandwith we MUST let them know we are upset, and just how many acualy visit this board and feel the same way.<br />
<br />
what harm can it do? email the feedback, it says on the web site its for coments, complaints and ideas, the above is all of that.<br />
<br />
try ingame feedback we gota do SOMETHING besides hinting at we should all do something to disrupt the game, a letter writing campain is good because it doesnt harm anyone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What harm can it do? It'll probably sabotage any further attempts at approaching SOE. You're of course welcome to do whatever you wish but we've got a poll going atm, why not stick with that and see how that option pans out before bombing their email servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/feedback does work. You just cant send them something sounding like a raving lunatic or asking for the moon. <br />
<br />
I sent a feedback about the Marsinger range item quests in Greater Faydark recently, and in the next patch it was changed. I didnt get reimbursed because of the confusing quest texts, but at least they read it and made a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thats what i mean, why not try something outside this board, its cool and all to have a place to hang out and share the same ideas but if we honestly want change we have to make them aware of it.<br />
<br />
the probibly view our board as a sunday comic, good for a laugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">how about this letter, <br />
<br />
We the pure melee's feel that we are underpowered, and we also feel neglected with the lack of change to our classes over the last few expantions, please look into it<br />
<br />
xxxx(highest pure melee)<br />
xxxx(sever)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>duppolfg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">how about we just dont e-mail anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I concur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if you dont want to dont, but dont come here to be assholes and trash me for wanting to get off my ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally I don't want to so I won't and you are more than welcome to go ahead and &quot;get off your ass&quot; just please don't claim to represent me every time you say &quot;We are also sick of ...&quot;.<br />
<br />
If instead you could write &quot;I am sick of ...&quot; then feel free to whinge away as much bandwidth as you like.<br />
<br />
Your post is very warrior specific towards the end, so perhaps you should have checked with the monks and rogues first too before starting with &quot;The melee classes of EverQuest are writing ...&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">we are all screwd right now, but admit it, warriors have it the worst, i dont see beastlords taking monk spots, i dont see anyone going after rogues group spots, 3 of my old friends who have 65 warriors quit EQ, and that really pissed me off because im almost 65 myself, and i dont want to get to that level to see that the class is crap on ALL levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gerick, you are right, warriors have it bad right now, but do not loose hope yet for the future.  I have sent an email(3 in fact, one after each of the last 3 patches) to SoE, explaining why I feel that melee balancing should be a primary concern.  Needless to say, I got no responce other than a form letter, but I felt better for doing it.  Sooner or later, SoE has to do something, the repercutions are too severe for them to do nothing.  Mass mailings are not the answer, but individual ones cannot hurt.  Right now I get by on the fact that whenever /disc defensive is needed, I am the one out front, and I revel in that role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i wont quit im to stuborn, but i will bitch as much as i can over the fact we are a 1 trick pony( i just have this really bad feeling they will be taking us to the glue factory soon :( )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gerick, <br />
<br />
 I very much understand the frustration but building arguments around feelings &quot;I'm sick of ....&quot; eviscerates any points that would follow.  I think it would be more constructive to send them links to discussions here that reflect the changes that you want to see and where there is significant agreement in the Warrior population.<br />
<br />
Sony tossed Warriors a bone with the CHoS and SotB so they obviously got the message that a sizeable population of us were unhappy and they dealt with it (in their own minds).    <br />
<br />
<br />
I used to work for a software company in technical support.  The company allocated 90% of its engineering resources to release the next half baked product all to the beat of marketing dept.  The other smaller groups were working on bug fixes and new features with existing products.    Sony seems to be doing something similar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since EQ is nearing its last expansions,  I think it pointless to send submissions for class changes as I would expect them to continue to focus on expansion releases as they pertain to all classes in general and not place much emphasis on a disgruntled class such as Warriors. The game doesn't require very many Warriors to function.   <br />
<br />
<br />
But what the hey, an email does cost anything. Send it!  Who knows /shrug</div></div><hr />
