Wielding a hategiver (crush) in primary and a greatblade of storms (slash) in secondary<br />
<br />
Both parses were done while at max haste and 280 dex.<br />
<br />
The first parse encompassed 58 mobs and ran for 02:11:36<br />
<br />
The second parse encompassed 84 mobs and ran for 04:02:50.<br />
<br />
Before Ambidexterity:<br />
Crush - 10999<br />
Slash - 9086<br />
<br />
<br />
After Ambidexterity:<br />
Crush - 13185<br />
Slash - 11865<br />
<br />
Buying ambidexterity caused the ambidexterity fire rate to go up by ~7%<br />
<br />
The interesting number though, is the dramatic increase in proc rate over time for the offhand.<br />
<br />
You'll note that in the first parse the off-hand proc (non-melee) fired 732 times over the course of 02:11:36 which is an off-hand proc every 77 seconds.<br />
<br />
In the second parse, the off-hand proc fired 1476 times over 04:02:50 which is an off-hand proc every 47 seconds.</div></div><hr />

If you look, you'll notice that you also bought a LOT more misses along with that AA ;)  I'm sure the hit% stayed about the same though.</div></div><hr />

The miss rate doesn't concern me because the procs generate more agro than my melee does anyway.  It was a worthwhile buy just for the increased offhand proc rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well duh.  You buy a lot of misses with Punishing Blade and Ferocity too, doesn't make them useless.<br />
<br />
This is actually the first parse I've seen regarding proc rates too, that's a good deal and that actually makes ambidex a really viable AA choice if you've got an aggro offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that I posted anywhere that it was useless, or even less usefull than anything else. <br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious that this AA is very important for holding/building/gaining aggro for anyone who uses 1h'ers.<br />
<br />
In your parses though, how many more ripostes did you get? How much more damage did you take from ripostes?  Were the parses vs lvl 60-65+ NPCs?<br />
<br />
It becomes a fairly dangerous AA when you are tanking/fighting NPCs who hit for 2000-3800 on ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In your parses though, how many more ripostes did you get? How much more damage did you take from ripostes? Were the parses vs lvl 60-65+ NPCs? <br />
<br />
People are getting way too caught up in riposte damage IMO.  If you want to truely minimize ripostes use slow two handers, take off your haste item, and have a shaman turgor you before the fight.<br />
<br />
Almost all our dps / agro adding aa skills increase the numbers of attacks that you are going to make.  Flurry does, Ferocity does, Punishing Blade does, ambidex does.  About the only dps aas that don't increase the number of attacks are crits, and tactical mastery.  <br />
<br />
Anyway normally mobs riposte like ~5% of attacks.  So if you are getting 7% more swings with your offhand weapon then you are going to generate OMG OMG 7% * 5% = 0.35% more ripostes.  Of those ~50% will miss you anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just go camp a snare gland if you're so concerned about riposte damage, put a shield offhand and go find something shitty in the bazaar with AC for your primary hand, and just click the snare gland every time you lose aggro, and you'll magically take no ripostes.<br />
<br />
They're a way of life.  Deal with them, but you don't have to go all spastic over them.  Getting a SoV is going to deal you WAY more ripostes than all of your AAs put together, and I don't see anyone turning down haste because it &quot;generates too many ripostes.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, i'm sorry, if that's the case then I guess you shouldn't be fuckin DUAL WIELDING huh?   Ambidex doesn't make a lick of difference if you're not.<br />
<br />
And I still stand by my statement..if you're so concerned with it, don't even turn on attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Were the parses vs lvl 60-65+ NPCs<br />
<br />
First parse was in PoV inner caves with some bored friends.  Level 62 and 63 mobs + the sleepwalker in that parse I believe.<br />
<br />
Second parse was an exp session in the BoT fire tower against Krigers, laers, lightning elements, etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Riposte damage wasn't the point of the parse, so I didn't check it.  If you're getting killed to riposte damage on the mobs I listed in the parse, get better gear or fire your cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sulvar, that's some pretty strange math.  If someone is going to dual wield, of course ambidexterity is useful.  The riposte argument is 1h vs. 2h.  Assuming that your offhand swings as much as your main hand and that your 2h has double the delay as your 1h's, then you're taking 4x the ripostes dual wielding than with 2h.  Ok ok ok, with all the aa's and how everything works, it's probably not quite that much, but it's close.<br />
<br />
It's all about maximizing your situation so you can do your job well.  Yes, you're going to have to swing at a mob and take ripostes, but if I'm the one swinging at a mob, I'm gonna make sure each of those swings is valuble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my math wasn't the increase in ripostes of 2h vs dual wield it was the increase in ripostes of dual wield with ambidex versus dual wield without ambidex.<br />
<br />
Just to repeat myself each attack you make against a mob has ~5% chance of being riposted lets say.  From the original post the ambidex parse shows that your offhand attacks 7% more with ambidex than without ambidex.  So multiplying 7% * 5% you will get 0.35% more ripostes with ambidex dual wielding than without it<br />
<br />
So if you normally take X ripostes using your dual wield combo, after training ambidex with the same combo you will take X * 1.0035 ripostes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ok. . .I guess my point was that people don't really say &quot;don't get ambidex, because you'll get more ripostes&quot;, they say &quot;don't get ambidex, because you should be dual wielding.&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
By the way, if a mob riposte's you 5% of all hits you make, if you increase or decrease the number of hits you make, he's still gonna riposte you 5% of the time.  The actual number of ripostes would change though.  Also, increasing your offhand swings by 7% doesn't increase your total swings by 7%.  What would really be valuble is some dps parses of riposte damage, so you could say &quot;this particular mob has 30 more dps against me when i dual wield.&quot;  &quot;This particular boss mob has 200 more dps against me when I dual wield.&quot;  etc.  Considering that riposte damage can really add to damage &quot;spikes,&quot; I think people would draw clear conclusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sulvar's math is right on. Only thing I would question is the 5% riposte rate sounds a little high, but that lessens the number of increased riposte due to Ambidexterity anyway. Seems like to me that a 7% increase in offhand DPS is worth the .35% increase in riposte damage. Any time you are really worries about riposte damage on a 3k+ hitter, chances are you will be weilding a 2her anyway.</div></div><hr />

The numbers are below, 569 risposte from 57 kills with avg hit on me for 280.  If you figure a 50% hit rate on risposte then you can cut the damage in half with 1h 1488 and 2h 588.  Weapons were std issue warrior 1h Copper and Blood with 2h GSoT.  If you ratio out the 2h damage for a Windy you get 374 risposte damage.  Lvl 65 warrior, 7100hps, 1365 ac, ca2, cs2.<br />
<br />
1h<br />
569 * 280 / 57 = 2795<br />
2h<br />

<br />
Toss a druid or two into the CH chain and then everything should be fine.<br />
<br />
I mean really, your raid doesn't depend on your ripostes, it depends on your healers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is some parsing from my logs last night in BoT.  I was fighting the wussy bees up in the top CY and using dual wield combo of BoC and GBoS.  All of the mobs fought were &quot;Stormriders&quot; some of which are clerics, some of which are warriors.<br />
<br />
Gartuff Level 65 Warrior all defensive AAs maxed<br />
Number of Fights: 37<br />
Total damage Taken: 165,714<br />
Average hit (not kick or bash) damage: 293.65<br />
Number of slash attacks made by me: 6047<br />
Number of kicking attacks made by me: 245<br />
Number of times my attacks were riposted: 424<br />
Mob hit rate on me: 50.19%<br />
Average mob dps against me: 47.48 dps<br />
Max mob hit: 555<br />
Min mob hit: 162<br />
<br />
So Using this we can derive the following<br />
<br />
Times I was hit by a riposte:   213 (424 * 50.19%)<br />
Total damage I took from ripostes: 62,547 (213 * 293.65)<br />
Percent of damage I took that was from ripostes: 37.7% (62,547 / 165,741)<br />
DPS I took from ripostes: 18.01 dps (47.78 dps * 37.7%)<br />
Mob riposte rate: 6.7% (424 ripostes / (6047 slashes + 245 kicks))<br />
<br />
So in conclusion against a mob with a max hit of 555 I took 37.7% of my damage from the mob riposting my attacks.  This seems impressive, but when you convert this number to dps, my ripostes were only helping the mob do an additional 18 dps to me.  This is ~1,000 damage per minute just from ripostes.<br />
<br />
One other thing to note is that the riposte damage doesn't scale up or down depending on the mob being slowed, the riposte damage only scales up and down depending on the number of attacks that I make against the mob.  If I was tanking unslowed bees their DPS against me might be as high as 150+ dps, but I would still be only taking the same 18 dps in riposte damage.  In this case fighting unslowed mobs the riposte damage would only be ~10-12% of the total damage instead of the 37.7% I parsed.<br />
<br />
I don't have any really good parses of my using just 2h on PoP mobs, but I will try to capture a log of me using my GSo4W and do the same parse.  Obviously you are going to take riposte damage while tanking the real question here is how much damage do you take using 2h vs 1h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Next set of questions!<br />
<br />
Given the anctidotal (And I'l parse one of these years) evidence that you can not riposte on the hits gained by a flurry, can you then:<br />
<br />
- Riposte on a tripple attack?<br />
- Riposte on a punishing blade attack?<br />
- Riposte on an ambidex attack?<br />
- Riposte on a ferocity attack?<br />
<br />
Do you have the logs still Lessiter?  What I would be curious is to check the % of attacks pre and post ambi that were 'You try to crush Foo but Foo Ripostes YOU!' and see if that percent went up or remained constant.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else done a study like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinwcc</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My opinion is DW is better in term of aggro building cause more chance to proc. You will not  depend on your 2h DPS to hold the boss since you Dps no match for wiz01.<br />
<br />
So when you think 2h &gt; DW because the riposte dmg, then you better ask yourself why I ask haste and wear haste item when i am tanking boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome info sulvar, thanks.  I want to get some data too at some point.<br />
<br />
Vinwcc, have fun with 1h's then if you like them, I just dont' see the point.  I aggro as well with 2h, and I think there are comparable 2h aggroers available at every stage of the game now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinwcc</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Logic is quite simple, More swing more chance being riposte. <br />
<br />
So DW swing more than 2h weapon, that why the conclusion come to 2h take less riposte dmg.<br />
<br />
But, the most significance factor of how many swing you have is haste. Haste is the one make you swing more than ever.<br />
<br />
The point is why you choose a lesser factor (2h take less riposte dmg than DW) to achieve the goal of fewer riposte dmg but  miss out the Main factor that make you swing more (haste).</div></div><hr />

2h dly 28-35 ish full haste come out to 15-20 dly 60+ can attack 3 a round + 1 for pb =4 attacks.<br />
dw 20-25 ish dly comes out to 10-15 dly 60+ dunno sbout tripple mainhand most might get flurry so not counting it yet so 4 atacks maby 5<br />
<br />
eiher way can get 4 attacks only difference is the 5ish dly and your more likely to get 4 with dw. <br />
<br />
on your garden xp mob would you even notice. on a super hiter prolly you would. with a 5 delay difference you prolly wouldn survive using 2h either.<br />
<br />
of corse in eq .00000005%(made up number) can kill you<br />
<br />
the real reason 2h wins vs. dw is 4x 100 dammage&gt; 4x 50 dammage<br />
<br />
think that made since</div></div><hr />

Also, saying that 4x100 &gt; 4x50 is complete crap, you are FAR more likely to quad with duel weild than you are even with maxed PB skill, and I dunno what weapon you are using, but if you're 65th (which is what you would be with max PB) and you are only hitting for 50 tops with your main hand while duel weilding, you need to find a better weapon, cause yours sucks p</div></div><hr />

I understood PB to be an extra attack, not an extra hit.  Look at  the description of the AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What punishing blade is, is a chance or an extra swing with a two hander everytime you attack.  It is sorta like flurry but it only works with two handers and you only get one extra attack if it triggers.  You can almost think of punishing blade like a proc that has a chance to go off each combat round.<br />
<br />
So with punishing blade you can see &quot;quad&quot; attacks with a two hander if you score a normal triple attack and punishing blade also fires.</div></div><hr />
