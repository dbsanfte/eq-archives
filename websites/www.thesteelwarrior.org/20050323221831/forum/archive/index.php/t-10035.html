<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly looking for something that can be used to track people's attendance. Was kinda holding out for EQWatcher to put out a WoW build, but doesn't look like they're planning to at this rate and we're looking to start raiding within a month.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows of any programs that can parse attendance say, every half an hour that would be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, but I sure would like one.<br />
<br />
The text buffer is ridiculously small.  One fight pretty much fills it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, my bad.. I assumed the people that made this game weren't idiots. I dunno how you can make a game following EQ and not enable it to record large logs in .txt documents, yet you can give so much freedom with a UI that it feels like your hacking everytime you use it.<br />
<br />
Guess it's going to be fun trying to track people's attendance when we start raiding then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i use cosmos, its not the best, but it tells what dps and you can see exactly which ability provide the most dps gain, etc... its good enough to help figure out where to put talents points<br />
<br />
as for the parser for guild stuff... might wanna try cosmos census tool</div></div><hr />
