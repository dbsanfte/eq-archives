<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glachum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Really only losing out on STA and STR, and for me when I'm buffed, I'm not really missing out on those two.  Is there a real reason (beyond the 100pt heal) that I shouldn't cash in on the Cobalt BP's retail value for what seems to be better Architect BP?  Thanks!!!</div></div><hr />

Better AC, and a few more raw HP ... I'd cash in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cobalts 100 hp clicky is fun for awhile, but if you have bind wound at any decent level, you can bandage 100 hp back by the time the 15 second click goes off.<br />
<br />
I'd cash in and get an architect BP, or if you can find one for cheap maybe a Heavy Rubicite BP. 85 HP is nice, its probably the highest affordable HP you can get. Commonly goes for 18-40k on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saneldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had the same decision to make a couple of months ago.  I cashed in and never regretted it, since I was able to turn the extra platiunm into upgrades in other slots.  I felt the regen discipline we have now kinda makes the Cobalt's heal meaningless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have an Architect's Bejeweled BP and for the price I paid (5kish) It's definatly a great deal. There's no reason to keep the Cobalt BP around.. but if you still want the clicky and still want a decent bp what you can do is sell the cobalt BP and buy yourself a Thurg MQ or SS MQ (depending how much the SS goes for on your server).. or even camp the Huntsman's BP in PoG. The Architect's bp is definatly a great deal though. <br />
