<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, maybe my pullers did something screwy... but the spawn times of the cats closest to LMM seemed different than that of the corner cats tonight.<br />
<br />
We cleared the cats on the sides, then the ones on the steps near LMM and those back right by him.  At least I'm almost positive that's how we cleared them because the pullers would have had to work at it to get the ones on the steps before the right side cats.  <br />
<br />
So after we killed the sides on the ones up by LMM, we went in a were about to pull LMM when i noticed the left side cats were repopping already.  I decided, let's kill the left and right side real quick then we'll pull LMM before the ones by him pop and we'll be good to go.  But instead after we killed the 2 on the left side, the steps repopped.  In fact most or all of the cats by LMM apparently repopped before the right side.  So are they on a faster timer than the sides?  I'd assumed they would all be on the same timer.<br />
<br />
Then our monks seemed to be having a hell of a time splitting the last 2 cats by LMM.  Finally since both those cats were blue cons I said just pull the damn things.  Blue cons are mezzable.  We'll lock them down and kill MM.  This turned out to be a mistake.  They are mezzable in theory, but in practice our chanters had a hell of a time.  The cats were tashed and malo'ed and they still very frequently resisted.  Once the right side popped 2 more cats, giving us 4, our chanters were about out of mana already from the many resists they got.  Sigh.<br />
<br />
We killed LMM before we wiped to the damn cats, getting no flags.  Suicide runs were able to get the loot for the winners.<br />
<br />
Next time I guess I do this like our first LMM kill.  If any cats are accidently pulled with LMM as happened the first time, I'll have the entire raid but me kill the damn cats while I tank LMM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Happened to us a couple weeks ago, the spawn times were screwed up but we did him this past weekend and they were back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Given the huge aggro range of the cats... I think kiting the cats will mostly just get you more cats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We had trouble with cat spawn speed on Wednesday night, though I'm hesitant to call it a bug - Our pull team still has a lot of knowledge rebuilding to do. Since we had a fair number of healers for the first time ever that I can remember, we just had the raid kill right side cats as they respawned, and had just the warrior and his clerics on LMM.  Seemed to work well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That matches my memory of LMM.  The cats on the steps respawn quite quickly - 5 minutes or something close to it.  While the rest of the room's respawn is much longer, maybe 20-25 minutes, don't remember exactly.</div></div><hr />

Cats are rather trivial to split from MM, if your pullers cannot do it, look for new ones :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The rest of the room is fairly fast respawn too, maybe 8-10 minutes.  But yeah, my thought was the ones on the steps and by LMM are even faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tempur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the cats are blue, tell the monks to break out phantom call and start lulling!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get 2 enchanters to charm the cats that spawn, give them haste and send them on LMM and you've got a under 3 minute kill =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Given that mezzing the blue con cats was a huge problem even once they were tashed and malo'ed (chanters got tons of resists), I don't think charming would work very well.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about monk lulling.  Some cats are blue (and some are yellow cons), but last time 2 blue con cats were the last 2 by LMM.  Yet the monk didn't lull pull.  hmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We used to do a pull dance with the raid in MMs room.  We'd clear one corner, move into that corner.  Then we'd pull the other side of the room, clear those kitties, pull MMs kitties, clear move one more time, then pull MM to an empty part of a room to single him out, and then to raid.<br />
<br />
Now we just clear the cats in one sweet, single MM, and if any kitties add, we tank them.  I can't recall on how fast the spawn time, except that its pretty dern quick.</div></div><hr />
