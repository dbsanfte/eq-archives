<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ornate has 6 more ac, 4 more dexterity, and negligable extra sv vs magic<br />
<br />
pitted vambraces from GoD instanced has 25 more hp, more agility, less ac, less dex, and different saves.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you had to choose, which one would you choose?   i have both and am torn.  i like the extra hps, but less ac isnt that great, and i am sorely needing more dexterity atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ornate has 3 regen per tick.<br />
<br />
I was wondering about those two the other day as well.  I'm not sure which to choose but I'm leaning for Ornate for the AC and effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Between the two, I would take ornate.<br />
<br />
You are better off getting Farwater Arms tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">farwater arms cost money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, so does Ornate?  If it doesn't cost money (you got it as a drop), why don't you sell the ornate mold and buy farwater?<br />
<br />
Also, if you can get ornate molds, why not play in PoW and get parts for arms for free?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have both and am torn. <br />
<br />
I take from this he is saying he has both arms (as in not  the Ornate mold) and is having a tough time deciding which to wear.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ornate, being an iksar I always loved regen ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, so does Ornate? <br />
<br />
Hrmmm...farwater arms (if findable) 200k+<br />
Ornate arms = 60k and fairly available<br />
<br />
Not really a valid argument unless you have that extra pp lying around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's close enough that it doesn't matter, but 6 AC is slightly better than 25 hps in my book (I usually figure 5hp = 1 ac for value) and the effect on ornate seals the deal IMO.  If you haven't made the ornate yet and just have the mold I would sell it and try to get a better upgrade in another slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Going with what Brutul said. <br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd stick with whatever you get first.  From what I've seen, those GoD arms are pretty damn common and they aren't exactly all that bad.  If you get the GoD arms, use the money to buy something in another slot.  If you get the Kizrak, well, you can't say it's not a solid investment.  =)<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i had the kizraks for a good long while before these dropped in a GoD trial group.  i was the only one present for whom it could even remotely be considered and upgrade ... so i was awarded them.<br />
<br />
i have them both.  selling the kizraks isnt an option at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since they are so very close it would be hard to even parse the difference between them. I'd say go with your gut.</div></div><hr />
