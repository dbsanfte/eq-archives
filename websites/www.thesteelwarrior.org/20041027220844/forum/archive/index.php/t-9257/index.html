<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmm...Kahzul's post made me think...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions for my gear atm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No idea what your cash flow is like, but tossing out some suggestions.  <br />
<br />
Expensive:<br />
Bloodmetal Earrings<br />
Valorium Ring(s)<br />
Whatever pieces of ornate armor you can farm/afford.<br />
<br />
Less expensive:<br />
Brellium Cultural armor, unimbued version<br />
Rotting Iksar Claw Earring (can camp this in Veksar)<br />
Stock up on Halas 10lb Pie and Grobb Liquidized Meat<br />
<br />
I'd upgrade your gaunts first and foremost.  However, you're looking fine for your level, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks.  ive been trying to upgrade my gaunts, but my cash flow is nil and kylong darkmail gaunts are too expensive lol...only have 1500pp atm.  once i get my bot and hoh keys, ill try to get some ornate stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sell the CHoS and SotB, that'll net you some cash right there.  Use the GSoT exclusively.  There are four slots I'm looking at that make me cry.  First and foremost, your gloves.  You say you only have 1500pp...I don;t know what Skyshrine MQs go for on your server, but trust me, get the gaunts...27ac 90hp.  Then, both your cracer slots.  Low AC and no HP.  Go for cultural on this.  Lastly, your arms need to be replaced.  AC is ok, but once again, no raw hp.  Get a Skyshrine MQ like with the gaunts.  If there's none available, take a group of friends and farm kael for the thurg version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, I've enjoyed fighting in Veksar and kael; both places would offer the potential for gear that you'd either be able to use or sell.<br />
The thurg armor (champions) in the bracer slots (AC 19, DEx 2, AGI 7, Mr/FR/CR 2, hps 15 would be an upgrade; a couple other places would be slight upgrades, or present the opportunity to use, freeing you up to sell the tradeable stuff you have on.<br />
I haven't been to Veksar since the whole Epic thing and it might be overrun with 65-70 level characters; you'd have to check. If not, it's a fun place to hunt, I think. Nice design.<br />
You might look into LDoNs, too. YOu'll need to do 'em for hate augs at some point anyway. Crossing the invis line in Kael when you're &lt;56 is fun, but the drops for quest armor are pretty random: Kael is not like a fast-food joint where you can have it your way. I realize that the points you get for adventures at 55 are not great, but you also have the chance of dropped augments and the advantage of knowing how far you are from an upgrade.<br />
Also, attend to AC, because although you need both AC and hps, I'd aim for 20 AC/level, and if your Magelo is accurate then you're a bit under that.<br />
Also something that can help if you want to poke around the web a bit is www.eqrankings.com<br />
Search for warriors/level 55/all servers/authentic and repeat that search for levels near yours. Look at what people are actually wearing as opposed to theoretical lists of things that you might be able to get. The top warriors will be twinked, of course, but are still worth looking at. If you see an interesting piece of armor, look it up, figure out where it comes from, and if you think your normal group can get to that spot, go kill the mob. In the research phase, find out what drops in that zone that would be attractive to others in your group, so that it's not all about you. Know the mob, know the zone, keep your fingers crossed.</div></div><hr />

Yea, i need to start doing some everfrost LDoNs soon to work towards hate auugs there.  I was just in Veksar to help someone with his epic 1.5, and it was totally empty except for us.  Also that researching EQRankings is a great idea, im going to try that.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your suggestions everyone lol.  Keep them coming if you have any :)<br />

PS Waaaaait, is GSoT my Greatstaff of Thunder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GSoT = Great Staff of Thunder (also see a thread in the library for help w/ such terms). GSoT is a very good aggro weapon that typically sells for the low low price of 200-400 pp. Sometimes lower. It is the poor warrior's friend.<br />
Most warriors believe that once you get the droga weapons generate more aggro than the GSoT, though there are a couple of dissenting voices. I'd try not to sell the droga pair unless you are really hard up for cash. But you can hold aggro with the GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, GSoT = Greatstaff of Thunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">heh in that case, take a look at me 2hb :(<br />
<br />
2hb = 21<br />
<br />
