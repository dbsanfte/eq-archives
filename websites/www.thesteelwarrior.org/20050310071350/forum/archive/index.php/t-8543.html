<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aamen</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was reading an interesting thread on the paladin boards.  They talked about a pally tanking a mob and ramping his hate up to allow the warrior/MT to taunt and 'leapfrog' his hate just a little higher, so that when all were ready the MT had some really solid aggro.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering, does this actually work?  How effective is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is really only used with Perma-Rooted mobs.  The secret is to debuff, slow, etc and get all that done, then have a pally or sk chain cast their agro spells until your certain they have agro.  Then, the warrior goes and aets and incites and he has very good agro for the fight.  The key is to keep the mob above 96% so it doesnt summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is also useful on certain mobs done by warriors. if i know the mob im tanking is going to kill me for sure (DT mobs) then i will incite as soon as it refreshes until i die so the following tank has as much aggro as possible. but then again i use all endurance on incite for all fights i dont expect to have disc up 2+ times in.</div></div><hr />

So doesn't really work on DTing mobs.</div></div><hr />
