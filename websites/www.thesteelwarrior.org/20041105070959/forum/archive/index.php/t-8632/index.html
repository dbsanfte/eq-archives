<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading this forum everyday for about 5-6 month now.  A recent post about dodge/ripstol mods on item has raised some questions that I hope experienced warriors can answer.  I have a dodge mod on my drape of agile(back item), and I recently put in a dodge mod aug(slot 3)  on my ldon bracer.  My question is if they stack or the highest % take over?  Also what is the difference bewteen dodge/ripstol x% versus dodge/ripstol +1/2/3 ???  As someone mentioned in previous post, they are totally diference beasts, please elaborate.<br />

As the above people stated, % mods on skills do not stack and only the highest mod will take affect.  As for 'Improved Dodge III' etc,  they also do not stack, and only the highest effect will work.  But they are not really skill mods, as they are mods to the actual success of the skill.  Cleave works the same way, I have an item with Cleave II, and an item with Cleave III.  It would seriously kick ass if that gave me Cleave V, but it does not :(</div></div><hr />
