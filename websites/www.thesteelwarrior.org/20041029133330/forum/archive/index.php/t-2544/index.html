<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A ranger in my guild just got the Mantle of Deadly precision(+15 Accuracy effect), and he was kind enough to do 2 30 min parses on a mob that doesnt hit back, so we could see what(if anything) it does.<br />
<br />
To quote him:<br />
&quot;Hi, I send you 2 logs around 30 minutes each, both with 1762 atk and without haste, only using Protection of the Wild and Cry of Thunder buffs, I hope the info is useful.&quot;<br />

Conclusion:<br />
<br />
I was expecting accuracy to increase hit ratio. That doesnt appear to be the case since it went from 72.5% without accuracy to 72% with accuracy.<br />
<br />
With the accuracy mantle on, average slash increased from 91 to 93, a 2.2% increase. <br />
<br />
So the way I see it there are 2 possible ways to explain these results:<br />
<br />
Either <br />
<br />
A) Accuracy is broken<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B) Accuracy increases average hit<br />
<br />
I am leaning towards B), but I dont know enough about statistics to say wether there are enough hits in the 2 logs to support that.<br />
<br />
I suppose its also possible that Accuracy is meant to do nothing for melee, and perhaps only work on ranged attacks like archery.. that would suck for us if thats the case :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's weird. These things seem to be really f-ed up.<br />
<br />
Accuracy should make you hit more often, not hit for more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you look at accuracy in that way..<br />
you want to hit a critical spot, head or something, more damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Other parses that I've seen posted also prove this exact same thing.  Accuracy = higher average damage per hit.  It does not effect how often you miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oops, wrong thread=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EQ Companion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting that minimum hit was 17 with accuracy and 9 without. It might be just a coincidence, though, but there were four 17 min hits so that typically tells that it really is the minimum.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that accuracy only affected bow damage, but that was only a rumor I heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well he just did another 2 logs, this time 45 mins each..<br />
<br />
Hit ratio was 72.65% with, and 72.76% without.<br />
<br />
But this time, average slash was 1 point lower with accuracy :/<br />
<br />
The minimum hit discrepeancy seems like a fluke, in the 2 45 min logs the minimum hit is 10 with, and 14 without.<br />
<br />
He will do a pure archery test tomorrow, will post again when I get the results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It might be easier to do parses with melee weapons since you know for sure what their min is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's just not enough data for the results to have any significance... any difference is well within statistical variance.<br />
<br />
Need a significantly larger sample.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the fact a set of 30 minute logs and 45 minute logs only shows a variance that is easily dismisses as statitical variance speaks volumns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Furor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">30 minute parses on a 15 Accuracy mod are not going to tell you anything. You need to put in a good 5 hours each way to level out the parses.<br />
<br />
Secondly, 72% accuracy? What are you testing on? A lvl 30 mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if you cant see a difference in 45 min, i dont really care about it though.<br />
<br />
what mob you are hitting on could make a difference. 72 could be the max so it doesnt do anything. maybe red or even cons would give better results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah its a fairly low level mob, dont recall its exact level, the zone is a bit out of the way.<br />
<br />
Edit: checked, its a level 1 mob. Feel free to priv msg me if anyone know a more suitable level parse target that doesnt hit back.</div></div><hr />
