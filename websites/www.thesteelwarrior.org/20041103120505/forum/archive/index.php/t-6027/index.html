<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
First the facts:  I pretty much only play cacually with a group of RL friends Consisting of Me, Druid, Pally, Rogue, and Enchanter.<br />
<br />
So basically 50% of the time I am w/o the Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Currently i have a CoF / Heavy Rubicite Girdle.<br />
<br />
I have been debating the idea of swapping out for:<br />
<br />
1) Seahorse HIde Belt<br />
2) Pernicity Cloak<br />
3) Ornate Gaunts <br />
<br />
Judgeing from prices on my server selling my CoF and Girdle would make the above possible and leave me with some extra cash :)   That way when im not with the enchanter i at least have the clicky haste buff from the Gaunts.<br />
<br />
Opinions?   Am I nuts to get rid of CoF/Rubicite Girdle?</div></div><hr />

Keep the cof, get the gloves, they stack.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed, that was my original plan...but....i just dont have the cash to buy the glove molds.  I should be able to sell CoF/Girdle and have enough money to buy mold, pernicity and seahorse belt.<br />
<br />
Probably won't do it cause I just don't have the patience/time to do all that buying and selling and do it in enough time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might try the eyepatch of plunder as an alternative clicky haste since it's free (pain in the ass, but free).  But honestly, in the time it could potentially take to find that damned named griffon up you could probably level enough to get a BoT group and get your own gauntlet mold.  (Oreen Wavecrasher dropped the last one I saw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't bother with the patch. Go camp the gloves or hold out long enough till you can camp it. They are, quite simply, the easiest piece of ornate to get. They drop in BoT off an East named which normally pops once every hour or two. I have seen him pop none, and have seen him pop 3 times in a row. <br />
<br />
Don't let the Bazaar dealers rip you off, because I know you can get this drop, and get some fine xp while you do it. Check the LIBRARY for &quot;Wandor's Guide to BoT Named&quot;. It is complete and comprehensive.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU CAN DO EEEEET!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oreen is a 8 hour spawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oreen is not the mob he needs, so Oreen's spawn time is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I think his spawn time is 6 hours, and so far I've seen him drop ornate gauntlet mold once and ornate chain leggings pattern once, along with some assorted runes, parchments and such.  He spawns in the east platform area, there's another named that spawns in an adjacent room (ph is a kriger) that may be the one Sassinak is referring to, no idea, never killed that one. Just keep getting the ph.</div></div><hr />
