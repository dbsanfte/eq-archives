<br />
I am sure you get tired of the &quot;Could you look at my gear and give me advice on upgrades path&quot; posts.   However, I have about 100K to spend and was wondering if there is anything worth buying as an upgrade bazaar wise.  <br />
<br />
You can check out Kilamana magelo in my Sig.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Kila</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd sit on the 100K unless you manage to run across a Helm of RZ at that price. You're gear looks good with very little to upgrade in the bazaar. You might look into the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest to get rid of that Lodi shield. <br />
<br />
If you're really looking to do a few small upgrades you could look for a Ear Symbol of the Veteran and/or Tear of the Rainmaker to give a little more AC/HP in the ears or a Steel Ring of Earthen Risiliance(sp?) would upgrade the Valorium rings. However I'd wait until I could afford a BoC or Helm of RZ if I were you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sell the lodi shield and get some random cloak with 80hp, i forget what it's called.<br />

edit: chrinos cape of the werewolf or similar</div></div><hr />
