<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gotta quick question for those who have this.  Does the shield of the arcane act as a heal as well?  Is the buff nice, ie stack with other buffs etc?  I have a chance to buy the mold and I wanted to know if it was worth it.  (or save up more for something like BoC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">doesnt heal. it is nice if you think an extra 300hp, 30ac, and 30mr is nice when a shammy isnt around to focus you, since the only thing it does not stack with are shammy hp talismans and focus. it does work with IoS tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, it sux it doesnt stack anymore :(<br />
Cuz I recently found out in a group playing my wizard and the shammy told me Focus didnt stick.. I was like, how? lol<br />
<br />
Ah well... i guess it was needed :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any more? The caster shielding line has never stacked with the shaman hp line unless maybe in Beta or something. Was there an exploit with this BP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Naw, focus just overwrote it. It never stacked as long as I've had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The buff doesnt' stack with Focus or heal any hps but.........it is a very nice buff.  If you regularly group with a shaman or druid as a healer the extra ac is greater than the extra hps that focus gives you since they don't have a true cheal anyway.  It also is another clickable buff for raids and the like for getting buffs in the order that you want them in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have to buy the BP, then don't bother. For the cost of a BP, you could buy a couple upgrades and still have enough cash to buy Focus in PoK every night for a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">meh depends on how much cash you got .. you have full FH atm ... so any upgrades are going to be very expensive.  no weapon is worth buying other than CHoS/SoBS because you wont get your monies worth.  kizraks, on the other hand, will last you until PoTime.  slap a 40hp aug on it and go get some levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
i assume you are an alt, seeing as youre decked out to hell with decent buyables with only 2 aa's.  assuming you have a lv 65 main, you might want to get a group or 2 of friends/guildees together and drop the SW tower mob playing either your main or your bot.  if you dont get the BP mold from that, you at least run the chance of picking up one of them nifty GBoS's ... which surprisingly ... will also last you until PoTime with a nice ldon proc on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fraid not, this is my main and I just got 65 last night.  Ive been off and on EQ for a while, never had a good chunk of time to exp.  Ive only got enough for the BP and no more so after learning that the buff doesnt heal I gave that up.  I did a gear suggestion thread a while back but there wasnt any major upgrades that I could buy that would be like wow.  <br />
<br />
Only thing in my head that might help me out a lot is a BoC but those go for around 400k+.  My plan was to exp to 65 (which Ive done), Get a bunch of AA's (def and maybe some off), and gear up via LDoN.  Augs come to mindas well as some of the warr gear.  Is there any warr gear that isnt too expensive worth getting in LDoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">40hp augs (save till you wont get rid of that armor for a long time)<br />
10ac augs (save till you wont get rid of that slot for a while)<br />
Royal Attendant (best armor pre-Ep's excluding GoD)<br />
Augments .. save em till you wont rep the slot for a while ... cheap a2 or yak to droga combo is nice<br />
<br />
hard ldon drops are keepers ... toss 10ac and 40hp augs on them as time allows.  Ldon is heavensent for the casual raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">EF armor is pretty good bang for your adv point buck.  North Ro armor is typically slightly better (for a warrior anyway), although it varies from slot to slot, and neither is a  huge upgrade to FH in most slots, but a lot of small upgrades do tend to add up.  Also, EF armor is roughly half the point cost of North Ro.  Your goal should probably be a hodgepodge of ornate, EF, North Ro armors.  There are a few other droppable armors that are available in the bazaar (expect to spend a lot of cash for some of them).  Can't see your magelo from work, but if you're looking to get aggro weapons, BoC is really nice if you get it as a drop, but if you're buying it, it isn't enough better than other stuff out there to justify the half a million plat price tag.  Droga weapons with anger aug's will do nicely until you can get better through raiding.  With the new weapon affinity and anger augs, it takes a real bonehead to steal aggro from us now.  It can be done, but somebody has to be either doing it intentionally or a real asshat to do it for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Go ahead and load up on 40hp and 10ac augs now. The devs have already said that augs will soon be removeable. By the time you get upgrades that should be in place and you can just transfer your augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why are they being removed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">removeable<br />
<br />
As in &quot;able to be removed&quot;<br />
<br />
As it stands now they poof in a green ball of smoke... soon to be &quot;removable&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlaydennSL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Removable as in re-usable. Currently, if u dissolve an aug, thats it, goodnight, no more aug. Dev's have finally realised that people get crappy when they spend 1150 LDoN points in EF on Anger3 for their OBoW, only to receive BoC 2 days later, and have to earn all the points again....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That will be really sweet. I've got questionable gear in my magelo that I have not augmented because I intend to upgrade the slot as soon as possible. (My champion's vambraces and death embracer helmet, for example.) I didn't want to augment those and lose the augment a week later.<br />
<br />
Very cool.<br />
<br />
Sounds like somebody at the summit paid attention to the customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i dont think im ready to flippantly start auging crummy gear but i do know that the facepiece i recently upgraded .. which has a 10ac aug on it ... im not going to be taking that aug off before i learn that they have become reusable. nice to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree in waiting before I start auging stuff that I expect to replace.  They have mentioned the possibility of making it a tradeskill function which would also mean a chance of failure most likely.  If that happens, I might still hold off in auging something crappy.  It would be nice to anger3 aug my CHSD until I can get a GBoS to replace it with, but until I know that I will be able to remove the aug, I will not put one on the thing.  Until then, it is a crap stat aug drop from regular adventure type mobs.<br />
<br />
Once I see how they implement this and see how it works, THEN I will maybe aug some of my crappier slots.</div></div><hr />
