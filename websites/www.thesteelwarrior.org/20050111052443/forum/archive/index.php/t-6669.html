<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last weekend, my guildies and I killed our 1st named in Kod'tak. It dropped a 20ac aug and a Rune. <br />
<br />
A rogue and I were rolling for the rune among other casters but something tells me that I should have passed the rune to casters. At the end, a cleric won and she get a new Heal over time spell.<br />
<br />
I cant find much info about the GoD combat skill tomb. Do you think I should roll at the next rune or pass it to my fellow guildies casters for better overall benefit to the grp/guild?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Warriors get this - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5015</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thnx Derrict. Guess I will pass the rune until everyone got it.<br />
<br />
BTW, do it mean there is no randomness of what skill tomb you will get from turning in the rune?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You always get Bellow of the Mastruq.  There are no other tomes.<br />
<br />
I think it's a decent upgrade over Incite.  Most of our early Runes actually went to Warriors first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the complaints many casters had in PoP was the numerous repeat spells they would get from a parchment turn in, so GoD set it up to  have just 1 particular spell/tome on these stone turn-ins, while the rest of the spells are mob dropped.  Which, from what I've seen, has been fairly rare and terrible drop rates so a bunch still don't have their full spells.  Since they're all made no drop, you can't hook up guildies unless they're in your group or nearby so you can shuttle them in (if in an expedition) to get the spell or stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nearly every class gets marginal upgrades on rune spells at best, really there is no reason to pass to barely any class as  warrior, the ability is just as good - if not better then other class's imo</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question, are these the same type of Rune's that drop in Baston of Thunder or is it some thing different found only in Gate of Discord zones?<br />
<br />
thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Glyphed Rune Word - Planes of Power - turned in for random L65 spell. Whichever NPC you hand it in to determines what class spell it will be.<br />
<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone - Gates of Discord - turned in for specific L65 spell or discipline. The class looting the stone determines what class spell/disc will be returned. The turn-in NPC is the same for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-02-2004, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get 10% more snap agro.<br />
A cleric gets 10% more HoT.<br />
A wizard gets 10% more DPS.<br />
<br />
We rolled every single rune we've seen so far.<br />
Too much whining otherwise, despite its not very guildwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">05-02-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, if some of your guildmate warriors have Bellow and you do not, their bellow will overwrite your incites on mobs, and your incite will not land until their bellow wears off.  While it's not a massive taunt or anything, this could be the difference between a smooth tank transition, and a wipe.  Roll for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RhaamanNoodles</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't really done much with GoD yet. How tough are KT named that drop the rune? Can a VTish group do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt 1 group of VT geared will do the minis.  They hit roughly 1700-1900, even slowed they can dish out some decent dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keldo</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as long as you have 2 healers + tank + dps you should be fine.  Just avoid yellow con named and go full disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Derrict, theres a non-EP non-VT group that's beaten Ikkinz 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that i want to see. Even with 100% Full Augmented LDoN....<br />
DD is gonna really hurt, and not even talking about the DPS needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess if you could get a VT tank to 8khp/2kac unbuffed, and get the clerics to 6k+ mana with mana preservation and great spell haste it could be possible, but I don't think you could do that with a non-vt+ geared group, and yes, GoD drops are VT+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When people say there is a non-VT, non-EP group who beat trial 1 I don't think they mean their gear is not around those levels. It just means they haven't actually raided those zones. The group I play with are all unguilded and don't raid at all. However, we are very well equipped and when looking at magelos, our gear levels are around mid-level EP guilds.<br />
<br />
I reach 10.5k and almost 1900ac fully buffed without a stitch of vt/ep loot. It's all about making the best use out of what can be achieved with 1-2 groups. <br />
<br />
We haven't had enough time since we've been to Ikkinz to give a real shot at DD so I have no clue how hard she really is, but regular KT named/Pixtt Annihilator are definately doable without ever setting food in VT/EP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, Fynepisa was who I was referring to, and I misread his (her?) previous post -- they killed PA, but havent tried DD yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I guess when you say 'VT geared' in today's terms it's a lot different than when I was doing VT 2+ years ago due to all the new PoP/GoD AAs and augments available to you.  A VT warrior use to be under 6k hp / 1500 ac but I guess they're capable of 8.5k / 1.9k ac these days with augments and hp aa.<br />
<br />
DI, riposte disc, stonewall and spam heals should be sufficient for anyone with ~ 10-10.5k buffed hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, the Taelosian Geomancy Stone seems to be a somewhat common drop off any named in KT or Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
Every class gets a nice little upgrade at something, so most people seem to think however they get passed out is fine. But after thinking about it, it seems clearly better for some classes than others. For instance wiz vs. war: wiz gets 10% more damage from his best damage spell, and that's about all a wiz will do in most fights, so he does his job about 10% better. Meanwhile warrior gets 10% more aggro from Incite by using BoM, but Incite/bom is only generates a small fraction of our aggro. And BoM doesn't help us tank any, so our total improvement is very small. Hmmm, but then again, if we instead lose aggro by a hair others can die so there's a Huge payoff in preventing that... hehe, guess everybody needs it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and nice going Fynepisa, looks like you have more AC/HP than many warriors that are in guilds that are racing to elemental named gods, all those Ldon and GoD augs, and 3 Time-quality loots (type 8) from KT/ikk really help. :)</div></div><hr />
