<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow warriors!<br />
<br />
After working hard to become the warrior I am today, I'd like some advise about which way to go now.<br />
<br />
Of course raiding is one of the ways to upgrade my gear, my guild (dkp guild) is currently doing PoP (TT, Grummus, MB, BoT, Xana, etc...) Ssra (AL, High Priest...) Kael (AoW, KT...) and the like... I'm usually SA/TA...<br />
I really enjoy LDoN and I'm 1 adventure away from the EF greaves, which seem to be a big upgrade for me (got thurg greaves atm)<br />
<br />
I still hope to get lucky in BoT and get ornate bracers, but so far I haven't been very lucky on rolls ( except for the earring ;-) ) and I still don't seem to be very able to tank Smid (after I get PD3 I'll start working on LR5 asap)<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=648999<br />
All advise and comments are highly appriciated!<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only outstanding thing I see are your greaves, they don't have any raw hp. Get some CT deity greaves from the bazaar, 40 ac, some raw hp and other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The EF LDon greaves have 70hp (?) I'll get those today or tomorrow I guess :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your  on CoV faction and have the power, I'd get a dozekar the curesed farming crew together.<br />
<br />
Here are 3 items that are the result of Doze quests, these 3 are the best imo.<br />
<br />
 Silver Bracer of Speed (http://www.magelo.com/components/eq_item_shot.jsp?num=31461) <br />
<br />
<br />
Silver Charm of Tranquility (http://www.magelo.com/components/eq_item_shot.jsp?num=31460) <br />
<br />
<br />
Pauldrens of the Deep Flame (http://www.magelo.com/components/eq_item_shot.jsp?num=31472) <br />
<br />
Also, you should be able to aquire the parts for the Strength of the Elements quest, it would be a powerful upgrade for your shoulder slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Loyalist Shield of Honor would be a huge ac upgrade,  32ac &gt; 5 hps and some stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
All really depends on how much you want to upgrade yourself really. <br />
<br />
You could farm ornate peices and sell them and get decent upgrades  through the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Or just keep raiding and rack up the DKP, then spend it on some loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Farming Doze is not an option really, altho the results are of course awesome.<br />
<br />
Strength of the Elements quest is on top of my list now :)<br />
<br />
Loyalist Shield is awesome, but near impossible to get as an iksar, and another warrior I know tried to get it and told me the quest seems to be bugged atm, but I'm not sure about that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done the entire quest all the way up until I have to get the ashes off of the named vamp in the coterie castle. How is the quest bugged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You've already passed through the part where I ran into trouble, Renix.<br />
<br />
The problematic part isn't a bug so much as a misunderstanding. Basically, do NOT turn in your figurine to Lathin Firetree unless you're ready to fight the shades in Katta right then. The figurine can be used to spawn the quest version of Ajeea only once.<br />
<br />
A useless GM who replied to my petition at 3am while I was in trader mode told me to file a /bug on it. Gee. Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quetazl Coatl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would do Loyalist shield quest. Already completed it as an Iksar. See posts in The Keep section.<br />
<br />
I do have a question about the CT armor....anyone know the name of it? I've searched several times to no avail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">fearsome skyiron it the name, it sticks...<br />
<br />
ogres and troll who workship CT have another kind of armor but iksar can't wear it... sadly.<br />
<br />
thx for the reply's guys!</div></div><hr />
