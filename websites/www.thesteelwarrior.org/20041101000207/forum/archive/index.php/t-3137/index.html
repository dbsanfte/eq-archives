<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so I desperately need some upgrades. .http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=787418. im a 56 war who's currently not in an uber guild or even a good guild honestly for the most part ( couldnt get a group together with em for the life of me) and i was wondering if anyone could give me some points on places to go for upgrades. My two most obvious choices would be Droga and Veksar but I cannot get a group in them nor can I seem to get a guild group together to get in them for drops. I would just make money and buy the neccesary upgrades but HHK is overcamped all the time and I can never seem to find any good solo spot. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks again.<br />
<br />
P.S yea i know i havent updated my ATK and AC yet i keep forgetting to write them down when i log off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SolA has some good pp farming in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maadaasaakaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or go the trade supplies route, go to your bazaar find out what sells for what, then work out how to acquire said items and sell em !<br />
<br />
A couple of free examples that payed for a lot of gear for me;<br />
<br />
Acyrlia ore, take some bandiads and kill grimlings in tenebrous mountains, go left from zone in till you find the first mine, keep clearing the mobs over and over, you will get ore, keep any windstones that drop they also sell well to trade skill folk.  Sell all the other drops, runes and gems to vendors in Katta, (where you will also buy you bandaids).  A nice bonus to this spot is killing the Grimling runner who drops a satchel you need for the relic pack quest.  So.. you can also make and sell relic packs, 10 slot giant 90% wr bags, sell for 800-1000 plat each on MM.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Ore also drops in Acyrlia caverns more commonly, but you wont be able to solo in there, so take a few friends, youll get XP as well.<br />
<br />
Another method to make plat but requires some patience and a tailoring skill of 60 or so is to farm and make leather padding.<br />
<br />
Head to marus seru, and kill rockhoppers like you are hell  bent on their extinction, bow pull  6 at a time and get slaying them.  They drop two kinds of hides, keep both, one type can be combined with a pattern to skill up tailoring. The other combined with shadling silk threads makes leather padding, there is a great spot in shadeweavers thicket over in the south east corner for farming the silk just keep whacking the skeles (look up the details at eqtrader), on mith marr leather padding can sell for up too 25 plat each, and they stack soo one stack =400-500 plat.<br />
<br />
I burned myself out on leather padding as I used it to skill up smithing and sold the leftovers.<br />
<br />
Both of these methods will net you good plat vs the time invested.<br />
<br />
And as has been mentioned many, many times play the buy low sell high game in the bazaar, you just need a small amount of start up capital and get going for it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get out exping in LDoN. <br />
<br />
Take the initiative and start forming groups from the /lfg lists if noone invites you to an existing group. In these 'pickup' groups, you'll make some new friends, people who actually play. Ultimately look for another guild, because you don't seem to be part of a worthwhile guild. LDoN drops great pure cash and vendor trash, and while you're getting that, you'll also be getting great exp and adventure points which you can use to buy stuff of a calibre you couldn't dream of affording.<br />
<br />
Oh, and LDoN is gonna kill off the acrylia tradeskill market, so I wouldn't start down that route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maadaasaakaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye probably a good point, though I was unsure from the original post whether or not they have LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN honestly seems like its a lot of crap right now lol, anything nice out of it is no drop for the most part and im makin more out of HHK even when someones campin it. I guess i was just hoping for that dream camp, or some good place to head where I could actually find a group. Exping isnt a problem for me LDoN exp still doesnt compare to planes exp, I was just in some serious need of some gear upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LDoN is by far the best place for VT. Not only do you get 5 plat weapons, you get 70 plat gems (with 37 cha), and 3-4 pure plat on a loot. You also get to have a shitload of fun and get decent exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You also get to have a shitload of fun  <br />
<br />
Darn straight!  Really thats the main reason....also you'll be able to upgrade your toon as you win some missions.  From lookin at your Magelo LDON is going to be very nice for you (and won't force you into becoming a guild lackey to get it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The split from every LDoN run I have been on has come out at 200-300pp each.  Do 4 of these in an evening and theres 1k plat.<br />
<br />
Its kinda nice to be killing stuff that drops PP and sellables again, although its also the first time I have heard of people MLing and then going LD at the end of an adventure in a long time too.  Just another reason to stick to guild groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I understand all this but it seems every damn person at my level has a much better bp than me lol. I just want to replace this crusty bp and hardened leather kodiak bracer then im content till 60, any suggestions? Keep in mind (----no good guild = P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lots of options for a good BP these days.<br />
