A married couple were asleep when the phone rang at 2 in the morning.The wife (undoubtedly blonde), picked up the phone, listened a moment and said, <br />
&quot;How should I know, that's 200 miles from here!&quot; and hung up. <br />
<br />
The husband said, &quot;Who was that?&quot; <br />
<br />
The wife said, &quot;I don't know, some woman wanting to know if the coast <br />
is clear.&quot; <br />

SECOND DEGREE <br />

Two blondes are walking down the street. One notices a compact on the <br />
sidewalk and leans down to pick it up. She opens it, looks in the <br />
mirror and says, &quot;Hmm, this person looks familiar.&quot; <br />
<br />
The second blonde says, &quot;Here, let me see!&quot; <br />
<br />
So the first blonde hands her the compact. <br />
<br />
The second one looks in the mirror and says, &quot;You dummy, it's me!&quot; <br />

buys a gun. <br />
<br />
She goes to his apartment unexpectedly and when she opens the door she <br />
finds him in the arms of a redhead. Well, the blonde is really angry. <br />
She opens her purse to take out the gun, and as she does so, <br />
she is overcome with grief. She takes the gun and puts it to her head. <br />
<br />
The boyfriend yells, &quot;No, honey, don't do it!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
The blonde replies, &quot;Shut up, you're next!&quot; <br />

A blonde was bragging about her knowledge of state capitals. <br />
She proudly says, &quot;Go ahead, ask me, I know all of them.&quot; <br />
<br />
A friend says, &quot;OK, what's the capital of Wisconsin ?&quot; <br />
<br />
The blonde replies, &quot;Oh, that's easy: W.&quot; <br />

<br />
Bambi, a blonde in her fourth year as a UCLA freshman, sat in her US <br />
government class. The professor asked Bambi if she knew what Roe <br />
vs.Wade was about. <br />
<br />
Bambi pondered the question then finally said, &quot;That was the decision <br />
George Washington had to make before he crossed the Delaware.&quot; <br />
<br />

SEVENTH DEGREE <br />
<br />
Returning home from work, a blonde was shocked to find her house <br />
ransacked and burglarized. She telephoned the police at once and reported the <br />
crime. <br />
<br />
The police dispatcher broadcast the call on the radio, and a K-9 unit, <br />
patrolling nearby was the first to respond. As the K-9 officer <br />
approached the house with his dog on a leash, the blonde ran out on the porch, <br />
shuddered at the sight of the cop and his dog, then sat down on the steps. <br />
<br />
Putting her face in her hands, she moaned, &quot;I come home to find all my <br />
possessions stolen. I call the police for help, and what do they do? <br />
<br />
They send me a BLIND policeman.&quot; <br />
