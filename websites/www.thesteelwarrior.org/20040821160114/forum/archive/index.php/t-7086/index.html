whats with the class envy and nerf requests going on the SK boards lately?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow -- those are some ticked off shadowknights.

<br />
The SK's of my acquaintance don't seem to be suffering like those poor bastards on that board. They rarely main tank when a warrior of similar level is present, but then again, they don't ask me and my warrior buds to pull or provide much DPS. But when adds come to play and there's no crowd control, they get to tank, and they seem to do it well enough. <br />

I personally think their egos could use a little deflating, myself, but that's just me.  They do need to have their skills/spells actually mean something IMO, but they really should be focusing on that instead of &quot;make me a better tank&quot;.  How about asking the devs to actually design something AROUND the SK or the Paladin instead of only around the warrior?</div></div><hr />

So true .. I retired my warrior to make an SK main and to be honest I'm happy with the class so far.  I fill the role of puller when needed to (FD is so handy, and yes MOST groups need a puller, so i do classify it as a ROLE) and my agro skills are probably as good as a War with a BoC or there about, my tanking is sufficient for grinds and LDoN.  So really the only place I dont really have a true place is raids *shrugs* to me its a trade off that I'm okay with as well as these 'new' GoD trials in Ikkinz... in pure grinds i 'can' fill 2 roles (tank and/or puller) which is more than a warrior can say in many situations.<br />
<br />
I do feel for Pallys I dont feel they can heal sufficient enough to occupy a healing role in a group for the most part their tanking maybe sufficeint for a grind but should be given something else also imho.<br />
<br />
To see such posts on the SK boards though, kinda shocked me... I mean that seems like a lot of hatred. (maybe I'm still a warrior in heart and I'm biased... I dont know)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The problem that you are dealing with is that many of those WAR assholes want tanking DOMINANCE. They could care less about class balance. <br />
thats all i needed to know to gauge the level of bullshit that thread would contain, class balance doesnt mean there are no class lines</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well they are part right if you can see past the howling retard quota.  There are alot of warriors who want &quot;tanking DOMINANCE&quot;.  I don't think its acurate to say that those warriors &quot;could care less about class balance&quot; though, just that they have a different view on what class balance is.  I guess if you want to call people with a different view on the subject you are debating &quot;assholes&quot; then thats your call, just don't expect to earn alot of respect for your point of view doing it.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have class balance between 3 tanking classes when one of those classes is the dominant tank and the others are balanced via their spell books and utility?  Until there is some agreement on the above statement I don't think the warrior or knight camps are going to see eye to eye.  Atleast its quicker to read a thread of retards calling each other arseholes then 20 pages of Tavendor(sp) and battleblade quoting and requoting each other until Absorch posts and everyone piles in to flame his english.</div></div><hr />

Warriors have an advantage in melee damage. Where, to increase our dps, we have to increase both spell AND melee AA's, a warrior can merely work on their melee aa's and get a decent dps upgrade. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sacrore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm just here to try to figure out better how each side sees the other.  I've played a SK casually for 2 years.  I have seen nothing of GoD.  I have spent a lot of time on SKO trying to figure out how best to play my class...but that's irrelevant.  What it comes down to is that i've seen all the various posts discussing/bitching about lack of Knights being able to do their job in GoD.  From what I can see, it's a bit more difficult than it should be, but not far off as some knights would like you to believe.  I think that WAR and PAL/SK disagree on the severity of the problem.  I dont want to get into that here.  What I do want to get into is one of the intelligent arguements i've seen over there that doesnt seem to come up much; that being the whole &quot;stepping on toes&quot; thing.  <br />
<br />
I know for a fact that knights dont need any sort of disc resembling defensive before GoD...beyond that i'm not sure and at any rate not in favor of it.  For the knights that dont want it, we argue we dont want to be warriors; we want to be ourselves.  For warriors that dont want us to have it, they say in many cases (as have the devs) that it would be &quot;stepping on warriors' toes&quot; to do so.  What I have seen from some in the knight community is a feeling that our toes have been stepped on; I believe this is why many knights are beginning retalitory attacks on warriors.  From the get go there was the most simple balance.  Knights had good initial aggro, allowing the fight to begin for everyone else sooner, resulting in quicker mob death.  Warriors had to build initial aggro before others engaged, but as a trade off took less damage than a comparably leveled, AAed and geared knight.  Effectively both worked just fine, and did so for a long time.  I will be the first to say that warriors' initial aggro was too weak during PoP and needed an upgrade; it was detrimental to the warrior to be lacking as he was.  However, I also feel that it was a bit overdone.  Yes, you definitely needed the fix, but it was overdone.<br />
<br />
As far as raid roles go, the snap aggro allowed knights to add tank superbly.  Knights had a raid role of offtanking.  Here is where a major problem for SKs seems to be (i'm not a paladin and cant speak for them here).  When warriors got their new aggro discs, it upped there initial aggro.  Fine.  SK initial aggro is still better than warrior initial aggro.  The problem lies in that warriors now have enough initial aggro to reliably take aggro on a raid add .  It doesnt matter if the SK can create twice the initial aggro; if a warrior can get the aggro, and takes less damage by default because he is a warrior, why take a SK at all?  There isn't a reason to anymore.  I think that more SKs are angry about losing their raid roll...many people do nothing but raid.  So in this way many in the SK community feel that warriors have stepped on our toes by being given as much aggro capability as they have been.<br />
<br />
I know that you guys arent gonna be happy with a nerf; hell i'd be pissed if someone suggested nerfing me.  But as I (and at least quite a few other that i know) see it, the devs stepped on our toes by giving you snap aggro sufficient to do the role we formerly excelled in:  raid offtanking.  If you can do it, and because you take less damage do it better by default it eliminates knights from being meaningful.<br />
<br />
I just want the warrior community to understand this.  The devs gave you the capability to do our primary role (add tank) and because of what your class already had (best mitigation, which it should have) you became best at it.  So one of 2 things is going to happen.  Either incite/provoke has to be lessened to still be effective in single group content, yet allow knights to have slightly superior capability, via initial aggro, in raid add tanking only, or to boost knight mitigaion capability.  They've made you more like us; now either change it to be resemblant (yet not having WARs broken) to what it was, or make us more like you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">With the amount of whining in that thread youd think we had a disc that sent a supermodel around to our house to give us a blowjob whenever we pushed it.</div></div><hr />

See, I don't follow this.  Add tanking is just that, add tanking.  Whoever can do a decent job should be doing it.  So what if the Warrior can do it a &quot;bit&quot; better?  You are either able to add tank or you aren't.  Knights are able to add tank.  Using a Warrior, unless they pop defensive, just isn't going to be that much of a difference.  And if you'd like to claim it is, please explain why anyone would care if it's a Warrior add tanking or a Knight add tanking if both are doing fine at it.  It just isn't, nor will it ever be, your exclusive territory.<br />

<br />
There won't be a nerf.  You're dreaming if you think there will be.  If you nerf Warrior aggro you push them back into being nearly non-functional for the PoP+ game, which is where the majority of people play these days.  I'd bet a considerable amount of money that not even SoE would do that.<br />
<br />
Either incite/provoke has to be lessened to still be effective in single group content, yet allow knights to have slightly superior capability, via initial aggro, in raid add tanking only, or to boost knight mitigaion capability. They've made you more like us; now either change it to be resemblant (yet not having WARs broken) to what it was, or make us more like you.<br />
<br />
You already have more initial aggro on demand, if you want it.  You can fire of two or three aggro spells one after another just as fast as the icons refresh.  I absolutely do not believe in anyway shape or form that incite is equal to that.  And if you're going to argue that is, you're going to need to offer up something more than just your say so or the say so of Knights who &quot;think&quot; it's true.<br />
<br />
And understand this, add tanking is fast paced group tanking, in effect.  If a Warrior doesn't have enough initial aggro to add tank, then he's going to be broken for group tanking because they are effectively the same.  There's nothing special about the mobs you're cutting through on the way to a boss mob, in the majority of cases.  So trying to claim that Warriors shouldn't be able to add tank but should be able to group tank is a complete contradiction.  It would be like my saying you should be able to play dead, but not feign death.<br />
<br />
And no, they did not make Warriors more like Knights.  They made them effective.  You don't have the only claim to a right to be effective.  You are effective.  Where Knights have been struggling changes are supposed to be being made or have been made.  You can do your job and do it fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Knights still excel in addtanking anything that is/could be mezzable. Incite doesnt cover even a single mez resist worth of agro and taunt is massively unreliable. Do not discount the value of doing damageless agro, its an extremely valuable tool. On *most* other raid adds/offtank needed mobs, there is no difference in practice between a knight and a warrior. Unless you wait 10.5 mins between pulls, warriors are not using defensive on them, and our agro &quot;advantage&quot; only shows itself over long periods of fighting. When you are the only person hitting a mob, at least for the start of a pull... then what does an agro advantage over time do for you? Isnt the initial agro (which knights still are better at.. procs are still random) far more important for add tanking? Isnt damageless agro far more useful then the ability to proc alot of hate off melee damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">so if warriors can effectively add tank, then what role does a SK bring to a raid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can do it ALSO....<br />
<br />
I dont know many clerics that can solo like a druid, so these classes have different strengths in different areas. <br />
<br />
I have seen alot of arguements saying that since a warrior has effective initial aggro, that knights having the potential for more initial damage free aggro means nothing.... I think anyone who has played knights AND warriors can cut through the bullshit pretty easy on arguements like this.  <br />
<br />
BOTH classes should be able to split tank adds.  Why should a warrior not be able to split tank an add?  Because split tanking an add is a role that knights claim as their own?  That's odd, ive seen knights main tank at alot of raids...  I would therefore come to the conclusion that in many situations both can be done by both.</div></div><hr />

A number of Knights have made the claim that because Warriors (among other classes) received the Phase 1 Melee Update and improved aggro abilities that Knights should therefore tank more like Warriors and receive a Defensive discipline.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that the Wariror Class Description states:<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
Verant/SoE contended that (paraphrase since I can't find the quote atm):<br />
'It's the group's responsibility to maintain aggro.'<br />
<br />
This arrangement worked ok until Knights obtained sufficient survivability that they were not a burden to to keep alive. In LDoN easy for example they had:<br />
<br />
1. Practically the same survivability as Warriors. The innate Warrior HP advantage was ~386HP's after AoTC.<br />
<br />
2. Vastly superior ranged aggro control.<br />
<br />
3. Additional value from spellbooks. In the case of Paladins this included buffs that mesh very nicely if a Druid or Shaman is the main healer, Res, Root, Pacify, etc.<br />
<br />
In PoP some few camps were Warrior prefered ie. BoT tower named. But for the most part players began slowing on incoming and superior Knight aggro control made them widely prefered.<br />
<br />
In LDoN there was NO marginal advantage to group a Warrior in ANY situation. Superior aggro control and added value from spellbooks left Warriors /lfg.<br />
<br />
Warriors made their case. They provided statements by Verant/SoE, comments about inferior Wariror aggro control from every class board, parses, Magelos, /who all Warrior 65 lfg and /who all Paladin 65 /lfg counts, etc.<br />
<br />
SoE listened and provided Warirors with the needed adjustment so that:<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
An SoE spokesman described these changes as &quot;needed&quot; to restore the proper balance. When asked about Knight improvements since Warriors received an upgrade, he pointed out that these changes were to restore balance and that you do not balance a scale by adding weight to both sides.<br />
<br />
Knights liked to claim the GoD issues, which affected less than 400 Knights in the game, were much like the Wariror aggro issues and that therefore Knights should get Defensive.<br />
<br />
However:<br />
<br />
1. Aggro issues affected almost every Warrior and could not be aliviated by content changes.<br />
<br />
2. Brenlo stated that GoD content was too hard and was being adjusted - problem solved.<br />
<br />
3. Some Knights asked for Defensive or asked that Defensive be removed from the game before, during, and after some minor GoD issues came to light (minor in the sence that Top Paladins were in fact raiding high level content with their guilds, had the loot drops form trials, etc.)<br />
<br />
They forgot, as Brenlo pointed out:<br />
Conor is correct, much of what is asked for by Paladins and SKs is specific to warriors and that will not be changing. Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. The fact that warriors can tank the harder content in Gates, while the knight classes cannot, does not mean Pallys and SKs are broken, rather that warriors are better tanks and that the content is too challenging. There is supposed to be a disparity between the tanking abilities of warriors and knights. Paladins and SKs want to be able to tank in the single group encounters, and they are right, they should be able to, but not at the expense of other classes.<br />
You see, Warriors were correct - the aggro issues were universal and required a change to restore balance and the Knight/GoD issues were confined to one expansion and required content adjustment. Further, Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />
<br />
That's what's got some Knights in a huff. They were unable to narrow the tanking &quot;gap&quot; that the Phase 1 Melee Update widened with the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change and that GoD widened more with the Sturdyness AA ability (500HP's for 40AA). They did not want to see the long-standing Warrior Primary Tank position continue and did not agree that:<br />
Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs.<br />
They even disagreed with Top Paladins like Sir Nomilus Puhre (Arch Overseers) who astutely observed early in the discusions:<br />
A thirst for the glory is wanted by every Warrior and Knight, but is not possible for all the Warriors and Knights on the raid. Understanding where a paladin fits into the formula of a raiding Machine or Team is more of the big picture many don't seem to remember.<br />
<br />
What do the 3 or 4 other warriors do while a Boss or Named battle is going on? Marginal DPS (yawn), and maybe pray the MT or clerics screw up so that the MT goes splat and he may jump in and tank for the remainder of the fight.<br />
<br />
What can the 4 or so Paladins do while the Boss or Named battle is going on? Marginal DPS, group heals, cures as needed, fast 1 sec heals as needed, LOH as needed, and in the case of an imminent wipe when the Warriors are dead and the Mob is starting to pound your casters / clerics to dust he can &quot;snarf&quot; the agro and maybe get the fight back on track.<br />
SoE is not about to make knights into 95% Warriors with powerful Spellbooks. They already are (or should be) preferred to MT Inny and CT in PoTime and are fully capable of MTing all of PoTime. That is close enough to being able to tank like a Warrior.<br />

<br />
This is another big gripe SKs have.  SK and PAL are not the same.  Paladins do indeed have some decent spells to bring to the table in a raid situation.  SK do not by any means have a &quot;powerful spellbook&quot; when it comes to raids.  Lets see.  Spears normally resisted.  Lifetaps do minimal damage/healing, especially when you look at the mana needed to cast them.  Zbite is good...unless you've got casters nearing the FT cap, which is often times the case; FT 15 plus tribute takes out mana problems.  That doesnt even take into affect its randomness as a proc.  AoH?  With many people closing down on the soft atk cap, they dont want the recourse effect.  Our self only buffs suck, we cant heal anyone else, and if you're using SK to pull in a raid situation something is wrong.  <br />
<br />
So we arent nukers, healers, or slowers, and our dps sucks.  That leaves tanking as what we do--it's what we want to do.  My point is if you can use a warrior, why use a knight?  This is the same as looking at PoP xp groups.  You could do it with a warrior, but using a knight was more efficient and safer.  Ya you guys were broken--you didnt have desirability.  My point here is that my guild has no reason to take me over a warrior.  The war takes less damage...thus requiring less healing (i know this number typically isnt huge but it's still a factor), and if it's a particular nasty add he can pop defensive and we're set.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If you nerf Warrior aggro you push them back into being nearly non-functional for the PoP+ game&quot;<br />
<br />
All i'm asking for is that knights would be able to lock down the mob maybe 1-1.5 seconds earlier.  It probably doesnt even require a nerf.  As it stands I am not wanted for raids.  You could tank back in PoP...you just werent wanted cuz someone else was more efficient at it.  That's where I stand now.  I'd rather not see you nerfed...nerfs suck.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you'd like to claim it is, please explain why anyone would care if it's a Warrior add tanking or a Knight add tanking if both are doing fine at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well lets see.  If we're low on clerics for the night,  i can't safely put knights out there to add tank.  What i can do is have 2 warriors and one cleric and a shammy/druid along with 2 others be a CC group.  If i use 2 knights, i want 2 clerics to be safe.  It allows us to go shorter on clerics and raid more reliably.  <br />
<br />
Also War dps while tanking  is greater than SK dps while tanking.  Why?  Because to hold aggro, i'm gonna sit and cast Clinging.  It does 5/tick if it would somehow manage to land.  Or i'll cast fear, which does no damage at all.  I cant swing while casting.  For me being the offensive tank hybrid I gave up that survivability to do more damage...it's not happening.  I can be the most utilitarian guy around and that's not going to make me a better add tank.  So a warrior takes less damage than I do and puts out more damage than I do.  Why the hell would i be wanted to add tank when a warrior can?  That's why they would care.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So trying to claim that Warriors shouldn't be able to add tank&quot;<br />
<br />
I never said that.  All I'm asking is to give knights a very slight advantage (1-1.5 seconds) in lockdown so they'll actually take me along and use me.  Warriors should be able to add tank.  They should be viable at it.  They shouldn't be clearly preferred--we should be on roughly equal footing as it comes to add tanking desirablility.<br />
<br />
What this probably requires is a final correction of the way aggro works, because we all know it's broken.   Whether SOE will actually put in the effort to fix it is another thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I just get frustrated with it. I am in a small old school type guild where we try to do everything with less than the norm and usually only have myself and maybe 1 other warrior in the raid. The second warrior is usually 4th on the list after one of our Pali's and SK's. They do great and no where near useless as some keep posting. When i die they do great usually, it just makes me wonder what game these guys are playing or if they even understand what they can do.<br />
<br />
On the off tanking warriors have always been able to off tank. When no one is casting on a mob and it's just you OT'ing aggro has hardly ever been an issue. With incite our job is easier but the idea that it is aggro on demand is off. It is aggro on demand only if the other players alow it, this just gives us a little more breathing room for them to screw up. We use knights to ot mostly not because of the aggro on demand but because of their ability to heal albeit small heals they can usually ot somewhere like SSRA without much attention from the healers for a good amount of time if they need the healer at all. Warriors will never be able to do that.</div></div><hr />

Here it is again, you apparently missed it. Brenlo pointed out (and he was NOT the first to do so):<br />
Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. <br />
Like Paladins (woo woo, I enjoy pointing out SK's are like Paladins only part Warrior), SK's do not have a Primary Tank's role in raids.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you might want to start over and state that SK's just want to be effective add tanks in raids. I'll reply that with the content adjustments you should be more effective.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of it -<br />
Your best DPS is done when not MTing, but when raid MTing Warriors generally don't care how much or little DPS they're doing.<br />
<br />
Your spears aren't resisted on the majority of debuffed mobs and [EDIT: Zbite] AoH is frequently cast, especially if you aren't in the same group as a MT and it won't occupy a critical slot - it's not that much different from Paragon being cast during combat and it's regularly cast. (It still would be best to put some of these recourse things in the song window and not the buff box.<br />
<br />
You do have an ability to debilitate a mob, but perhaps not enough. Your best pet is never used on raids. 1/2 of a proper heal + 1/2 of a proper nuke is NOT a fair way to design Lifetaps. Some things we can all agree with and SK's may need some spellbook revision.<br />
<br />
But, you don't need 1 1/2 seconds aggro advantage over Warriors during which Enchanters and Clerics die. In groups vs. normal experiance content, you already have that ability - the Darkness line of spells. You can have a much bigger than 1 1/2 second headstart before the mob begins doing damage.<br />
<br />
As Shikarii observed, we ocassionally get an SK that is informed, understands his class, and is honest in his assessment. Writing such posts might not make the conversation go the way you want, but some of us might mistake you for being knowledgable and capable of sharing insight 8).<br />

On a totally unrelated note, another reason i think the Knight community is bitching is because we learned something.  We watched you guys have a hell of a time through PoP.  There was a lot of intelligent conversation to begin with for solutions, but the bitching got progressively worse.  And it got results.  Your board set a precedent...if they dont listen to the smart stuff then just bitch.  Do I agree with it?  No.  Do i think a lot of intelligent warriors got grouped by association with the fucktards?  Yes.  I think the same will probably happen to SKs.

Well the interesting thing is Feign Death always comes into play for Monks who deliver considerable amount of dps (still lower than rogues however) but cant tank as well as an SK.  I still feel that perhaps the SKs bring the least to raids but yet when it comes to grinds, with FD they do have 2 roles they can fill (in pretty much any given situation) in a group be it puller or tank or both.  I feel that its also the 'trade-off' SoE may have in mind.  Simply the versatility of the class when it comes to a smaller setting like for example grinds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">To any knight out there that thinks the warrior Incite line gives solid snap agro comparable to the knight spell abilities, you are grossly mistaken.  First, incite by itself is usually not enough to pull a mob off anyone.  It is enough if I then run over and hit the mob, but very very very rarely do I hit Incite and have the mob run to me (unless I'm MA and the puller is trying to make that happen via low agro pull spell, FD, etc.)  Also, I can't chain cast incite.  If there a multiple adds and I'm offtanking, there is no way I can grab agro on all of them fast enough to save the casters.  <br />
<br />
Knights can get solid agro at range and cast quickly to get agro on multiple mobs.  This type of ability is ideal for offtanking.  Sure, there may be a few mobs in a few zones a competently geared knight can't offtank...that doesn't mean we should redo class balance because of those isolated situations.<br />

Just an observation but I don't think it was the warrior board that set the precident as that's not the board the dev's seemed to be watching. <br />
I just have a hard time fathoming that other guilds have their knights just do nothing during raids because they are useless. We use ours regularly and I can see where they need help but at the same time it is not like I can solo in Tactics, PoD, Fire or any of the other zones. My class isn't built for that where as I regularly group with an SK in those ares to leech exp from his single group experience if I go with one of our Pali's we usually duo in PoD. As a warrior none of that is an option though even with 9k defensive and all of the other disc's we would be killed. Our knights regularly OT and it's not because of the insta aggro, it is because they can handle the mobs solo without taking a healer from the rotation. <br />
On another note everyone on a raid has a job, the main one is do not get aggro and help make sure the focus person has it. Might not be a huge job but when it goes wrong and takes an hour or two to regroup it sure looks like one. Isn't that about all that any class does? Heal, do not get aggro. Nuke, do not get aggro. Crowd control and try not to let anyone else get aggro. The only difference is that we try to keep aggro. Other than that when you OT you are essentially doing the exact same job as we are just we would die without a healer breaking off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During the first stages of PoP, clerics, shaman, enchanters, wizards, mages, rangers, druids, necros, (I am probably missing a few) were all rightly scared to group with just about any warrior because they simply would die multiple times with a warrior tanking.  The mob needed slowing because of the higher dps and the warrior would need healing quickly.  Knights could just about ensure that an unslowed mob never touched them via ranged aggro and thus were a much lower healing burden than warriors.  Heck, usually the warrior was the last to die in a group.<br />
<br />
During the first stages of GoD I don't hear the uproar from almost every class that Knights are broken, only from the Knights themselves.  I do however think they need a leg up on tanking named in the trials however, warrior's defensive discipline is not the right answer IMO though.  I currently can do Vxed named with around a 40-50% success, a SK in my guild tried tanking last night and went at 20% success, but he has around 1k less hps than me though.  I know we really don't belong there as of yet as we haven't reached the Elemental planes but the loot is too good to pass up for our guild.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Battleblade summed up perfectly how the current knight complaints are NOT like the warrior taunt issues that we &quot;whined&quot; about during PoP.  There's no comparison.  Warriors proved their case from many different directions as BB describes and the devs made the right call based solidly on the evidence.  I'm seeing didley-squat in the way of evidence from knights to back what they want.  We know a few GoD zones/encounters are too dps intensive and Sony is looking at them as we speak.  We have no evidence to show that any content from any prior expansion should be impacted by any changes, as buffing up the knights would do.<br />
<br />
I tried posting on the paladin class board at everquestlive.  That was a waste of time.  I got an SK windbag claiming that I had no clue and that his spellbook was useless.  That's just laughable.  You think the devs will pay ANY attention to you at all if you make such ridiculously untrue statements?  He also enjoyed comparing warrior item self buffs to his spellbook, like the items we can clickie are even close.  It's just stupid.<br />
<br />
As far as that SK board thread goes... *shrug*... they're idiots.  Hopefully the devs can see that.<br />
<br />
The point that you don't balance a scale by adding weight to both sides can't be emphasized enough.  They just recently changed warriors to bring them in line with where the devs think they should be relative to knights in tanking.  It basically helped offset &quot;knightemization&quot; of armor.  Why on earth would they now buff up knight tanking ability?  But that's what knights what because they don't think warriors should have gotten the tanking buff that Sony gave them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you said there would appease a lot of SKs, including myself.  This is why I have such a problem with the &quot;you have a spellbook, you shouldn't tank well&quot; arguement (not accusing you of using that but many do).  If i have the offensive power that i'm supposed to have (the reason i gave up a portion of my defensive capability--the ability to do decent damage via spells), in the form of spells that are going to make a noticeable impact (as opposed to the half-assed lifetaps and such), that gives me a reason to be chosen as an offtank.  Tweak a few resists, upgrade lifetaps, maybe the next necro pet, and fix terrors to work right.  If that is the nature of what is changed, that's fine by me.<br />
<br />
As far as this being an issue like you had in PoP, you're right it isn't universal.  The only point i'm really trying to make is that it is impacting us as SKs, making us less desireable in raids.  It isn't as big a problem because it only affects 2 classes and is only on raids, as opposed to your general aggro problem which affected everyone by them getting slaughtered.  That's why you wont see anyone else talking about this; it's not hurting them.<br />

Utility doenst mean shit on a raid.  I'm not talking about single group content.  I do just fine there (again gates is another story but i cant comment to that).  I am talking about raids.  I'm supposed to be an offensive tank hybrid; that means I should be less defensive and more offensive than a warrior.  I've got the less defensive part down (-1 DI, higher skill caps you have, and that's not even beginning with discs, etc.)  But my dps isnt exactly what i'd call stellar.  If i use dots on a raid, necros will scream bloody murder.  Top 2 spears, they're ok, except the 45 second recast and some resist problems.  Lifetaps cost far too much mana to be effective.  Harmshield will keep me alive for 18 seconds....but drop me to the bottom of the aggro list so i can watch casters and clerics get slaughtered.  If i pull on a raid the monks will want me kicked out.  <br />
<br />
Relative power increase is the issue as i see it.  That's what happened in PoP.  It used to be that you got the pull, tank built aggro, then group engaged.  Knight aggro during PoP changed that to make groups desire immediate aggro.  This is why warriors became undesireable...knights got relatively more powerful.  Warriors didnt lose anything--but neither did they gain and that was the problem.  I was all for fixing warrior aggro cuz it was broken.  I do not understand why you needed more mitigation; you were already ahead of knights comfortably via your riposte/dodge etc caps being higher.  I didnt lose a thing when the melee upgrades went in; you gained enough to a point where it makes you preferred in most situations.  500 hp with gates, 5% bonus amongst others make a big difference.  If your mitigation had stayed the same i dont think anyone intelligent would be saying anything.  Then come the issue of class defining traits: the spellbook versus the discs.  Discs scale to content; spells dont.  The harder the mob hits you, the more defensive does for you.  The more hp the mobs get, my spells do the same damage.  Net result is I fall behind in the relative power curve.  I've played since the Velious days...had warrior aggro been good PoP would have been damn near balanced.  Now, you got the needed fix and more; I got shit.  We've traded places.  I didnt play during Kunark but from listening to elder players I'm glad I didnt; i dont want to end up in a world anything like what i've heard it was.<br />
<br />
Defensive put knights behind the curve in Kunark, aggro put warriors behind the curve in PoP, and now melee upgrades are pushing knights close to the edge of that curve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why exactly do you say this?  You really think a 5% mitigation bonus and 500 HP really make enough difference that Warriors are &quot;preferred&quot; in most situations?  Balls.  I don't believe it.  The only time 500 HP and  a 5% mitigation bonus are going to make a lick of difference is if there is some question as to whether or not that tank will survive at all.  And in that case it's not our 5% mitigation bonus that makes the difference, it's defensive.  Otherwise, no one cares.  They want a tank that can take the beating.  If a Warrior is taking 1045 damage a hit while the Knight takes 1100 damage a hit and both are still standing at the end of the fight, it makes no freaking difference at all.<br />
<br />
Defensive put knights behind the curve in Kunark, aggro put warriors behind the curve in PoP, and now melee upgrades are pushing knights close to the edge of that curve.<br />
<br />
No, you're wrong.  Defensive didn't put the Knights behind the curve in Kunark, there was a lot of other stuff that has since been fixed that put the Knights behind the curve in Kunark.  Hell, no one really knew what defensive was and what it could do until late Kunark and it wasn't until Velious that defensive came into it's own.</div></div><hr />

Do not use your lack of creativity (or guild's lack of utilizing abilities) on the game. You have utility, you just admitted it. If you can't figure out a way to use it to your advantage, or your guild doesn't allow you to (i.e. the monks)  then you should reroll your toon, or take the blinders off your eyes.<br />

In every expansion except GoD, Knights are still the most preferred members of MOST groups, perhaps excluding the BoT named camps. Warriors were given tools to match up yea, I don't think there's a Warrior on this board that would say we still have the shit end of the stick - but realize, Knights still shine in over 90% of every content ever developed. Warriors can do stuff better on raids. Calm yourselves.</div></div><hr />

The one thing that i think i'm seeing (please correct me if i'm wrong) is that a lot of you seem to still lump SK and Pally together.  I know for a general discussion that can work; but pallies and SK have different issues.  My utility skills: dots, DD, debuffs, FD.  Dont use dots, they create stack problems with necros.  My DD is used to increase dps; even with them i'm still a ways behind the true dps classes.  My debuff taps are usually overwritten by caster/priest versions.  FD...IF there isn't a monk i can pull.  That's rare.  CR jobs?  That in no way helps the raid to victory; all it does it make it more convenient and less time consuming to get bodies back.  Sure, in a group all this stuff is great.  That still doesnt give me a raid role if i'm not an offtank.  Pallies can at least buff others with buffs that clerics cant cast.  Their LoH can save the WAR who is MT if a clr blows a heal.  As an offtank, they can lower mob dps by stuns.  Ya they have something to do; all i am is bad dps as an unused tank.  No one likes to be taken along to just fill a spot; yet if you have enough WAR and then Pallies, that's what SKs are relegated to.  <br />

I came here to find out what people thought.  Battleblade had a better idea than I did.  If my offense is upped a bit, i'll be happy with what i've got; it's the relative power increase that is lacking at the moment.  With that, at least i can stand next to you on the raid while you tank and do enough dps to be respectable.  Being respectable on the raid is all i'm asking for.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see GoD content fixed, in a different way than giving knights defensive and giving them a large share of our raid role, which is *their* typical played card for demanding powerups (&quot;Warriors want to be the top-most raid tank, knights just want to be the best group tanks&quot;) -I do know there are knights who want to have a greater raid role, but to be honest, unless this game changes alot, there are just about 6 things needed on a raid - CC, Heals, tank, DPS, pulling, slowing- come up with a new job if you want it.<br />

You're right because there is no reason.  I'm just fine in single group settings (again outside GoD i dont know about there).  Yes, if you see a knight bitching about 1 group problems not related to GoD...you may have said it best Sorguran:  &quot;chucklefucks&quot;.  You are right that the utility that i have is awesome for grouping; the snares and FD specifically are very useful in 1-group settings.<br />
<br />
Back in the day SK were members of the pull team.  Now monks excel at FD pulling to a point you dont need SK to do it.  They dont have the interrupt or fizzle chance on FD that i do, only the fail chance, which i do also.  If i recall correctly, they also get an AA to allow FD to not fail when hit by a spell on the ground (not sure on that though).  Also the lack of cast time makes it faster--less chance of failing by being hit as you fall because you can get it off before you get hit.  If it's a dire situation, yes i can do it. But in general my raid role as a puller is gone.<br />
<br />
As far as the other 5 parts of a raid that you listed, i am unable to heal others or to slow.  Offtanking is a lump together of tanking and CC.  I am not the MT for the raid, nor should i be (unless we're doing stuff back on velious or other obsolete content, or the mob procs fear).  I cant do what is thought of as regular CC: mez, or even ghetto mez.  The only other thing to do on raids is dps; my sustained dps on a long fight (which most raid encounters are) is less than that of a warrior due to the fact i cant go all out burn all the time because i'll go oom far before the end of the encounter.  As burst dps goes, i get HT for one mob every 36 minutes.  In addition i can spear and ToI until i go oom.  Ya my burst dps is better...i have spells...how can it be worse?  That's what i gave up some defense for.  Burst dps is good for finishing the big mob...it doesnt help the raid get to that point faster though.  <br />
<br />
This just amounts to a bunch of rambling, i realize that...i just want you guys to understand that between you guys and pallies i've been relegated to a ranger that has no bow discs for the majority of the raid.  I get to take a kill shot...seems to be the main thing they want me to come to the raid for these days.  <br />
<br />
I dont want to be the raid MT unless i have to...that's a job for warriors.  I dont want warriors to be unable to offtank...that's marginalizing warrior usefulness, which is just bad.  I dont want your discs or your current mitigation ability...those would only serve to water down what little class identity SK have left.  What i do want is a reason to be chosen as an offtank, other than &quot;oh war and pally attendance is down tonight, could you offtank?&quot;  Be it by offensive increase, fine by me.  I'll gladly rotate offtanking with Pal/War...my point is that right now i'm behind the curve to the point they only want me to do it if the other classes arent available.  Thats where you were in PoP...it sucked...you know how it feels to be unwanted.  I want balance, not dominance.</div></div><hr />

You're right because there is no reason. I'm just fine in single group settings <br />
<br />
Can we quote you on this?  Heh... it's refreshing.  I don't agree with all your complaints about raid usefulness, but hell, you're not asking for defensive disc and you're not making blanket claims about your spellbook being useless.  So it's a lot easy to take you seriously at least.  Your statements about single groups (pre-GoD at least) line up with what I've had experience with occasionally being grouped with a knight and the fact that some friends in game who play knights seem to be just fine as MT with their groups.  <br />
<br />
My personal observations and the lack of good evidence to support some knight's claims makes me apt to call BS on their claims of sucking in groups.  :/  GoD is an issue, but as has been stated many times, the devs have been working on it.</div></div><hr />

Well i'd rather if you didn't...especially not on SKO or PoN (a few of the members there would probably flame the mods into banning me  :(  ).  That's my view on things...i dont have any problems getting groups or living once i'm in them (unless i get a cleric that thinks CHeal is gonna get him aggro...there are still a few out there that only want to use HoTs).<br />
<br />
As far SK possibly catching rangers, it could happen with the way thing are now (it shouldn't be allowed to come to that though).  It's been a thought of mine for a while that rangers need a dps boost...their dps isn't where it should be for a dps class.<br />
<br />
Druids.  This is a sticky situation of sorts.  I myself dont find much use for them in a group.  However, pair them with a pally or war, and you've got something for an offtanking group.  Snare (helps keep things in order if someone manages low health aggro) and casting a DS, with a bit of healing.  Obviously i can snare so i dont need that.  Also useful for splash heals...i'd rather see the shamans keeping mana for debuffing the mob and buffing PCs on dispelling mobs.  They dont excel at anything really; but they can do CC, healing, some minimal dps.  I'd like to see them get upped in healing power to break the cleric stranglehold on the top end of things...clerics are a must have.  Clerics should be the best at what they do, but not so good that the raid gets called off if we dont have enough.  Tanking isn't fragmented that badly...you must have 1 warrior for MT, ideal minimum is 3 (if shit is hitting the fan hard), if you bring more because you have more they can offtank.  But if you only have 1 you can still do it.  The problem i have is that having a class required sucks.  If you must have 1, ok.  If you need 6 of em to make it work, we have problems--balance is messed up.  It needs to be fixed...how you go about doing that in the case of druids is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Just my opinion, but I have found SKs to be far better pullers most of the time.  Snare+FD is a powerful combination.  Rune helps on occasion, too.<br />
Snare + FD is powerful, no arguments there.  <br />
<br />
Phantom Call/Shadow + Rapid Feign 3 + no casting time and no chance of fizzle or interrupt on feign + Stonewall 5 + several defense-oriented discs to choose from if things go bad is more powerful, however.  So is lull + fading memories + highsun in a lot of circumstances.<br />
<br />
Hell, I've had Ikkinz trials speed up dramatically by letting the cleric just pacify pull rather than me spend time splitting mobs out.  I'd split out the few mobs that were just around a corner (i.e. if you can see them to cast pacify, you're in aggro range) and let the cleric do the rest of the pulling.<br />
<br />
I'm certainly not trying to claim sk's can't pull, as we can.  We're definately better at it than most classes.  I'm also not trying to whine about monks/bards being better pullers, I'm arguing with the &quot;sk's are far better most of the time because of snare&quot; statement.  Simply put, we aren't &quot;far better pullers most of the time&quot; if you're dealing with high-end content, and certainly not compared to monks, which it sounded like you were doing.  We're second- or third-rate pullers, depending on the circumstance and how good your bards are, and even lower when pacify/harmony-pulling is an option.  <br />
<br />
Don't forget pet pulling.<br />
Keep in mind that the trick to pet pulling is that the pet needs to suvive... and between how fast the mobs in GoD run and how hard they hit, the level 48 necro pet(what sk's get at 64) isn't exactly a huge help most of the time, even buffed.  There are a few limited mobs where it works well, but it's not really a factor in high-end pulling.  Or if it is, I haven't figured it out yet.<br />
<br />

Umm, anything a paladin can offtank, you can offtank(assuming similiar gear).  In fact, 98% of all mobs pre-Uqua you can offtank, period.  Even Uqua is doable unless you get unlucky.  Sure, warriors are a lot better at it, but it's not impossible.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what you're saying is the problem here.  Druids stack pretty well, what with DoTs from different casters stacking, healing always stacks, etc.  Are they required?  No.  But lots of classes aren't absolutely required for a raid.  But they can help heal or add okay dps or do both, plus their buffs.  That's not so bad.  They stack better than warriors, too. :P</div></div><hr />

I've never had a bard puller who knew what they were doing (not even sure that any of them had FM yet).  Last time I did an LDoN with a Bard puller they kept getting killed so I just started pulling myself and we did much better.  And I won't argue with you on the Paci pulling, if it can be done (which has been damn near impossible in most areas with the new engine because of targetting issues).  In Hard LDoNs, the only successes I've had have been with my brother (65 SK) pulling.  Well, except for one adventure where we had no puller and one of the druid would simply pull a bunch and kite them.  I'm not referring to GoD content as I'm not there yet, but so far in hard LDoNs and Tier 3-4 I've had much more success with SKs pulling than any other class.  Back when we did Vindi we always had SKs pull Vindis guards because they could snare them.  I haven't really seen a monk that had convinced me that they are better by any means, but that may be just because I haven't seen a good monk puller yet.  As with everything, it's situational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I really wish some of the whining knights would actually play a warrior in the 65+ game and learn how much easier agro control is for knights.  The last 2 nights I was doing ldon's and twice I lost agro to slow after using incite and getting a proc.  Let's see, my options at that point are...hmm...I can't use incite again until it cycles...that leaves me with taunt and hoping for more procs.  Let me tell you, it's a frustrating feeling watching the caster get pummelled and there's nothing I can do to get agro back.  I lost a cleric last night because we had a 4 pull, someone made a mistake so I burned AET early on, then a heal came on me and the cleric got agro.  I had already used incite so that wasn't an option...all I could do was run over and beat on the mob and hope for a proc or a successful taunt - neither of which happened in the 20 seconds it took for the cleric to buy it.  Good thing I have this great ranged agro lock now... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Now, sit back and think about add tanking on a raid when you get more than 1 mob per tank.  What's a warrior going to do?  Run around and try to hit each mob to get agro??  Not to mention, knights can get solid ranged agro without causing damage and breaking mez (no, incite very very very rarely pulls agro off someone if I don't also beat on the mob or use taunt.)  Knights make great off tanks and bring tons of utility.  I wish these people would learn to play their class.<br />
<br />
Note:  I'm only referring to the knights that whine about pre-GoD &quot;issues&quot;...I know some excellent knights that do know how to play their class and they do bring a ton to the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">In Hard LDoNs, the only successes I've had have been with my brother (65 SK) pulling.  <br />
That sounds more like a skill issue of the people you group with, honestly.  LDoN is a lot more about knowing mob pathing and aggro ranges, and how to pick the right pull target, than it is about being able to split one or two mobs out of a crowded group(unless you're doing Takish).  I've seen a shaman pull hard ldon's without much trouble.<br />
<br />
But we're obviously in different stages of the game... and my eyes are on the high-end content.  Once your monks and bards get more aa's, and your bards get better at pulling, things will shift.  SKs can still pull, since almost nothing at all changes for us pulling-wise from 30-65, but monks and bards both have the potential to get substantially better as their aa's go up.</div></div><hr />

So, what you are saying is that because of a series of mistakes you made, there is a problem?<br />
<br />
Also. why is it that several warriors I have spoken with have been talking about this thing with Incite that lets them chain cast it if they want to.  I haven't see very much on it here, but I have no reason to doubt them.<br />
<br />
Now, sit back and think about add tanking on a raid when you get more than 1 mob per tank. What's a warrior going to do?  <br />
<br />
Either you don't have enough tanks for your raid (recruit more) or your pullers are just trying to train you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">So, what you are saying is that because of a series of mistakes you made, there is a problem?<br />
<br />
Actually, it doesn't sound like he made a series of mistakes.  If you read it carefully it sounds like someone pulled a four pull, doesn't mean it was him.  He used AET early on, because of a mistake someone else made, which is exactly what AET is for, to help deal with other people's mistakes.  And then the Cleric got aggro from healing him, not a mistake on his part nor probably the Cleric's, but something that comes about as part of the game.  So before you get your panties in a bundle and start running the guy down, maybe a little reading comprehension is in order.<br />
<br />
As far as chain casting Incite, given that it's on a timer, I have no idea how that is possible.  It's not like having three stun icons on a spell bar where you can fire them off one after another as fast as the icons refresh.  I suppose you could combine provoke and incite, although I don't know if they stack.  All the same, the fact is, stuns or snares are much more controlled aggro and much more reliable aggro.  That's pretty much irrefutable.<br />
<br />
Either you don't have enough tanks for your raid (recruit more) or your pullers are just trying to train you.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm no expert on the high end game.  But I know that in BoT there are areas where respawn happens so fast all you have to do is stand still to be effectively trained.  I can't but imagine there are other places in the game where that is also the case.  Knights have the ability to rapidly gain aggro early in a fight, pure and simple.  And they can do it at range, pure and simple.  Warriors on the other hand are pretty much required to run around from target to target when attempting to get aggro and it's not anywhere near as solid early in the fight.  And anyone who has ever been in a crowded raid can understand how difficult getting in melee range of a particular target can sometimes be.  So rather than being belittling, how about understanding his point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">This whole issue of usefulness in a raid seems rather silly to me.  Does an SK or Paladin really think they bring less to the table than the 5th warrior down the tank rotation on a raid mob that will likely be single tanked?  I can't speak for other guilds - but at 10900hp and 2150AC I often go an entire night of raiding without ever being put in the rotation because we have 9-12 warriors at the raid.   On these nights who is more important to the raid, a warrior sitting in the wings doing what dps they can muster, a Paladin with very nice heals and LoH doing DPS as well, or the SK providing aggro buffs often pulling the target to camp and sometimes snatching a narrow victory from defeat with HT while doing their share of DPS.<br />
<br />
I realize SK and Paladin have very different rolls and thus any balancing would need to be done independantly, however if either class is judging balance based on the one or 2 warriors who happen to MT a given mob then then they need to take a big step back and look at all the other warriors who are also there and what they bring to that same raid... only weapons.</div></div><hr />

What we'd like is to tank a bit better than chain and leather classes than we do (re-mitigation)... so a bit closer to warriors :/<br />

And, because the bulk of our spell book is dps spells (just like the bulk of a necromancer's spell book), we feel that we should out dps warriors by some margin. This of course upsets rangers but I think this could be made more palatable by making our dps more situational  than theirs, ie dependent on having pet up and mobs living long enough for dots to do reasonable damage on them... just like a necro.

<br />
The difference between SKs and Warriors in mitigation isn't that large.  And it has never been shown that chain classes tank as well as the Knights.  But if we accept that they do, just for a moment, then increasing Knight mitigation should also require an increase in Warrior mitigation, or Knights end up tanking just like a Warrior.  And therein lies the problem.  If you set SKs up to tank just like a Warrior, then they're a Warrior with lots of other crap they claim they don't use, but they do.</div></div><hr />

Would you like it if I blew off the impact of defensive in the balance picture between SKs and Warriors?  How about if I blew off the impact of greater non-mana DPS?  How about if I completely disregarded the impact of more HP has?  Oh, you would say, those things are relevant, you can't focus in on only one aspect of the Warrior class in an attempt to leverage that into enhancements for your class.  But that's exactly what you expect to be able to do.  You want to disregard the impact of X, Y, and Z, and focus in on only one or two aspects of your class in order to justify enhancements.  But it doesn't work that way.  A class is a complete package.  Focusing in on only those areas you think you're weak and insisting on only comparing those against another class' strengths is intellectually dishonest.  It would be like my focusing in solely on the fact that Wizards do more damage than Warriors as a justification for increasing Warrior DPS, while completely disregarding the differences such as AC, HP, mitigation, and so on that are in the Warrior's favor.</div></div><hr />

It's intellectually dishonest to take every argument into a conveniently grey/unclassfiable area (utility) and say this justifies every imbalance in the stuff that can be argued over sensibly.<br />

Please tell me how a SK amazing utility justifies them spending more than half their spell gems on dps spells (which, I have to say again, form the bulk of their spell book)... having to control a pet and cast nukes and dots... to be, at the end of it all, doing less dps than a warrior who is just meleeing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Alright, I just want to try to clear some things up, a few things seem to be misinterpreted, whatever, I'm not gonna say anything about that, I'm just going to say what I believe most SKs have a problem with at the moment. Keep in mind I play a Shadow Knight, and know less about Paladins than a lot of you probably do, so this will be based a lot on what I know/have heard about SKs. Here goes:<br />
<br />
First off, no Knight wants to be a main tank on Uber_Raid_Mob_01. Some have said they want to, true, and we at SK.org usually call them stupid shits and make them cry. What we do find retarded is the fact that, if something happens and all the warriors are killed, the next in line tanks are the rangers/rogues/monks, who should NOT, in ANY case, be chosen as tanks over knights. I think you can agree to that.<br />
<br />
Second, the whole argument about defensive is mostly centered on the one-group GoD trials. With six people, you have your tank (Warrior), Cleric, slower, usually a second healer, and then 2 spots (3 if your slower/2nd healer is a shammy) for DPS. Now, when you have 2-3 spots for DPS in a group that is completely based around effeciency, why in god's name would you take a shadowknight? Our DPS is minimal compared to basically half the classes in the game, or more. A pally can be a decent second healer/DPS/stunner, though not as well as a cleric would heal, or another class could DPS. Hence, knights would like to be able to fill the tank role on these trials. No one wants to be as good a tank as a warrior, that's been repeated a million times over; what we want instead, is SOMETHING, so that after we tank the whole trial (which was possible before and after the nerf) we can tank the named/boss also, and not have to make sure we have a ranger there to tank it for us, because the ranger is alive for 18 seconds due to WS, whereas (before the nerf anyway, I can't say now as I'm nowhere near that point in the game) a knight tanking had a chance of instant death any time during that encounter, and usually fairly early in that encounter.<br />
<br />
As for a role in raiding, offtanking is our role (or should be, by most knight's thinking, from what I've heard anyway), and a shorter duration, watered down defensive (or any other sort of mitigation) would make our job that much easier for us, and maybe actually set us out as THE offtanks, not the &quot;if all the warriors are tied up, you can MAYBE go get that mob&quot; tank. Every other class in the game has some sort of role in a raid; Warriors tank, Clerics heal, Shaman slow, a lot of classes DPS; Knights can do none of that. Pallies can heal to an extent, SKs get 2 group spells and weak DPS. (DPS which is surpassed by warriors high-end; yes we have spells, but remember, our nukes have no resist modifier, our DoTs are not nearly as effective as a Necro's/Druid's/Shaman's so you don't want to waste a mob's buff slot on a crap DoT, our lifetaps can't even keep us healed of AE damage on a lot of mobs, our pet is green and basically fodder to throw at a raid mob, and when we DO cast, that means we're not meleeing, which means even lower DPS) Even if (just hypothetically) they gave us full-blown defensive, we still wouldn't be the main tanks on raids, because of 1) innate mitigation, 2)Auto-riposte disc which lets you build a lot of agro very fast while taking minimal to no damage while the mob is slowed, and 3) AE taunt, because you get to choose when you get agro, a knight trying to pull a mob off a warrior that has been meleeing for a while (with an agro weapon set) just doesn't happen, until the knight scores a successful taunt. And yes, this has been tried; there are accounts of SKs chain snaring/fearing (our two best agro spells) for over a minute, and still not even having the mob look their way.<br />
<br />
Basically, knights just want to be closer to warrior tanking and have some kind of decent gap between us and the chain classes so that we are actual tanks again. Clearing out a trial only to be set aside so that a chain class can tank the boss of the trial is retarded, and I'm sure that you can agree to that. I have just tried to outline where knights are coming from (from the arguments that I have seen), so that maybe all this &quot;knights are stupid assholes&quot; &quot;warriors are stupid assholes&quot; shit can stop, and something can actually be done. Thank you for taking the time to read this.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh yes, and just for the record, almost every knight I saw was against the gimping of the trials, and the devs knew about this, they went ahead and did it anyway; we want to be actual working tanks, not tanks that can only tank when content is made lesser.</div></div><hr />

Now I'm confused. Are you saying that for us to be better than warriors at DPS, the only way possible is to be a monk? What kind of crap is that? We don't tank as well as you, we can't keep sustained agro as well as you (we have a slight edge in quick agro, after 20 seconds warriors are far ahead), we don't even have a whole lot of burst DPS on you anymore, now you're saying that we shouldn't have anything over you? What kind of balance is that? Please, please tell me.</div></div><hr />

Then again, why can't SOE do a little bit of thinking, a little bit of work, and maybe try to tweak a lot of classes' damage? Would increasing monk(and other DPS classes') DPS by a bit, dropping warrior  DPS (dammit, i hate crying &quot;nerf&quot;, but there really isn't any other way to do it, that i can think of) a little bit, and sticking SKs in the middle there be so bad? The way I see it, warriors are supposed to be the incredible tanks (as they are), paladins are supposed to be the defensive tanks that can tank nearly as well as a warrior, heal, buff, stun, etc, and SKs are supposed to be the offensive tanks who can tank nearly as well as a warrior (note: I'm NOT saying knights should tank as well as warriors, they shouldn't, but they should also be viable tanks) and do a little more DPS thanks to our spellbook being dedicated to DoTs/Pet/Nukes/bit o' utility. Why is this so absolutely horrid?<br />

<br />
While GoD mobs were badly designed, SoE needed to follow up after the impact of the Phase 1 Melee Update was known and look at Knights as well.<br />
<br />
Knights do have some legitimate complaints, but these got ignored when the &quot;Tank Parity&quot; posters campaigned, 'Warriors got acceptable aggro control, so now you must give us Defensive (or at least a healthy piece of it) or remove it from the game.'<br />
<br />
SK debuffs should debilitate mobs more, especially steal Attack and AC. Yes, they compete with Shaman and Necros in this area, but it IS a capability that is supposed to compliment their base level tanking.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps should be more than 1/2 of a proper heal + 1/2 of a proper nuke - IMO even 3/4 of a proper heal and 1/3 of a proper nuke would be more acceptable. Spears and HT are used to do spell damage to mobs, not lifetaps. Lifetaps are self-heal only so there is really no reason not to make one that can do a reasonable job.<br />
<br />
SK's should have a pet that is worth summoning on raids.<br />
<br />
Paladins should have fast cast heals that exceed the max hit of mobs encountered in raids. IMO they should have AE heals, BoV, /shield, and an improved Yaulp.<br />
<br />
Knights give up some tanking ability and DPS as a &quot;cost&quot; of having a spellbook. It is spells and mana that should restore as much of these capabilities as SoE allows. AND the versatility and utility of their spells MUST help provide them excellence at performing their raid role. I happen to believe that role is not the ability to survive the most brutal battles as well as a Warrior.<br />

Yes... FD (thought not nearly as good as a monks) and summon corpse are *real* utility. If it's your opinion that these are worth us being less tanking ability + less dps than a warrior please say so.<br />
<br />
My own opinion is that our lesser melee + our spell book (which is from a DPS caster class, the necromancer) should be &gt; a warriors dps. And imho this does not upset things with rangers/monks too much as our doing this level of dps would be much more situational than theirs (i.e. we can't just jump in and do it, we need to muster our pet and the right spells, which are often DoTs and so even more situational). But then I also think monks should be doing mroe dps than they are and that gap can widen to find more space for rangers and behind them sks.</div></div><hr />

Oh, you would say, those things are relevant, you can't focus in on only one aspect of the Warrior class in an attempt to leverage that into enhancements for your class.  <br />
<br />
No, you can't focus on only 1 or 2 aspects of the Warrior class when comparing tanking ability, kind of like you do here:<br />
<br />
You really think a 5% mitigation bonus and 500 HP really make enough difference that Warriors are &quot;preferred&quot; in most situations? Balls. I don't believe it.<br />
<br />
You do a great disservice to the tanking debate when you trivialize the tanking difference between Knights and Warriors as 5% and 500 hp. You know it, I know it, the devs know it. Attempting to minimize the differences like this is counter-productive. Warriors have:<br />
<br />
5% innate mitigation (DI-1)<br />
500 bonus HP<br />
Higher Dodge/Parry/Riposte caps<br />
More HP per stamina point<br />
More HP on Warrior only gear<br />
More AC on Warrior only gear<br />
<br />
Toss in the following:<br />
<br />
AE Taunt for guaranteed aggro transfer<br />
Higher Taunt skill cap (ok this is weak)<br />
Furious for initial survivability and aggro boost<br />
Defensive/Evasive for HUGE long term damage reducer<br />
<br />
<br />
And you're telling me you don't know why Warriors are &quot;preferred&quot; in most situations? Balls. I don't believe it.<br />
<br />
<br />
See, I don't follow this. Add tanking is just that, add tanking. Whoever can do a decent job should be doing it. So what if the Warrior can do it a &quot;bit&quot; better? You are either able to add tank or you aren't. Knights are able to add tank. Using a Warrior, unless they pop defensive, just isn't going to be that much of a difference. And if you'd like to claim it is, please explain why anyone would care if it's a Warrior add tanking or a Knight add tanking if both are doing fine at it. It just isn't, nor will it ever be, your exclusive territory.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what if the Warrior can do it a &quot;bit&quot; better?!?!? LOL Add tanking was the raid niche we owned. By your own admission, Warriors now do it better. So what you are saying, is that if every Knight on a raid was replaced by Warriors, the raid would grow in power. The only problem would be the Knight only loot that would rot, and the trouble botting a Paladin to MGB Brells. A Knight add-tanking in Uqua is a liability to the guild when Joe Warrior can do it &quot;better&quot;.<br />
<br />
A Knight needs the tools to be the second best tank in the game. We currently lack them. If some Warriors' pre-eminence is blinding them to this, I don't know how I can present the facts to convince them otherwise. Thanks for your time.<br />

Naubi states:<br />

In your opinion apparently, since Paladins get priest spells unrelated to tanking and SK's get tanking related spells obviously Paladins should be a bit behind SK's as a tank. #3 perhaps?<br />
<br />
But Chania apparently disagrees in part:<br />
A Knight needs the tools to be the second best tank in the game.<br />
Since healing/buffs aren't necessarily directily related to dps and tanking, Chania seems to think they should be free. It does not matter how big the gap is between Warriors and Knights for Knights to be the second best tank in the game. You focus almost exclusively on Warrior &quot;advantages&quot; and NOT the distance between Knights and non-plate tanks. You say one thing, &quot;second best tank&quot;, yet argue another - Warrior/Knight tanking gap. <br />
<br />
I'm convinced Knights ARE the second best tank because I've SEEN them outtank Rangers and Monks in PoTime. It is not common at all for guilds to have non-plate tanks do Inny, CT, Sayrn's adds, RZ's adds, or Phase 2 yard trash. <br />
<br />
Naubi, you are right - SK's should when using HT, debuffs, their weapon buffs, a top of the line PoTime DPS weapon with a DPS aug, Spears, and pets outdamage a Warrior focused almost entirely on tanking and maximum aggro. I understand that without any of these things parses indicate SK's do a bit less DPS than a Warrior. I'm shocked that with ALL of them SK's don't outdamage a Warrior for a single mob. I thought your burst DPS was pretty good - my bad.<br />

You're really going to have to substantiate this perception of yours that SKs are doing just barely equal DPS to a Warrior when maximizing the potential in the SK spell book.  I see you saying it.

<br />
And if you aren't, then the problem is not that you don't tank well enough, it's that there's a problem with your DPS, which should be the area targetted for enhancement, if it can be shown that SKs are falling behind the DPS curve.  If that's your claim, it's up to you to prove it, no one will just take it on your say so.<br />

Knights are repeatedly told that they can't tank anywhere near Warriors because they can heal, because they have HT, DoTs and a pet for &quot;added dps&quot; (lol), because we have UTILITY.

Oh, and Battleblade, the difference in tanking between Warriors and Knights right now is greater than the difference between Knights and Rangers.

First, if the utility is lacking there are a ton of options other than decreasing the tank difference between knights and warriors.  The most obvious alternative approaches are to increase the usefulness of knight utility, or adjust the content to make the utility offered by knights more useful.<br />
<br />
Second, yes there are 3 tanking classes.  However, only 1 is solely a tanking class and therefore it should be the clearly superior tanking class for single mob tanking (as it is now.)  The other 2 classes are hybrid classes and should not be equal to the one-dimensional tanking class when it comes to straight up tanking the big mobs.<br />

There are parses about how warriors out-damage knights on SKO, I'll see if I can dig them up.  <br />
<br />
And knights have all this wonderful utility(lev, invis, FD) we save raids all the time with out uber self only buffs that almost every other class has.  Monks can FD better than us, and can't get it interupted by spells, so they are used to pull over us.  Bards are sweet pullers, so we're out of the puller industry.  Our DPS sucks, so that's not an option.  We don't have mez, or root(pallies do, speaking for SKs), so we're out of CC.  We can't tank big mobs(no defensive/damage reduction spell/damage avoidance disc/ability), so that's out.  Our only role left on raids is offtank, which we were doing nicely with in PoP, now I heard of a guild using an Enchanter to tank an EP god(rumor may or may not be true), so being in a god guild means that you have probably trivialized PoTime.  Now warriors can offtank better than us, yes we can still do it, but it's like pulling, why have a SK pull when you can have a monk or bard pull.  <br />
<br />
On another note, I always thought that warriors traded a lot of DPS to have better tanking abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, give SKs beastlord level utility and you can balance the equation... but not with the kind of utility we actually do have.<br />
<br />
But to be honest this analogy doesn't really hold... becuase monks are a greater dps class than shamans whereas necros by far outdps warriors. To reiterate... Shaman are utility, necros are dps and this is why I feel that sk should be outdamaging warriors at all levels of the game by a real and significant margin (when they can deploy their pet and spells of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">There's no reason why SK's shouldn't do Necro-like DPS provided they tank like a Necro.

Sorry, you are primarily a melee, so you get lesser casting abilities.<br />

But don't pretend that even lesser abilities aren't powerful when combined with the ability to tank. I've had the pleasure of solo fear kiting as a Warrior and duoing with my son who plays an SK. Power doesn't even begin to describe your class.<br />

Being able to ride Fear, a pet, Darkness, DoTs, RZ/CT armor and a Windblade through your 50's in what? a week from 50-60? And then out aggro Warriors five levels above you for two expansions might have made you forget -<br />
<br />
You're a hybrid. Yes Paladins s/b the #2 MT and Sk's the #3 (or do I have it backwards??) but that does not mean they need to be within shouting distance of #1 outside of normal experiance groups.<br />

Your class being able to MT all of PoTime isn't close enough for ya? [Edit: those with much much more than 7k HPs unbuffed, of course. With low HPs, I'm sure BoT named are a challange much less real tanking. When you hit the 8k HP's (and shielding and the AC) easily obtainable pre-GoD things will be easier.

Now here is the Problem the spells are being resisted so you have to fall back On the warrior part more since it Is lesser, the easist and most effecent way to fix this would Be give those classes spells that reflect the upped resists of mobs due to there pure class couterparts Haveing better versions<br />
<br />
Or You can use this senerio<br />
<br />
Mob dose Massive DPS via melee = warrior best to MT<br />
<br />
Mob dose Massive DPS via Proc = Pal/SK best to MT it .<br />
<br />
In those Above examples it would focus On the Knight classes being better defended Agaisnt magic since they work with it And  know its subilties better then warriors would, I think the SK should be a bit farther Above the Pal  in Actual DPS becuse the roles would fit  In the knight class its SK as the DPS, and Pal as the more defensive. <br />
<br />
But what do I know I am a simple poor fool never Had the desire to go Uber as You can see from my magelo  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh And only Monks, Warriors, Rouges and Beserkers should really be in compatation for melee damage, Knights should be higher then what they are tho  I do Agree with that</div></div><hr />

If the utility aspect of our class is lacking, then how can it be used as justification that we shouldn't tank within a city block of Warriors? It always comes back to tanking, Glatius, because that is (was?) our role in EQ from the beginning. We aren't dps, we aren't CC, we aren't healing, we're firstly a tanking class, no matter how much the Warriors want to downplay it. Is there 3 tanking classes or 1, Glatius?<br />
<br />
What's so hard to understand?<br />
<br />
Oh don't pull this crap.  NO ONE is saying Knights shouldn't be able to tank.  And you can't validly claim that currently Knights can't tank.  But you and people like you seem to feel that you should tank exactly like a Warrior in all ways and still retain all the value of your spellbook.  That's not reasonable.

By your reasoning, Warriors should do the least DPS of any class in EQ because they tank the best. Is that what you are proposing, Battleblade?<br />
<br />

I've had the pleasure of solo fear kiting as a Warrior and duoing with my son who plays an SK. Power doesn't even begin to describe your class.<br />

Lol I'm glad you enjoyed your time in the mid-50's when Fear actually landed. You know that no SK has feared any XP mob in 2 years, right? I think this is the root cause of most Warrior/Knight debates, the complete and utter lack of understanding of each other's abilities.</div></div><hr />

5% innate mitigation (DI-1)<br />
500 bonus HP<br />

More HP per stamina point<br />
More HP on Warrior only gear<br />
More AC on Warrior only gear<br />

<br />
AE Taunt for guaranteed aggro transfer<br />
Higher Taunt skill cap (ok this is weak)<br />
Furious for initial survivability and aggro boost<br />
Defensive/Evasive for HUGE long term damage reducer<br />

Don't try and pretend that it is.<br />
<br />
And what exactly is &quot;the value of your spellbook&quot;?<br />
<br />
Dps?  Warriors do very similar dps to SKs, we go no extra dps out of our spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Utility?  Most of our utility is just situational fluff that doesn't come into play during normal combat.  Fear doesn't even work on exp mobs.  FD is nice but by itself not enough to make up for a signficant loss of dps or defense.<br />
<br />
Aggro?  Incite and agro procs took away most of our advantage there.<br />
<br />
Maybe SKs should be able to tank just as well as a warrior not *in addition to* having a spellbook but *because* they have a spellbook.  Imagine, agro spells that can accomplish the same as incite.  Dps spells that make up for warrior discs and offensive skills.  And, get ready for this, self buffs and lifetaps that allows us to take just as much damage as a warrior, including a spell to mitigate burst damage like warrior defensive!<br />
<br />
Wizards and rogues both deal out dps, one with magic and one with physical attacks, yet they seem to co-exist.  But when the idea of a magic based tank and a physical based tank comes up, hell no, the warriors will have none of it.<br />
<br />
Oh, that's right, we can self-invis without a clicky item.  Bring on the flames.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Knights lack those abilities, sure.<br />
<br />
Warriors lack the ability to cast lifetaps, dots, pets, fd, snares...do i need to continue? <br />
<br />
It's called compromise. Knight have some...issues (mostly in high end raid situations), but it's pointless to sit there and list our abilities while completely forgetting about what they are...a hybrid. In the exp group game, a knight is still very versatile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I'll say it again, Knights need the tools to be the second best tank in the game. <br />
<br />
Errr... they ARE the 2nd best tank in the game.  So your point is....<br />
<br />
Moving on, I'm not going to quote a later message from another knight, but I see yet another SK claiming their spellbook is worthless.  Yawwwwwn.  That's such crap it's not worth responding to.  I've had SKs and paladins both tell me their spellbook is far from useless.  More telling is that when I'm grouped with knights, both classes seem to use those spells an awful lot for something that's worthless.  :p<br />
<br />
It's funny that a hybrid complains that warriors tank better, monks pull better, etc.  Isn't that the expected penalty for playing a hybrid?  You can competently do a wider variety of things than most classes can do, but you won't be as good as another class in each of those things.  Hence... utility.  I'm sorry that hurts on finding good roles for some of your raids, but that's the way it is.  It certainly comes in handy many times.<br />
<br />
Hybrid classes are supposed to be more powerful than the class they are derived from. This is balanced in AD&amp;D by a larger XP burden. Me thinks that you should research what you say before spouting it off with such authority.<br />
<br />
Me thinks this has little to do with EQ.  Making one class more powerful than another is better suited to a game where hardly anyone gets &quot;maxed out&quot; on their levels.  Then your hybrid is typically lower level than your base class, so when they adventure they're about equal in power.  Many EQ players max out or close to it, moreso before AAs were created. <br />
<br />
At any rate, there's no hybrid exp penalty in 3rd edition AD&amp;D and classes are intended to be balanced whether they are a paladin, a fighter, or whatever.  :p <br />
<br />
The recent whining about warriors being too good at dps is just grasping at straws.  &quot;Hey, our other bitching about warriors being too powerful isn't working, so let's target THIS!&quot;  <br />
Warriors are great defense, moderate offense, and no utility.  So?<br />
<br />
By the way, a long parse of similarly Time geared players showed the warriors around 115-120 dps, the paladins in the 90s, and the SKs at around 85-95.  Now how much does the SK add to that with DoTs and their pet?  The pet would be easy to parse.  The DoTs would be much harder to measure, of course.  I'm also not sure how gear will compare at a lower end of the game.  Warriors get a large dps boost if they're lucky enough to kill Rallos Zek and get the sword.  Before that, they're probably even closer to comparably geared knight dps.  But I don't know.  Maybe knights get a large and sudden dps increase somewhere on the way to Time as well.</div></div><hr />

My bad. I thought Invoke Fear landed quite handily on exp mobs in Maidens Eye at level 65 as it did for several months when I Fear Kited there. I will test it again, since you assure me it hasn't worked on an experiance mob in two years. Lucy doesn't show a level limit, but I supose Lucy is wrong too.<br />

<br />
Snare is situational?  Or will you claim that because so many other classes have snare that you never gain any benefit from it?  And how many times have you survived a situation using FD where a Warrior would have been dead?  No benefit there?  Loss of DPS?  Again, prove it.  Loss of defense?  Are you claiming you should be completely equal in defense to a Warrior?  If not, why is the current margin too large, and what exactly is the current margin and why is it too large?  You keep throwing around generalities and assumptions as though they're proven facts.  They aren't.  They're merely your opinion.  Why should I substitute your opinion for my own opinion when you have nothing of substance to back up your opinion?<br />
<br />
Aggro? Incite and agro procs took away most of our advantage there.<br />
<br />
Dead wrong.  In the first 10 seconds of a fight, unless the Warrior is very lucky with procs, SKs still have a much stronger lock on aggro control than a Warrior.  And in battles that last about a minute or two, that first 10 seconds is important.  What you're pissed about is not that you lost an advantage, because you still have one, but that you lost an overwhelming hands down advantage.  Well boo effing woo.<br />
<br />

<br />
As far as common group situations, you've provided absolutely nothing to show that they don't.  You have provided absolutely nothing that shows that SKs don't have aggro spells that can accomplish the same as incite, in fact the I find the claim that you don't to be rather ludicrous.  I've played with incite, I know its limitations, have you?  Do you realize that it's not &quot;aggro lock&quot; at all?   I doubt it.<br />
<br />
And as far as defensive is concerned, forget it.  You won't get most Warriors to sign off on their raid death certificate just so SKs can feel like they get to be raid MTs too.  Why guild Warriors if SKs can tank raid mobs just like a Warrior using their spells and snare, FD pull, buff their groups, and so forth?  What does the Warrior bring to the party once an SK can regularly and successfully step into his boots against the boss mobs?  Answer is, not a hell of a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">To sum things up:<br />
<br />
SK's argue that all their &quot;extra ultility&quot; (ie spell book) doesn't mean $hit if they can't tank (and/or DPS) like (or nearly like) a warrior!<br />
<br />
Warriors argue that since we have NO inherent utility (ie no snare, stun, root etc.)and can only do one thing well (get beat on) we d@mn well better be the best at it!<br />
<br />
Hard to reconcile those two views as both are firmly grounded in the respective players EQ worldview. Both have elements of truth which make them compeling and both have elements of bias which make them debateable.<br />

P.S. Best quote from the SK board = &quot;Warriors and clerics should be deleted!&quot; <br />

Warriors do better DPS now, I'm still trying to find the parses, I know they exist though. <br />
<br />
Our spells that we cry are useless are useless on raids.  Our spears get resisted too much to actually be usefull.  We aren't going to cast our DoTs because they take mob buff slots, and why waste a slot on a crappy dot, when you can have a shammy or necro cast a dot that will do probably twice the damage (not sure on that, haven't looked at high end necro/shammy dots).  <br />
<br />
Our pet, ha don't get me started on our pet.  1 good AE, and our pet is gone, in the dust.  if we take the time to resummon him, that's one spell gem down, and that many seconds not doing anything usefull.  Our attack/ac/resist/whatever taps take up a regular buff slot, I am not even in VT yet, and on an AE/charm/dotting  mob, I don't want to cast them because they take up the extra buff slots.  <br />
<br />
Glatius, snare is incredibly situational.  Our snare in particular gets resisted a lot in PoV (about 2/5, guessing to only increase in higher zones), and also gets a DoT component, which means that if we snare a mob for aggro, IF we get to offtank, the chanter is gonna kill us because it will keep breaking mez.  <br />
<br />
In pre-god single group content IMO SK's are fine.  In GoD however, I am told that the Ikkniz trials still require a warrior to do them, NO ONE asked for GoD to be nerfed, knights were pissed off, just as much if not more than warriors were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, but that's not what you say.  You say things like, &quot;Chain classes tank almost the same as Knights,&quot; with the implied assumption that Knight mitigation should be increased while Warrior mitigation would be the same, and you don't even have anything to offer to prove it.  And you say things like, &quot;Warriors mitigate too much better than a Knight,&quot; when you won't even bother to qualify how much better the Warrior mitigates and why you feel it's too much better.<br />
<br />
Here is the thing, if Warriors mitigated .01% better than a Knight, then the Warrior would still mitigate better.  But that advantage would be completely meaningless.  No one would care.  It would be a difference that was effectively no difference.  For a difference to have meaning it needs to be substantial enough to be noticeable.<br />
<br />
Right now as it stands, why recruit knights when warriors can do things better.<br />
<br />
Things like what exactly?  FD better?  Dot better?  Snare better?  Buff people's mana better?  DPS better? Still unproven.  Oh, you mean TANK better?  But I thought that SKs didn't want to tank as well as Warriors?<br />

Fine, you have issues with your spells lacking usefulness on a raid.  What exactly do you expect Warriors to do about that?  Offer up defensive as compensation?  Go talk to the devs about your spells.<br />

Here's a thought, don't snare the mezzed mobs.  Keep casting snare until it sticks.  And know that having snare on demand is a hell of a lot more useful in a hell of a lot more situations then you admit. <br />

Oh no, don't even argue this.  I was involved in the talks with the Knights, they were absolutely livid that they weren't being given defensive.

<br />
If not, why is the current margin too large, and what exactly is the current margin and why is it too large?<br />
In normal, non-disc, non-burst dmg situations, the existing margin isn't bad.  However, a warrior can use defensive and/or evasive every ten minutes to deal with overpulls or high level pulls.  A SK can deal with similar burst damage by, uh, oh yeah, he can't.  This doesn't just apply to raids but to a lot of single group content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

SKs are not anyones first choice as a snarer (ranger/druid) or FD puller (monk).  SK group buffs are laughable at best.  The fact is that warriors, monks, rogues, rangers, and several other classes have discs to deal with burst damage, whether it be defensive, WS, riposte/parry discs, or whatever.  I'm not saying that SKs should get warrior defensive but some way to mitigate burst damage is certainly needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Outside of a raid?  Not very often.  Typically if I'm firing off evasive or defensive outside of a raid things have gone really bad.  And usually that's because the healer had bought the farm, so at best I'm staving off the inevitable.  Seriously, evasive and defensive aren't all that useful outside of a raid.  Once in a while they come in handy.  Certainly not every day unless you're in a group that really doesn't know their head from their elbow.<br />

Yeah, so this is our &quot;thing&quot;.  We can't FD, we can't LoH, we can't lifetap, we can't harm touch, we can't group heal, we can't buff, we can't do a hell of a lot of things, we get to use evasive and defensive.  And for overpulls, unless the Warrior is able to fire off AET when needed or can build aggro on each and every mob, the first time the healer casts a heal the healer is probably toast.  Besides, you're not considering the DPS reduction involved with both disciplines, which means the mobs are dying slower.  And defensive is really most useful against mobs with very high DI.<br />
<br />
Kind of like the overwhelming, hands down advantage warriors have for dealing with burst damage?<br />

No, I'm not.  SKs claim that things like FD are useless, worthless, and don't compensate them in the least for the differences between them and Warriors.  I claim otherwise.  They aren't useless or worthless, and they do compensate for the differences.  Now, even if FD isn't used all the time, every day, it is used, it does add benefit and it does have value.  So discounting it isn't possible.</div></div><hr />

Lol I'm glad you enjoyed your time in the mid-50's when Fear actually landed. You know that no SK has feared any XP mob in 2 years, right? <br />
I pretended this was a misunderstanding:<br />
My bad. I thought Invoke Fear landed quite handily on exp mobs in Maidens Eye at level 65 <br />
Chania pretends that the mispresentation wasn't made:<br />
Lol well there's your problem right there. I was in Maiden's Eye 2 years ago.<br />
Heh, when Warriors couldn't get groups some of us got experaince any way posible. Fear reduces downtime significantly when soloing for exp.<br />
And cleverly puts me in my place:<br />
Maybe we're not at the same level of progression.<br />
Lol, so it does contrary to your representation still work on experiance mobs. THAT is the problem right there. Some Knights are incapable of stating the way things are. They have a strange compulsion to state that their spells don't work.<br />
<br />
But you might be right about progression. I don't know where your guild is. I do know as individual characters, your 7k HP's unbuffed isn't in the same town much less neighborhood.<br />
<br />
That's the second problem. Some Knights think that because they've reached level 65 they are Tanks.<br />
<br />
Oh, SoE can gimp the content. But don't even imagine a 9k HP buffed &quot;tank&quot; ought to compete against Tanks with 11-12K HPs in difficult cutting edge content. SoE is NOT going to provide a magic pill that powerful ever - no matter how much Knights underplay their spellbook.<br />
<br />
When you finally reach the 10.5K HP's buffed possible by completing and farming previous content, your ability to do GoD advanced content and the fact Fear doesn't work on raid quality mobs shouldn't bother you. They won't be issues.<br />

I'll leave you with a final thought, and if it makes you consider the issue differently at all, I will have done my job here.<br />
<br />
Knights used to off-tank in raids. Why did they off-tank and not another class? They certainly weren't the beefiest tanks available. Well, they off-tanked because they had a way of getting reliable aggro very quickly. Warriors lacked this ability, they had no way to get aggro early in the fight other than AE taunt with its long recast time, hope for an early proc from an Anger aug or weapon, or rely on the notoriously poor Taunt skill. This is why the inferior tanking Knights were the offtanks of choice.<br />
<br />
Best raid MT: Warriors<br />
Best raid off-tank: Knights<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today. By giving Warriors Incite/Bellow (A move applauded by most Knights), the devs inadvertantly took the offtank role away from Knights and gave it to Warriors. Some may argue that early Knight aggro generation is still superior to Warriors. The fact is that you don't need the best aggro to offtank, you need sufficient aggro. Warriors have that, and due to the harder hitting nature of end game trash mobs today, Knights offtanking is now a liability when Warriors are available. The result:<br />
<br />
Best raid MT: Warrior<br />
Best raid off-tank: Warrior<br />
<br />
How do you return the off-tank role to Knights? Nerf Warrior Incite/Bellow line? No sane Knight is asking for that. Increase Knight tanking so that they can share the off-tank role? That still leaves Warriors as the best choice unless the tanking gap becomes so small as to be meaningless, no sane Knight is asking for that either.<br />
<br />
So I ask the mighty devs, with their years of experience and knowledge... How will you return the off-tank role to Knights, or what other role would you give in exchange? All Knights are eagerly awaiting your answers.</div></div><hr />

Chania - thanks for this post.  I realize we don't agree on a lot of the issues involved, but it's good to have a discussion and at least hear both sides of the situation.  <br />
<br />
Along those lines...2 things for the knight community to consider:  (1) is early warrior agro really as good as you think it is? - I'm speaking specifically about the need for good/quick agro for off-tanking purposes, and (2) getting locked into a single focus when discussing any balance issue can often generate very strong resistance from other classes - looking at a combination of class abilities and content design can be a more effective approach.  <br />
<br />
(also, I realize lots of knights understand these points - and it's a shame that the vocal few keep antagonizing us warriors - similar to the way a few vocal warriors antogonized knights earlier this year by insisting the only way to fix warriors was to give us initial agro lock equal to what knights could do)</div></div><hr />

But can we agree that their role is much diminished? Instead of off-tanks, we are now situational non-damage mez bitches?

No problem. We can't balance a class in a vacuum. What we need is a discussion of facts, not exaggerated hyperbole that is presently coming from both sides. The 3 tank classes are intimately linked, all of us have been on top at one time or another, and we have all been on the bottom too.

Prior to incite Knights completely and totally dominated off tanking because they could lay down controlled aggro like right now.  The very thing that made them the preferred tank for groups in PoP and LDoN made them hands down without a doubt the preferred off tank.  Fast forward to today and Warriors have been fixed, so of course they're better able to off tank than before.  The exact same fix that makes them an acceptable group tank also makes them an acceptable off tank.  There is no way you can make Knights the hands down preferred off tank without crippling Warriors as a group tank in the process.  And frankly, I don't think it's really reasonable to expect to be the hands down preferred off tank.  That seems like something that all three tank classes should share, which as far as I've heard is exactly what is happening today.  Knights can and do off tank just fine.  So do Warriors.  If Knights feel their raid role has been somewhat diminished, that's unfortunate, but realistically they shouldn't expect to be the &quot;only&quot; off tank.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just like they shouldn't expect to be the &quot;only&quot; group tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">GAH BA HUM BUG. I started this thread earlier today and i sware it was only 4 pages long  now it is 6 8(<br />
<br />
Well i have played a SK and a Warrior at the lower end and with my main (65 shammie) i have seen the upper end of things. <br />
So i have a few questions Sacrore.<br />
How fast have you seen a SK grab argo from a cleric that was getting beat down because he healed and the MT did not have absolute agro? I have seen one get agro in less than 2-3 hits on the cleric. This is a SK that is on top of things and is watching what is going on around him. <br />
Now how fast have you seen a warrior grab agro under the same situtation? After the Cleric blows involunerability(sp?) or is dead?<br />
Now the same for pallies.<br />
<br />
From personal experience i would rather have a SK take the part of agro management in a raid for all adds because of this ability. So there is one role you have in a raid if the people in the raid know the classes. The SK should be the lead on agro management and the off tank should then take it once it is gotten off the PC in need. Yea pallies can stun to gain agro but i have seen countless times the SK pull argo from everyone trying.<br />
<br />
In a lower end of things i have seen a SK pull a mob and then just stand there while the Warrior tries to pull it off the SK. Yea there was a level difference but it was SK 55 warrior 52.. But the Sk went to the point of darknessing the mob to pull then stand there and do nothing while the warrior tries to taunt it off. The mob droped about 40% of its health before the warrior gained argo. Yea this is a low end example but it still goes to show you as a SK have execelent argo control. <br />
<br />
So is argo control a viable roll in a raid? <br />
<br />
In my eyes and experience (which does not count for much in most peoples eyes) The warrior is ment to be there for the purpose of being the MT. Sk's are there for agro management of adds until a off tank gets them of and in most cases they are the off tanks. Pallies are there for their stuns to reduce the dps of the target. If you get a Pallie and an SK working on a mob togather.. SWEET  as a druid can keep them healed easily.<br />
<br />
just my thoughts...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If only this was the case.<br />
<br />
Basically it seems to come down to warriors must always have teh biggerest numbers Rawwrrrrr!<br />
<br />
Even when that doesn't make sense... <br />
i.e. with SK dps vs warrior dps (where it seems kind of perverse for warriors to be so strongly against the idea that just maybe SKs might be meant to out dps them by a real margin when they can use their pet+dots+nukes e.g. 90% of their spell book).<br />
<br />
To summarise the warrior position: Knight balance must not involve anything 'real' (because us warriors are the 'real deal' dontcha' know) like dps or tanking. This is easy for paladins cos' they heal so give them some healerer stuffs, um sks can get uh things... not sure what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">I have no problem with SK's out DPSing warriors. The only problem is that SK already tank so much like warrior (non-defensive) that a DPS adjustment would be overpowering.<br />
<br />
Same bit holds true to Pallys too. There needs to be a trade off somewhere, and IMO, 3 minutes of glorious defensive doesn't come anywhere near the all around usefulness of a spell book.If knights want to tank 80-95% like a warrior, then something has got to give.<br />
<br />
You don't see any other priest class come anywhere near as good at healing as a cleric, why should the tank position be any different. There should be an immediate and noticable different between warriors and knights in tanking ability. Unless your group is taking on trival content, you immediately notice if there is no cleric present. I believe the same should hold true for tanks too.<br />
<br />
A warrior's tanking advantage shouldn't just be noticable in raid/extreme content. Right now it isn't noticable then unless the warrior pops defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">This is how I kind of see it.<br />
<br />
If you excel everyone else at something as fundamental to the game as tanking then it doesn't have to be by so much that it's day and night compared to the other classes... it just needs to be enough to make a real difference and to command a premium. It's just like IRL (well maybe) where the CEO might earn 10x someone lower down the company... but is he really 10 times smarter etc... no, but that smaller difference commands a hefty premium.<br />
<br />
Warriors problem was that their aggro issues made their tanking excellence unable to shine (and command the right premium)... and probably (this is harder to see unless your someone that parses etc) the margin wasn't enough to be valuable.<br />
<br />
But the way things are now, warriors really do command that premium at the high end game. Sure, the GoD retuning let knight's tank better so that it wasn't &quot;day and night&quot; but a warrior is still your choice if one is available.... and the premium is higher than more difficult the content. This is what warriors wanted right? The chance to shine once the whole aggro thing didn't hold them back?<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is that something as sweeping as tanking better is worth more than being better dps... because there are so many dps classes. You can't use the simple arithmetic where so and so does x% more dps so they should take x% more damage... and even more so if that dps was situtational.<br />
<br />
This is why monks can feel they are hurting. They are distinctly mediocre compared to the real dps class (rogues) and their pulling is no longer commanding such a premium when other classes can pull so well. The stuff 'only a monk can pull' is pretty much non-existant now. And then they wonder why on earth shouldn't I at least be able to take a hit decently.<br />
<br />
And thinking about it... I reckon we give SOE too little credit for trying to balance and advance their game. When you really look at it, it's much harder than you imagine. They have to break the mold of 1 mob, on one tank, with healing and dps. Because you just cannot make a balanced game like that... especially when that one tank wants to be the &quot;cleric of tanking&quot;.<br />
What they are trying to do is round out the one dimensional classes. One step is giving warriors reliable aggro so they are not essentially crippled in one aspect to make up for being essential in another. Another is breaking the grip of CH so that hopefully you aren't just a box in a ch chain where it doesnt honestly matter how well you play or if youre in bazaar or time gear. When you say that you are wanting to be &quot;the cleric of tanking&quot; it could mean that you want to be the meatshield box where it wouldnt matter what gear you have past a certain point or how well you play... if somehow some aspect of a warrior = CH. <br />
<br />
This is why SKs were on the whole very much in favour of new toys for warriors (kicks that snared or whatever) to accompany their tanking premium... rather than having warrirors the crippled tanking gods. And we are worried now that you would rather have it both ways.<br />
<br />
And, ugh, why did they have to put so much one group content in GoD. Even two groups would have allowed for more development of the classes... not needing to pack so much healing into such few slots that you can't really do much about clerics. It's really making it harder for them to advance the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Hm well reading around... if monks really take less damage over time than knights 'already' then they don't honestly have much to complain about. This makes them better rampage tanks than knights for one thing (DA is a none issue with bestow AA).<br />
<br />
And on reflection... what's really annyoing about playing a SK is you think youre supposed to be one thing (puller,dps,tank, debuffer... or whatever is the flavour of the month) and then you're not. And atm it seems we aren't really anything.</div></div><hr />

And atm it seems we aren't really anything.<br />
<br />
Well roles from expansion to expansion do shift to one degree or another.  And it does seem that as SoE increases mob difficulty they also narrow the scope of what works effectively.  Paladin stuns work fine, until you reach a level where they don't land much any more.  Paladin heals work fine, until you reach a DPS level where the mobs hit so hard that it doesn't help much any more (which also argues that the Warrior HP advantage isn't all that meaningful anymore either.  If healing 900 HP isn't very helpful, then having an innate 900 HP advantage can't be particularly overwhelming either).  And I'm sure much the same applies for Shadow Knights, for example fear no longer works in most situations.<br />
<br />
What this means is that as the scope narrows there is a premium placed on being able to do what that narrow scopre requires.  And that is being able to take damage, which Warriors do best and always have.  The problem isn't so much in the fact that Warriors have an area of excellence, but rather that SoE has tended to narrow the scope on what works more and more as time goes on so that other things lose value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's hit on a big part of the problem here.  Specialty classes like warrior and clerics should by definition be significantly better at their specialty role than classes with more utility.  That's a given, or at least it should be.  Clerics definitely are.  Against bleeding edge content at least, warriors definitely are.  That's as it should be.  The problem is there are what, 15 classes now?  And Sony put in very difficult trials that only allow 6 characters.  To get through it, you're going to go with the specialists as much as you can.  You've only got SIX slots.  You don't have much room to be adding utility.  You've got to get your required roles taken care of.<br />
<br />
If you go to 12 characters, now you have some wiggle room.  Challenging content could then be made for the larger group.  You might have a tough named that practically requires a warrior to tank it, but maybe you also have an unmezzable, unrootable add.  You take a couple good healers, but wouldn't it be nice to have an add tank who can also throw a heal if needed?  Maybe one of your main healers dies.  You take the tank/healer because you've got your pure, specialized tank for when he's needed, but you'd also like that extra utility.  With 6 person groups you don't have enough room for both so you take your specialist and hope to god you don't need the utility.  With 12 you have more room to try different combinations and strategies.  Even having 8 person groups would help.  <br />
<br />
6 person groups might have been fine 5 years ago, but the game has evolved such at the high end  that there are too many &quot;required&quot; roles now.</div></div><hr />

This mentality is exactly like when you as a class, needed an upgrade to your aggro abilities to fuction, you were seeing a problem that needed to be fixed in order to retain some desireability for the character your spent time leveling to 65 and a half thousand AAs.  If I'm seeing a problem, and you say there isnt a problem, yet dont play my class...how is that any different than when some knights told you to go eat shit because you didnt need an upgrade to your abilities, without ever playing a warrior?  Its the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
Warrior_05: You cant have my abilities, because your not to supposed to MT on raids.<br />
SK_01: I dont want to MT on raids<br />
Warrior_05: Listen moron, I told you your not getting any sort of useful disc to MT raids.<br />
Sk_01: I dont want to MT on raids.<br />
Warrior_05:  Your not a real tank, you dont deserve anything remotely useful to help you tank, and your sure as shit not taking my tanking role.<br />
Sk_01: ....</div></div><hr />

Dont shoot me that utility bullshit, because rangers, monks, beastlords, almost all non tank hybrid and pure melee have some sort of damage evasion disclipline.  HT is not a class defining ability at this point either, it is a toy.  Some sort of Evasion disc is within our roles and along what our class is defined as.<br />

Crimson - there is a huge difference between defensive/evasive and the short term mitigation abilities rangers and rogues get (I'm not sure what the other classes you mentioned get.)  If you want a short term ability like fortitude, that's one thing - but if you're asking for our one and only class defining ability, I don't think you'll find much support here or at SoE.</div></div><hr />

For the umpteenth time, I DONT WANT DEFENSIVE.<br />
<br />
A riposite disc/evasion/whatever disc in the area of 18-30 seconds to assist me in the long term offtank situation or when all warriors have died on a raid.</div></div><hr />

Then you should be clear in your posts.  You said you wanted some sort of evasion discipline.  As a warrior I naturally equated this to the Evasive ability we get.  Evasive is equivalent to Defensive in usefulness.  Therefore, based on the post you made it appeared you were asking for a 3 minute disc that was equivalent to defensive/evasive.  If you do not want that, please state that clearly in any relevant post - as you just did in the above post.  (and, no, I'm not going to go back through 10 pages of posts to piece together exactly what someone wants before replying...I'll go by the info on the latest post)</div></div><hr />
