<br />
But i was wondering how the exp gets divided.<br />
<br />
24 person raid gets a 1/24th share? Or since in groups, the exp is divided by 5 and given to all 6 people, so actually would get 1/20th share, per the example?<br />
<br />
Is there any inherent 'loss' in the way raid exp is calculated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There used to be a 25% loss in raid.  I think I recall that they removed that penalty.  Now, you just get the share you'd expect, i.e. 1/24th in your example.<br />
<br />
But it is still effectively penalized compared to group XP, because there is such a large XP bonus in groups, which is not present to raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An interesting thing about raid xp is that leadership xp doesnt seem to be punished while in a raid.  For example if in a single group it took 50 kills to gain 1 leadership aa point, in a raid of 40 people it would still take about 50 kills to gain 1 leadership aa point. I think this is because leadership aa is based off mob level vs your level, not on the xp value you earn from the mob or whether you are in a raid or a 3 person or a 6 person group.</div></div><hr />
