<br />
Another of these endlessly repeated posts Im afraid...<br />
<br />
I have recently taken over a friends Warrior account, having been playing a Druid for the last 3 years or so (I continue to play the druid).<br />
<br />
Im in the process of trying to upgrade the character as you can imagine, and my main concerns are his offhand, wrists, shoulders and ear.<br />
<br />
He is flagged through Fire but not Time or GoD, as is my druid and I am generally a non raider so am looking for bazaar/1 groupable upgrades.<br />
<br />
Could any kind soul make some suggestions (and please say if you see other weaknesses besides those listed) and I will try not to bring shame on Warriors by playing like a druid :)<br />
<br />
Magelo is  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1043185  <br />
<br />
As an aside, Im not flush enough to buy a BoC etc, but can farm reasonably well.</div></div><hr />

See the thread in the Keep about Omens faction armors quest. That would take care of your bracers and 4 other slots as well.<br />
<br />
The Ear, Mask and Neck in my magelo are from single group targets in MPG and WoS. Also saw Mazerunners ring drop and lost roll, but its available and single groupable (both mazerunner pieces are random from any mob in MPG). Decent shoulders drop from random trash in WoS. All of those would be good upgrades and free.<br />
<br />
Offhand you could go after Bygone Butchers Cleaver or Sword of Midwinters Vengeance from RCOD and MPG respectively.</div></div><hr />
