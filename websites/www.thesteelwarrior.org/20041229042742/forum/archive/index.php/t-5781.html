<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ecchu</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I finally dinged 65 the other night and started working on AA.  I was wondering what the best path for getting AA would be to maximize my defensive/hp and then after that which offensive aa help the most.  Also, should I be getting Area Taunt as soon as possible? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I bought the cheapest ones first that way I got more ability faster. Since you need em all to make a real difference I dont think it matters what you get first.  At least if you buy the start of each level you will be well balanced. I think getting all combat agility just throws of the clerics timing. Hit point aa's are nice but they dont add as much as you would thing except for GoD now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the list of what is available, and go for it. Besides, there are a ton of threads giving descriptions of everyone else's preferences ;)<br />
<br />
Generally, it seems the prefered is: run3, (3 in anything), 12 spend in ca/cs/pd depending on pref, PE, AETaunt, finish maxing ca/cs/pd, lr/id5, SE, PD3, PP5, etcetcetc.</div></div><hr />

I need as much HP as possible and as much mitigation as possible and as soon as possible, just curious how to do that in the best way.</div></div><hr />
