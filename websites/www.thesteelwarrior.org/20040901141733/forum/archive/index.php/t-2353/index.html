<br />
anyway, i was in Nurga this weekend and was doing my usual thing, warrior was at about 35-40% health so i started the CH... got nuked twice, that hurt.<br />
<br />
Now it is a race between HP's and cast time... I yell over to my wife (playing a druid atm) and tell her to spot heal... Warrior is unconcious... crap... wait... HE is UP!! <br />
<br />
total hps on warrior: 3255<br />
CH for: 3261<br />
<br />
now THAT is mana efficient =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I joined the purple club once, but didn't think to screen capture it.<br />
<br />
THIS ONE (http://home.earthlink.net/~robkeating/manasaver.jpg)  is pretty mana efficient when you compare the total healed with my total HPs.  Although not quite as efficient as Daoga's heal :)<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS ONE (http://home.earthlink.net/~robkeating/ch7875.jpg) is the most I have been healed with a single spell.</div></div><hr />

I am a one time member of the purple club, was exhilirating kinda, I think I got an SS but it's on the other comp.<br />
<br />
I also got healed with 3 hp left before, not quite purple but close enough ;)<br />
<br />
The most I've been healed for is 6017 hp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just yesterday morning I was in PoS on my monk.  We had a 56 warrior for our MT.  I pulled a cactus and he started to beat it down.  And the chanter started having resists.  The warrior was down to 1% on my UI, everyone else said he was at 0%.  And he hung there for about 4 seconds before the cleric hit him with divine light.  Slow finally landed, cactus died about a min later.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, 2 mobs later the dr00d lost his charm on his frog pet.  3 hits later dr00d goes down, and then we all went down:(<br />
<br />
I think my best CH was for around 3350, not much HP to work with when you're only lvl 52.  But since I had barely 3500 at the time and was getting hit for 250ish per round, I was just a wee bit anxious:D<br />

Thats the part that made it barely possible Dobbo.  We had a 60ish cleric and druid in the group.  Between them they managed to keep the tank alive until slow landed.   And that charmed frog was doing unreal dps for us(at least until it broke charm that last time...)<br />

I stayed at 1% for what seemed like years. We had our clerics runing around in circles avoiding Sorrow's AE, some eventually got hit with the silence. The whole fight, which lasted like 20 mins (defensive refreashed twice) I got close to or over 10ch's for over 7500 due to the fleeing clerics :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had it twice in raids as MT.  The one I remember was against Ixiblat Fer.  I got knocked down and was bugged (lying on the ground) for the rest of the fight.  &quot;I can't stand up, none of my controls are working.&quot;   Managed to keep aggro the whole time (I think I was getting whaled on for max damage cause I wasn't blocking or anything.).<br />
<br />
I also got it while I was soloing with an alt.  Was being chased by probably a bandit or zombie in North Karana, running for the zoneline.  Knocked down and zoned through sliding unconscious.  WooHoo!!!  Ended up at the safe point in WK, which is off in the middle of nowhere...</div></div><hr />
