<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gingles</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was in MM LDON with a 65 Storm Warden Wood Elf. He had his AA set to 90%. I&quot;m a Barbarian Warr 65 I had my AA set to 100%.<br />
<br />
He has approx 30 AA overall. I have 26 AA overall.<br />
<br />
At the end of the dungeon crawl I had gained roughly 20% AA. He had gained almost a full orange 100%. <br />
<br />
Is the large race exp penalty really this bad? 80% What is up?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you are correct kamidari, they got the same aaxp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a wood elf warrior and a barbarian shaman, and their aa exp is identical, as far as I can tell.  100% of an aa for an LDoN dungeon seems awfully high.  The only time I got anywhere near that was a collection one where we cleared 95% of the dungeon, but still failed, and even then it was about 75% of an aa.</div></div><hr />

I logged in and asked the guy again because it did seem too much and it was one orange he says he never uses exp it confuses him...=P <br />
