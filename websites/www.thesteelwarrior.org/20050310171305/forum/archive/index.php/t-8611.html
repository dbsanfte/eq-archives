<br />
Sunday I met up a with a friend, a bard, who is looking to get the lute from Ferubi. I have never been there, but what the heck, I have worked hard to tank as I do. I notice, once we get past the first couple of pulls, that the shaman (who seems to be a good player) is slowing on inc, before I am even getting any agro--much less good agro. But, flatteringly enough--he is not getting punished for it. I seem to be getting agro fast enough. So I comment, &quot;You trust my agro, huh?&quot; He respondes &quot;Sure do.&quot; That felt good.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today. I get invited, from my LFG, to a Vxed group. Now i have been to all of 3 GoD zones and have clue what is quite instore for me. While, again, most of the time, getting and hold agro was not a problem. Surviving while having that agro was--humbling.  Fabel, the excellent enchanter we had, just kept a 64 mob charmed..and it did most of our tanking (and DPS). Vxed was just cleaning my clock with 1533 AC and 7855. Toward the end, I (and the monk Kyat (good puller)) would not start to melee until the cleric or druid was summoned for healing the charmed pet. <br />
<br />
I am now Vxed flagged--we won-- but one of the comments was this was like doing it with RA's MT down 2 bubbles of health...if not more becuase he has 500 more AC than I do. I can't take much credit (if any) for us being flagged. But displite dying many times (5-10...? I didn't really count) in the end I lost no XP and gained about 1 and 1/2 AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, Vxed/Tipt are a pretty big step up from anything else you do prior to them.  I know after spending a few nights in Tipt, LDoN hard just seemed like a joke and I used to consider it kind of a challenge.  I really like Tipt though, just good layout.  Fast respawn to keep you on your toes, but with built in rest spots along the way.  Good loot every trip, variety of mobs, great exp, quest items, tradskill drops.  I consider the sewers a time sink (which can be bypassed) but Tipt is a great zone and I am happy to go there even if I know in advance that we're not gonna win (cause we only have an hour or whatever).  You gotta have the gear for it though, that's a fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And beleive it or not, I still have not tanked a hard. :-/<br />
<br />
Difficult to put together a hard pickup group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">id recommend over 9k. in tipt at 10k hp in an avg group clerics cant ride mounts because its very possible  that if they start a cheal at full life they will need to duck out and quick heal because i wouldnt be alive when cheal landed. vxed is a little bit easier. some of the sewers are complete jokes, and monotonous as hell. i remember one time doing sewer 2 or 3, cant remember, but i had to afk about 5-10 minutes and the group just had the ranger tank and it was still easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thats kinda loaded question. Odds are you wont ever &quot;tank&quot; either as most folks use the ench charm method...the main job of the warr being to agro mobs on charm break and tank bosses...both happening with an infrequency that allows disc usage.<br />
<br />
For kicks I have tanked both Vxed and Tipt exp versions..with my gear I can handle Vxed fairly easily...Tipt is still quite painful</div></div><hr />

THe more the merrier, but I've been doing it fairly ok with approx what I have now.<br />
<br />
2 healers and both are jokes as far as healing goes.   I had a friend who breezed through tipt with a cleric, druid, and necro, only 3 deathes, and with 2 rezers, went by very very quickly with the chamred pooka and a ranger.  He was like 8600hp/1400ish AC.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I hate him =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tanked vxed once, it wasn't fun. We started off charming, but the duration on cragbeasts wasn't as good as what the chanter expected, so we gave up charming after 10 mobs or so. I tanked the rest, with DI on for the duration, and lost DI 5 times, 2 fails and 3 saves. We had 3 mobs left prior to the hail and oz, and for the first time all night, i didn't have locked aggro on a mob, the cleric got 2 rounded, and we wipe. I was hella pissed.<br />
<br />
This was with 1650ac and 9300hp or so, and I got smacked around pretty well. I'm sure if I did it again with my regular group of friends instead of a random pickup group it would be pretty easy. The group was cler/war/ench/ranger/ranger/sham, and the shammy didnt cast qbob on me all night, he was like dps all the way =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of people are afraid to venture through  Vxed and Tipt, and it's a huge damned shame.<br />
<br />
The first time I went through Vxed and Tipt, I had less of everything that the popular opinions here dictated I should have. I was around 7.8khp, 1500ish AC, and like 45aas. I didn't even have LR5 yet, I was hovering somewhere around LR3.<br />
<br />
The real challenge of Tipt and Vxed is that you need to have people that you know and trust to back you up. I tanked both Vxed and Tipt, with those subpar stats, straight through Heartstriker Jhiru. While I did rely heavily on the DPS of the charmed pet, I was the one tanking those beatass mobs, and I didn't do a poor job of it.<br />
<br />
GoD is the first expansion that begins to wean clerics off their CH at 65% mentality. Damage in GoD is far too streaky to rely on the ten second cast time, and even now when I go back there with 9khp and 1800ac, I still can't take CHs on those mobs. Sometimes I'll get wacked for 4k in straight melee + whatever I take from procs, and sometimes I'll get missed 4 times straight.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I would personally encourage any tank to try these trials if they can bring a group of people that are used to playing with them. If the Cleric has a feel for your HP, and the Enchanter is skilled, there's honestly no reason to fail these trials if you persist. Plus, they have some kicking upgrades you may want to look for, particularly greaves and earring off charoov the trickster, hp augments off enraged maternal cragbeast, and bracer of the heartstriker off jhiru, if you're lucky enough to see it drop and beat out the cleric on the roll heh.<br />
<br />
A few things anybody would want to note before seriously tackling these trials:<br />
<br />
Enchanter pets are gods here. However, don't let your Enchanter charm a stonemite; they go into summoning mode below 96% health, and that's super bad for recharms. Pookas and cragbeasts are ok, ravagers are actually a LOT faster (runspeed 5 at least) but dish out more DPS: snare is a must for any charming here. Make sure your enchanter is timing charm, don't pull if it's getting close to 7 minutes and 30 seconds on charm (mandatory charm break at that time, CoD won't last longer than that ever.) Do NOT let the pets tank, most mobs here proc a snare that is very short and will overwrite druid/ranger snare, thus creating an issue on unexpected charm breaks.<br />
<br />
Build your group as well balanced as you can. If your enchanter is charming, don't let him slow, bring a Shaman along. Have a class for snaring, and if possible a seperate class for pulling. If possible, make it a monk, necro,  shadow knight, or bard for pulling - in that order, monks are best here, then necros, shadow knights and then bards. Lots of stuff can't be lulled here.<br />
<br />
Avoid fighting in the narrow mountain passes. Try to pull as many mobs as you possibly can to a roomy area before proceeding. If you find it necessary to move up into the passes to fight, try to fight at a bend, not where the trail is straight.<br />
<br />
Ikaav mitigate melee damage heavily, and reflect themselves midway through the fight. Ikaav and Hexxd type mobs spawn pets upon aggro (Call of Chaos is the spell script you will see before the mobs spawn), but poof after 12 seconds. Note: pets that are spawned before you aggro, will not poof. Those are real pets.<br />
<br />
No CHs here, not even with a secondary healer. Spam heals all the way, unless you're remotely close to 10khp. Then CHs but you'll still need a spam healer. Shaman, Paladins, and Druids work well for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Mobs run here! Make sure they get snared. The last thing you want is a runspeed 5 ravager finding a few of his high DPS friends to come back and splat you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't let popular opinion dictate how you can play the game. A good group setup and skill account for much more than the stats on your inventory window in these GoD trials. When I did the trials, it was supposedly suicide for me to even try them.<br />
<br />
That being said, I fully agree - these are not places for pickup groups. I wouldn't even try them with people I don't know. Remember, they are progression content, they're not to be taken lightly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did Tipt with a 7k tank once.  That's 7k buffed.  :)<br />
<br />
You can use CH in Tipt even with a 7k tank, it's a lot more efficient than spamming HL.  If you're undergeared for tanking it, root, slow, then engage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you've got the DPS from a charmed pet backing you up, HL or even SL might be more efficent over time than rooting/slowing every pull (some things are also unrootable). Mobs won't be alive long enough to need more than one heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, cragbeasts are where its at.<br />
<br />
Allow me to clarify.  Enchanters are for weenies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see nothing &quot;weenie&quot; about using an Enchanter for one of their class defining abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you just might be a weenie!  :D<br />
<br />
As a tank, going through tipt with a charm pet tanking and me doing nothing isn't my idea of a good time.  I have done Tipt with and without charm pets and my conclusion was that charm pets are for weenies.  Just my opinion :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I never said to let the charmed pet tank, actually I worded my previous comments very specifically as to say pets should not be tanking, just adding to the overall DPS of a group.<br />
<br />
Implying that a class shouldn't be used for their class defining abilities is a joke. That's like saying clerics should never use Complete Heal, Warriors should never use Defensive, etc, etc etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't say that they should never be used, weenies need a strategy too!  :D</div></div><hr />

-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I have to disagree here.  Bards = the ultimate class for tipt/vxed.  Not only are their pulling tools second to none, but you get PRE slowed mobs, MAD resists and insane AC songs/mana song.<br />
<br />
I&quot;m sorry but as the 6th, a bard is unbeatable.</div></div><hr />

He died once splitting the ghosts, but otherwise it went great.  Have made it as far as the Crag Mom with a ranger as puller and slower as well hehe.</div></div><hr />
