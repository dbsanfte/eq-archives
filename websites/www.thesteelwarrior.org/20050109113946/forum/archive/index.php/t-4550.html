<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vizergi</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I am going to get flamed to the high heavens because of this post, but I wanted to give my opinion about the Paladin - Warrior dispute. BTW, incase you didn't catch the nifty title, I am a Paladin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Paladins are finally balanced /wave Kunark. Warriors are not<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, the incoming &quot;opening&quot; change to pure melees I think is a step in the right direction, but somewhat of a crappy change. This opening still leaves warriors at the mercy of the RNG (that sounds familiar...), therefore still having snap agro shitty. Now, I am not saying that Warriors don't need an upgrade, they definitely do, but the upgrade can't be crazy. Here is what I am trying to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins need to stay the masters of agro. We must be able to sustain agro longer, and generate agro faster than Warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before you go apeshit, and go OMFG stupid greedy Paladin fuck off, let me explain. If Warriors can generate as much/more agro as/than a Paladin, the demand for Paladins will fall to Kunark-era levels. Yes, Paladins can patch heal, have stun mitigation (which is a moot point on raid mobs, and a fair amount of exp mobs BTW), rez, buff etc. That is all nice and dandy. But, when it boils down to DPS (on live mobs, dead mobs are up in the air) and HPs/AC, Warrior are much greater than Paladins (except at *possibly* the higher end game. The Bulwark of Vie line is fucking ridiculous - Paladins *should not* be tanking high-end mobs like Time RZ).<br />
<br />
<br />
However, Warriors DO need an upgrade. What type of upgrade should Warriors get? Something that is not at the mercy of the RNG. AE Taunt was a step in the right direction. Give Warriors something that is snap agro. Not as much as say, Cease, but at least something that can be a halfway-decent substitute for Paladin stun. Make an ability that uses the endurance pool that can be used at any time. Something like a shout, which *can be resisted, but that resist can generate agro, just like Paladin stuns.* <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying that giving Warriors a shout thing should be the only fix. Warriors should have a utility like SKs (group taps, recourses) and Paladins (group heals, HoTs) have. Maybe something similar to a Diablo II Barbarian Warcry (while not infringing on Bards, they've been fucked over too much :P) - have the Warrior's &quot;powerful shout bolster the resilience of his comrades,&quot; causing a brief increase in haste. <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, Warriors need, IMHO, two things: A snap-agro generator that isn't random (sorry, an Anger X wouldn't help Warriors), and more utility in groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's please try to keep this as a civil discussion, but if ya want to, flame away :D<br />

Now regarding the actual post ...<br />
<br />
There are a lot of nit-picky details I really disagree with. But it's not worth getting into. It would just derail things. I mean it doesn't matter either way.<br />

<br />
Now that I think of it.........I'm going to retract my statement about Bards :P.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the topic,<br />
<br />
I would like to hear the small things you disagree with for the sake of a valid discussion :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh ok ... nit-picky details ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Paladins need to stay the masters of agro.&quot;<br />
<br />
I disagree that paladins are the &quot;masters&quot; of aggro.<br />
<br />
I think enchanters, shamans, necromancers and even wizards can obtain aggro just as easily as paladins. Granted those classes don't WANT to obtain that aggro, but they can.<br />
<br />
I also think clerics can use the same &quot;stun&quot; tactic paladins use with similar results, if they weren't too busy healing.<br />
<br />
But none of those classes tank.<br />
<br />
In regards to tanking, Rangers get aggro just as good as paladins in my opinion.<br />
<br />
To ME, Shadowknights are the masters of aggro. Their spells are better at it. At least that's my opinion. Like I said, it's VERY nit-picky.<br />
<br />
How does it relate to what you're getting at? Well, I mean, what you're stating just seems sort of, I dunno, barely related. You're stating paladins should remain the masters of aggro, but the only people they are Masters of Aggro OVER are warriors, rogues, monks and bards. <br />
<br />
To me it's like saying that Sammy Sosa is better at baseball than Kobe Bryant. And even though you think Kobe should spend some more time in the cages so he gets better for his annual Lakers Staff Picnic Softball Game, you think Sammy Sosa should remain the better power hitter.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as much as say, Cease, &quot;<br />
<br />
Why choose cease? Is that the spell you use most regularly for holding aggro?<br />
<br />
I think it's not too far out of line for warriors to WANT paladins to have to use more level appropriate spells for their better aggro do you?<br />
<br />
I mean Cease? You should have left that behind in your 20s. <br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
Like I said ... VERY nit-picky stuff. And the reason I didn't want to bring it up is it detracts from what you're SAYING ...<br />
<br />
The MAIN IDEA:<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically, Warriors need, IMHO, two things: A snap-agro generator that isn't random (sorry, an Anger X wouldn't help Warriors), and more utility in groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which, I feel a LOT of people will AGREE with you on.<br />
<br />
We can go back and forth on the nit-picky details but I don't want to. If you want to say I'm wrong about this or that ... well, ok. I won't fight you on it.<br />
<br />
Because it's your main idea that I care about:<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically, Warriors need, IMHO, two things: A snap-agro generator that isn't random (sorry, an Anger X wouldn't help Warriors), and more utility in groups.&quot;<br />

<br />

<br />
Well, for one thing, Cease has been *the most* effective agro generator for me hands down. Whenever I cease a mob, it jumps on me like a hobo on a ham sandwhich. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, why did I choose Cease? Because it is a level 9 spell. You know what that means? Assuming there is no low-level agro, essentially a 9 Paladin, ok maybe 9 is going a little far, level 15 Paladin (we get our second stun wuwu~) could hold better agro than a level 65 Warrior. <br />
<br />
Basically what I am trying to say is that my level 9 spell shouldn't be holding agro better than on anger II SotB and one anger III Somethingblade of Storms (the 1hs that drops from Water tower in BOT). Yes BTW I have tested that.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I guess I am posting for no particular reason and repeating myself due to the fact that I suffer from an acute sense of insomnia :P. Keep posting, I must pass the time :P</div></div><hr />

Getting away with getting and keeping aggro with a spell that costs you near ZERO mana is highly unbalanced.

<br />
Obviously SOE cannot do much now about that without pissing off a ton of people. So yeah I agree give warriors some improvements.<br />
<br />
As far as aggro goes thats fine. However, I want to be as close to aggro generation to a knight  as a knight is in tankability to a warrior.</div></div><hr />

So about a 5 percent difference in aggro eh? Yea that'd be fair, but then we would be &quot;overpowered&quot;</div></div><hr />

But to even compete yes, we have to be overpowered ourselves in relation to the game content, because I feel the classes we are trying to be equal to are currently overpowered as is.</div></div><hr />

Look, I'm not Galidin the Leader of the Holy Crusade of Paladins-need-to-be-uber-at-the-expense-of-all-sense-of-balance :P. What I am saying is that Kunark was uber-shitty. Maybe not for the highend Paladins, but I know it took me *months* to get from 33-35 because Paladins could tank about as good as Rangers can today (which isn't that bad, but would you rather have a warrior.....not going to ask that question....:rolleyes:). <br />
<br />
<br />
Now today, we are finally useful, albeit maybe too powerful, but considering the metric fuckton of mudflation, who isn't? Oh yeah, Warriors and Monks /tease. <br />

<br />
Unless that's sarcasm and not a bird flying over my head, would you really only like a greater difference in mitigation and HPs? Because quite frankly, I don't believe that, unless you nerf Knights instead of buffing Warriors (which is an uber-bad move :P) any difference in midigation is going to make a difference in group availability for Warriors. The quality of the gear nowadays makes the Mana Pools of healers and HPs of Knights abnormally large, therefore a mitigation raise wouldn't do shyte. <br />

<br />
I agree with you on some point. I could chain Cease (level 9) and Stun (level 30) for hours on end with KEI. And that power gives me insta-agro free of cost. Now, you could nerf the manacost on these spells/make spells below level X not work on mobs above level Y (bleh :P), OR you could give Warriors a lesser version of this. Something that is a reliable ability for snap agro. Now, let's say Knights can tank ~90% as well as Warriors. I say the Warrior Snap Agro Ability (henceforth known as WSAA) should work around 85%-90% and have a recast longer than a Paladin stun. However, the WSAA absolutely *cannot* infringe on a Paladin stun.<br />
<br />
A viable option for the WSAA could be, for lack of a better idea, a ferocious strike, crippling (sp?) the mob for a few moments (cripple agro is teh win) and generating, say, 300 points of hate. The ferocious slash will have a recast....er.....refresh time of ~18 (Cease, my baby, has a recast time of 9). So now, ferocious strike is not only a dependable source of agro, but as well adds a splash of utility to the Warrior class. <br />
<br />
Warriors should get a wide range of this special attacks, and I suppose each ability should eat up a little bit of mana....er.....endurance from their endurance bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Nitpicking time OMG!!! When I said Paladins need to remain the &quot;Master of Agro,&quot; I should have said Paladins need to generate more agro than Warriors :P.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this whole thread is retarded and about a set of classes that mutated into something which they should have never become.<br />
<br />
Your assumption that Paladins or Shadowknights should be 'The Master of Aggro' is about as stupid and inane as me saying Warriors should be the masters of Healing.<br />
<br />
Stuns were never intended as aggro tools. Using a level 9 spell to lock down aggro, as NICE as it is, and believe me it's damn nice, should not be possible. A stun is meant for one purpose - TO STUN. As you level up, more efficient stuns are given to you, some with DD components, some with faster cast times, some with faster refreshes, some allowing the 'STUNNING' of higher level mobs, and some with a combination of the aforementioned purposes. <br />
<br />
With that said, Aggro and Tanking go hand in hand. Logically a paladin should not be the master of tanking. That's my job. Given that tanking is my PRIMARY role, I should have the best tools at my disposal to perform that job. I currently do not. This is a design flaw.<br />
<br />
I suspect that soon, the ability to generate aggro with cheap stuns (if not all stuns) and the INCREDIBLY cheap Fears will be nerfed without mercy. Mark my words, it's coming. I can basically keep aggro lock on my SK in an undead zone by chaining lvl 15 fear for 40 mana and lvl 22 Spook the Dead for 10 mana (that's right, TEN - 10 - TEN mana); at 3.5 seconds for Fear before spell haste and 2.0 seconds on the nose for spook the dead. For a grand total of 50 mana, that's enough to lock a mob on my SK until hell freezes over. If I want to be a dick, I can sick a Festering on the target and another fear and basically, GOOD LUCK getting it off me. A warrior on the other hand relies on 2 procs per minute generating 700 hate per proc. Would you like me to do the math of how utterly shitty that is? Bust out a calculator junior.<br />
<br />
A Paladin is the defender of a group. Did you read that? THE DEFENDER OF THE GROUP. They have abilities to increase the survivability of the group greatly, far more than a Shadowknight or Warrior. On the other hand, a Shadowknight is the DPS dealer of the Knights, who has several utility spells available to also augment the DPS of the group and also other abilities (FD, self taps, snares, self only mana regen, corpse recovery, etc...). When I'm on my Shadowknight, I NEVER stop casting spells. Depending on the group, I'll be tossing Auras, a group tap, dots, DDs (something a paladin basically lacks aside from undead nukes and flame of light), etc... And admittedly, I use fear like I use air. I love it but I'm not so jaded as to not think how wrong it is that I can pull more aggro with 50 mana on my gimpy ass 120 aa'd Dread Lord than I can with my 400+ AA geared to the tooth Warrior. At the same time, I can generate sick DPS and would and do annhilate equally equipped and even better equipped Warriors than me in groups. When the fuck did this become ok? <br />
<br />
It's not ok. Playing a Shadowknight and a Paladin and then going back to a Warrior is a sad thing. I can't even force my knights to play warriors, they'd rather just log out, and that's the ultimate test right there... the easiest way I've found to shut Knights up is to let them play a warrior. After they're done (it usually doesn't take more than 5-10 minutes of fighting) they are silent. Then I get the, &quot;Welp, I don't know how you do it because this sucks.&quot; speech. Yea, thanks, I know it sucks. The things I can do on my GIMP SK are so ridiculous that the only time Furor ever comes out now are for raids. I have no desire to play him. My Shadowknight is 1000x more fun and worthwhile to me and the groups I'm in. <br />
<br />
Additionally, a Paladin is JUST as awesome. For example I was pulling AE on Kreugen the other night, something I normally do on a warrior. Everything was the same. On these AE pulls if I get hit, I take a LOT of damage. On a warrior, that means run around, get to your cleric and pray for the arb to land or a heal. On Kreugen, I laugh. I get down to 20% health, within 30 seconds I have healed myself back to 80-100% with a few Lights and one SC (all 10,500 hps worth - but that's another rant entirely). The best part is that the heals I just cast on myself bought me a metric fuckton of hate so when I bring the train home to the station, those mobs dont bum rush the cleric that didn't have arb up and tossed an SL. Usually then I'll just toss a Wave of Mar or a few Lights if people are hurting. I am invincible and I like it... a lot. <br />
<br />
There is no argument a Knight can make for any melee balancing to be pushed their way. There is no argument a Knight can use to even TALK balance to a Warrior. There is no room for negotiations. No room for anything anymore. Ironically, I don't think the melee changes they're proposing will make me drop gearing up and AA'ing my Shadowknight. A half a dozen gimmicks will never replace the unbelievable abilities and spells I have at my disposal as a Shadowknight. Basically, the melee changes they are going to propose have to be so ridiculously good (in order to put Warriors on par with SKs/Pal) that they would completely destroy what little integrity is left in the game. So I stand by my original thoughts on these changes; they will be nothing more than gimmicks that give a 2% DPS increase.<br />
<br />
EQ is fucked.<br />
<br />
Now kindly shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />

Paladins get exactly 2 Damaging-stuns post 50, 1 damaging stun post 49. Holy Might (only works on level 55 mobs), Quellious Words of Tranquility (either works on 55 or 61, can't remember), and Quellious Words of Serenity (which works on 65 mobs). Holy might and QWoT are useless at the high end. QWoS has a long ass casting time.<br />
<br />
As well, the reason Paladins are in love IMHO with non-damaging stuns is that we can build up enormous amounts of agro on a mezzed mob without it breaking mez. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you mad the stuns act like taunt is now (top of the list +1) Pure Casters would be so unbalanced (Clerics chain-stunning, Enchanters chain stunning etc.) All in all I don't think that would be that great of a change.<br />

I love it but I'm not so jaded as to not think how wrong it is that I can pull more aggro with 50 mana on my gimpy ass 120 aa'd Dread Lord than I can with my 400+ AA geared to the tooth Warrior. At the same time, I can generate sick DPS and would and do annhilate equally equipped and even better equipped Warriors than me in groups.  <br />
<br />
Furor, along with most of the post, I completely agree with you. I think I tried to say this in a previous post, but it was ~3am and it probably got jumbled in a bunch of shit. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Paladins and SKs generate disportionate amount of agro for no cost. That is bullshit and should be nerfed, however, a possible solution is to give Warriors that ability too(see the &quot;furious slash&quot; on one of my previous posts). Now, whether Warriors get furious slash or Paladins get nerfed, I think either solution would fix the problem. However, if and when Paladins do get nerfed, you'll have a clusterfuck of pissed-off Paladins screaming Kunark etc. etc. While that outburst would be unjustified, it would happen. In the end, I don't think SoE is going to want to nerf something, but simply make it better.<br />
<br />
With that said, Aggro and Tanking go hand in hand. Logically a paladin should not be the master of tanking. That's my job. Given that tanking is my PRIMARY role, I should have the best tools at my disposal to perform that job. I currently do not. This is a design flaw. <br />
<br />
Nothing I disagree with there.<br />
<br />
A warrior on the other hand relies on 2 procs per minute generating 700 hate per proc. Would you like me to do the math of how utterly shitty that is? <br />
<br />
Again, I completely agree with you. My 15 Paladin can hold better agro then an Anger II and III +stun/damage procs equipped Warrior. That....is bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, a Paladin is JUST as awesome. For example I was pulling AE on Kreugen the other night, something I normally do on a warrior. Everything was the same. On these AE pulls if I get hit, I take a LOT of damage. On a warrior, that means run around, get to your cleric and pray for the arb to land or a heal. On Kreugen, I laugh. I get down to 20% health, within 30 seconds I have healed myself back to 80-100% with a few Lights and one SC (all 10,500 hps worth - but that's another rant entirely). The best part is that the heals I just cast on myself bought me a metric fuckton of hate so when I bring the train home to the station, those mobs dont bum rush the cleric that didn't have arb up and tossed an SL. Usually then I'll just toss a Wave of Mar or a few Lights if people are hurting. I am invincible and I like it... a lot.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the thing. For high-end, for people who know their shit, the see Paladins like the one mentioned above. For the average, 65 Paladin who is lookin for a BoT pickup group, the vision of a Paladin is quite different. Paladins are viewed by the *average* gaming community as guys who can give me Brell's, and guys who can tank better than Warriors. They don't appreciate that if I weave in a HWoP (Wave of Marr costs a damn lot on my server) with a SC and throw in a Force of Akilae, the mob, as I said earlier, is on me like a hobo on a ham sandwhich. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, just because people don't &quot;truly understand me&quot; doesn't mean that I am not overpowered. I am. I like it. It is fun. When compared to Kunark, which was not fun, I am having a blast. However, it is at the expense of Warriors. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Basically, the melee changes they are going to propose have to be so ridiculously good (in order to put Warriors on par with SKs/Pal) that they would completely destroy what little integrity is left in the game. So I stand by my original thoughts on these changes; they will be nothing more than gimmicks that give a 2% DPS increase. <br />
<br />
Here is where I disagree somewhat, specifically with the bolded statement. I believe that Warriors should not be able to generate more agro than a Paladin or SK, but shoudl be able to tank better, and the difference in tanking should be easily viewable by the human eye, not some bullshit 600, nay 300 (yay, Paladins got AotC) HP difference. <br />
<br />
I however do agree that these &quot;opening&quot; changes are bullshit, and are nothing but gimmicks, just like the gimmicks Warriors have been thrown in the past.<br />
<br />
Now Furor, I am curious, what do you think about furious slash/kick/whatever abilities? Hell, make'm a 0 second stun with other damaging factors such as a momentary cripple/snare/stun/slow. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ironically, I don't think the melee changes they're proposing will make me drop gearing up and AA'ing my Shadowknight. <br />
<br />
Neither do I. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Don't mention Flame of Light when it comes to Paladin nukes. I think a developer misread the memo and instead of putting it down for 20/Druid he put it down for 50/Paladin :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read your post first, before flaming, as you instructed.  But good god man get real.  If hybrids are to retain their guaranteed push button at will agro lock, then their ability to take the beating should be greatly reduced or no matter what kinda crappy gimmic we get, nothing will be fixed. I realize that hybrids dont want this cause they wont get to be MT anymore, but face it that was never the intent of  your class.  Most pally's dont even play pallly's they play warriors that can use stuns to keep agro, maybe a wave heal or 2.  Face it if(and i realize this will never happen) they make it so pallys cant be MT anymore(i wont say nerf cause again they are being played in a way never intended) the only reason most of them will have problems is cause they will have no clue how to play their toon with it's origional intent, utility. <br />
<br />
But rest assured everything i have seen about the melee upgrage shouldnt cause pally's any cause for concern, in fact things for us will be worse.  First off i dont like the &quot;fix&quot; being turning us into more pally like.  I mean &quot;endurance pool&quot; sounds alot like mana, and those trainging guides that need to be turned in sound suspicously like parchments.  Sounds like that all my new abilities will have chance to fail, where stun hell even a resisted stun is guaranteed agro, you cant &quot;fail&quot;.  I will still have all these items with useless brain stats(wis,int, mana), probably since i dont have elemental or time access will probably have to wear lesser hp/ac gear to get focus effect items for the new skills.<br />
<br />
The correct fix would be to move pally/sk classes back to being utility which would mean either reducing their agro abilities or their ability to take a beating.  But since there is a marketing issuse, and Sony is far more worried about keeping players in EQ at this point than fixing the game, this will never happen.</div></div><hr />

(flames starting to get to me I guess)<br />
<br />
-but-<br />
<br />
This line got me thinking :<br />
Paladins need to stay the masters of agro. We must be able to sustain agro longer, and generate agro faster than Warriors. <br />
<br />
Now, for hybrids and warriors I think SOE wants Paladins to be master of Snap Aggro, Shadowknights to be masters of sustaining aggro for very long time (Dots, clinging darkness) and Warriors should be somewhere in the middle - Ie. have some snap aggro (which Warriors lack atm) and fairly good aggro over time due to good damage output. Rangers ... I think they envision them as the only hybrid that can take and loose aggro at a whim, which is really neat when you think about it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I see nothing wrong with that definition - If only it held true. <br />
<br />
The current state of affairs : <br />
<br />
Paladins :<br />
They are the masters of Snap Aggro and since the level 9 spels also gives aggro, they are actually also extremely good at aggro over time !<br />
<br />
Shadowknights :<br />
SK's are very good at accumulating aggro over time, and even have some pretty damn good snap aggro.<br />
<br />
Warriors :<br />
Have fair aggro over time with EB weapons, but really lack in Snap Aggro.<br />
<br />
Rangers :<br />
Can really grab aggro with snare big time.<br />
Can really drop aggro with Jolt.<br />
<br />
Fine Tuning that could be done : <br />
<br />
Paladins :<br />
Stuns that MOBs are immune to shuold have toned aggro down on them, they would suffer a little on aggro over time due to mana consumption, but their snap aggro would still be the best of the best. <br />
<br />
Shadowknights :<br />
They actually have a tad too much Snap Aggro compaired to Paladins and should be toned down a little in that aspect. They are a little weak on some levels with aggro over time, though not at high level, so a few intermediate dots of a sort might be useful without stepping on anyones toes. Also, lower aggro on Clinging darkness a bit, it's overpowered when used for snap aggro with it's very low mana cost.<br />
<br />
Warriors :<br />
Lack of Snap Aggro really is the issue here. Our aggro over time isn't too bad ... provided we get EB weapons, which really shouldn't be a requirement. Good aggro over time if they are augmented.<br />
<br />
Rangers :<br />
They seem to be pretty balanced, though Ensnare seem to be a bit high on aggro, but it's probably because they also have high damage output so they are already close to being #1 on the hate list. Their aggro shedding capabilities are par none. They actually seem pretty balanced in the aggro department.<br />
<br />
Summa sumarum :<br />
If the upcoming Melee changes must address these things or we will run into the same problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think warriors do not generate enough agro and I think knights generate to much agro.  I do not think that warriors should generate more agro then knights do but warriors should be stronger at tanking then a knight to make up for having less agro.<br />
<br />
In a ideal world  if some one was looking for a tank the would grab what ever class was lfg at the time and if a warrior, a pally and a sk where all lfg and the same level they would look at there current exp situation and decide from there.  Fighting something with a AE grab the pally for group heals,  Need a snarer and a tank but only have one slot grab the SK,  Have a healer whos mana pool is a wading pool grab a warrior.  I doubt that sony will ever get the classes balanced to that point and if they did I doubt the masses will realize it.  Something I have noticed in EQ people tend to follow other peoples opinions instead of forming there own.<br />

On top of that we got no utility. EQ is totaly unbalanced in this. This is the issue without geting into whole fucked up itemazation thing.<br />
<br />
The end result is warriros need much more then just agro upgrade to make us balanced. We need either be able to tank better then paladins by around 20% which I dont see happening or we should get the same ammount of utility as a knight of similar level/equipment and they gotta up our agro. Something like making us be able to proc EB at will on things every few minutes will do nicley.</div></div><hr />

They will not fix the game because all the folks who took advantage of the insane gifts given those 2 classes would run screaming to other games, therefore the 3 pure melee classes will remain fucked up and close to useless.<br />

<br />
I think it's about time you re-read the definition of your class.<br />
Everquest Classes (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp)<br />
<br />
While you're there, read up on the roles of warriors and shadowknights also.<br />
<br />
Notice this in the warrior's class description: &quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks&quot;<br />
<br />
Also note that there is absolutely no mention of agro management whatsoever in the paladin's class description.<br />
<br />
The bottom-line is this: There is no evidence that paladins were ever intended to be (nor do I think they should be) the so-called &quot;masters of agro.&quot; The use of low-level stuns to maintain agro is an exploit. The end.<br />
<br />
I agree with Furor in that you should expect the agro-lock-via-low-level-spells to be fixed soon. No, not nerfed - fixed. It's unfortunate that it's gone unchecked for so long because when they do fix it I forsee a lot of people hating life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At a minimum and without a whole bunch of other necessary changes for balance, I don't understand why nerfing the ability of (usually low level) stuns/fears to generate agro on immune mobs is a problem.  Isn't the only difference there the loss of agro creation ability by folks that want agro?  Sure, sure... it might also nerf some fights where paladin agro lock on immune mobs is nifty and we would need to compensate.  <br />
<br />
The mana cost of the high level stuns which would still work in a number of situations, when looked at with mana regen and focus effects, is so small anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, It is kind of funny, that we talk about Knights and aggro. I really dont have any problems with any of the SK's I play with , group with, or see. None. Maybe its just me, but SK's are a lot more warrior friendly than Paladumbs. First, there aren't anywhere near as many SK's. While everyone has a paladin twink. Sk's actually require a lot of work and skill to level up and be effective. <br />
<br />
SK's have roles, besides the MT, while Paladumbs all seem to be of the attitude, that THEY have to be the main tank.  <br />
<br />
SK's have been given pure hate generation spells, and aggro -reduction spells. They also have group and personal buffs to aid in aggro management.  FD pulling, DD, FEar, Pets, Taps. So many useful abilities, that provide, yes there is the word Utility to the group. SK's have unique abilities that help and enhance parties. A properly played SK can maximize the abilities of any warrior...<br />
<br />
Then there are the paladumbs... And I kind of sympathize with them to an extent. They are nothing but warriors who can heal/cure/buff. Look at their spell lines. They baiscally have 6 types of spells...<br />
<br />
Healing Spells - fastest heals in game, best group heals, low end cleric heals<br />
Buff Spells - Brells Line, along with low end cleric spells, resist buffs<br />
Cures - curse, poison, disease, arguably the best cures in game<br />
Root -  crowd control<br />
Stun - huge aggro + mitigation<br />
Undead Spells - couple utility and nukes.<br />
<br />
This to me is the biggest design flaw in the EQ war-knight relationship. None of these abilities work well with another tank in the group. They currently have no role other than to be a tank. And thats where i see the flaw. Yes, I know they have utility, and they bring more to a group than warriors. But virtually none of this utility helps in many ways except as a MT. <br />
<br />
If you were asked what the two big abilities of a paladin are, what would you say? What makes they special and unique as a class? Its pretty obvious to me, their healing with fast/group heals, and their stuns. These two things, do what? Gain aggro like crazy. Having a paladin NOT use these skills, denies them the posibility of being the most effective and efficient, and in effect makes them the default main tank. Compare that to an SK, that needs to actively cast spells to draw aggro, that do nothing but aggro essentially (fear being useless at high level), Sk's would rather Tap/Spear/etc than cast useless aggro spells . The paladin however, does useful actions, stun (if they actually use level appropriate spells) and group heals. The after affect of their action, is what draws aggro to them. IE, they do a beneficial action, which as a supposed downside has aggro generation. But instead of this being detrimental, it is an added bonus. Basically they get double the pleasure, none of the pain. That is why i see SK's different than Paladins.<br />
<br />
The problem is not necessarilly with warriors, its all in the design of paladins. There was never any good use for a paladin. There is virtually nothing unique about them that allows for them to do anything other than be a Main Tank.<br />
<br />
Paladumbs as the Masters of Aggro, they were NEVER meant to be. Sorry charlie, their major aggro comes from stuns, which ORIGINALLY had little to no aggro generation, but got nerfed to hell because of using stun- lock. Of course many Paladumbs will disagree with this, as they never started playing the class until after it became apparent that they were overpowered. these same Paladumbs scream Kunark, when they never started until after Velious.  <br />
<br />
What Needs to be done, is give the paladins a unique role somehow. In the current state, they cannot share the MT spot with warriors, because there is no sane reason to take a warrior over a paladumb. Unless you are fighting Red-Conned Named mobs that require defensive to kill as a single group, a warrior is a detriment to a group. Its sad, but its the truth. Paladins were created as warriors with spells. They have no other sense or purpose. <br />
<br />
What they were supposed to be is a group protector, and an undead slayer. This hasnt worked out well. Because of a few design problems. Its something that will never get fixxed in EQ, we can only hope in future games it will be addressed. Its a lot like in D&amp;D, the Paladin was arguably the most powerful of melee classes, but they had quite a few restrictions. These restrictions were put in place to limit the power of the class, to make them unique and to make them special. Nothing about Paladumbs in EQ is unique, special or limited.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world, this is how I would fix paladins....<br />
<br />
Heal spells - first get rid of all the cleric healing spells. Specialize in very fast casting spells, and group heals. Also give them a self-only complete heal that is faster than CH and more expensive. Paladins should be the emergency healer, and the group protector.<br />
<br />
Buffs- shitcan all the cleric buffs. Leave the paladin only brells line, and the AoTC line. Give paladin only stackable resist buffs.<br />
<br />
Cures- fast casting disease,curse,poison cures...<br />
<br />
Stuns- keep these, but give them a detrimental effect.. ie if a mob is stunned, it becomes memblurred.<br />
<br />
rest of spells are fine, root,dispell,pacify, etc..<br />
<br />
Undead - hear is where I would change them, increase the undead nukes to the efficiency of Wizard nukes, maybe even higher there. Give paladins self buffs that imbue them with bane undead powers. Give them a +100% to melee skils when combating undead.<br />
<br />
Mitigation - keep them on the same tables as warriors.<br />
Damage/Weapon Skills - Cut all melee skills by 30%.<br />
<br />
That would give paladins a unique role in the game, as undead slayers, and also improve their group healing abilities.<br />
<br />
Never gonna happen, but thats the way I envision paladins.<br />
<br />
as to all the Paladumbs out there... Nerf their Immune Stuns, and It will level the balance alot, fix itemization and we may be ok..</div></div><hr />

This difference has to be significant enough that it's noticeable (i.e.,  5% mitigation isn't enough.)  <br />
<br />
I don't know the details on how the new system will work, but if it's only a proc/affect twice a minute...that doesn't cut it for xp mobs that usually die in 30 seconds anyway.  I think the idea could have merit, but it sounds like the implementation may need serious tweaking (based on what I've heard about things on Test.)<br />
<br />
I also think a major problem that needs to be dealt with is itemization.  Sony needs to quit being lazy and go back to having class specific restrictions.  I realize this is a lot more work on their end, but having the same piece of gear usable by knights and warriors - and the gear has stats that are only useful for knights - is imbalancing.<br />

<br />
Why does everyone say this? I still cannot comprehend, why people cannot make the leap of logic...<br />
<br />
If a mob is IMMUNE to a spell, in this case a STUN... the Spell does 1 pt of hate for aggro.<br />
<br />
ERGO.. IMMUNE means that the mob is NOT STUNNED... there for Enchanters and Clerics can go crazy chain stunning, get 1 aggro point, but DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the NPC's ie they NEVER STUNNED the mob, because it was IMMUNE...<br />
<br />
This concept about breaking the game by chain stunning is the paladumbs deflection of the real problem. ie. exploiting a hastilly added code fix to spells, using the spells for not what they were designed for, but instead to get a completely different result...<br />
<br />
ie.. they cast STUN not to STUN, but to get the Detrimental AGGRO for a positive result...<br />
<br />
here is an example...<br />
<br />
A certain mob charms PC's and sends them against the party .. but due to stacking issues  this  charm spell will not overwrite the level 9 snare spell... so all the tanks /duel rangers, get snared.. and then fight the big nasty mob... no one ever gets charmed... <br />
<br />
Would this not be an exploit?<br />
<br />
Would not there be a reason to fix this?<br />
<br />
Paladin Immuno-Stuns are NO different...</div></div><hr />

I agree 100% on the stun immune situation.  I was only talking about mobs that are not immune.  <br />
<br />
I should probably also note that, although I'm 65 now, I'm by no means uber (little over 7k hp fully buffed), so my comments are for the non-elemental/time players/gameplay - which is also currently very much out of balance.</div></div><hr />

I have never grouped him with anyone outside a few RL friends and I rarely play him - I just log him on to buff my warrior if we don't have a shaman in the group.  <br />
<br />
What kills me is the shaman almost always gets invites within a few minutes of logging on....and I don't even have LFG turned on!!  Yet, sometimes I can sit for hours with my warrior looking for a group...  (and I usually get compliments on my tanking when I'm with new people...so I don't think I suck as a warrior :cool: )</div></div><hr />

There's your problem right there.  I'd take a 65 war tank over a 62 sk myself.  Levels make a big difference.  Of COURSE a level 65 knight is going to tank over you.</div></div><hr />

None of these abilities work well with another tank in the group. They currently have no role other than to be a tank. And thats where i see the flaw. Yes, I know they have utility, and they bring more to a group than warriors. But virtually none of this utility helps in many ways except as a MT.<br />

I think you have hit the nail on the head.  And, many Paladins (not all mind you) agree that spells that do not affect a MoB should not generate aggro.</div></div><hr />

I would pick him to tank over me anyday to.. that was not my point. The point was If i was 65 and MTing for the same group... he (65 Sk) would still be useful for DPS, Dots, his pet, and loads of other stuff....<br />
<br />
Warriors if not MTing serve no use to a group that was my point and I understand I didnt get that acrossed good enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, because warriors are intended to tank and only tank.<br />
Because we are (or should be :p) the best tank does mean we don't do enything else very well. <br />
Take a look at clerics, the best healer class. if they are not healing... they can do some guetto nukes, buff, melee with with their &quot;spamming proc&quot; hammer, etc... nothing game breaking, but they are the best in their speciality.<br />
<br />
So we Warriors can do some useful sustained DPS and shield the casters. We can also save the day with our disciplines or AE taunt... Nothing really great, I agree. But it is why you play a warrior after all, and not a bard :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrast</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Understood.  In a situation where offtanking is not needed, in a group where only one mob is pulled, every time, and killed at the groups own pace, warriors certainly do not stack very well with other tanks.  Nor would a Paladin, really, if his heals, rezzes, roots and stuns aren't needed or utilized.  I suppose a SK still has plenty of utility in groups like that, though, as their utility is mainly damage, and damage always stacks.  I use that example, because that is what the majority of my groups end up being; if i'm not tanking, I pull out the Tantors and woo myself with some eye candy, in between all my misses.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Paladins can patch heal, have stun mitigation (which is a moot point on raid mobs, and a fair amount of exp mobs BTW), rez, buff etc. That is all nice and dandy. But, when it boils down to DPS (on live mobs, dead mobs are up in the air) and HPs/AC, Warrior are much greater than Paladins (except at *possibly* the higher end game. <br />
<br />
It does NOT boil down to DPS and HPs/AC.  That's the fundamental mistake I see over and over.  <br />
<br />
Those utility spells mean a LOT.  It's crazy the dominance Paladins have in the melee relationships.</div></div><hr />

It's not ok. Playing a Shadowknight and a Paladin and then going back to a Warrior is a sad thing. I can't even force my knights to play warriors, they'd rather just log out, and that's the ultimate test right there... the easiest way I've found to shut Knights up is to let them play a warrior. <br />
<br />
I often play my friends (and guild leader) paladin for Cazic/Innoruuk in Time. Even in just these few minutes of fight time it just feels like im cheating at the game. After playing a warrior for so long, its like I busted out the cheat codes and am playing on god mode. Thats how fucked up the problem is. The saddest thing is during this time, im not even using more then 20% of a paladins full abilities, only DA, run in, and generate more agro then Jesus himself could ever want in a matter of seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like in the average group warrior disciplines and whatever mitigation edge the warrior enjoys are not needed.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, aggro never goes out of style, and that utility means a lot when the crap goes down, or in places like LDoN, where paladins completely rule. <br />
<br />
I have no idea why people like Torrast even bother writing this stuff. What's the point? You're suggesting there isn't an imbalance? That paladins aren't kicking ass all over the place? Just give it up. It's done. The results are in -- paladins have been dominating group tanking for nearly 2 years and most reasonable people recognize this. It's over; there's really nothing to discuss here, and telling us that in some groups in BoT you don't cast many heals is totally pointless.<br />
<br />
Hence the dramatic overhaul to pure melees about to land.</div></div><hr />

I don't expect you to understand or look at this rationally, having read many of your other posts reguarding paladins http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4653, but a man can hope.<br />

Hmm, was just thinking, a better way to put it might be that Paladins can be useless as well in a competent group that already has a decent tank.  After all, if you have a good tank already, why invite a paladin?  Heals that aren't needed?  DPS to be scoffed at by any non-purecaster/priest class?  Crowd control that will go unused?  Oooooh, Brells, which can be gotten ahead of time, or with a shout to the zone (unless, of course, you have the odd ranger tank who wants SoT, but that's not common) since, as has been stated here, Paladins have become a dime a dozen. In my personal experience, at least, I've NEVER, ONCE, EVER been invited to a group for palty dps and &quot;extra healing&quot;.  I would enjoy the change, truth be told.<br />
<br />
My entire point of view, of course, could be the way it is, because I play on Stormhammer, and people dont usually have the choice of passing up the warrior in favor of the knight, and having too many tanks available isn't too common.  If this is the case on a regular blue server, then I can understand your frustration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And as much as you feel useless when a competent group already has a tank, the warrior is that much more uselss. If a group has a good tank already, the warrior is far more useless than a paladin. You think all you can do is tank. That's wrong. You think other people don't value the non-tanking abilities of paladins. That's wrong, too. My twin brother is a shaman -- he certainly values them. But a warrior who isn't tanking really isn't bringing much to the party.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this has devolved into yet another paladin-warrior balance thing -- and that discussion is over. It's finished. It's been resolved. They are not in balance. You can argue it all you like, but you are wrong, and every sensible person in EQ now recognizes that, including, fortunately, the developers of EQ. Balance hopefully will be restored soon.</div></div><hr />

as for any class saying their manna goes unused becuase it just isnt needed. well let me put it this way if a paladin or ranger doesnt heal because the cleric can keep up on his own then why not dump your spare manna to heal between fights and allow the cleric to dump his own spare manna on a few nukes? so the fact that knights have manna is an advantage to their desirability in any group.<br />

should we compensate for this advantage by giving warriors manna? no, because thats not in the spirit of what a warrior should be. its bad enough that the differences between races are so small and that deities make almost no difference at all. we certainly dont need to increase the overlap in the characteristics of classes as well. this is why i like improving the mitigation (and MAYBE the dps) on warriors as the solution for the balance issue.<br />

also i would caution about overdoing any improvements to the point where it only causes the other melees to complain that they have now gone to the bottom of the list on desirability. there is a fine line between being overpowered and being underpowered. consider that a cleric at level 60 is probably only 20 percent more manna efficient on heals than a druid of similar aa selection specialization selection and equipment. or a wizard only about 20 percent more manna efficient on nuking than a druid. the point being that a 20 percent improvement on either of these areas by a druid would make clerics or wizards utterly devestated in their group desirability and the same would happen to palladins if a warrior were improved by 20 percent in areas that would be a direct competition with palladins.<br />

though its all guesswork to some extent im expecting to see a four percent improvement to mitigation a comparable improvement to relative dps (warrior compared to knights) and maybe a 10 percent improvement to &quot;hate generated from activities other than dps&quot; (which could result in a loss of taunt as much as negative 20-40 percent) and that if true will result in a dramatic difference in perceived value of warriors to group (which people will take a long time to become cognizant of) without it becoming so pronounced as to make them overpowered in the minds of the masses. and so it should be adequate. i would love to see warriors become the new superclass but lets face it i only think so because im a warrior and if i were any other melee class i would be justified in loathing that idea. i think the extent of changes forcast for our class are more or less where they ought to be.</div></div><hr />
