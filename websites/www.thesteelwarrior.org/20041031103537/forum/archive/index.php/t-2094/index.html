<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">the GSoT thread got me thinking<br />
everyone has stories about great buys they made but have you ever made a purchace you regreted?<br />
<br />
i play 5 unguilded chars on the lowest populated server in EQ so i buy alot of my upgrades and have always done pretty well<br />
i really wanted a nice face slot item for my warrior and got caught making a hasty decision<br />
id say about 3 weeks ago i saw a grimling contraption for sale for the first time and it looked like exactly what i was looking for<br />
there were two for sale, one for 25k and the other for 24<br />
after checking to see where it dropped (not to many evils hang out in AC on SZ) i went ahead and grabbed it<br />
over the next week or two they kept popping up between 15-20k and i thought oh well you shoulda waited<br />
well over the weekend i checked again and there were two more for sale, one for 9k and the other for 8 :(<br />
i understand mudflation and prices go down and yadda yadda but 15k in a few weeks seems extream<br />
i might have well put the 15k on my courser and destroyed it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Janthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, this should be pretty obvious, but shop around man...always take your time looking because that's gonna happen.  I know (and not exactly the same, but) that when I went in to look for Crushed Topaz for HoT gloves sometimes they would be selling for 1k a piece!  Then I would come back a couple days later and they would be 500p a piece.  It's all about patience my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah i have been playing eq since pre kunark<br />
thats what makes it so tough to swallow<br />
i should know better<br />
it was purely a spur of the moment desicion<br />
thats why im hoping a few others chime in with thier boneheaded mistakes to make me feel better lol<br />
<br />
(fast item destroy bloopers are my fav btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I buy overpriced stuff all the time, but I don't regret it.  Only time I can remember being pissed off at something I bought was when I first started and someone sold me (unmarked) no-rent stuff before I even knew there was such a thing as no-rent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I paid 20k for Command of Druzzil for my chanter and then they nerfed it.  Its about the only thing I have ever bought that dropped dramatically in price soon after.  Got one off a spec hand in the other day and can't get 4k for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i paid 200 plat for a crafted velium brawlstick :D that was about my best deal i ever found.<br />
besides that...err, let's just say they see me coming....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">500pp for a Berserker's Sword.<br />
<br />
I was a n00b, k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't remember which kunark era monk weapon it was, but I paid about 1k for either a Trance Stick or a Cane of the Tranquil. I think it was CoT, cause 1k for trance stick would still be not a bad price.<br />
<br />
That's about the only purchase I've regretted. And I've more than made up for it.<br />
<br />
And heck, I used that cane for a good long time so no biggie there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Man, I remember when 1k was cheap for a CoT hehe, I was using one of those at level 50.  Jade mace was like 15k in those days and it was one of the best weapons in the game.  Now an untwinked level 30 would turn their  nose up at a 9/18 with no stats and no proc hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh well to make you feel better a necro in my guild won a Girdle of Mithaniel last week then went to sleep thinking he was selling his old belt for 300pp, woke up to see that it took almost no time for someone to buy the Girdle of Mithaniel for 300:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lol fenrig that almost happened to me<br />
<br />
i put a windblade up for sale for 4400 instead of 44000 and someone actually ran up and started browsing my wares before i noticed and closed the window<br />
<br />
at least sony has takin steps to stop us from doing some stupid shit<br />
remember the old firepot scam when coin was able to be put on the ground?<br />
how many thousands of items were given to the banker instead of placed in the bank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I personally miss putting money on the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Janthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well if you want a bonehead move story I got one that goes way back! hehe...Back when EQ first started and Bristlebane Server first came up I got up to level 17 pretty quickly...I ended up killing Pyzjin (however you spell it) and getting a Glowing Black Stone...which...then wasn't known by pretty much anyone.  I had NO idea what it was for and saw that it was an Intelligence item and being a warrior and apparently lacking some of the afore mentioned attributes I decided I really didn't need it.  I was going to sell it to the merchant but decided I would try to make a ring out of it instead!!!  Back when stuff could be combined even in the wrong components and you would actually lose the components combined...yeah...poof, bye bye Glowing Black Stone!!!  That was probably the worst mistake I ever made...Don't ask about the whole jewelcraft thing...hehe...I think I actually got to like 40 skill or so... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well,i got a pretty bad one,i bought my featherwood bow for 200,thought i was gettin a deal,only one i have seen lower than 230,so i buy it and what happens,next day there is one for 150 and they kept dropin and they stoped around 100,if i would of had a little patience i would of saved 100k,but oh well,least it wasnt somethin stupid,bow is gunna be in my range slot for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My best deal? Buying a Razor-Edged Shan'tok for 275 pp off a merchant, and then selling it for like 4k later....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My worst deal was buying a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang for my Shaman to get his piercing skill up. Paid 7k for it, and will be lucky to get half that for it now. I'm older and wiser now, and don't buy things first time I see them anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I paid 9 or 10k for Barbed Ringmail Leggings when I was trying to buy Barbed Rubi. Took me 3 months to sell them off my mule for like 5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kalene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it was my contraption that you bought Sullon.<br />
<br />
Dont feel bad, I sold a contraption for 50k to a goodie warrior a week before that and he must really be kicking himself.<br />
<br />
The worst mistake i ever made was selling a cloak of crystalline waters for 3450 cause i missed a 0 in the price. Whoosh, 27k down the drain.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes you feel better =)<br />
<br />
Ya win some and ya lose some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">bought shortblade of lighting a few months ago for 55k... now its 20k on Saryrn...<br />
<br />
:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got a Barbed Rubicite Coif for 40k, wore it for a month or so, then sold it for 100k.  Of course that's more than countered by my bow that I bought for 150k and would probably have trouble selling for 50k now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hey Kalene<br />
<br />
good buy on that 20k belt today, i wanted to move that one fast cause i have another to sell~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You win some, you lose some. I bought a Fleshgrinder for 5500 back when they went for 75k. On the other hand, a couple weeks ago I bought a Shortblade of Lightning (28k), a Disemboweler (20k). 2 days later I picked up a Copper Hammer of Striking (30k) and found out both swords I had just picked up had lost about 40% of their price. To make matters worse, I found out how easy CHoS is to get. At least the hammer dropped when I was duoing with a friend, we split the profit so the pain isnt so bad now.<br />
<br />
I really feel sorry for anyone who bought ornate armor right after the patch upping the drop rate. Prices on my server are dropping like a rock. About the only ornate holding its price are BPs, and plate legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I love when traders forget to check their prices.  It didn't happen to me personally, but a friend of mine bought an Iron Cog Earring for 3 k.  Apparently the seller forgot to check his zero's.  He later sold it for almost 300 k.  Too bad I wasn't online or I'd be wearing it in my ear slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I used to trade 24/7 back in the day. I have made some doozy's :)<br />
<br />
95k for a COF.<br />
Traded away a fungi tunic for a Wavecrasher.<br />
Paid 85k for an RBB.<br />
Paid 105k and a fungi and a wavecrasher for a Horn of Hsagra and a Fleshgrinder.<br />
Bought an exe axe for 2500pp back in Nov 1999.<br />
Bought a shield of Rainbow Hues for 15k, then found I couldnt use it.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on and on. Some highlights:<br />
<br />
Once bought a Zlandicar heart for 15k and sold it for 55k on Drinal by doing who all necro 51-60 for a day and a half and getting a euro guy to buy it. <br />
<br />
Have purchsed 8-10 fungi tunics all around 25k.<br />
Sold 4-5 fungi tunics for 80-100k.<br />
<br />
Can't remember the other good ones. I gave away a couple fungis for free to friends because of my good luck. Never had more than 250k in bank at one time though. I find that Traders never stop trading. Even when there arent good deals out there, you still want to be in the action.<br />
<br />
This is all pre-bazaar btw. Bazaar was great for consumers, bad for sellers :) (Value, not convenience.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jazmyn637</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My dumbest mistake was when I first moved to Stormhammer...<br />
<br />
I've never seen a moss covered twig for sale (the 3/10) one, and was amazed to see one for sale in bazaar.<br />
<br />
It was only 80k!  For this amazing super high aggro mainhand weapon that will probably outaggro almost anything else.  (At this point, I was ignoring the fact I would get riposted to death).<br />
<br />
Anyway, after I bought it, it wouldn't let me equip it in my mainhand slot.  I was like wtf?<br />
<br />
Checked it, they are now offhand only...<br />
<br />
POS, resold it for 10k the next day.<br />
<br />
Oh well, you win some you lose some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">lets see, my absolute best deal, hmmm i paid 250pp for an aged velium claidmore, i used that thing for a long time, and loved it<br />
<br />
my worst deal, LoY launched and i wanted that Barnacle covered axe real bad, i thought it was so uber, so i scrounged up all i could and paid 9k for one, luckily i saw the price falling, sold it for 7k a few days later cuz i realized it wasnt worth the money, and i know keep one in my bag cuz i paid 400 for it a few weeks ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">worst deal ive done was trading for a split blade of destruction for reselling,best deal was prolly  buying a BoC for 370k and selling it for 465k+30k in items the 2nd day i had it up in the baz :~)<br />
but in general the bazaar is a gold mine if u know the prices,and got plat 2 spend on buying for reselling,much easier 2 make plat there then it was in EC days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">bah  my worst deal I made was buying my GSOT a month ago for 50k now it can be bought for 4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Bought a Hiero Cloak for 1700pp someone forgot the zero (17K)<br />
Sold my Sboz for 32K (highest price in the bazaar at the time) 3 others 31k, 28k and 24K respectively, but mine sells LOL<br />
Sold CoF same time same person 71K , theyre at about 45K less than a week later, Big boobed human females make great traders. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rhes/Rypem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I bought a Fungi Tunic the 2nd week of the Bazaar being opened for 5000pp, some prick left a zero off his price.  <br />
<br />
I got a ornate leg mold off of a guy just the other day for 32k....he was auctioning that he was selling it fast and cheap, so I made him an offer and told him it was all I had.  I saw the same item for sale later in the day for 90k.  <br />
<br />
Suffice to say my warrior is happy with his new legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I had only seen 2 GSoT's for sale during the last month, and 50k each...one day saw one for 38k so I grabbed it...yesterday I saw one for 8k:( .<br />
<br />
Once some guy had a fungi for sale for 550...I bought it and sent him a tell...I know...woulda been a heck of a profit, but I'da hated to lose 55k because I left off a couple zeros...<br />

If I didn't buy it, someone else would have so hence the purchase.  People should be careful when adding zeros.
