<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy folks.  I'm currently in a small guild on my server that's in a rebuilding phase after a long period of inactivity (long story).  We don't have a lot of people to work with, but I thoroughly enjoy raiding, and I'm hoping that if we can get some raiding started, it will help with recruiting.<br />
<br />
I'm approaching level 65 (where I will stay for a while), and while I work on my core defensive AAs, I'm looking at organizing some raids for our guild and friends to go on in order to have some fun, learn to work together and upgrade our gear.  We'll have the following personnel at our disposal (give or take a player or two):<br />
<br />
2 Warriors (me when I hit 65, the other is under 60)<br />
4 Clerics (All above 60)<br />
2 Enchanters (Both above 60)<br />
1 Rogue (59 now, will be above 60 by raid time)<br />
1 Necromancer (65)<br />
1 Paladin (65)<br />
2 Shamen (Both 65+)<br />
1 Mage (65)<br />
2 Beastlords (Both 60+)<br />
<br />
The 2nd warrior also has a cleric alt (same account, no boxing) in the high 40s.<br />
<br />
I will be the main tank (magelo in signature), and I will be level 65 and have the following AAs completed:  Combat Stability, Combat Agility, Natural Durability, Physical Enhancement and Planar Durability.  I will also most likely have Weapon Affinity 1 or 2.  Obviously, I'll continue to work on more as time passes.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for are some viable raid targets for the folks listed.  I'm currently looking into Kael Drakkal, Cazic Thule, BoT Towers, possibly Temple of Veeshan and if we can get another chanter or two, PoN Hedge.  Are there any other decent raid targets for us?  Right now I'm not considering OoW because not everybody has the expansion.<br />
<br />
Some feedback would be greatly appreciated.  I'm hoping that if we can get raiding, even the little raids, recruiting will be just a little bit easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say continue upgrading, in reality the lowest raid zone is Kael. At your point you are about where I am, though I'm working my defensive first since I'm not my guilds main tank. I can tell you vindi and statue/idol/AoW would be out of your reach, you'll need a lot more DPS or a lot better gear. Try upgrading through LDoN's and OoW (some really, really great gear out of here). Also recruitment is necessary, like I said at your numbers you'd need to be EP geared or better to raid Kael (would defeat the purpose too). Just continue upgrading, gaining levels, and defensive AA's. All these events become tons easier with levels/AA's (especially levels, being your guilds main tank I would advise hitting 70). Anyways, bazaar yourself out, AA's, etc. You'll get there eventually.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warhead, use this thread I made in the General section of my guild forums:<br />
<br />
Guide (http://www.rog-stromm.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1293) <br />
<br />
Basically it lists out the raid mobs we have taken out before as a guild, and also running directions to each raid mob.<br />
<br />
It's lagging a bit in terms of updates (2-3 mobs at most) but it should prove useful for you to start gathering info on what targets are doable.<br />
<br />
With your current setup, the following targerts may help you determine how strong your raiding force is:<br />
<br />
Vindicator<br />
Statue of Rallos Zek (first part of Avatar of War cycle)<br />
Rumblecrush (this was the mob we learnt how to do rampage tanking)<br />
Xerkizh the Creator (has Hategiver - check my magelo for stats)<br />
Guardian of the Seal<br />
BoT Towers<br />
Overlord Banord Paffa (fun script)<br />
Mujaki (another fun script)<br />
<br />
Mind you I am not sure which exactly you'll be able to take down, but each of those listed have different strats that you will need to learn and master.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pox In Bardinu is a well overlooked target, he drops nice loot, and is pretty simple once u learn how to pull his guards out and kill them..<br />
<br />
Rhag 1/2/3 in Ssar are pretty easy.<br />
<br />
King Tmax in kael is doable.  <br />
<br />
The big Rock guy in Acheva. Vdynn i think is decent.<br />
<br />
Envolved Burrower in Acrila Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">farming ssra period is fun, dont know what else youd be able to take down there besides XTC.  Most definitely not cursed or emp and i have no idea if theres any other worthwile targets there.  you could probably take xanamech in innovation (dunno tho) he drops some decent gear.  thats about all i can suggest heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input, all.  I'd considered Paffa, but considering that I'd been on 4 failed open paffa raids, I wasn't sure I was ready to try it yet (despite the fact that the personnel available to us is far better than any of the setups on the open raids).<br />
<br />
Also, thank you for the idea of Xanamech.  I'd definitely like to get myself and some of my people factory keyed for the future, although that's looking pretty far off at the moment.<br />
<br />
As for the others, I'll definitely look into them, although not too deeply.  I know that me and my merry band are far from groundbreakers, but it would be tremendously rewarding to us to try and work out strats on our own.  If we wipe the first few times, that's not a big deal, it'll just make winning the sweeter.<br />
<br />
Oh, I will eventually be levelling to 70, but I want to get all of my defensive AAs first.  I know that levels &gt; AA as far as tanking ability goes, but I think it'll be faster AA grinding at 65 in areas that I'll actually be able to tank in without the AAs.<br />
<br />
If there's anything else floating around that's 3 groupable without EP level gear, I'd love to know about it.  If I can't make 4 friends in a month, I have issues. =)  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't heard Nadox Inny mentioned.  He should be doable with your crew and it sounds like some of his drops wouldn't be too bad for you and your guild.  He only drops level 3 focus effects for casters, but the stats aren't terrible, the monk/bst weapon is solid and he does drop a 36% haste cloak that's superior to a CoF.  Three day timer and almost no one bothers with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check into Korukust in Chardok also, can't remeber exactlty how many we would kill him with, but he is either in your reach or very very close to it.<br />
<br />
Grieg is another to consider. <br />
<br />
Maybe not cursed himself yet, but you could probably swing the first 2 mobs of the cycle in the near future.<br />
<br />
Could head to Ferubi and just crawl around killing stuff with that force. Some nice, but fairly rare items come from random trash there and there are some nameds that drop augs you could do. Same goes for other God zones like Burindu.  Not sure if it would really be worth it to you hoping for random drops from trash mobs, could be fun though, hehe.<br />
<br />
Once everyone has Omens you could probably do very well organizing 2 groupish mini-raids into Bloodfields, Ruined City, NC and WoS.  Id say Bloodfields and ruined city would be best, just because not a ton of people there at least on y server. Could get a lot of nameds in a 3 or 4 hour killing spree there. Runes, attunable stuff, solid agro weap (Bygone Butchers Cleaver).<br />
<br />
Also, every single mob for the tier one Omens quest armor is killable with your force except Velkitorin and Pyrique (BP and legs).  The results of those quests look to be extremely nice if you aren't Elemental raiding guild and able to get Raex. Head and shoulders above ornate at least in the pieces ive seen. Sorry if i have Omens on the brain, hehe. I realize you said you didn't want to consider Omens yet, but some outstanding stuff for your crew to do there.</div></div><hr />

This is a good choice IMO.  Most of the content you are experiencing has level 60-65 characters in mind anyway.<br />
<br />
As for a good grind spot, make the Tier 4 section of the Plane of Hate your new home. :)  UNREAL XPs, good chance at loot (especially if you know where the placeholders for the named are) AND you also get to work on likely the best questable range slot item (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21002) in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the IV(itirus vius? i cnat remmber in akheva ruins), grieg, Xanamech(the gnome walk to kill the dragon in PoI), the 3 Prototypes in PoIFactory, mini's in Tactics(glykus, overseer, tagrin), Thought Horror Overfiend(the deep), banord paffa in CoD<br />
<br />
these mobs me and my guild usually drop when we are bored and/or dont have enough for other targets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More excellent advice, and for that, I thank you.  Innoruuk doesn't drop anything besides the cloak that would be useful to me, but certainly some of the FT gear would be beneficial to the casters.<br />
<br />
I will also look at taking a group into PoH for the Marsinger quest.  It is certainly an excellent reward for what seems to be only a little bit of drop hunting.<br />
<br />
Many other excellent suggestions that I shall look into more deeply.  I'm really hoping to be able to grind out 65 by the end of next weekend (living in Korea, which is GMT+9, makes doing something productive during the week a considerable challenge) and most of the AAs I'll need in the week or two following that.<br />
<br />
Another question.  Do you think that Shei Vinitris (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8561) (Akheva Ruins/Luclin) can be 3 grouped?  He has very nice face (Crys'Va Mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26560)) and shoulders (Mantle of Fortitude (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=30533)) drops that I'd like to get my hands on, plus several other pieces of nice loot for my fellow guild members and friends.  My biggest concern about the encounter is the death touch, as the only tankworthy characters in our force will be myself and the paladin.  The death adds don't worry me, our chanters are very skilled.  Suggestions/advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm looking at my &quot;next step up&quot; weapon combination to be Hategiver (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28854) and Great Blade of Storms (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22971).  Both of these targets should be within our capabilities in about a month or so.  Aside from these, are there any other possibilities that I should look into as far as aggro weapons go in the near future?  I know this particular question should probably go in The Bunker, but hey, why start a new thread?<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all who have helped thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prototypes in PoI might be doable.<br />
<br />
Will need more then 1 tank, as they dispell you out of room.<br />
<br />
If all 3 are up, can get 6 loot, if I remember right some nice stuff for priests at that lvl.<br />
<br />
Would try to get down BoT tower done, would be hard at start, but when you get use to it, it will get easier.<br />
<br />
Some other nice targets listed to, like Deep burrower, AC burrower ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shei can be 3 grouped, but takes some good coordination to pull off with low numbers (one extra death can mean a wipe).  Since Shei is also blowable, I'd recommend getting to the point of flawless IV/Grieg/Vindi/Statue/XTC fights before seriously considering him.  You can also take out everything except Vulak in NToV more easily than Shei, so that's a good opportunity to fill out everyone's weaker slots with moderate gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kukoc</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if anyone mentioned this, but get groups together and farm the crap out of WoS and once everyone hits 65 move to MPG.  There you will be able to equip most slots of everyone very quickly.</div></div><hr />

The instanced zones are nice for single groups, and with the 3 groups of folks I can put together, it looks like a viable place to get some excellent upgrades.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, not everybody has the expansion.  I would still be able to bring in 2 groups easily, but I hate to leave people out.  Doing so doesn't instill the feeling of teamwork and comraderie that I'm looking to achieve.<br />
<br />
That being said, I have looked into the DS instanced zones.  If I can only get a single group of folks together, be assured that I will test them out.  I'm pretty sure I can tank them now (at 63 with no defensive AAs) with a shaman for slow.<br />
<br />
I haven't really done any research the last couple of days between work and a flaky internet at home right now, but any other suggestions will be considered and appreciated.  Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 Warriors (me when I hit 65, the other is under 60)<br />
4 Clerics (All above 60)<br />
2 Enchanters (Both above 60)<br />
1 Rogue (59 now, will be above 60 by raid time)<br />
1 Necromancer (65)<br />
1 Paladin (65)<br />

2 Beastlords (Both 60+)<br />
<br />
Hey man.<br />
<br />
I was the raid leader for a guild that was moving around at this level for a while.<br />
<br />
If you can really get yourself to 65 and the AA's you are talking about...<br />
<br />
Then I would suggest trying to do BoT Towers a bunch if you have all 4 clerics.<br />
<br />
You are light on hps atm, but you can get ornate BPs for every class from the towers.<br />
<br />
Vindi will give you his BP, but if you are farming Eindride, you probaly dont need Vindi.<br />
<br />
There are FT2 hats on Brynju for your priest classes, and he drops the wicked shank for the rogue. He also drops the Chain BPs.<br />
<br />
Auliffe will drop GSo4W for BST for better DPS and Leather BPs. He can drop the ice wand for your casters.<br />
<br />
Eindride as mentioned before has great hybrid shoulders, Plate BPs for you and your clerics, and a Great Blade of Storms for your main hand.<br />
<br />
Start with Eindride. He is the easiest. Your DPS will be lacking at first, but with 4 clerics you will live. Get your BP and GBOS.<br />
<br />
When you get him down, move to Auliffe. A bard will help a lot in these encounters, and you can always invite one and allow him to roll. You need him to avoid the stun.<br />
<br />
Finally, take a stab at Brynju. He is great reward, but you need higher DPS to keep the area clear. A COD pet will help a lot for that fight.<br />
<br />
Leave Whats his Stupid Earth Tower guy alone for a while. Your casters wont like it, but its more pain than it is worth at first.<br />
<br />
Clearing these guys out every 8 hours or so will yield a great amount of loot for your crew, plus you can get ornate pieces from Minis along the way.<br />
<br />
I dont think you have the DPS for Xanamech. I dont think Kael holds anything that great for you that you cant get more easily from BoT towers. NTOV can gain you all some upgrades, but it is longish respawn and without a decent amount of DPS, it can take a long time to clear through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Start with Eindride. He is the easiest. Your DPS will be lacking at first, but with 4 clerics you will live. Get your BP and GBOS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree with that. Eindride has that really annoying AE mana drain if you can't position just right, plus Auliffe's AE is pretty wimpy. Can cast out of the range of it, plus all it is is a stun + minor DD. Nothing ungodly terrible imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johnjacobjingle</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a list of the first 40 raids a guild should try:<br />
http://www.voodooreign.com/First40.xls<br />
Please e-mail me at: dabigbillboski@voodooreign.com with suggestions on DEFINITE changes to the list. I have left out some gray areas! Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on my BoT tower key as we speak.  Well, not right this second, but I am in the process of getting the gems.<br />
<br />
I have a bard available to me as well, I can't believe I left him off the list.  He's only level 59 right now though, so we'll have to get him up a bit before he'll be useful in the towers.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to try and take some of my folks through a PoJ trial for the progression flag.  It is my goal to get my entire force progression flagged, and am curious as to the best set-up to achieve that.  I would take the following people to do execution trials:<br />
<br />
Myself (soon to be 65 war)<br />
Cleric (60+, interchangeable to get them all flagged)<br />
Mage (65)<br />
Enchanter (63)<br />
Shaman (66)<br />
Beastlord (63)<br />
<br />
I would include the necro, but he's been MIA for the last 2 weeks and I don't know when he's coming back.  I can swap in the rogue for the beastlord once the BST gets flagged, and I think the shaman can be swapped out to get other people flagged (with chanter picking up slows).<br />
<br />
Once I get all my folks through that, I can take them into PoStorms for the BoT key.  I went into Storms yesterday with a group of 5 (of which I was the lowest at 63) and we had kind of a rough time.  I got my beard, but we didn't do the other 2 camps.  With a skilled puller, I think I can take our force in there for BoT keys.  The chiefs might be kinda fun, but with 4-6 clerics, I think it can be done.<br />
<br />
I reviewed the spreadsheet of the 40 raid targets, and I had to knock 6 off the list immediately because none of us have keys to sleepers tomb.  Also, I'm not keyed for VP, VT or anywhere else that requires one.  That's something else I need to work on.<br />
<br />
Heh, it'll be an interesting adventure in the future.  I expect it to be fun, both for me and for my fellow guild members and friends =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Your entire guild could go for the PoStorms flagging, since it's min level is 55  :D</div></div><hr />
