<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings! <br />
<br />
I just read over Gaylon's thread for his warrior and druid, but at my current toons' levels (52 for warrior, 54 for druid) the zones mentioned are not exactly good for me. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what i said in the other thread about maiden's eye you could do in scarlet desert using the cheetahs as pets. the cheetahs near twilight are lower level. go find the better ones near the north side of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could try Velks.  It's slower than POP exp, but it adds up.  Plus, spiders have low hp and don't hit hard.  I levelled my war from 51-60 there in the old days, so it's doable, and I don't think they nerfed the exp again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CasEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jaqged Pine Forest.(zone off of SFG) Have the Druid &quot;wolf&quot; ya and if you can get the poacher camp you are golden. <br />
<br />
Decent exp, some coin, vt drops, and the poacher's drop pelts of all kinds as well.<br />
<br />
You will be KoS to the critters there, hence the wolf form. But once at the poacher's you can drop it. I recall exp was pretty good up to 55 there for me, some will be LB tho.<br />
<br />
Named poachers might be a bit rough unless you bring a few more tho.<br />
<br />
One word of advice, don't get too near the river...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some great suggestions here! <br />
<br />
I was suggested LDC's in Sol B for a little while - may try them and then head on to Velks/Jagged Pine after I'm bored. <br />
<br />
Many thanks - keep them rolling.</div></div><hr />
