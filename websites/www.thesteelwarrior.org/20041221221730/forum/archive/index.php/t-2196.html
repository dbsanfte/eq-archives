<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so I was in this pickup group in PoS yesterday.  We were doing fine, but we had a couple of deaths that could have been avoided.  I know my armour isn't all that, but it isn't that bad and I have tanked in PoS before.  I noticed that the chanter waited a good two minutes before he slows the MoB.  Now, when you are getting wacked by an unslowed cacti for 2 min. at 500 HP a pop, it tends to eat up the clerics mana.  So there's also alot of medding down time that could have been avoided.  So next thing I know, the wizzie leaves and the group gets a pally to rep him.  Someone in the group says, &quot;He's a good tank.&quot; /group member slaps Mvreena in the face.  Another group member says, &quot;You can switch to DPS Mvreena.&quot; /group member slaps Mvreena in the face again.  I'm really ready to leave at this point, but I have only 3 blues until 60, so I suck it up and continue pulling while we wait for this god of tanking.  We get an add, chanter mezzes, things are going OK, then the bard wakes up the mezzed mob.  Chanter goes down, cleric goes down, only ones left are me, the bard, and the ranger.  So at this point everybody knows its a game of last man standing.  The pally picks this opportune time to come running up.  Pally says, &quot;Invite me if you want to live!!&quot;  I'm like WT???  So I say, &quot;I would love to, but I'm not the leader, and currently the leader is zoning to her bind point which makes it kind of hard to transfer leadership.&quot;  After my rez, I got rescued by my guild, and went to PoV, where guess what, I had no problems and get my level.  I consoled myself by figuring that particular pally deserved that particular group.  Just had to vent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the a pally or sk gets added to a group I'm in, I simply ask what his/her HP and AC is (and get back some pitifully low response) and then casually point out that I have X-hundred more HP and X-hundred more AC and that as a capable Warrior can hold aggro just fine. This doesn't mean slow on INC or chain stun or anything, it just means that you would have been better off getting a monk or rogue for more DPS :)</div></div><hr />

i just want experience. i don't care if a snow bunny tanks.</div></div><hr />

Gives me a chance to watch more TV and kinda drift off to mez land.  Had a paladin tank way back in PoN and exp was running nice and smooth.  Was a good 3-4 hours of exp grinding and I started to fall asleep.  <br />
<br />
Its nice to tank and all, but you gotta stay focused and stuff.  If Im not tanking, my DPS shoots up the roof and I just hit the /asisst macro from time to time.  Effortless free exp, cant beat that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Lorre<br />
<br />
Having to tank always sucks.  Sometimes its nice to just /assist and grind mindlessly without worrying about the slower dieing.  I wanted a pally to tank in my last exp group but she wanted me to tank /sigh.  Anyway, if you are grouped and getting exp who cares who takes the beating?<br />
<br />
I will say though that Pallys can root park adds better than most other classes including mez IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FarlanderB</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See I disagree. Tank stacking is not effective. Whenever I'm in a group where I am not the tank (which doesn't happen anymore because I promptly replace myself with a rogue and go LFG), I feel like the other people are regretting inviting me because mobs could be dying faster if I were a higher dps class.<br />
<br />
And I don't like being able to watch TV while I exp. I like all the stimulation possible while playing EQ. That's why I 2box a shaman and encourage every enchanter to charm :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasn't trying to see whos dick was bigger, especially seeing as how I don't even have one :eek:  Just today I was in a group for most of the day where I pretended I was a rogue.  Was just frustrated with the whole situtaion that particular day.  I mean please, if you think I'm a horrible tank just say so and don't give me some BS about DPS.  The straw though. was the Superman complex this particular pally seemed to have.  However, he died like the rest of us, so I guess his super healing powers (OK, maybe that's more like Wolverine) weren't as advertised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just remember something. Nine times out of ten those paladins that claim they are superior get splattered eventually by a mob that resists the stun and just rips them a new one. When that happens ask the freshly rezzed cleric how much he enjoys medding with death effects when the group could have played just a little bit smarter and let the real tank do their thing. /evil grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not understand why groups think they can do more DPS with a Paladin around.  Unless people XP for 15 minutes at a time a caster can't do more than his mana regen in DPS and that is actually quite low especially for pickup groups that most certainly don't have high FT and all the mana regen buffs.  <br />
<br />
It's rather amusing that the uberest of casters do not need very much aggro at all to use up their excess mana (over a long duration, like xping), and yet all the low/none FT pickup group casters are so oozing with firepower that they just need to have a Knight to use it all up.  While my Blade of War can hold aggro against our best caster who sustain 200+ DPS (possibly a lot more), it somehow fails to work on someone with no FT, focus, and a low amount of AAs.  I guess these people must be able to sustain 300 or more DPS since that's how much damage you'd have to be doing to justify that kind of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the idea is that with a warrior, a wizard/mage/etc just isn't casting as much as they could with a paladin/shadowknight...they aren't coming up against the mana regen barrier they would be hitting with a hybrid.  Whether that's true or not is another story, but general belief doesn't always follow logic.<br />
<br />
BTW...100th post! :D Guess staying up until 4:30am trolling the message boards is good for something, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont know, but my group last saturday worked well with a paladin in group.<br />
Actually it were 2 of them over the time of 4 or 5 hours.<br />
We compared hp/ac at the start, i was about 200 hp and 100 ac ahead of them (they were from a guild in elementals, so their gear was superior to mine), so i tanked.<br />
Agro wasnt actually an issue, offtanking when needed went smooth (we had a bard for crowd control, sometimes resists were an issue), dps was good enough (warrior, paladin 400+aa, shaman, necro, bard, cleric).<br />
At least in tower of sol ro where some mobs hit for 800+ a pop usually knights are more than happy to let the warrior tank.<br />
<br />
Oh and for the second half of the session i used my 2hander to tank instead of bloodfrenzy/blade of carnage and i was surprised i had no issues with agro until we changed the shaman and he malo'd on incoming.<br />
Worked with him as well after a bit of timing the debuff later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back during Luclin there were a few times when I'd equip 2 opal encrusted steins and a shade silk robe and pretended to be a wizard.  Took one of the groups 15 minutes to figure out why I wasn't nuking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I usually do is swap out my high aggro weapon setup, go with DPS weapons, and the group's DPS goes up. The hybrid can generate superior aggro, so the casters don't have to be so careful with their nukes, slows, and DoTs, and the warrior's DPS goes up due to actually being able to use the good damage weapons, as opposed to the good aggro but not especially good (by comparison) damage weapons.<br />

And as a warrior you don't see a problem with this?  Aren't warriors supposed to be the best at their craft, which happens to be taking as well as inflicting damage?  Yes, I know all the many problems we have as a class.  All I'm saying is, I didn't choose to be a warrior so I could be a plate wearing gar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I think we all see the problem with it.  However the situation actually dictates that it's the best way to handle it at the moment.  We can keep fighting it in pickup groups and running our head into the wall, or you can step aside, pull out something with some good DPS and go to town.<br />

You gotta do what you gotta do to feel like you're productive when you're broken.  Being a stubborn dick about it in game won't get you fixed any faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I don't really like to tank because tanking is rarely appreciated anyway.  Yes they may tell you your aggro sucks when they get a Paladin but do you really think if the Paladin is the only one there, a group would say like &quot;OMG Paladin our savior please grace us with your infinite aggro!&quot;  I don't really mind if people want to take their shot at tanking.  If the group can manage with that it's no problem to me even if it's less efficient than normal, since so much efficiency is wasted on pulling anyway.  Today I was in a 4 Warriors (yes 4) + Paladin + Cleric with bot shaman group in Earth so we're not exactly a DPS powerhouse here, and we still had to have puller taking off when a mob is at 50% because that's how long some pulls are.  Is the inability to kill a mob 5 seconds faster really that important when you need to have one person not fighting a mob for half of its health just so that you don't have to wait 30 seconds for a pull?<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work out (i.e. the Knight dies), you can always tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this post made me remember something that happened in PoV few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Was bored, it was the middle of the night, not many people online, so i toss up LFG, and sit down in PoV.<br />
/who turned up 9 people in zone ... figured it was gonna take a while to find a group.<br />
bout 5 minutes after i zoned in i get a tell ... come to BC.<br />
YAY!!! a group actually wants me ... i get there, they invite me.  The cleric inspects me, and promptly sends me a tell &quot;Put your aggro away, the pally is tanking&quot;.<br />
I comply, because at this point, im just happy to find a group.<br />
Bout 10 minutes into fighting, i decide to inspect the paladin, as i was wondering why he was needing chain CHs to keep him alive.<br />
Asked how many HP he had (only baron title mind you), 4900 buffed he replied, this was with Virt, FoS, Boar, BMB.<br />
My cigarette litterally fell out of my mouth at this point.<br />
<br />
So in the end, i sent a tell to the cleric ... said, hey, mr cleric, i got an idea, will speed things up, interested<br />
he says what is it. .... i say ... let me tank, you wont have to med every 4th fight<br />
he says, but your a warrior, you cant hold aggro.<br />
Then i bet him 1000pp that i would hold aggro well enough so he would use less mana.  This cleric at this point was under the impression, that we couldnt hold aggro at all, so he thought to make a quick K.<br />
After the 2nd pull, the paladin left, i never told him i had 1200 more hp unbuffed, than he had buffed.  He just figured it out when i just needed Sup elixer to keep me alive.<br />
<br />
left PoV that day 1k richer, and another group of morons converted to warrior tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe if I should have left out the part about the pally in my original post.  In fact, when I left that group to go be with guildees, I was not the main tank.  Heck, I have a 2 year old, half of the time I'm not even at the keyboard because I'm running after her or playing with her.  I'm quite content to take whatever role is allocated to me.  I just want to know why unless you're with guildees or friends things seem to go so badly and the warrior gets blamed.  Heck, if you've just grouped with someone a time or two things go better.  Maybe it's just me.<br />

<br />
that warrior was 59 ( kinda low to start to tank in PoS imo ) below 60 his taunt key is not effective on any mob 60+. ( was that ever changed ?  )<br />
<br />
we have no info on the pally except that he showed up , as far as we know he might have been 65.<br />
<br />
in that situation doesnt it make sense to let him tank ?<br />
<br />
sorry but in my opinion this game got 3 tank class and yes one is way more effective in a raiding setting ( guess which one ) and therefore that one is much more wanted in strong guilds . however i tank that all 3 should be able to tank in everyday raiding situation period.<br />
<br />
i do agree that warrior agro need some improvement , how that could happen i do not wish to go there.<br />
<br />
<br />
trast if your pally stun in  a group and they arent MT they need to learn to play period.<br />
<br />
to the guy that talked about that 4.9k  buffed pally well that pally gear sucked big time and some war gear also suck big time. melee classes are very dependent on gear and what they can,  cannot do often depend on what they wearing ( and lvl, AA ). i am sure some pal or sk got more hp than you out of better gear.<br />

First off Darnir, I'm a she not a he.  Might want to read more carefully before you start telling people they aren't seeing the whole picture.  Second off, I previously tanked in PoS just fine with guildees and friends.  Which was the whole point of this thread.  Also, I want to know where in the hell you think  a 59 warrior is supposed to tank?  PoI and PoN with all the high 40's low 50's?  Third off, what level 65 in their right mind is going to come to PoS for an exp pick up group?  He was only 60 btw... I think, it's been a couple of weeks now.  Fourth off, why purposefully replace a wizzie with a pally when you have a tank unless you think the tank is crap?  Fifth off, I don't mind being DPS.  Sixth off, this thread has deviated so far from what I was trying to say, guess I didn't say it well enough in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it was changed.  I saw a 51 shadowknight successfully taunt a level 60 bug in FG a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I don't mind being DPS.  People really get too hung up on maximizing their efficiency in exp grind groups.  Especially if you have to sit around for half an hour making your perfect group.  As Phantron said, it doesn't make that much difference, get your tank, healer, and slower, and grab who's available after that.  My last PoV group was shaman, warrior, beastlord, and 3 mages.  God damn did that group kick ass.  Only me and the shaman were 65, everyone else was 58-61.  If they had all been 65 we could have cleared half the zone.  Anyhow, if the paladin has worse gear than me, I tank.  If they have equal or better gear, they tank.  I don't mind hitting assist while watching TV now and then, especially if it's a group of newbies that are ping-ponging the mob all over the place.</div></div><hr />

But I resent having spent four years working on improving my ability to absorb damage to the greatest point I possibly can, only to have one expansion come out that turns that on it's head and makes me DPS.   If I had know that was what was going to happen, I'd have spent my AAXP on offensive abilities.   I'd have selected my gear to improve my offensive abilities.   I wouldn't have focused on the area that I was led to believe was going to be my primary function at pretty much all times.   It's like having a Cleric spend four years working on improving their alteration and healing abilities to then tell them they're going to be a nuker.</div></div><hr />

A lot of groups still think Mages/Necros don't bring a lot of DPS even though they're probably the best DPS in the game for XP groups (since you can use pets).  If your group has unrealistic aggro expectations on you (i.e. being able to hold aggro against chain slowing), then let the Paladin handle it.  You're not the one dying, after all, and since there's more people in the group (5) than you, you might as well go with whatever they believe.</div></div><hr />

oh well, TIer2 should have never been opened to 55.<br />
<br />
oh and Mveernal, if your gear isnt the best, exp some in deep veksar or droga. almost the same exp, but the mobs hit only for half of what the same level PoP stuff hits for. More casters though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors can't hold aggro eh?  What about the other folks in the group controlling their aggro?  Yeah,  a Pally definitely has an advantage with stun etc., but that also means that the group has to pay less attention to their aggro management than with a Warrior.  Basically that tells me the group is a bunch of lazy arseholes that don't deserve my superior skills!  (/insert sarcasm)  <br />
<br />
Mvr, you were obviously better off without that moronic group.  I hate groups, and people that are group/xp Nazis.  These are the ones that absolutely have to have the perfect group and won't go xp till they do.  To me, that's just ghey.  I find it fun and challenging to build a group with different types of classes.  I know in some cases you have to have a slower/mezzer, or both, but you can work around some things, and several classes can slow, so you can be creative with group making.  Too many people are way too obsessed with the perfect group and maximizing every possible second of xp grinding.  I don't know what ever happened to kind of winging it and having some fun.  <br />
<br />
And if my role in a group is DPS, I don't really give a crap.  That's what I'll do.  In raids, that's basically what I do anyway as I'm not even near what our MTs are.  /shrug no worries, I still have fun.</div></div><hr />
