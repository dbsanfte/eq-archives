<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There seem to be 2 opposing factions in OOW.  Killing dragorns in Wall of Slaughter will raise faction with the Overlord, the guy who leads all the armies, and lower some others relating to the original inhabitants.  This could have remifications for quests, including maybe access to the locked zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah, a caster in my WoS group yesterday was worried about killing the dragorns because of the faction hit.  I said &quot;they started as kos to me, so I'm starting as kos to them&quot;.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tranmek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is also another faction that does not seem to go in the negative. It's called The Dranek Loyalist (something close to that name) which is what im thinking is what we are  gonna want according to the lore that I have read. I was also  looking at my faction and it stated that I was  max dragorn faction, but I did a con and was still kos. My group was fighting in the Bloodfields , first courtyard on the right hand side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's like two or three of those kos quest npc dragorns that don't attack, lots of quests!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's possible that killing a mob can lower a faction even if they're not on that faction (ie, they'll be KoS to you, but they lower faction with something else if you kill them. some mobs are just always KoS)</div></div><hr />
