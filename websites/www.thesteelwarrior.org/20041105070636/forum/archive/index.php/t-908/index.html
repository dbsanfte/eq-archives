<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been reading some of the old strategies for this and they were really quite old - some were written in 2001.<br />
<br />
Anyway i was wondering for the initial break in, assuming you head to the west camp, with all the new levels etc will 2 groups of 61+ people have a problem breaking in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 groups 61+ should have no problem.  Just invis, zone in, turn left, go to the wall, and start your clearing.  Be ready for multiple mobs while pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not a fun corpserun, and even though it is old... you can still wipe there, just be on your toes at the campsite and you should do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, it depends on the makeup of the 61+ group(s) involved.  At the last fear breakin I saw, (And the first come to think of it) :)  We wiped twice, first time 'cause some folks ran the wrong way out of the portal, aggro'd half the zone, then trained it to  the camp, the second 'cause we were in summoned gear.  Got a couple groups of 60+ friends to help breakin and they had a tough time too.  Ended up having a bard and shaman kite stuff around and let the rest pick off a few at a time to kill.  After the breakin it's a fairly easy raid.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just bring an enchanter or two and AOE stun , two druids/mages/ or wizards would help for the aoe as well.<br />
<br />
61+ chanter with FT7+ can AOE stun all day and night, add two chanters and you can wipe fear (minus the golems) in an hour / hour and half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kbam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">West wall breaks seem to depend on how well you handle the scarelings and just how far they shadowstep you.  All it takes is for one person to get shadowstepped a large distance away and the number of mobs you're fighting can go from a couple to 10+ in a few seconds.  I'd only recommend west wall breaks for those who have been there before.<br />
<br />
For first timers I'd suggest looking at doing a north wall break.  A north wall break allows easier CRing and recovery from a wipe although it does take some coordination to get a cleric in the right spot and camped out safely at first.  Once at north camp there is only one patroller to worry about so it does afford a larger margin of safety.  Downside to this is the longer set-up time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahem,<br />
<br />
Cast invis on everyone in your raid.<br />
<br />
Zone in.<br />
<br />
Turn left (west) run to the wall.<br />
<br />
If you get attacked, stop and die.<br />
<br />
Drag&amp;Rez any who die.<br />
<br />
Pull at will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">West Wall is pretty damn easy to be honest with you. Just bring an enchanter and you'll be fine. I'm pretty sure all of the mobs are mezzable by the low level mez, Dazzle, so they can be mezzed for little mana and for along time. For a group in their 50's, yes it will be tough. For a group of 60's it will be very doable (done it a few times), and at 65 with nice gear it's just a cakewalk.<br />
<br />
If worse comes to worse what you can do is take in an A team and fight at the west wall till it's clear, then bring in the rest of the raid. If the A team begins to get overwhelmed, just evac to SRO or CT and run right back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just did a Fear break in last night on my monk.  We spent a good 20 minutes sitting in front of the portal giving out directions on what to do/not to do, where to go, what to do if you have agro, etc.  I paid attention, had never been there before.  We didn't use invis, someone said there were see invis/undead mobs so don't bother(I REALLY wish I had wrote down what asshat said that.)  We were told to zone in, turn left and haul ass to the wall and STAY THERE , no wandering.  I was thinking that a 4 group raid of mostly 55+ wouldn't get wiped...<br />
<br />
The other monk in the raid had been there before so he went in first to FD at the zone in so we would know when it was clear and safe for everyone to come in.  Monk says all clear, zone in now.   We charge in, I head left like i was told and stop when I get to the wall.  I look back to see where everyone else is.  Here comes 2 Shiverbacks, an Amygaldan Warrior, a small flock of Scarelings, a few spiders, and about half the raid.  /GULP<br />
<br />
Hit my /target MT and /assist macros and got to work.  We beat down quite a few mobs but I could see mobs taking off left and right.  The GD Necro was Fearing anything that got within range of him.  Chanters finally start AoE mez and stun but it was way too late.  Everything that got feared came back with at least 2 more adds.<br />
<br />
Me and the other monk FD when we are the only ones left alive.  The raid leader starts blasting /tells to everyone he knows trying to find a rez team or 2.  The monk and I start dragging bodies into a pile along the wall where we were supposed to form up.<br />
<br />
After about 2 hours of dragging, we were both dead.  He got gated and went down pretty hard before FD refreshed for him.  I got feared and ended up at the firewall before it wore off.<br />
<br />
One of the higher guilds on the server showed up with 2 groups of 65s and cleared us a nice big safe rez area.  Ended up being about 4 and a half hours of wasted time for maybe 3% exp.  I really hope things go better when I take Haqq there for his Ball of Everliving Golem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cervesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The fact that players 61+ will train a camp boggles me.<br />
<br />
Like everyone has stated.<br />
<br />
Invis, Head in, turn left, run to West Wall.  SoE helps on the run if available, but definately not required.  If you get aggroed DIE.  Don't break mezzes, if you get shadowstepped, check for aggro, if you get aggro DIE, not too tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">west wall break is little safer if you have a monk train north first, then zone in invis. just make sure sow is trainers last buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lol, for what's it worth, my guild has been trying to 'break in' for the 1st time too, we also had our break in crew invised and all, they did get to the camp, but go figure soon as my group zoned in we were attacked by at least 3 mobs and soon enough it was total wipe ^_^<br />
<br />
I had one of the greatest view I was at top of the hill and saw some guys running toward my grp far down with like 15 mobs on their tails<br />
<br />
Honeslty once eveyrone died and got rezzed on the spot, it was much easier ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, my first mega fear wipe was when my old guild had a druid go in to check for a wizzy spawn. She died because invis dropped so we got a raid party to go in and get her corpse and all. Well that was a nice 3+ hour corpse run. Anyways here is a pic of me soloing about 1/3 of the mobs that wiped us.<br />
<br />
It was hell :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Groticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did a break in the other day for a rogue needing an eyerazzia for a quest.  Me, 65 Cleric, 65  Rogue, 65 Chanter, 63 Necro, 57 Wizzy.  Invised and ran to West wall.  Wizzy had 2 agro and brought them into camp.  We started killing.  Never had more then 4 mobs.  Took all of 6-7 minutes to clear a safe area out and get the piercer to drop for the Rogue.<br />
<br />
Yes some mobs do see invis but most do not.  always invis if you want to reduce the number of mobs you get to start the break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One problem I remember also was the need for high MR.  I have been feared in there with over 140 MR .. by blue mobs.. it isn't good when yo urun to the hills and aggro more mobs while the rest of the group is getting rezzed ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The secret to a good Fear break is to leave the idiots outside. You know the ones, they are the people that no matter how many times you say something they are the first ones to screw up. They are the ones who don't pay attention and end up going the wrong way into a pack of mobs. They are the ones who don't use /assist and the ones who run around like headless chickens when they get agro.<br />
<br />
With current gear, levels, and AAs, a Fear break should be a cake walk for a couple of groups of 61+. Do a west wall break just like it was written 2 years ago. As long as no one trains the camp and everyone assists the MA, you will have a safe camp in about 20 minutes or so. The mobs are weak and they don't hit very hard by todays standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Breaking fear with 2 groups of 60+ should be pretty trivial.  Last time I broke fear we did it with warrior, rog, bard, and cleric all level 65 and it was pretty trivial, hell necros, shamans, wizards and various other classes can clear the whole zone solo :p.  Been breaking it with one group since Velious.  Remember people used to do it with nobody over level 50.  With level 60s that aren't retarded it's very easy.</div></div><hr />
