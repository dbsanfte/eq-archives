<br />
I finally sold my LSoEE, and have ~6kpp to spend.<br />
<br />
My plan was to replace it with a cheaper DPS weapon such as Defender's Lightblade (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17200), for when I want some DPS as assist or swith offhand when I have aggro, and get 4k spare for another upgrade.<br />
<br />
My current setup for aggro is Frostbringer and Silken Whip of Ensnaring and seems to be working well enough for non PoP raids.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to buy a decent DPS replacement and a gear upgrade, or go all out on a 6k ish offhand AGGRO weapon that's really worth the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
PS: going to do Bracer of Benevolence and Draconic Pauldrons quests soon for 20+ sta, so not looking to upgrade those slots.<br />
<br />
PS2: woops, also have Corroded Plate Vambraces waiting for gems, so not upgrading Vambraces either</div></div><hr />

<br />
look for things like argent protector, the blackened acrylia halberd and theres a few others all in the 4-6k ranger which will give decent dps.<br />
<br />
for 6k for a aggro generator, id keep the frosty and the silken whip and get another 1hander proccing wep like a barnacle axe or the new ykesha or anything else with an aggro proc. then rotate all 3 via hotkeys for nice aggro generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it depends on when you're MT or not in a group.  If you find yourself mostly MT, then upgrade ure gear.  More HP's, and ac will only help you out if you tank a lot.<br />
<br />
If you find that you are damage dealer most of the time, go for a good two hander.  There are a lot of cheap 2 handers out there.  A weighty Polearm ran me bout 100pp at the bazaar (29/33).  Also, Taw Ew War maul's arent too much either (round 2k).  Wide bladed greatsword does wonders (31/30 ac20) and runs round 6-7k.<br />
<br />
Check to see if there are cheap upgrades.  Get the most AC/Stam/Hps for the buck you spend.  The Bazaar filter and searches are youre best friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks<br />
<br />
I hear you on the 2 handers, but yes I find myself often MA or SA depending on when our level 60 Pally is present, with our warriors currently in the 51-55 range.<br />
<br />
How about a SCHW and Belt combo ?<br />
<br />
Since the FBSS has no stats at all this could be the best upgrade yet?<br />
<br />
I know I can look up the bazaar for belts, but there may be items not on sale that I can get after auctioning a while, so just wondering if there are any good Belts with ac or sta / hp in the 3k range I could buy ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zilden</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buy a weigty polearm for a 2 hander and get your self a better haste belt imo. Sash fo the dragonborn maybe? Or better yet just keep the frosty and honed blade and save all your money for a runebranded girdle. RBG has ac/hp/sta and decent haste 6 perc more then fbss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honed Blade of the Ykesha and Cloak of Maelstrom is what I bought.<br />
<br />
I liked the HP and DEX on the cloak.<br />
<br />
I didnt like the AC malus on the Silken Whip of Ensnaring, and fancy the look of the good ol' SSoY. The ratio is nice and the proc too.<br />
<br />
I am going to try for a Champion crown as we do Kael rather than spend 5k (minimum) on a Raldukan helm.<br />
<br />
RBG's go for 21k on Terris Thule last time I checked .. :(<br />
<br />
I have done very little fight since, and I hope I won't be disappointed with the HBoY.. If I am you won't hear about it until I have sold it back ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh that's cheaper than when i was there lillyann :D.<br />
<br />
if you can drag some friends down to Seb you may want to try to camp one near the undead frogs past the golem that drops the lammy ( that's where i got my RBG from back yonder ).<br />
<br />
if you go for the hand_route for haste; you can always grab a chitinous belt ( 13 AC str/sta5 somethign else ) or a sentry belt...pretty cheap belts @ 1K or so ( prob a lot less ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also a Harness of Grey Flesh I have seen on someone's profile (200p at bazaar).<br />
<br />
I have tried alternate profiles with SCHW and Belts, and the problem is other than no drop belts its hard to get more than 13 ac on it. The SCHW gloves themselves have bad ac.. so instead of getting one more slot full of yummy ac &amp; stats I get two slots adding up to the same ac as the cobalt ones and a hp boinus that's not really worth the trouble yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reminding me about Sebilis, actually I have the key and my guild is going to raid it soon, and who knows I might be able to go and camp it sometime..</div></div><hr />

SV FIRE: +4  SV COLD: +4) drops in CT at planks.  The mobs are roughly on par with stuff you'd find in PoD CY.  Good exp there up through lvl 60 as well.</div></div><hr />
