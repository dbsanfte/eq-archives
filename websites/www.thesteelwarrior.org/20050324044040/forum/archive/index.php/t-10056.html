I agree that MPG trial needed to be tuned to reflect the loot it has, but the dramastic patch like this really makes no sense.<br />
<br />
I heared TR big CR in tactic trial. My guild which beats Ture and KtH get wiped pretty fast in new body trial and face a SUPER REGEN boss in Realm. Aracane is another story which boss hp gets tuned a lot too.<br />
<br />
Does anyone try power or mind? I guess MPG trial now is nothing worth to do if your guild is already CoA-enable. Maybe SoE want to push other guilds to Tacvi, but such a change only pushes ppl to WoW or EQ2. /shrug</div></div><hr />

-Foresight, ummmm way too hard now<br />
-Hatred, well all the ADDS RUSH you now<br />
-Adapatation, well ae rampage hits for max/and has insane reg now in one form<br />
-Endurance, heard they do double damage now?<br />
-Specialization named, takes half the damage now<br />
-Corruption i think has no changes<br />
<br />
how bullshit is that.. my guild just got into anguish 2-3 months ago.... loss about 20-30 members to EQ2/WOW/etc, had to recruit, WHICH of course isnt easy to do, and regear, reflag.. we beat 4 trials in one day, with a ton of recruits. Then go back after the changes, and find out, 2 are super dam hard now. How bull crap is that? Such a kick in the ass.<br />
<br />
What do they want us to do?Regear?Go back to Tacvi? Not like that zone easy at all. <br />
<br />
So if sony wants to be smart, heres changes:<br />
RS king/queen - 3 loot each<br />
Tacvi, well its on par with PG loot now....so should be similar in dificulty yes? And make final mob there drop 300 300 + loot as good as anguish.<br />
PG trials, their beatable i think but still.. geez.....like you wasted a few hrs of peoples time, trying these trials, stealth nerf...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually raised this issue, particualry the double whammy of the recent attrition coupled with the changes, and they're keeping a pretty close eye on the recent retuning.   <br />
<br />
You've gotta understand how this unfolded.  Essentially, the first group of guilds who got through them, got through fairly quickly, some (not all) using several exploits to do so (particularly on Hate and Foresight).   Some of the trials were indeed a little on the easy side *for guilds at that time* and that's the feedback/monitoring that came through that prompted the changes that have been forthcoming for a couple months.    <br />
<br />
The game's changed a bit since then, particularly guild dynamics due to the recent attrition, and thus a lot of the stuff that was valid 2-3 months ago, when the feedback started coming in, assuming 54 man raids with solid gear, etc, are no longer the modus operandi, and thus the changes may impact things too much in today's EQ.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the designer responsible for these trials is extremely responsive, and ABSOLUTELY listens to player feedback about the tuning of the events, so... when posting your experiences in here regarding the changes, I'll get them into his hands, but you MUST be as descriptive as possible, without injecting &quot;Stupid SOE&quot; snide little comments.   Give the facts, dont' pepper them with cynicism or criticism, they were tuned according to the feedback that was provided at a time when the dynamics of EQ were a lot different than they are today, but they're fully aware of this, and are keeping a close eye on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so that is a question. How could we explain the detail without spoiling the whole event ? Do you want us to describe the event to ruin the funny of others willing to try?<br />
<br />
Headboss has already pointed out the most problems the events get.<br />
<br />
Just one more thing to add-on<br />
the stupid AE rampage boss in Realm got uber regen which gets 8% hp recover once the boss changes into this form and the boss gets insane rampage rate now<br />
<br />
My guild down the Realm boss to 20% then the boss keeps about 20%~30% for about 5 min because the fast transform and SUPER regen</div></div><hr />

=<br />
<br />
You can expect them to get it right in a few months time or so. So tough luck if you didnt make it to Anguish before this patch :p<br />
<br />
Ok that was slightly cynical I guess. I just dont understand why ALL raids must be extreme challenges.. why cant there be a few ones here and there that you can just cruise through and chill out on? If I were still playing that is something I would want. Them (apparently) turning every single worthwhile raid that exists into a tactical challenge isnt exactly something that makes me want to return to EQ, especially when we already beat them many times before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Noticed Tactics is alot harder to do now that lev does not dodge the floor emotes.

<br />
What did they do to Arcana HP, Increase or Decrease?<br />
<br />
We had a guild on our server who would beat tactics by going high up on a wall and just nuking from range. Immune to the emotes, and no end boss, you just nuke the podium mobs down with zero risk, zero skill, and zero effort.<br />
<br />
If nerfing that obvious exploit was the only change, you have absolutely no grounds for complaint. Hiding up on a wall was quite obviously cheating. That event isn't too hard in the first place assuming the entire raid pays attention. Middle ground? There's no need for middle ground - it's cheat or don't cheat.<br />
<br />
Adaptation has always been a poorly designed crapshoot. If you get lucky and avoid getting the fire mob, you're golden.<br />
<br />
Specialisation has always been gimp, with zero need to 'specialise'. If the changes necessitate changing spells or weapons, then it'll be a more taxing fight, but still doable.<br />
<br />
Hatred was hard enough initially. Training off down the ramp was already very difficult to accomplish, even if it wasn't an intended strat. It certainly wasn't cheating like the 'sit high on wall' strat. The changes definitely seem to make for a more 'controllable' event, although they do necessitate a greater number of tanks/addtanks with will be a problem for today's depleted guild rosters.<br />
<br />
Endurance was boring once you figured it out, but still required a decent tank turnout, and probably should've been left as-is. If, as indicated, the Ancients have double the dps, that's a step too far IMO.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm already in Anguish, and no, I haven't experienced most of these changes first hand, but if people are complaining about 'Simon Says' because a blatent exploit has been fixed and one of the easier trials is 'too hard' to do legit, then I have to base my impressions on their comments about the other trials upon that.<br />
<br />
If you couldn't do Simon Says without exploiting the z-axis, then you wouldn't stand a hope in hell of doing Ture.</div></div><hr />

That got fixed.<br />
<br />
Those AE's going off without warning, sometimes five times in the space of a second... that's a bug.</div></div><hr />

Same on ours, which is why I am glad it is fixed.<br />

That event isn't too hard in the first place assuming the entire raid pays attention. Middle ground? There's no need for middle ground - it's cheat or don't cheat.<br />
No it's not the only change, you didn't read my post.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm already in Anguish, and no, I haven't experienced most of these changes first hand<br />
<br />
Right then, go try the trials and get back to me.<br />
<br />
If you couldn't do Simon Says without exploiting the z-axis, then you wouldn't stand a hope in hell of doing Ture.<br />
<br />
For clarification my guild has never used the exploit, since it was fixed I was saying what was done, my problem is while learning this encounter it has been revamped to an uneeded difficulty. An correct me if i'm wrong but Ture has no emotes like Simon Says, so unless your suggesting that Lev avoids his melee by some amazing coinsidence, how does that relate to anything? Yeah we couldn't do Ture, when you we're in Qvic could you of?<br />
<br />
If you got a problem with me specifically you can PM me over it Demorgoth, I'm done responding to your jabs under my posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT bullshit nerfs, why not warn us in the patch? Why waste 50ish peoples time to do a trial thats almost unbeatable? What they expect us in foresight? Bring in 10 rogues? With all tacvi daggers? Also don't they know that a ton of high end guilds, just loss massive players. And I'm pretty sure most players are dam sick of reflagging, recruiting and regearing. Now the so called top end players, have to waste more time to regear people? Kinda of disappointing.<br />
<br />
Hatred's change is fine, Don't see a problem in it, but adaptations is full of crap. Specialization ? Geez, full qvic isnt enough, and u need to farm txe/inku over and over? That is crap.. what you need 6 CH rotation + grp CHer in every grp? Wasting peoples time seriously. People got into anguish early that is fine. Hell my guild got in it pretty dam early. Till EQ2/WOW crap came out, sure, shit happens, reflag, rebuild, regear.. then this?  Pretty sure EQ isn't about gear, its about skill/tactics and class numbers/balances, Guessing its about gear now.<br />
<br />
Also have to remember, even thou old PG trials were kinda of easy. How easy? For guilds who farmed plane of time for months? Farmed qvic armor for hrs and hrs.. did Inku over and over? That is more then fair and sufficient time to get into anguish or whatever. Too fast? EQ is in its last year.</div></div><hr />

Corruption is a good example of a raid that at first seemed extremely hard, but is extremely easy once you have it mastered. Does that mean it should be changed? Imo no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm I dont recall AoW, King Tormax, Yelinak etc changing all the time. And I'm pretty sure we have 50 kills on some of those ;p<br />
<br />
And btw Bardeil.. I'm not asking for anything on a silver platter, my point is just that there used to be 2 types of encounters in EQ, A)Challenges and B)Easy loot mobs. To use an example from the old days, AoW=Challenge, King Tormax=Easy loot. But the EQ design today seems to dictate that all high-end encounters must fall under category A). <br />
<br />
IMO a certain number of category B) encounters is needed to keep the DKP-wheel rolling in the raiding guilds. Because lets face it, no matter how much bullshit people feed you about how they &quot;play for the challenge&quot;(I get sick everytime I read that bs on Cestus D's frontpage :p) I'm willing to bet there is equally many whose primary reason for playing is character-building(aka l3wt). Why else would magelo be so popular?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I can't really speak for MPG raid trials because my guild is far short of them, but from what I can tell, for instance in elemental plains, fire and water mini's are easy loot, and the gods are a challenge. Not many people expect to farm gods for loot, although it's significantly better.<br />
<br />
AOW loot is much better than tormax loot. It seems to me that Qvic is the easy loot farming area of GoD, maybe inktuta as well. <br />
<br />
It seems to me as if MPG trials are meant to be a flagging bottleneck, not a loot farming area.  The fact that they are pretty good loot is just a bonus, but it seems thoroughly unreasonable that guilds able to farm them (were/are) able to use their anguish flagging raids to gear up apps, while the rest of us have to gear up our apps on non-progression targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me as if MPG trials are meant to be a flagging bottleneck<br />
This is true, but remember there are 6 MPG trials. Before the changes the MPG Hate trial was in reality the bottleneck that most guilds were stuck on. So the difficiculty of the 5 other MPG trials were more or less irrelevant with regards to actually obtaining Anguish access.<br />
<br />
I do however of course agree that they should fix the obvious bugs like standing on ledge on tactics trial would make you oor of the kyv arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apostate</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find hatred quite a bit easier than when we first did it with pure offtanking. It is much easier to do it that way now. We beat the new one on our first try.<br />
<br />
I need to try adaptation more, but I think it's less random. Think it might be a little harder overall, but the forms are more even with one another, making it much more consistent imo.<br />
<br />
Corruption I felt was one of the easiest trials, in that even it had a very short period to learn it- mitigation I think would be fair.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried foresight, but to be honest the first time we tried it we WERE dodging the floor emotes... that did nothing. Being able to keep all your melee right on the dragorns except for kyv arrows made it a really easy trial, I can't even imagine leving up the wall to exploit it.:o I don't think fixing that would be a big deal, though need to try it and see.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried Arcana or Body since patch since patch, probably won't get around to it till after we kill Arch Magus at least.</div></div><hr />

Never said they did. What I said was. I would like event to change not exactly become harder but to change as they should. If you have kill a mob 50 times using the same strat you think at some point he would catch on and change how he does business eh?=).<br />
<br />
I didn't say they did change but I think would add something to the game for old mobs to rescript their events to make them a bit more enjoyable to do for the 60th time. When you know what exactly will happen every time it is much less fun to me I know when I go kill Emperor which mobs need be mezzed which need tanks and all that just so simple now. <br />
<br />
Guilds now have no trouble with events that use to be tough since they know everything that will happen cause they have been fed the strats. Just my opinion like it or hate it somthing I would like to see implemented.</div></div><hr />

Granted, all applicants would be dead halfway through and you'd be trying to finish the trial with 4 groups or so, but it was still easy as hell.  Foresight was nothing but a DPS fest.

Adaptation and Hatred were the ONLY ones that required alot of attention.  Hatred, despite being harder, overall, was easier to do with low numbers than Adaptation.  I seem to recall doing Hatred with 35, and that turnout couldn't find the dps for Adaptation at all.<br />
<br />
With the upgrades, none of the trials are really possible to sleep through, especially for any guild that cannot still field 50, and very few are the guilds that can, from what I see with &quot;Now Recruiting&quot; signs on every guild's welcome mat on the internet.</div></div><hr />

Issu learn how to fucking read thank you. None of what you quoted me saying had anything to do with your little rant. I never ever uttered a word about wether or not the new raids are doable or not. All I have posted is my OPINION that there should be variation in the difficulty of the raids. If I was responsible for the MPG trial design I would have 3 of them be hard(progression wise, to keep suck-ass guilds out of anguish) and 3 of them be more moderate and farmable(so we have something to do when we are tired of Anguish raids and just want to chill and score some easy loot). The 3 hard ones would be plenty to lock out un-worthy guilds of Anguish. If you dont agree with that fine, I could care less. There are obviously many different arguments you could make about why it should be this or that way. In the end only one persons opinion matter anyway, and thats the designer of the MPG raids.</div></div><hr />

I've only tried two of the new trials (Endurance and Foresight).<br />
<br />
Most guilds that were recruiting and re-flagging / farming signets now will be unable to beat the majority of these trials. That means every night you are either forced to go back to Qvic and Inktu / Txevu to try to re-gear, or, you keep losing night after night to these trials. <br />
<br />
Now in all honesty, both of those options are not what I call awesome fun.<br />
<br />
Basically, it all comes down to guilds now not being able to recieve kewl new phat lewtz, which means they get bored, which means &quot;hey, how about those new games?&quot;<br />
<br />
If SOE does not fix this FAST, EQ is going to sink fast as far as high end guild / raiding goes.</div></div><hr />

Especially those who haven't even tried the new versions yet but know they are teh eazy!<br />
<br />
So now you need to have a force that is mostly Anguish geared to beat the Trials, well thanks. What is wrong with leaving hard enough alone? Were guilds that were struggling to beat ele or time gods crushing all of the Trials to gain Anguish access? No? Then what problem were you trying to solve by &quot;fixing&quot; all of the trials, Mr. Dev.?<br />
<br />
Yes by all means fix the Simon Sez (Tactics/Foresight) trial so that people can't just avoid the emotes and the ensuing damage (oh and now fix it again so that the new bugged-out un-announced chain AEs don't nuke you to hell  :rolleyes: ). But making them harder only screws your loyal EQ players who play in guilds that got hit by people leaving in droves for WoW.<br />
<br />
As for my guild, we had our last 2 trials figured out and were 1-2 nights of 50+ people away from beating them when WoW struck and prevented that from happening. Since then we have been scraping back and were ready to start beating and reflagging these again, until now when they are nerfed to hell. We are being punished severely for simply not finishing these earlier, and it sucks. In their current form they are unbeatable to us and will be for a long time yet, which will most likely cause more people to leave, preventing us from ever getting there.<br />
<br />
So thanks for destroying us, and probably many other guilds like us. And grats again to you guilds who beat them early and farmed Anguish oftten...well hey I guess you benefit again as a few people from each of the guilds destroyed by this &quot;fix&quot; will probably stick it out in EQ and apply to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no, my guild hasn't done them for months due to lack of people.  Outside of Anguish MPG had the best loot (though Queen/King items have better resists, but generally inferior in other stat combination).  It's not supposed to be easy.  Now there's a problem if they are impossible, but then everyone labels everything as impossible if you don't beat it on first try.</div></div><hr />

What I want to emphansize is not the changing of the MPG trial but the over-tuned of that trial. We have no problem with that since we can reflag our member easily with CoA name loot.

<br />
The only problem I have is the changing of these encounters right after eq2/wow dropped. It may have been prior however we were all anguish flagged and everything was dandy. So we wernt messing with mpg raids anymore.<br />
<br />
The dilema I face now is the fact I have roughly 30 flagged members still in guild. Raid flagging people for ture over and over doesnt seem likely since hes a 5 day repop. So Im gonna have to go through mpg again. And apparently relearn encounters that may be all around broken. Just a bad time to do this imo.<br />

If its still doable then hey...well have to relearn it. Just hope its not broken all to hell like some people indicate.</div></div><hr />

The point is that you need enough people surviving so you don't have 5 million emotes on one person and then count on him avoiding them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah true Phantron, but if 1 person is on thier toes and paying enough attention to be dodging all emotes then surely they are doing the trial as it is meant to be done, an undogable emote is sorta like saying &quot;No matter how good you are, eventually you'll die in this trial&quot;<br />
<br />
Overlap yes, I have no problems with a Move then a duck then a move to the south side, this type really tests if your raid is paying attention, but an emote by which doing the correct action of 1 leads to an incorrect action for the other shouldn't be there imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem with that is then it is conceievable one person can win this trial, especially if the Kyvs still despawn after a certain number of emotes.<br />
<br />
One 7K arrow shouldn't kill you for the level of gear you're expected to have to win this trial.  From a probablistic point of view the chance of getting a move/stop combo is 1/9, so unless you're having a really bad day, this shouldn't be the sole cause of your death.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-25-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They simply go away after a certain number of emotes.  They despawn one by one until there was none left at around 15 minutes left to go for the trial.  This is pre-tune though.  I think they figure if you can dodge the arrows for that long they'll cut you break.  The other emotes do increase to make up for the missing Kyvs, so you'll have Dragorn using Flashfire nonstop (the emote that you've to interupt via damage) and room emote going off every 2 seconds.  Now that room emotes are fixed I'm not sure if that's any easier than just dealing with the arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Headboss</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if emotes go away after a certain amount of time, can't you just camp a cleric or LD one, and log it in after the emotes stop firing off?

So if you're in a position where the arrows can't hit you, you never get any toward that limit.  Someone somewhere has to either dodge or get hit by all those arrow emotes before they go away.<br />
<br />
So like I said, it's not really that helpful, because if you can dodge/take that many arrows, you should've won already.  Besides, once the arrows go away they just get replaced by room emotes instead, and those work now unlike before.</div></div><hr />

It was borderline- the aggro range of the pups seemed a mistake that wasn't a big deal in and of itself unless you kited or trained them. I don't really fault people for using it, since it was far and away the hardest event in trying to do it in the intended way, but we beat it with offtanking and never once trained/kited, and beat it in pretty much the same way post-patch (and was easier).</div></div><hr />

Expecially when they can flag new members without redoing the trials. But then again, its been pretty obvious thru-out the course of history of EQ that the highest end of raiding was always designed for only the top guild per server. Because as soon they beat an event or cracked their way into a new zone, it was made harder for the rest of the guilds trying to compete. So they can say to make it harder, and being top end makes their voices carry more (and many of those top end being developers) so now its even harder to get to top end for guilds not there and the guilds that made it can cement themselves into that position.<br />
<br />
For us, it was a two part problem of banging our heads against Intk and PG trials on top of new games EQ2/WoW that crippled us. The only other course of action for the guild to survive is to take a step back, recruit, refarm time/qvic/ikkinz/intk and after a few months lose more member from rebashing our heads against newly tuned PG trials and Intk. Rinse, repeat, and maybe eventually beat em all.<br />
<br />
You can't expect people from the top end guilds to give a crap while they still able to benifit from being the top recruiting guild and recruiting people from all the other guilds that eventaully get tired of the refarming and rebashing. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have logs of the trash on Endurance (and SK from guild who tanked them all said that they were not beefed up), but I have logs of tanking Ansdaicher the Ancient boss. I parsed him at 1000dps, max hit of 2459 (14%shielding). This was over the 5:11 that I was alive and I used evasive. I parsed the other MOB at about 1000DPS as well, but it was closer to 800 on one of our best tanks who tanked for ~4 minutes before a newer member had to take over (who definitely had less hp/ac then the first tank). He was putting out 1.66 hits per second, even while slowed (or so the shaman told me). <br />
<br />
Guild leader tanked it last time we won and took 714k damage over the course of the entire fight (15ish minutes), and I took nearly half of that (312k) in just 5 minutes. If I had survived the entire fight I would have taken at least 200k more damage then my guild leader took when he tanked them, granted he does have 150ish more AC, but still that parse has me taking about 130% of the damage he took.<br />
<br />
Too bad I don't have the exact parses from the first run to see what the mobs old HPS was, but he was definitely spamming me with hits/misses this time through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are those max hits with DI 19 and % shielding?  Keep in mind there are lots of ways to increase a mob's DPS without upping the max hit or changing the DI/DB.</div></div><hr />

Where you get this info? Or just speculation?</div></div><hr />

It's currently fixed on test, and will be pushed live soon.<br />
<br />
Mentioned that earlier in this thread, though.</div></div><hr />
