Game Makers to Try Pay-as-You-Go Model<br />
By David Colker<br />
Times Staff Writer<br />
<br />
May 14, 2004<br />
<br />
Computer game designer Jeff Strain describes his latest creation as a fantastical online world of castles, monsters, swords and magic spells that players explore and experience bit by bit.<br />
<br />
That's also how Strain wants players to pay for &quot;Guild Wars,&quot; one of a new breed of pay-as-you-go video games that publishers hope will keep revenue rolling in long after a title's initial sale.<br />
<br />
After &quot;Guild Wars&quot; debuts later this year, Strain's ArenaNet Inc. will offer new levels that players can pay to download.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you purchase a chapter, you can play it online as long as you want,&quot; said Strain, who declined to say how much chapters would cost. &quot;Then every six months, we'll offer a new chapter that's a whole new experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
The $11-billion video game industry has long puzzled over how to squeeze more money out of players over a longer period. Much like how movie producers relied primarily on box-office receipts before videotapes and DVDs, video game publishers make virtually all their money from initial retail sales.<br />
<br />
Online games such as Sony Corp.'s &quot;EverQuest&quot; and Microsoft Corp.'s &quot;Asheron's Call&quot; charge players by the month, but the audience for such titles is limited to several hundred thousand die-hard fans.<br />
<br />
At this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, publishers big and small buzzed about how the proliferation of game consoles and PCs with high-speed Internet connections opened up new opportunities for selling extras such as additional levels and exotic digital weaponry.<br />
<br />
A video game can cost $4 million to $8 million and take two to three years to develop. Titles sell for an average of $50.<br />
<br />
Once a game is designed, add-ons are relatively cheap.<br />
<br />
&quot;A new level of the game might cost only $200,000,&quot; said P.J. McNealy, who tracks the video game industry for American Technology Research in San Francisco. So if 1 million people buy a game when it's released and a publisher can sell a &quot;new level for $10 to only 10% of those who own the game, that's an extra $1 million revenue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kazuo Hirai, president of Sony's U.S. video game division, said the company planned to sell digital add-ons to games played on its PlayStation consoles.<br />
<br />
&quot;We view a future where mini-transactions are the norm,&quot; Hirai said.<br />
<br />
Sony will start selling add-ons — such as weapons for an adventure character or a souped-up car for a racing game — next year, said Andrew House, executive vice president of Sony Computer Entertainment America.<br />
<br />
Some of the add-ons will be items normally earned by long hours of play; novice players could pay to equip themselves with the same gear as more experienced competitors.<br />
<br />
The inspiration for the Sony initiative, said House, came from participants in online subscription games who sell virtual goodies they've earned in the game on EBay Inc.'s auction site, sometimes for thousands of dollars.<br />
<br />
&quot;It showed that the customer was willing to pay for online, downloadable content,&quot; House said.<br />
<br />
Mini-transaction payments might not come directly from consumers. &quot;It could be a promotion that uses a code in a bottle cap or comes with a Happy Meal,&quot; said analyst Richard Doherty of Envisioneering Group, a technology consulting firm in New York. &quot;There are all kinds of ways to extend the revenue rather than, 'Just buy the disc and we never hear from you again.' &quot;<br />
<br />
Downloads are by far the cheapest way to deliver add-ons. Before its initiative kicks off, Sony is trying to entice its players to get online via their consoles by packaging a high-speed modem free with PlayStation 2.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a strategic advantage to get those adaptors out there,&quot; House said.<br />
<br />
By the end of the year, Sony executives said, more than 100 of the company's titles will have an online component.<br />
<br />
For third-party PlayStation games, House said Sony might help publishers sell add-ons. &quot;We could do some of the heavy lifting for them — billing, the actual downloading — and the revenue from it would be shared,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
In private meetings at the games expo, Electronic Arts Inc. hinted that it, too, would offer downloadable add-ons for some of its most popular games. EA is the world's largest independent game publisher.<br />
<br />
Analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan Securities said the strategy was mentioned by EA's chief financial officer, Warren Jenson, when talking about the &quot;NCAA Football&quot; game. &quot;He said that if you were playing as Notre Dame against USC, maybe for a buck you could wear the green jerseys.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a reference to a famed 1977 game in which Notre Dame switched to green uniforms and beat favored USC.<br />
<br />
Chip Lange, head of marketing for EA's online games, said the company had been giving free development kits to online players so they could create their own levels.<br />
<br />
EA also is considering using its in-house development staff to create levels it can sell. But the company has to be careful not to anger current players.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can invest to make a new entertainment experience for the players, but only if the online community around a game sees value in it,&quot; Lange said. &quot;We will not just gouge them for dollars.&quot;<br />
<br />
Many in the industry will be watching &quot;Guild Wars,&quot; which is the first title from Strain's Seattle-based ArenaNet.<br />
<br />
Previous episodic games caused little stir, but Strain said his experience working on the popular strategy game &quot;StarCraft&quot; convinced him that the strategy was worth trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;We would release 'StarCraft' and then later offer an expansion pack,&quot; he said. &quot;The overwhelming majority of those who bought the pack didn't play the original anymore.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I knew there was a catch to such a charming game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cazzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so basiclly i can give SoE a few hundred bucks and be full god geared and have the best weapons? so win irl....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the intent is more for first person type games (think half life etc) but mayhap I read it wrong.  I'd doubt that a MMORG would work very well with purchaseable items....heh any better than EQ does now with Ebay  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you think you can pay $500 for a Raex set or a Vadd set or whatever the current uber item is, it's not going to work that way.  This isn't even about players whining how buying for virtual property is messed up.  MMORPG have been out for a long time.  If this is such a great idea someone else would've done it already.  Look at the MMORPG that has failed.  I don't know what they are but I'm sure there's a lot more of them than the ones that are doing well.  Did those guys start selling uber items to salvage their game?  No.  Because it just doesn't work.  When you start selling uber status you run into problem with lawsuits.  I remember someone sued a MMORPG in China when some account hacking or something cost the guy to lose something he bought on the order of thousands, and that was from an EBay source.  Now imagine if you pay $5000 to SoE for an instant EQRanking #1 warrior out of a box character, and then something screwed up and the character's gone.  Or what about you bought this super uber warrior from SoE and then everyone says you're dumb for buying it, and then you can sue SoE for fraud because the character you buy is not really playable because no one wants to play with you.  There's just too much SoE can be held liable if they start selling high end stuff.  There's no way they'll take the risk of being sued for millions of emotional damage (and seeing the way some people feel about selling uber things, I wouldn't be surprised whoever bought one of those will suffer some kind of emotional damage) because someone got made fun of them for buying from SoE.  Selling uber status has absolutely nothing to do with the status of the game.  If it can be proved that selling uber status is profitable in the long run, you bet every MMORPG will be selling uber status overnight.  You think your fan loyalty or vision or whatever means anything to anyone if by ditching you they get more money in the long run?  The reason why no one does it is because no one wants to risk the backlash which makes selling uber status unprofitable in the long run.<br />
<br />
Now selling stuff like the leg-up thing in UO, that's certainly possible.  I can see items like the Fabled whatever being sold too.  I imagine anything like name change, server move, and so on can be sellable.  Things that are cool to have but do not really affect the integrity of the game (as much as people complain about moving with gear I've yet to see a guild paratroop to another server and ruin another server in some irrevocable ways).  <br />
<br />
And as for the whole pay as you play thing, don't count on it working.  It's the same thing as what everyone who tried to make a fortune in China said.  If just 0.1% of the 1 billion Chinese buy one of my widgets, I'll be stupiidly rich.  At some point it's going to cost you $200,000 to develop a new widget and you won't even get 10% of people who wants to buy a widget and you will lose money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I personally disagree. There are tons of games that I beat, beat the expansion, and just don't want to start again to play through. If they offered these mini-expansions on a regular basis, they could add a TON of life on to the game. Yes, at some point people will stop paying for them and move on. So what? They'll discontinue making them after they are below some minimum for profit. It happens, nothing lasts forever. If the game is good, the company will have made plenty of money to justify continuing this program on other games. I predict success for good games and failure for bad games (just like now). <br />
<br />
You pay on online fee for EQ, why wouldn't you pay for OWNING additions to a game you enjoy? It's buying rather than renting entertainment. You can stop buying at any time and enjoy what you already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The development cost of anything in game is expensive.  Like the example says, it might take $200,000 to build a new level, and while the developers would LIKE to believe that 10% is willing to pay $10 for it, this is merely wishful thinking.  You also overlook the fact that paying for content by no means guaranteeds anything about the quality of content.  Let's use EQ, with 400K subscribers and a game people are probably most willing to pay for new content (just look at how many expansions everyone have).  A new zone that cost $200,000 would require 5% of the population to buy it at $10 to be profitable.  Sounds really easy, right?  So how come it hasn't been done yet?  First, you have to consider all the whiners that will complain SoE is greedy and possibly leave.  While I believe this number is small it's certainly not 0.  Second, the zone you make has to be really incredible to justify paying $10 for it.  If not you could have people who feel they're ripped off and stop playing EQ altogether because they bought your $10 level.  Losing even a month of EQ's monthly fee more than offsets the $10 you make, resulting in a net loss.<br />
<br />
People do remember if they bought something that wasn't as good as expected.  EQ's expansions can get away with this in some way because it's sort of a peer pressure thing, especially for raiding guilds (you don't have this expansion?  Then you can't be with your friends!), but no way people will put up buying an optional zone only to find it being a waste of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I imagine the real interesting problem would be something akin to &quot;intellectual property rights&quot; Once you pay for these levels and these weapons, who really owns them? How do you enforce that? What happens to people that resell the things they've bought for real life cash, at a lower price than what the company is offering, just to make a quick buck after they've discovered they don't enjoy the game anymore? Yes, that happens now, but if you primarily design your game around the concept of online buying certain level stuff, that opens a new can of worms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The development cost of anything in game is expensive. <br />
<br />
Not really.  Most of the cost goes into building the base infrastructure and framework (object model, data model, logical architecture, business logic framework, server structure, server logic level, transport structure etc all) which consitutes an initial investment.  To incrementally add onto this structure is not nearly as expensive...hence add-on modules are much higher margin than the initial investment.<br />
<br />
Now EQ has re-done this base infrastructure a number of times...I'd imagine they'd like to find a business model that gets them to a &quot;steady state&quot;.</div></div><hr />

  Here's the key: Guild Wars does NOT have a monthly fee. You only pay for what you want, and you keep it once you've bought it. No obligation to keep buying, but you can keep playing. You could just buy the original game and play that indefinitely. Why is that good? Because you don't HAVE to spend more money; you already own the game. This isn't like EQ, where you buy the game, buy the expansions, and THEN have to pay a monthly fee on top of it all. This isn't NOT EQ's business model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems nice and all really, but if you join any semi-decent guild, you'll be putting down money on a new expansion to get the gear/goods/etc.<br />
<br />
Not like it matters to me, I liked Guild Wars and I plan on buying it on release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I bought LoY for my killer dye job and increased bank space .. only been in zones for 1 hour total.  Figured that is all I would get for my $30 investment.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5393<br />
<br />
At that link, caster realm states that EQ is giving away the expansions for free, if you get a 1 year subscription.  So I believe that making the expansions isn't that expensive, but great profit margin on them.  <br />
<br />
Be interesting if they will sell actual weapons/armour ingame.  To me if they sell any non content items, it will be added utility, like added bank space etc.  Maybe pay to have a serverside bazaar mule??</div></div><hr />

spent a grand total of 15 minutes in the zone.</div></div><hr />

Hi, Im 15years old and this game seamed cool.Lots of people running around with cool swords and armor.But then I found out I have to pay my months allowance just to get one sword.This sucks<br />
Hi, Im 27 and a successful professional. I just took my spare change and loaded out this toon. I log on once in a while in my busy schedule to show off my virtual e-d***.<br />
<br />
Yeah, will go real far.EQ worked because regardless your RL status, you were you in EQ.Your time invested = what you got.Of course PA(Ebay) changed that to an extent,but on the whole its time= reward,not money = reward.<br />
<br />
I may be wrong but thats my opinion</div></div><hr />
