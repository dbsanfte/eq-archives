<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Ive played my shaman for a long time and it finally got boring.  Then I switched to my Barb warrior and played him untill about lvl 50 when they started comming out with the Discs.  That got frustrating in the extreme. I never really knew my role..Was I DPS, was my strength not high enough..I rarely seemed to land crits and so on.  Then I switched to my SK, and he is fun, but the only reason I play him is to have a tank with FD.  Now Im going back to the Warrior, I guess its what I really want to play the most anyways.  Here is my question.  My warrior is a barbarian and I really hate the way that damn kilt looks so Im gonna start another one.  I cant narrow down the race I want to play though or which god is the best to choose as far as armor goes.  I like the Troll for his regen, but I also like the Ogre for his Stamina and Strength and stun resistence..If you had to start a new tank, what race would you choose and what Diety would you get. Its damn frustrating to find good armor only to discover you can use it due to the diety restrictions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Sir, it's not how the kilt looks, it's what's under it that counts!<br />
<br />
If your Barbarian worships Rallos Zek or the Tribunal, you are fine. No need to re roll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
personally i'd pick Dark Elf mainly because im a girl and i think they look cute but i guess for a male maybe an ogre or troll hehe?<br />
Rallos Zek :) of course or Cazic Thule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ubercheerio</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on what you like in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Its a debatable topic, but i feel Ogres make the best warriors because of the ability to resist frontal stuns, they also have uber STR and sta which will help you get to the end game a bit easier.  Along with that cool stuff the ogres have an XP penalty.  Sucks.<br />
<br />
I play a female barbarian, and i'm not bothered by the kilt at all, just the helms.  You either get a horny helm or a chain mullet, they're both annoying.  Eventually i'll LDoN and get one of the cool graphic ones.<br />
<br />
If you want something a little different, i'd go Gnome.  I was originally going to make a gnome warrior but i wanted to have slam, so the gnome was a no go.  A gnome tanking a giant would look awesome, but i dont think you're too fond of them =P.<br />
<br />
Thats just my take on it.  Go with what you'll have fun with and dont think twice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well female barb warriors is fairly rare. Female troll even rarer. If you do go ogre--who for a long time had the best RP--make sure you raise agi to at least 75 or your AC will be hammered. <br />
<br />
As for best--while there are some aguments to be made for the slamming races--in the end they are all viable and eventually indistinguesable. I would strongly recomend you make your choice on the basis of what looks the most fun.<br />
<br />
Strenght is nearly pointless in a warrior. Stm is good, but most warrior gear has it--its not a very hard stat to raise. Pre 50, stamina does not even have that large an effect on HP. If you are planning to go end game I would say put as many points as you can stand into CHR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are re-rolling a Barb for an ogre or troll because of looks?!? :eek: <br />
<br />
All I can say is you have no taste  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually no..that was one small factor.  Appearence is one, albiet a small one, and since Im the one playing him/her It would make sense that I like the way the toon looks.  Taste is relative, and have a complete stranger tell me I have no taste is just retarded.  Second, the diety, while I like the helanic tundra serries, some of the rallos zek armor is cheap and easy to come by...Third, race..Ogre, stun resistence is awsome, but the down side is the exp smack.  <br />
     Mostly however, I wouldnt dream of telling anyone how to play theyre charactor...  If Im going to invest time in a &quot;game&quot; then I want to enjoy it, same goes for anyone else.  Im not a huge fan of DE's, but if someone wanted to play one because the look cool, who am I to judge.  By your post, I can see that nothing constructive can come from you in the least.  Welcome to my ignore list..Your the first in over three years..Congratz tard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh I cant even ignore you due to the Admin/moderator position.  But I find it hard to believe your  a moderater yet berate someone for wanting to make a new toon due to the fact they didnt like the race?  I was a bit heated when I made my last post, but I still stick to my guns on the race topic.. I would never berate a person due they're wanting to change races and reroll a new toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalos Nathsar</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure he is joking with you Kahzul... you know, over the fact that ogres and trolls are typically uglier than barbarians. Its probably nothing personal.<br />
<br />
I have a barbarian warrior (tribunal) currently, and though the kilt does become the center of many jokes, I wouldn't change race for anything. Helanic Tundra was the cheapest of almost all crafted armour and  presents the 'best' warrior stats out of all crafted as well (high ac, sta, hp). It was wonderful to have slam as well leveling up, and saved us from many a gating mob. <br />
<br />
I have honestly thought about a WE warrior, just because I love the look of them and the whole RP aspect. However, equivilent gear would be harder to find to replace Helanic Tundra, and he probably wouldn't be as effective as my barbarian. <br />
<br />
My opinion? Keep your barb as long as they whorship Trib or RZ, and make up for the kilt by the size of your, uh, hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I feel like a total ape for slamming him like that and I salute you as I pull my foot from my mouth.  Im on edge here in Okinawa and we wont have cable internet for another two weeks and its been a month..can you tell Im going crazy..Anyways, sorry about the outburst Brutal...feel free to kick me in the minerals. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other quick note, is there any way to tell if a mob is getting ready to gate?..usually I just see em vanish and then the O-shits kick in..Specially in the Sshrea temple..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess I took Bruutal the right way, as I though what was saying was funny.<br />
<br />
I can feel for ya on the Cable thing.<br />
<br />
If you mean other that the low health and spell casting on the gate? Nope. But you can't really expcet warriors to deal with that. I would very much see that as a caster responcibility--as they can stun on demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalos Nathsar</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure that a message comes up like: &quot;*mob* begins casting a gate spell!&quot;, and that is when I usually slam away (it is quite hard to see sometimes in battle spam though). Either that, or anytime they are below 30% and begin casting a spell. I always make sure I have slam up for the last part of the fight, I hate CH's almost as much as I hate gates.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, my 51 tank is stripped down to nothing right now, but my cousin quit and dumped 300k on me..what a pall..he he..anyways..Im looking forward to decking him out so to speak..Again, sorry brutul, I acted pretty childish..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like my ogre warrior, he is not super twinked and being stunned all the time is irritating, made a new shaman and he is a barbarian, when i get stunned for the fifth time on the same yellowish mob i get pissed, fights are close enough without me standing there looking silly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if i rerolled?<br />
<br />
heh, actually i just did. i have *maybe* an hour a day tops to play anymore, so i twinked out a new war and just solo when i need my fix. rolled an ogre who worships RZ, here's my reasons:<br />
<br />
-frontal melee-based stun immunity<br />
-worshipping RZ lets you wear feirce heraldic cultural armor @ lvl 46+<br />
-high innate str and sta make it easier to cap those stats (especially for a player who doesn't have time to raid or camp much). leaves you with just dex and agi to focus on stat-wise. cha isn't a factor as i won't be needing di.<br />
-slam. don't need a sheild to stun mobs in the early game before kicks begin to stun them at lvl 55(?).<br />
<br />
that's mainly why i chose that combo. excellent for the low-mid-non-raiding 65 game...especially when i'm looking to mainly solo or just screw around with my extremely limited play time. if you're going to end up raiding a lot and playing a lot of the very high end game, things change a bit. you'll usually need gnome illusion to corner tank as an ogre which eats a buffslot. you're going to want to invest in a shrink clicky for just about ANY indoor situation. and with stalwart endurance AA, any other warrior race can build up a 70-80%(?) stun resistance from ANY side.<br />
<br />
definitely not the best race for everyone, but it's the best to meet my needs. my main is a 65/150ish aa dorf. for the shorties!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play an ogre warrior, it has its pros and cons:<br />
<br />
Pros:  <br />
- Frontal stun immunity.  I cannot praise this enough.  I played a troll SK for a while and holy hell I cannot see how anyone puts up with that garbage of constantly being stunned while tanking.  Trying to cast is even more frustrating.  But hey that's me.<br />
<br />
- Stats are decent for starting out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- The &quot;ogre screen shake&quot; that you get when you attack a mob makes me dizzy.  It is exaggerated compared to playing a smaller race. I tried a gnome warrior to pal around with some friends and it was just simply a joy to play.  I didnt have the earthquake effect going on all the time.  Lots of people dont even know this problem exists unless they have played many different sized melee classes.  Shrink doesnt completey negate the screen shake, I've found that it has more to do with your current model.  My screen still shakes a ton while triple shrunk ogre, but isnt nearly as bad when illusion gnomed.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Ogres are freaking HUGE.  If i look straight ahead while tanking, odds are I cannot even see my target, I have to look down to see the mob.  Cobalt bracer / illusion fixes all of these problems so the point is moot.<br />
<br />
- XP penalty for ogre.  Shrug.  I dont notice it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If I had it all to do over again, I would choose an ogre warrior with an insta cast clicky, permanent illusion gnome with no buff icon  :)  Seriously, I'd still pick ogre because I cannot deal with stuns all the time, but I dont play my ogre without being super shrunk or better yet, illusion gnome or dorf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now to just start evangelizing 3rd person view for warriors. Its a huge tactic advantage. You always know why someone agros something when they shouldn't. You can taunt/belllow behind you without turning around. You can see around corners for wehn you are trying to pull, in dungeons.<br />
<br />
And not crazy combat animations, like ogres or wolf form has, because you are scrolled back behind your character.<br />
<br />
I suggest you guy all at least try it for a few hours and see how it is for you. Simply go first person like normal, and zoom/scroll with your mouse back out behind yourself. Sometimes it can be a pain with the camera doing some goofy stuff and having to scroll the camera in a bit in tight quarters/low ceiling, but it is soooo worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beeafraid</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think, based on looks, the wood elf warrior looks the best.  The plate armor just looks the coolest to me.  Unfortunately, you get a big loss of stats to go with it.  Once you get to be lvl 65 with a hefty dose of AA, the loss of stats doesn't really matter.   You'll buff out to 305 stamina/strength, etc. regardless.  But until then, it will be harder to find groups and harder to get your HP up to respectible levels.<br />
<br />
If it's a female....well, I gotta go with the dark elf on that.  The flamed plate stuff looks real nice.  Wood elf and half elf are also nice to look at. <br />
<br />
If you want to go on what really counts... stats.... you pretty much should go with the Ogre.<br />
<br />
If you want the best of both worlds (good stats and good looks), stick with the Barbarian.  I didn't want to deal with the looks of the Ogre (vanity) so I went Barbarian, and would do it again in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
As far as diety, that's primarily a function of the race.  I am a barbarian and went with Tribunal.  If I had it to do over again, I'd have gone Rallos Zek.  The actual cultural armor is almost exactly the same for both... however, RZ armor is a little easier to come by in the bazaar (at least on my server).  This probably has something to do with the fact that Helanic Tundra armor can only be made by a barbarian smith.  I don't know if the same kind of race thing applies to RZ.  I wouldn't think so because barbarians can wear it too, but I don't know.  And because it's more plentiful, it's probably a little cheaper as well.<br />
<br />
Do not under any circumstances make an agnostic warrior.  Cultural armor is too much a good buy for the buck and you can't afford to cut yourself out of that.  While I'm doing my best to replace it with no drop stuff now, it has served me well for many levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess if you want to be the highest hp warrior early on Ogre is great.If you're into that though the advantage will likely quickly pass.Ogres are easy to see leading a raid force around!I guess frontal stun immunity is helpful early on too,but, no warrior maker.If my wife would go round as a haffer cleric being an ogre would have it's merits.Personally,I like the look of trolls,Ikkys and frogs.I always thought the lil sss you make when tanking as an Ikky is kinda cute,although I'm sure it would drive some ppl nutz.My wife and I went barb because she didn't like the big evil races and I wasn't going to be a kitty no how hehe.So when Stromm fired up we started out togeather in halas which was kinda kewl.I still can't help using ef wayfarer camp omw back from GOD if I'm running...sick I know.Barb is usually a very good size for ma'n with a shrunk raid force for me and well my horns are kewl.Haven't been able to turn them in yet hehe.<br />
<br />
All the races are good and if you play into the raid game it doesn't matter at all.Just pick something fun for you.I woulda been endlessly lost in Neriak... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
