<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok there was a pick up raid on drinal the other night for RZtW, normaly there are night raids lead by high end players. everything from grumus to rz is being raided. now question.<br />
<br />
Was drinal's pick up raid the first one to kill RZtW? I know there use to be alliances and what not back before the 72 flag thingy. but was there a true pick up raid that killed RZ before? im talking pick up as in /ooc lookin for people to kill RZtW, kind of pick up raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cool so it might be a first. now they have to try a pick up raid for sol ro after a few more pick up rz kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EQLiquidslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">rallos was killed on mith marr by a pickup raid about a week ago, prolly before that, just the one i remembered</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ours was on the night of the 29th</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">depends what you call pick up...<br />
<br />
we have a public raid channel on E'ci have flagged oh, several hundred for EP's do public raids on all but the EP gods.. and those will be soon..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's hardly a pickup raid when your MT is using Edge of Eternity/Darkblade of the Warlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When PoP first came out there would be pick up flag raids for Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, Grummus, Vallon, Tallon, Ralloz, Agnar, etc... <br />
<br />
As for now... too much guild competition.  Even my best friends cant / wont let me in and give me that &quot;sorry we no longer allow non app or non members to participate... &quot; bs.  Like me myself, in sol ro or fire is gonna give them competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But Landrain, you're in the &quot;public guild&quot;. *snicker*<br />
<br />
But yeah, E'ci has the best public raiding system anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">or it could also be because some guilds dont like strangers at raids because one person can blow an event.  Not saying you would but a lot of guilds have that policy and wont allow outsiders on raids unless they have some sort of backflagging arangement set up with another guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's too much competition in the high level end game all-around.  I'm having way more fun using my high level to twink than I did flagging for elementals.  LDoN is also a blast, I think dungeon crawls are way more fun than PoP, and given enough time the gear is comparable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, thought you meant like a real PU...<br />
<br />
We've had the number one guild on the server host a bunch of PUs, mostly for backflagging, but I don't really count that as a PU.<br />

 You realize of course that describes virtually every raiding force in all of EQ right? If not for the few Type-A personalities per server slapping folks around shit would hardly get done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Reason most guilds dont want to flag random people for some mobs, is that oncee u open that doorway, everyone wants to flag their friend, and it just becomes a pain for the guild officers to  deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yeah but when you see a random lvl 65 thats not in a guild or is in a guild that normal would never see RZtw, say /ooc looking for lvl 65 for earth. it just brings a tear to your eye and makes you feal all warm and cozy inside.</div></div><hr />
