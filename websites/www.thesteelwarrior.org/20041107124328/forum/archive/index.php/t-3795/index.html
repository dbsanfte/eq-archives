<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crist0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As most of you are aware, the official stance for SOE in regards to camps *was* a) camps do not exist and b) the first ready to engage/spawn cycle has claim to said mob/cycle. That policy has changed now, according to our new Ayonae Ro server GM Jaanbaz.<br />
<br />
The story:<br />
<br />
A few of uswere finishing up a guildmate beastlord's epic in Timorous. Being the first to arrive, I noticed the guild &quot;Zone&quot; had about a dozen people sitting around the scout. I sat nearby waiting for them to kill it so I could tell the people coming not to bother.<br />
<br />
After 30 minutes of waiting and watching more of them slowly trickle in, everyone from my group had arrived(7 of us). I was discussing the matter with the shaman from their raid and discovered they had already been there for over half an hour even before I got there. At this point, since my group was ready, I asked them to engage or move aside so that we could. They replied they were still waiting for more people.<br />
<br />
After having over an hour to prep and still sitting there unready to engage, I told our beastlord to turn in his coin and start the cycle. I had given them first shot after all, and informed them that if they didn't take the mob at that time our group would.<br />
<br />
Our beastlord turns in his coin and starts the cycle, and we start killing the 6 spawned mobs from the turn in. At this point Tigaman sends me a tell saying he killed the scout(who our beastlord is to turn in the drops from the spawned mobs). I run up to verify this is so(it was), and receive tells from the shaman helping them that I had talked with earlier(notoriousraptor) informing me that Tigaman had killed the quest mob.<br />
<br />
I run back down in time to see Tigaman and others from his guild training every raptor they could get their hands as well as the remaining 4 spawned mobs we had been single pulling onto our group, and attempt to kill those remaining spawned mobs. Great, 4 of us die..and so do a good number of them. They also managed to knock off and loot 2 of the spawned mobs our beastlord needed.<br />
<br />
Immediately I petition, and while that is happening I get super lucky...Tigaman sends me a tell gloating that he killed our quest mob after the cycle has started, and laughing that our beastlord now has to start his epic over since he did not get the drops from the spawned mobs and had already turned in his coin. I send a /tell to the new server GM, Jaanbaz, informing her that we had trouble with people training/killstealing/killing our quest mob.<br />
<br />
Jaanbaz tells me she is looking at the petition, and asks me to send in /reports of Tigaman's tells(which he is still sending). I send in about 8 reports(yeah, he was sending that many tells), and inform the beastlord who the raid was for(who was also laughing and taunting directly to him that he now had to restart his epic) and the other people with us to report their tells from Tigaman.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm thinking we have him dead to rights at this point. We triggered the cycle after giving them over an hour to prepare with them still not ready, we have several people who /reported Tigaman sending tells that he killed the scout and laughing that our beastlord has to start his epic over. I'm even getting tells now from his guildmates there to help him informing me to let the gm's know they saw him kill and train us to screw up our beastlord's epic.<br />
<br />
The Jaanbaz lets me know he/she is looking at all of the reports now and will be with me in a minute. After a bit Jaanbaz asks me to join the csrresolutions channel.<br />
<br />
Here is the log from that(I also have screenshots of what happened before the log, however I can not host them. If someone wants to host them I will send them to you.):<br />

[Mon Oct 20 18:58:47 2003] You told Jaanbaz, 'i am an officer'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 18:58:52 2003] You told Jaanbaz, 'the guild leader is not on atm'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 18:59:42 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Alright here is deal'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:00:32 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I have my petition queue full of petitions from both of your guilds. The first thing that I want you all to understand is that sending in multiple petitions regarding the same issue will not get a quick resolution for the,'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:01:02 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'It only affects our ability to assist you.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:02:05 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Two - From what I take it is that there are issues among each other from both groups '<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:02:28 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Do I have both of you here and paying attention?'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:04:52 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Now, As a GM if we have to interfere in this situation, we will have to take harsh action against you. If this becomes a support issue we will have to fix it completely'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:05:49 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'thats it they get away with taking our camp after we were there hour before n e one from there guild got here and when they zoned in i said scout is ours'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:06:16 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'if i may, when you are finished jaanbaz'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:07:05 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Now I have two officers of each guild with me &amp; I want this issue to be resolve here mutually. Otherwise we will just be forced to take actio '<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:07:46 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'If this occurs again, then the two of you will be held responsibile and this will be noted on each of your accounts'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:08:05 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'if he kses my mob again i get in trouble??'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:08:13 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Could I have some clarification please? Because from what I understand the first person on site and ready to engage (or) the first ready group to start a spawned event has rights.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:08:40 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'bro we were there hour before you we were waiting on fallin mate'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:09:07 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I asked them to either engage cycle or stand aside and they replied they were waiting for more when my group was ready to engage. Was I wrong to have my group engage if they had people here but were not ready to start cycle?'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:38:32 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Will it be possible to get a reimburse for licck, since killing the scout effectively erased all of our work on his epic so far?'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:44:50 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'ahh ok making sure i wasnt in time out, thanks'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:55:35 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'i would appreciate it if you would stop taunting the person we were raiding epic for ikill'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:02:16 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Alright'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:02:21 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'k'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:03:12 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I think I have an understanding with the other guild here. I will reiterate'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:04:21 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'There were circumstances here which either of the groups could have avoided'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:04:58 2003] Ikill tells CSRResolution:2, 'ehem we said scout was camped he coulda said ok and left'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:05:21 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I do not want any further CS issues between the two guilds. I will be noting the chat I have had on the accounts of both guild officers.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:06:43 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Was I mistaken about game policy then? Could you clarify where I was mistaken so I do not make the same mistake in the future?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:06:59 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Again, this should have been resolved without GM intervention, with the groups co-ordinating with each other.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:09:23 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I was under the assumption from past rulings and statements that there are no camps in eq, and the first to engage or start a cycle had the rights to it. Their group had a full hour to engage before we did, more than thirty minutes of that I was here waiting to see if they did'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 20:13:06 2003] Ikill tells CSRResolution:2, 'we done here i mist a meeting at work to do epic i can make it for second half if i go now'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:13:53 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'The final verdict is that I just do not want any more issues between these two guilds.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:14:29 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I am not interested to punish/warn individuals, just I do not want such issues to be taking CS time'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:14:39 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'OK, but could you answer my question regarding game policy and possibly reimburse licck for all of his epic work that was erased when the cycle was interfered with?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:14:44 2003] Ikill tells CSRResolution:2, 'there was no guild issue with me there was only about six of them there'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:15:33 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I realize CS time is stretched pretty thin but I was under the assumption I was toeing the line as far as game policy goes'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:16:22 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'No, I will not be able to reimburse that. As for the policy decision, KS &amp; taking over spawns from guilds is frowned upon and not acceptable.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:16:35 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'That is in the Rules of Conduct for Everquest'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:16:47 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Ok, why will you not reimburse when you have logs showing him admitting he ksed it'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:18:05 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'and my question revolves around the soe policy towards what constitutes a &quot;claimed&quot; mob. Are you stating that mobs can in fact be camped and it is not first to engage/first with the force ready/first to start cycle is not always the rightful owner of spawn?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:19:33 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Yes the rules revolves around that its not appropriate to attack/KS something that someone else is fighting'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:20:00 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'But there are ways to deal with situations like this.. instead of runing it for each other'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:20:05 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'so it was our mob, because they had neither engaged nor spawned the epic cycle. They were merely sitting here waitint to do so'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:20:24 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'our beastlord started the cycle, you can see why this might be confusing to me'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:21:56 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Agreed. However if a group was preparing for the event, you could have co-ordinated with them or did some type of agreement with them for the event'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:22:06 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'It could be using a random number or a duel'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:22:34 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I did ask them if they were prepared, they said they were not prepared yet and we were'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:23:10 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I gave them the first attempt, I asked them to engage or stand aside, at which point they informed us over public channels they were not ready to engage'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:24:08 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I have made a decision in this regard.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:24:39 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Even with logged proof of them taunting our guildmember after destroying all of the work he has done so far?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:25:15 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'And I would suggest that you try other means in the future and I shall not want any further issues in this regard.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:26:06 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'If you feel that the decision is not what you believe to be correct. Then you can write your concerns on the way your issue was addressed.Our supervisors will review and take the appropriate steps'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:26:26 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'You can mail at eqcs@soe.sony.c'<br />
<br />
Now I'm getting a little angry towards the end, after Jaanbaz spends over 15 minutes talking with him about what happened and then not talking to me at all about the situation aside from asking for my reports earlier. Not only was our beastlord NOT reimbursed for all of his epic work so far that Tigaman destroyed(with plenty of proof from his own mouth to that effect), but the GM did not even discuss our side of this at all. In effect Jaanbaz inferred that our people were ksing his raid, despite the fact we were there first with the force necessary and we spawned the triggered cycle.<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, Training is now OK, Interrupting triggered events to deny others their completion is ok, kill stealing is ok, and most importantly you can now camp mobs for however long you wish, regardless of your readiness to engage or if there are others waiting who ARE ready to engage the mob waiting to do so as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Groups and guilds are expected to work out conflicts before they escalate and before involving a GM. Taking a unilateral action without having reached an accomodation is frowned upon.<br />
<br />
Another guild or group was there first and let you know what they were doing. Had you left (FCFS) then there would have been no dispute. You state that you watched them for an hour before demanding that they do what you wanted them to and theatening if they didn't you would take unilateral action. Had you left an hour earlier there would have been no dispute. Instead there was a dispute, you knew it, and you took unilateral action - end of story.<br />
<br />
I was very amused when a scam artist hanging out at a bank got someone to put an item in his trade window by darting between the traders. He was outraged when the GM made him give it back. He said that he thought the rules were if someone trades with you its yours.<br />
<br />
Yep, there are rules. But GM have some lattitude. Be the first to act like an ass and ye get spanked.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems to be GM policy for a while.<br />
We have been informed that a mob is taken when there is a force able to clear to the mob, not necessarily able to kill him, just to get there(XtC).<br />
And according to the GM there is no time limit in which they have to engage.<br />
<br />
In your case, I wouldnt have forced the encounter with a dozen people around, i would have left for the next spawn.<br />
From all this i guess there have been issues between the guilds in the past or this kind of thing usually doesnt happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Man, that is so wrong.  They really need to funnel some of the money they are making into getting some reliable CS.  It's ridiculous what you were told.  Yeah, it's not the most polite thing to tell someone to either do their thing or your going to, but it is the rules and completely fair.  They obviously broke the rules yet the gm says &quot;I really don't care who did what, I just don't feel like having to be bothered by ya'll&quot;.  Total BS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Petition again today.  Its sad to say, but its totally dependent on who you get.  In fact petition every day until one of the GMs takes their head out of their ass long enough to reimburse the epic turn in parts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anytime we've run into spawn races with other guilds and GM's were involved, the guild there first with the force to kill is given first crack.  If that is unsuccessful they are to stand aside for the other guild to get a crack (if applicable, your mileage may vary).  On some rare occassions when it's not clear who was ready first, GM's have had GL from each side flip a coin (/rand 0 1000) to see who goes first.  Now, granted we've had really no major issues in the last 9 months or so but they can creep up.  IMHO, this GM seemed to feel put out at having to do his job.  One word... putz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Race to&quot; mobs are first to engage with force.  (Doesn't include a druid kiting the mob around with agro till the raid force gets enough either).  So clearly the other guild didn't have enough and should have let you take him.  Also the insult of KSing you and then trainning you, puts you clearly in the right.<br />
<br />
I would petition again and hope for a different GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't see how it can be your fault if things played out the way you said they did. Both parties knew the other's intent. You made it clear to them to go or stand back after at least an hour of them being there.<br />
<br />
There is also a rule about Monoploizing a spawn/zone. Theorectically(sp), I could stand in Time and successfully keep other guilds from doing it simply by saying that I am waiting on more? If I was there first? I don't think so. If you're not ready and someone else is, you either go or sit back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wonder what all that precious CS time was supposed to be spent? Pulling some newb's corpse out of a hill? GMs are on the server to resolve these disputes should they arise. Yes, there should have been a certain level of maturity between the two groups. There should have been a mutual agreement made to determine who had right to the spawn. But there wasn't, and then actions were taken that broke the Play Nice Policy. Honestly, Tigaman should have felt the sting of account suspension for what he did, as well as whoever was party to the training, while everyone else should have had at least a mark on their account for their inability to handle the situation as mature individuals. If I'd had my druthers as the GM, I would have flagged everyone in the zone as PVP and let them fight it out. If they want to be children, then let them be children.<br />
<br />
I do have this much to say about the GM. What a piece of work. That is not how you deal with the problem. Dealing with it that way just pisses off everyone, and a pissed off customer base is not what anyone wants. If the conversation is as you logged it, the GM was extremely lax in enforcing the PNP, especially when it involved the harrassment of a player by another (Tigaman and the other BST).<br />
<br />
They really need to fix the /guildwar functionality. That's one way this whole issue could have been resolved without having to go to the GMs about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were already there, they called the scout, they should have had an uncontested shot at it.  They were understandably PO'ed - they were there first, they called the scout, and it's a fairly important turn-in that you really don't want to screw up.  They wanted to make sure they had the numbers to make it a success for their Beastlord.  You showed up with your group and shoved them aside.  They shouldn't have done what they did, but really neither side &quot;Played Nice&quot; in this situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How long should one be required to wait on another to be ready?<br />
<br />
If they had say 5 people on at 7AM and didnt expect to have enough until 8PM that night when their guild logs in, is that reasonable?  Is an hour reasonable?  Its all just a matter of opinion.<br />
<br />
The practice of calling something with less numbers than you feel adequate to do it with is pretty retarded.  If you have the numbers, kill it. If you dont, stand aside and let someone who does kill it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:P<br />
<br />
In any event, I'd contact the GM thingie, and simply push for getting the epic item restored. There's precedent there (A LOT of people have had epic items restored, for various reasons). And you have evidence, in the form of reports, of the person deliberately killing the scout to make that person lose the epic item.<br />
<br />
The rest is just evidence that people can't play nice together and the &quot;play nice&quot; policy is stupid and doesn't help GMs make any kind of good decisions.<br />
<br />
ALSO ... a final note ... the next time you find yourself in this situation ... contact a GM first. THEN invoke the PNP. THEN engage, in the presence of a GM, or work it out with the GM before stepping in and engaging.<br />
<br />
Would that have taken a long time? In this instance, probably. And would the other guild have probably engaged while you were waiting on a GM?<br />
<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
BUT ... 1- Your beastlord would not have lost the epic item. 2- If the other guild had NOT engaged beforehand, you may have had your shot, and had a GM backing you up. 3- It may have been resolved, for or better or for worse, without angering anyone.<br />
<br />
Or it may have had just as screwed up a conclusion. But it's an avenue you didn't try.</div></div><hr />

I've had plenty of time to read, reread, and digest the code of conduct and PnP because of this. Calling in a GM to resolve the conflict was not necessary, here is why(from the PnP):<br />
<br />
<br />
3. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br />
<br />
There are cases where two or more groups* wish to kill the same NPC or hunt in the same area. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise.<br />
<br />
If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a compromise. Any such compromise is final and not open to debate. Refusing to abide by these terms will be considered disruption and may result in disciplinary action.<br />
<br />
It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br />
<br />
Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other  group was not capable of completing the goal, by their own admission. Not only that, they were uncapable of completing that goal for thirty minutes while my group was sitting there able to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Uhrlik,<br />
<br />
Good point about competition. However, if you use cut-throat tactics you shouldn't complain if yer throat gets cut.<br />
<br />
Grist,<br />
<br />
You don't get to be the judge of capability nor set conditions. If a spawn is contested (and this one was by your admission) you can not take unilateral action. It is up to you to either work out an agreement or let a GM decide who has the capability and who has the right to engage.<br />
<br />
It's seems likely that the GM looked at the other party's recorded kills, numbers, and ability and decided they were capable.<br />

If you don't have a force there to kill the mob then YOU FUCKIN LOSE.  Period.  Cristo waited long enough and was nice enough, and there should have been zero question at that point who was in the right.

Reading the code is one thing.<br />

Actually talking to a GM and avoiding a conflict would have, obviously, AVOIDED the conflict.<br />

Calling in THIS GM beforehand, from reading your log, would have certainly made the thing go much smoother.<br />

Maybe you didn't understand why the GM was unsympathetic to your case.<br />

So let me spell it out for you. YOU initiated something that you shouldn't have. You did NOT try to resolve the situation with the competing guild. And you did NOT try to resolve the situation with a GM. You simply went in for the kill.<br />

Basically, two fucked up things happened.  Some peeps unable to kill a mob were trying to hold it.  They should have known full well that if a superior / capable force showed up b4 they were ready - they'd likely NOT GET TO KILL IT!<br />
<br />
Two, second capable force shows up; gives what I would estimate to be ample time to engage.  First group doesn't engage, states they can't.  In order to AVOID bad shit at this point, EQCSR should be contacted to come arbitrate.  Likely group 2 would be allowed to proceed since they were ready.  Instead, what happens is group 2 fires away w/o totally nailing down that they were going to do so with group 1.  Group 1 goes WTF?!, and engages out of anger etc... Now it's all FUBAR'd.<br />

It was a dispute. Work out an arrangement satisfactory to all, petiton a GM, or accept whatever happens.<br />

I think Haas's mule example was apt.  I can't kill Vindi with a level one mule any more than I can with half a group of level 60s...the point being if you don't have the force you don't have the force and I can't camp a mob with the thought that SOMEDAY I may have the force ready.<br />

Oh, so I can sit with my level 65 warrior in Kael and call Tormax just because he's up, then wait 8 hours for my guild to be online?  Fuck that.  No one ever does that, and if they do, they DESERVE to get pushed aside so the capable people can do it.<br />
<br />
If you're at the zone in, and you call the Spore King, while I'm already in the jail wasting frogs, you bet your fuckin ass I'm not finding something else to do, i'm going down there and I'm busting the King up.  You're not there, you don't have the force, you don't have the camp, period.<br />

To say there is so much more context to this would be an understatement (most from pre-CI ellie planes)...but I'm not going to cite how the mechanics of GMs/Ellie Planes/Fennin Ro server fit together in this thread (p.s. I feel for you CI guys...you have a hard road ahead ;-(  ).<br />

(another war naturally) and we sat in silence for almost 3 hours before i got fed up with snarling at my screen and checking constantly to see how many guildies he had online..<br />
<br />
so i sent an /OOC.    so here we are after 3 hours of staring each other down when a message suddenly pops on his screen saying..<br />
&quot;hey (BLANK) your my best friend. I feel like I can tell you anything...&quot;<br />
so we laughed our asses off then started talking, then decided that rather race and fight for Sev, we will do it together. Sev sapwned an hour or so later, and we took his ass down. I won the roll and got my scale...<br />
next week, I was right back in EJ camping Sev because we had made a deal to work together and when Sev popped, we took him down again and now we both had scales..<br />
<br />
we have been great friends ever since...<br />
<br />
As for good old Jakle. well as he said earlier. sometimes helping another first before taking for yourself actually benfits you more than taking the mob would have..<br />
<br />
so, how does this relate to the original topic at hand?<br />
<br />
It is my express opinion that you were all wrong. every one of you involved.<br />
<br />
should a person be able to camp forever around a contested spawn and call it claimed, therfore holding up others and preventing them from completeing their quest? FUCK NO&gt; if you dont have the force, and you know you dont, and dont have a chance in hell of getting anytime soon(like realisatically in say, i dunno 10 minutes?) be the bigger man, and step aside, give the group that is ready their chance. OR say fuck it and offer to help them!!! ( OH GOD FORBID WE HELP RATHER THAN TAKE FOR OURSELVES)<br />
As for the original poster. yeah you had a right to complain that they were not ready to take it. you make a fair question in &quot;how long should I be forced to wait?&quot; but fact is, you fucked them over. you know you did, whether you feel justified or not, you know why they were there, you just didnt care.  maybe instead of takign for yourself and stepping on them to get it, you could have offered to help them do it. or roll for it, or many other things.<br />
as for the GM WHAT A DICK. SOE has their rules, the GM needs to enforce them. purposely training and ruining the game for someone else is against the rules. screwing up an epic so they have to start over completely is against the rules. enforce them for fucks sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Battleblade, The Nameless has had more than it's share of guilds getting their collective throat cut. Back in Velious, the two top guilds were nearly neck and neck (Legacy of Steel was ahead of Sanctuary, but - although they may deny it - not by much).<br />
<br />
Sanctuary got so pissed over a contested spawn that they lost, that they bailed on the Best of the Best to screw up an LoS raid. LoS was raiding Dain, who at that point had never been killed. They had their strat, they had their force. They were buffing and going over their plan when a few Sanctuary members popped in on them.<br />
<br />
Mayhem ensued. Pets were dismissed; casters ran chain casting Sentinel through the raid party forced a portion of it to go LD; throw in a liberal dose of training and you've got a recipe for one seriously screwed up attempt.<br />
<br />
There was never any love lost between the two guilds, but the rants and flames board was ablaze for weeks over the dispute.</div></div><hr />

Its an epic mob not a friggin raid force mob, have some respect.<br />
<br />
let me ask you this, how would you feel if you were in BoT or somewhere and a named mob spawns that you cant kill with your current group.  You try to get some key class you need from guild to come help but in the meantime another group comes by and snatches the named even though it is blatantly obvious that your group is prepping for it?<br />
<br />
Even reverse the situation you described and put your group as the one camping the epic mob...I would think you would be estatic if someone sniped it<br />
<br />
Have some empathy and in a tough situation where two groups are disputing /random is a wonderful thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Both sides were completely and utterly in the wrong...<br />
<br />
The people who were there camping were wrong because they were too cautious, however the way the Epic Bst works, if you faill this AT ALL, you must start completely over again. This encounter ALSO has been and still is BUGGED, if the mobs pop in the wrong spot you wont get all the mobs, you will then loose and must start all over. this is not a mob to just go and engage and kill without a little idea of what is going to happen. Waiting for overwhelming force is not a bad idea.<br />
<br />
The people who showed up with one group and forced the issue, they were wrong for being complete and utterly arrogant asses. Just because you are 'uber' and can kill anything in the game with one group, doesn't give you the right to DEMAND another party in the game to move now. They have the same rights to the mob as you do.<br />
<br />
Engaging while they were there was Ignorance and Arrogance at its highest level, and also wrong, this should never have been done UNTIL a GM was first contacted and consulted. <br />
<br />
Them Training you was also wrong, and killing the epic mob was wrong, however, I can see their reasoning, and also understand their frustration with what you were doing. This guild was probably a smaller mid 50 or so guild that neede a good turn out to do this event, While you were a group of 65's just strutting around like roosters in a barnyard.<br />
<br />
Both sides were wrong.<br />
<br />
Remember something about this mob... Its a 3 day spawn, it ALWAYS drops the piece, its not like there are 2,000,000 Beastlords qued up to get this done. Its not the Golems in fear that drop epic pieces once in a blue moon. This is an ALWAYS drop triggered epic mob. If there were 10 people in the zone and they said they were on the mob, Go Do Something else... <br />
<br />
You looked for a fight and a conflict and you got it. Your Bst is LUCKY imo that he got his coin back. I would hope he was more congenial with the GM's than you were and they understood it wasn't his actions, but he was defering to you.</div></div><hr />

There were 2 out of our group that were over 60, the remaining ranged from level 52 to level 60, with an average level in the low/mid 50s between them.<br />

As for the rest of it, there is no way that they should have even had to wait that long (assuming the story told is the truth, which I have no reason to doubt).<br />
<br />
As for the people saying &quot;Well the epic wont get used anyways&quot;.. SO WHAT!   That person paid just as much as you and me and is entitled to it even if he is going to destroy it seconds after.<br />
<br />
The GM was wrong and his supervisor obviously agrees. <br />
<br />
Does it suck to be the person that was waiting for his friends/guild to come kill it?  YES<br />
Do I care about that?  YES<br />
Do I think that the &quot;ready&quot; people should have to be penalized for it?  NO<br />
Do I think that the people that griefed the BL and his group should be penalized?  HELL YES<br />
<br />
I personally would have went and fought that group if they were not a neutral guild (gogo pvp server), but if they were neutral I would have left the zone and came back later secretly hoping they failed (/sigh yes, not proud but I would have been anxious).<br />
<br />
I think the GM needs to be reprimanded for trying to use threats to get out of doing his job.</div></div><hr />

now weather you where right according to the Unwriten Rules of EQ is a whole different story. <br />
<br />
If your camping the fungus king and you just recovered from a massive train and are oom and low on hp and tigaman shows up with a full group and tells you that you engage now or forfiet the mob. according to you, you have bow out and let him have the mob because you are not ready.<br />
<br />
<br />
me pesonaly I would have talked to the person in the other group who was in charge. I would have explained the situation and asked if i could do the event this time since our beastlord was leaving for iraq and realy wanted his epic. I would have also offered them my services to kill the next trigger in 3 days time and anyone else i could get to come along.<br />
<br />
this is the part where you reputation comes into play. are you a nice guy or a dick, can you be trusted or are you always lying etc etc.<br />
<br />
From the way i read your post you said they had people slowly trickling in. that meens they where showing some effort in getting people there to do the event. me pesonaly, I would never have even consitered triggering that event as long as they where showing an effort to get people there. but thats just me. I love everyone and try to get along with eveyone, even if they're a dick.<br />
<br />
but yeah according to the EQ offcial rules you may have been right<br />
<br />
---<br />
it's also based on circumstances. if you are in a time guild and this guy is in a guild with 11 people, 9 of which dont log on anymore, and the other person in his guild has down syndrom. and his only other friend is some guy that has been playing for 4years but cant seem to get lvl 50.

Actually the rule says<br />
1. Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br />
If the mob is not &quot;already fighting or pursuing&quot; someone, it is open game.  Unless you say they are in voilation of rule 3, &quot;You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.&quot;<br />
<br />
If your camping the fungus king and you just recovered from a massive train and are oom and low on hp and tigaman shows up with a full group and tells you that you engage now or forfiet the mob. <br />
They gave them half an hour or more, if you can't recover from a wipe in half an hour you don't deserve that mob.<br />

Risky there. Due to CR it could end up taking a lot longer than 15 minutes if you mess up on the run.<br />

Now if you simply fight your way down, it takes a bit longer than 30 minutes ... but everyone gets there easily with no problems.<br />

You're taking the wrong way if it's taking you that long to get down there.  Assuming level 60 or better melees in a group, you can invis to the lev tunnel, shred everything beginning with the first skeleton, clear the bridge, jump down and zone to Chardok B in less than 10 minutes if you're not leading a group of fuckin numbskulls.</div></div><hr />

Not my fault some people don't even know where half the zones are let alone the layout.  Droga, Seb, Chardok, Guk, Sol B, Howling Stones, Skyshrine....I know em all upside down inside out and every way in between.  I'm truly shocked that people don't have scouting toons to check places out.

In fact, I've spent a good portion of time in Dok, and know that the original poster is very correct. Using some pathing tricks it's really easy to get to Dok B by yourself and live. You don't even need invis.<br />
<br />
But I've met and adventured with a lot of people who went through all 65 levels without ever getting acquainted with good ole Dok. I'm not gonna generalize and make assumptions about them based on that.<br />

I'm just gonna say that when Dok B opened, it was definitely interesting to watch people run around in there lost. A LOT of people.<br />
<br />
&quot;In any guild where the majority of the membership were 60 before PoP was released.&quot;<br />

Not true at all. Early on Chardok was not a very fun zone. The pathing made it horrendous, and people tended to avoid it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Drezdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Unwritten rules?<br />
<br />
Unwritten rules are nothing more than a communist manifesto - absolute and total bullshit.  There are real rules.  Period.  There was no grey area in this situation.<br />
<br />
The fact that Crist0 even waited 30 minutes is a testament to the power these &quot;unwritten rules&quot; have on the general EverQuest community.  Crist0 didn't have to wait 30 minutes by the actual EverQuest code of conduct and probably shouldn't have.<br />
<br />
The GM's ruling was a product of sheer ignorance, and a lack of work ethic.  He or she obviously didn't want to be bothered with the situation and just pissed in the wind without giving any regard to the actual code of conduct he or she was supposed to enforce.  He or she probably never actually read them, or just glanced through them.  The rules are quite simple.  There was no contest here, because Crist0's group was the only group or force capable of completing the quest at that point.<br />
<br />
Again, this is not a grey area issue.  Who judges whether or not a group is capable of completing a quest or killing a particular spawn?  Well, in my estimation there is a heirarchy of perception.  Obviously, someone wishing to kill the same spawn is able to partially determine whether or not another group is capable, but they are low on the heirarchy.  The next up, much farther up, would be a guide or a GM.  That's assuming the guide or GM you have actually knows anything about EverQuest.  The top of the perception heirarchy would be the group's spokesperson itself - self-assessment is almost always more accurate than a third-person perspective of someone's or some group's mettle.  From the spokesperson's own &quot;mouth,&quot; the first group was not ready.  Therefore, they were not contestants, and there was no grey area as to whom was capable or not.<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to get their heads out of their asses and quit this social blacklist, unwritten rules, communist garbage.  There's wishing everyone would be nice, and then there's an actual effort to enforce social communism, which is what I see here.  A person should be allowed to follow the written rules, and that's it.  Trying to tell someone they are wrong because they didn't play fairly by the piss-in-the-wind unwritten rules is such utter crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">First In Force is a concept that most servers seem to use for determining who has &quot;ownership&quot; of a camp or boss.  I'd never use that rule for something as trivial as an xp camp, but guilds do it all the time for boss mobs.  If you've got the force, go ahead and announce that you're claiming it.  But don't be surprised if someone asks you to prove it by actually engaging if your force looks insufficient.  Etiquette would demand a reasonable amount of prep time of course.<br />
<br />
If you're there first and have a reasonable force for the encounter, most people and most guilds will give you the benefit of the doubt and let you have it.  If you're claiming a camp for hours on end hoping more people from your guild eventually log in then you have no claim to it.  Either engage or leave.  Most of the time it's not even an issue.  If someone is claiming a boss or some camp and there's something equivalent available elsewhere then just let them have it and move on.  The disputes normally arise when there's no comparable content available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Everyone needs to get their heads out of their asses and quit this social blacklist, unwritten rules, communist garbage. There's wishing everyone would be nice, and then there's an actual effort to enforce social communism, which is what I see here <br />
<br />
I think you are confused on your political terms.  Communism had nothing to do with unwritten rules; actually quite the contrary its existence was based on structure (that a highly structured, planned sharing of resources could bring greater good).  So much in structure in fact that it was untenable as that &quot;hyper structure&quot; caused gross inefficiency..<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;unwritten rules&quot;.  They exist everywhere in the world.  Whether its how you talk on the phone, how you handle gettin on/off the subway, how you relate to veteran shortstop when you are a rookie or where you stand in line in a public place...they are all &quot;unwritten rules&quot;.  This has more to do with people solving their problems themselves with a minimum of external interference (a Libertarian stance not Communist).<br />
<br />
All that being said: in the old days of EQ there were tons of unwritten rules; thou shalt not inspect w/o permission etc.  These days there is a code of written rules; it is the GMs job to know and enforce these rules.  In this you and I agree.</div></div><hr />
