<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering if anyone has tried this or if it is even possible.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation where you are not planning doing any tank switches and you are fighting a mob that is fairly resistant is it possible for the secondary melees to use /shield MA then pop fortitude/furious to lessen the damage spikes until a slow lands. Also could this be used against mobs that are not slowable to smooth out the spikes.<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that /shield takes 50% of the damage to that person. If you can shield and fortitude it seems possible that you can lessen the total dmg output by 1/2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When two warriors are using shield,<br />
<br />
- one person receives 1/2 damage (this is a little better than defensive, and is a good thing)<br />
<br />
- the other person receives 3/4 damage (this is generally worse than defensive, almost as bad as them tanking it on their own).<br />
<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be much point in having one warrior take 3/4 of the damage while still having to heal another tank.<br />
<br />
If the warrior who is eating 3/4 damage has the most hitpoints, then they ought to be tanking in the first place.<br />
<br />
If the warrior who is eating 3/4 damage has superior AC/shielding/etc., then it's totally wasted while they are shielding.<br />
<br />
The only situations that I can think of to /shield during a boss fight are:<br />
<br />
1) if the warrior with the most hit points is unable to get aggro for some reason.  Then he can still take some of the melee damage from the person who has a lower life expectancy.<br />
<br />
2) if shielding completely eliminates the need for a healing rotation.  It might be easier/safer to heal two tanks through conventional healing instead of coordinating a rotation.<br />
<br />
3) if the person who has aggro is in danger of dying (e.g. the healers are silenced), and it would be really bad if they died.  Then shield them and risk your own life to save theirs.<br />
<br />
4) if most of the group/raid's DPS comes from a damage shield.  Shielding makes the mob take twice as much damage from damage shields.</div></div><hr />

I tried the /shield target but found it problematic.  I find that others generally like it when you /shield them.   The only peeps that don't are healers who think your questioning their ability sometimes by shielding their wards.  <br />
<br />
I have covertly helped out on spike damage a few times but I am usually my guilds second assist so busy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use this hotkey...<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
When I see a mob attacking some one or when I loose aggro, I just hit that hotkey and it will target the mobs target and shield them right away, then just retarget the mob.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;toggle last two targets&quot; button works even better.  Don't have to worry about F8 picking up some mezzed mob and aggroing the enchanter on you that way.</div></div><hr />

Is it a disc? does it work like the old-school discs (with hot buttons)? This is the only thread that I've found that discusses /shield. Is it useful? In what situations would it be useful? I've never used it...the only time I've ever seen it used was many months ago when I happened to be running by a group in KC and I got the message &quot;*insert name here* has turned in to a living shield&quot;...this is the /shield disc right? I've never really seen anyone use it since then. Nor is it discussed in the training portion of this web site. Any help to square this uninformed tank away would be greatly appreciated on this...</div></div><hr />

/shield<br />
<br />
press F8 after to retarget mob your killing.<br />
<br />
works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's an ability, not a discipline.  You can use it every 3 minutes, as long as neither you nor the other person are using a discipline.  Type /shield when you have no target to see info about it.<br />
<br />
It's short duration, but extendable with AA's.  It's also short range, but that too is extendable with AA's.  The people who never use it are the people who never spent AA's on it.  2 AA is worthwhile to double its duration.<br />
<br />
Next time a paladin insists on taking aggro in your group, try standing right beside him and typing: /shield Dumbpaladin</div></div><hr />

I was using this except I still had problems with /assist picking up the wrong target sometimes. <br />
<br />
Shortly after I picked up Health of Target's Target, I started just targetting out of the box and using a basic:<br />
/shield<br />
/g Shielding %t<br />
macro instead. It works more consistently for me and it's a bit faster. <br />
<br />
I didn't know about the toggle between last targets command. Is there a way to incorporate that into the macro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In exp. groups I prefer to set up hotkeys with /shield &lt;slower's name&gt; /shield &lt;cleric's name&gt; and/or /shield &lt;enchanter's name&gt;. Basically, whoever might get hit but can't really take a punch.<br />
In raids, that's not practical because of the number of different folks who could, in theory, need to be shielded, so the hotkey set ups mentioned above will work.<br />
Shielding does add to the damage output of the mob, but it cuts in half the damage taken by the character the mob wants to hit. I believe there is also a hate component to it--so when you shield your cleric or shaman or enchanter, there is a better chance the mob will turn right back to you, which is really what you want. But it does also give whoever is getting hit a little bit extra time (how much depends, of course, on how tough the mob is and how wimpy the caster is).<br />
Because of the fact it doesn't stack with discs, it seems to have limited use in terms of shielding other tanks. If another melee picks up agro, you can /shield him and give healers more time to keep that melee standing, and give yourself a better chance of pulling the mob right back on you.<br />
As far as shielding the main tank...hmm. If MT is out of discs in the last few seconds of a fight and there's a real question that a heal might not land in time, you could try it.<br />
But post lvl 55 I would think that such situations would not be that common.<br />
I like /shield, but the people you raid/hunt with have to know what it does--you're going to have to explain it to them, including the bit about the fact you need to be close to them to do it.</div></div><hr />

/ass[ENTER]<br />
/sh[ENTER]<br />
<br />
then F8 or toggle last two targs to get back on your mob.</div></div><hr />
