I may do that if things dont work out where I am at. Kind of fun watching a guild start in ST and work hard for it. That and my chanter could use some VT stuff once it starts rotting for everyone else. Ultimately I think Bertox is likely to be our first real test for progression. But who knows :)<br />

I'm not trying to argue because I think for the most part you are right on with the way you want things for both raiders and non-raiders; meaningful content for both sides, and raid players end up with better gear due to more difficult content. I too think this is exactly how the game should be.<br />
<br />
The question that comes up though is, how far behind gear wise should the non-raiding player be, in a hard cap sort of way? By hard cap, I mean if I do everything I can possibly do with say 2 groups (including /bazaar),  where should I be at? <br />
<br />
Should I be behind the top hardcore raider? Of course<br />
Should I be behind second tier raiders? Of course<br />
Should I be behind raiders who are nearing the pinnacle of the second to newest expansion? Most likely<br />
Should I be behind the up and coming raider? Now, it's not so clear.<br />
<br />
You could carry the list out to more and more levels , but I think right there is where it is gray, and in my opinion anything below below that the most hardcore non-raider should be ahead of. Personally, I think non-raiders should cap between that 3rd and 4th group, and they should have to pass meaningful, non-trivial content to get there.<br />
<br />
Where do you guys think the cap should be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Between one and a half and two expansions. When guilds were breaking into VT, casuals had a mix of Kunark/Velious. When guilds were breaking into Time, casuals had a mix of Kunark/Velious/(not VT)Luclin/easy LDoN. (IIRC, Quarm was not defeated until very close to LDoN's release?)<br />
<br />
Of course, now that guilds are breaking into upper echelon GoD content - casuals still have a mix of Kunark/Velious/(not VT)Luclin/(non EP)PoP/easy LDoN.<br />
<br />
When OoW is released, also, casuals will still mostly be stuck with that mix, as they have not been persuaded by Sony, and have not been 'invited' for lack of a better word into GoD until very very lately by high end server populations into attempting the content outside of the soloing druid paradigm. Putting most casuals just about 3 expansions back of raiding guilds (Hard/Raid LDoN, GoD, OoW)</div></div><hr />

Ya see, the point you and Haas don't seem to get is I'd find any way possible to progress without being trapped in that rat maze any more than I had to. I would progress, I wouldn't sit on my thumb and complain.<br />
<br />
The interesting thing is you ignore completly my advice that you don't try to LDoN yourself to success. It might make sense to get the BP and some augments, but there are alternative sources for almost every slot that're at least servicable until you have acess to better. And at your progression there is better, plenty better.<br />
<br />
Of cource a half-dozen (are we up to a 6 yet?) Magelos showing how players can reach 8k, 8500, or even 8600HP's unbuffed prove NOTHING - even if a couple are the Magelos of actual players.<br />

Taking 6 months off from the game, not progressing, and not even trying GoD makes you knowledgable and uber - thanks for setting me straight. You aren't slow horses, the track is muddy. SoE is probably turning back your AA exp while you sleep.<br />

Being in a guild often helps you with even with single group content and quests. Besides this, guilds generally raid which makes even more content available. You ask if players that only group or do very casual raids s/b behind a guild that raids fairly regularly. I contend that it's inevitable that they are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye Fynepisa,that is the crux of these kind of arguments how to strike balance and preserve game quality.<br />
<br />
I personally,don't think that the contrast between group &amp; raid gear  should be measured by expansions.I think thats immaterial.LDON did not increase the gap because it was not aimed at raid content.What I would like to see is more focus on making the grouping game fun with more depth for post bazaar warriors.<br />
<br />
Really, what x warrior is wearing shouldn't matter to someone doing totally differant content.It never mattered to me/shrug.Well at least it didn't matter after I farmed up some droga weapons hehe.Before that aggro was a real pain for Gunnar on Stromm and decidely hurt my game play experience.Gear was rare there then.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is game integrity preserved by improving non raider progression paths along with GOD stuff.The idea being that with level 70,more aa and good farming of better groupable content ep quality mobs will come within striking distance of 1-3 groups.Not only do I see rztw occaisonally falling in this light and mini raids(and eventually single groups) taking down ep mold droppers,but, more types of new content of equal quality drops being hit by non raider groups.It should take time and effort ,but, I'm pretty sure old and new paths will open up progression for non raiders eventually.I'd like to see more of this.I don't want to see stuff handed out on a scale unbalanced with the rest of the game.EP &amp; Time quality loot should only be dropped off of mobs of comaparable strength and possibly rarely from unique very long and difficult quests.The scale should remain intact as much as possible.When you have the ability(levels,aa,tactics,horsepower whatever) to kill equal mobs then you should get equal loot.<br />
<br />
One of the things that is often omitted is the numbers of people that are normally used the first time through farming ep content.SOE put  mobs in that were more challenging than old content so raiders responded by enlarging their raid forces.If the gear gap is greater than normal it is because the mobs were harder than normal as well and required more people to take down.I wish the balance had stayed more inline with older content ,but, it's done.I would have preferred smaller raid forces for gameplay fun.Perhaps,really they need to back fill content and add more stages before ep level stuff.<br />
<br />
I think there will be paths open to non raiders.Hopefully, more new stuff will come out  and some older raid content will eventually open up.Really tho I think I'd toss my cookies if my group wondered into kt and a Raex style sleeve dropped off of a kill tomorrow.It would make our raid efforts a joke.Eventually people will get there,but, the determing factor of fun should be stuff to do with your friends.Not comparing magelos with some guys raiding GOD.If your primary worry is about having competitive gear than you should be devoting your life to raiding with hard core guilds.I just want to tank for my friends and beat stuff with them.If you're like me then the real problem is a lack of fun content with it's own progression for soloing and grouping.I'd like to see soe place more emphasis on that.Comparing numbers between people who don't play togeather gos no where.It just breeds a lot of negative feelings that can't be properly resolved playing a game.EQ is a social game.It's not a true test of players against each other...that's for another game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you didn't actually say you'd quit <br />
Hyperbole, exaggeration. I want to complete my Vadd's and see the end content of GoD just like I've seen the end content of every previous expansion. Just like I intend to see end of OoW.<br />
<br />
Beside's having just reached 13Kish HP's buffed, I'm interested in seeing 15K HP's. That way I can do LDoN and GoD group trials when I'm not raiding so a few more players will never ever be satisfied with a sub 8k HP &quot;tank&quot; again. (In truth, I barely play when not raiding and could care less about LDoN and GoD trials - thought I'd play to your delusions though.).<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, it has to matter.  The reason is because raiders/non-raiders/casuals must share at least some content.  If they continue to layer better and better gear on raiders while allowing non-raiders/casuals to trail behind a bit more each expansion, there will come a point where they either make content for raiders or they make content for everyone else.  Non-raider/casual content will be far too trivial for raiders, while raider content will be far too difficult for non-raiders/casuals.  So unless SoE wants to split the game completely in two, there will have to be some connection between the two types of gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? Why do we have to wait for another expansion to be released? This whole discussion is about balance in current expansions and access to 2 year old content. <br />
<br />
Sony has said before that expansions aren't intended to balance previously released content. Are you now trying to convince non-raiders that our solution is to just buy another expansion? To what end?<br />
<br />
I don't need to be level 70 to access elemental planes or succeed in them. I need to raid and OoW isn't going to change that. At best it will reduce the number of people needed for a successful raid, not remove the raiding requirement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Myself, I don't want level 70.I'd like to clear time as a 65 many times like people before me did.I don't see it Glatius.I would like to see the gap close over time though I doubt it can be efficiently managed.I don't want to the gap increased.I just want stuff to stay balanced with regard to mobs and there drops,not nerfed to make stuff easier as soe seems to like to do to keep or get some people interested.&quot;Some people&quot; is not a referance to non raiders vs raiders btw.It's more in regard to eq dabblers and folks who want more for less effort.<br />
<br />
There is a huge void in gear drops atm that could be filled with progressive content and rewards.Just make it fun and adventurous with depth.Not a gear drive thru like LDON.If you want to compete go play with the uber folks.I just want to tank for my friends and they are happy to have me despite giving away 1000's of hp and 100's of ac to people who have farmed more advanced content.Other people who want the same gear as me should have to kill similiar strength mobs imo.This will eventually happen for non raiders I'm sure.....already is for some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are several reasons why theoretical magelos showing 8K non-raider gear have little relevance to whether there is a functional skill-up path for nonraiders to this level. I also question the proposition that one or two real magelos of similar level prove much either, other than there are a couple of people out of hundreds of thousands who have played this game who decided to spend much more time and effort to get worse gear than they could have had had they joined a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
In fact, Battleblade's own posts listing potential target mobs for nonraiders contain better indications that most casual players might advance their characters in interesting ways (I myself have picked up an intriguing suggestion or two along these lines from BB and others--spent one day last weekend scouting out a zone that ended up looking doable for my friends, in fact), but these lists still present some functional difficulties for nonraiders that have little to do with player skill. Essentially, the reasons that you see a lot of these non-LDoN target mobs untouched by casuals have to do with some combination of the following:<br />
1) you need a group or two to do to do it if you aren't already so well geared that the encounter is trivial, and it's a long crawl to the mob (for some casual guilds this can be a problem, because if this is a true pathway and not just a one-shot deal, then getting 6-12 people together repeatedly for 4-6 hours on the same nights will be difficult for them).<br />
2) the mob's loot table is narrower than the classes required to camp the mob, and the target drop rate is rare to ultra rare. Thus most of the people needed for the fight are certain to get nothing out of it, and all of the people will get nothing most of the time--and that's if the mob is up. It's hard to hold casual groups together when the reward for success and the reward for failure in a fight are, all too often, exactly the same--just as it would be to hold a raiding guild together under the same circumstances.<br />
3) If a group of friends rotates target mobs useful to each class in the group, but can only commit to long camps twice a week, then between failures, mobs that don't drop the &quot;right&quot; drop, other people camping/farming the mob, etc etc it can take months for all members of the group to upgrade any given slot. Expansions will come out that outdate your gear faster than you can update it, unless you are playing so long and at such long stretches that you could get gear that was 40% better by joining a raiding guild. This is exactly what is happening to many non-raiding players, even the unusually serious ones who post here. The frequency of the introduction of new expansions is increasing at the same time the frequency with which nonraiders can advance through each previous expansion is decreasing.<br />
<br />
The reason that LDoN camps are one of the few places that casual players can get pick up groups (or fill out their groups) is not that casual players fear the risk of non-LDoN mobs. It's that everyone in an LDoN group can advance his character by fighting here. The basic risk and reward tradeoff for casuals is a lot more like the risk and reward tradeoffs faced by raiders than most raiders here seem to want to believe: the problem for casual players is not that they cannot accept more risk for more rewards, it's that the reward curve is much flatter for them than raiders. <br />
Also, the LDoN rate of advancement is quite different for a raider hitting some hards to fill in aug slots as opposed to a nonraider attempting to do enough easy LDoNs to get from whatever the &quot;average&quot; newly minted lvl 65 player has to being outfitted with 8K hitpoints, anger III augs, visible armor upgrades, etc.<br />
<br />
But whether or not I'm right, I don't think people quit eq because they think that they have exhausted all technical upgrades in their armor. It's not why raiders quit, and it's not why casual players quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But whether or not I'm right, I don't think people quit eq because they think that they have exhausted all technical upgrades in their armor. It's not why raiders quit, and it's not why casual players quit.<br />
<br />
I agree.  Just because technically a person could continue to advance at a snail's pace if they were willing to invest a huge amount of time into it isn't a compelling reason to continue to play for most people.  The time invested has to feel as though it is being properly rewarded.  Risk is certainly a factor, but it's not the only factor.<br />
<br />
People leave because they no longer feel like continuing to play is rewarding enough.  Fun is one of the biggest rewards, and that seems to have been drained out of much of EQ over the last several expansion.<br />
<br />
For example, do you know how fun it was for me to spend several weeks/months in places like PoD, PoI, and PoS to walk away with next to nothing in the way of an upgrade?  I'll tell you, not very.  Casters got parchments all over the place.  But the items for Warriors were basically unheard of.  Great loot distribution.  And that's just one example, there are numerous more.  Making experience, and slow experience at that, the only significant reward isn't very fun and doesn't convince people to hang around.<br />
<br />
What I find most interesting is that a zone like Veksar actually has better loot for the time invested than most of opening zones of PoP.  It's by far the more entertaining zone.</div></div><hr />

Everything below the EP zones is basically no loot unless you raid.  LDON was great for casual players because it offerers guaranteed rewards as well as cutting up play sessions into small manageable chunks.  They need more variety though.  For most casuals LDON normal is too easy and LDON hard is too hard.  They need another level in between as well as another level after hard IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think in theory LDoN was great for casual players.  I think in practice is wasn't as great as it could have been.  Problems I think LDoN has:<br />
<br />
1. The lack of variety you mention was a big deterent for many people in doing sufficient numbers of missions to really gain the rewards.  <br />
<br />
2. The fact that you had to focus your missions in one particular theme, while very often other classes you needed to group with had to focus in a completely different theme.<br />
<br />
3.  The fact that not only did you have to purchase the item you wanted for a pretty steep point cost, but then you had to also purchase augments for it at a pretty steep point cost meant that you had to pay 2 or 3 times the original price.<br />
<br />
4.  The inability to purchase mid-level rewards without having to regain the points again to buy the top end rewards (which the buy back change has helped to a degree).<br />
<br />
LDoN just wasn't done well enough to hold most people's interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">LDoN just wasn't done well enough to hold most people's interest.<br />
<br />
I'll second that.  LDoN had a lot of potential, but fell painfully short.  <br />
<br />
That said, i still hug my anger augments daily  :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">4.  The inability to purchase mid-level rewards without having to regain the points again to buy the top end rewards (which the buy back change has helped to a degree).<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually they just fixed this problem by allowing you to sell back your old gear and augments for partial cost (70% I think) as well as removing your augments without losing them.  I would have preferred that they let you get closer to full points back but 70% is a huge improvement over 0%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree, which is why I mentioned the buy back change in parens. 70% is a huge improvement.

Only if they add more equipment :)<br />
<br />
Seriously I wish they would just let us know. Even 30% loss sucks when you have the choice between waiting and hoping that new stuff is coming (and not losing that 30%) or just digging in for the potential to lose 30% (buying now with anticipation that nother better comes along). At one point my cleric had 6K saved because it looked like there was gonna be new stuff. Now she is augged up with +40 manas instead. Course if they add more slot 1/2/3 equip I will regret it since the augs are slot 7/8 :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">LDoN was fine.  It was an entire expansion devoted to the casual gamer.  In fact, it could certainly be said that LDoN was the first expansion which created a real upgrade path for non-raiding characters.<br />
<br />
What's happened to LDoN is the same thing that's happened to the early PoP zones:  people have figured out the optimum approach to maximize reward while minimizing risk.  In PoP everyone congregates in BoT and knows the camps inside out - people who know every drop from every spawn in BoT South Middle/Oven usually haven't spent more than an hour in Torment.<br />
<br />
In LDoN everyone does thousands of collects and slaughters, time after time, focusing on their one particular theme which gives them the upgrades they want wherever possible, but they reject assassinates and rescues out of hand.<br />
<br />
Is it any wonder that content seems repetitive when you focus on the path of least resistance?<br />
<br />
Yes, upgrade paths become rare and difficult when you're 65 and you've finished farming the basics.  That's true for raiders as well; it takes a whole load of time invested just to improve one slot.  The effort required gets greater and the reward gets smaller as you climb the curve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There are four strengths inherent in LDoNs for casual players:<br />
1. Every class, no matter what your group make-up, has a chance of recieving a reward. This instantly makes it easier to get a group than many zones, where the best mob drop may be great for a warrior, but nothing for the cleric, or nice for the cleric, but nothing for dps classes, etc. For casuals, the problem--the real risk- with zones with a rare drop for a single class is not that the mob is dangerous or that you might wipe, the risk is that you organize your friends go out there, kill your target, nothing drops, experience sucks, and you've wasted everybody's game time--sometimes a big factor for casual folks who can't get together every night. Wasting one day is wasting half a week in real time. Never happens in LDoNs.<br />
2. LDoN is easy to get to and has a reasonable time requirement for casuals. No three-hour struggle to get everyone to some far-off zone and fight your way into the target mob. No flagging, no killing much harder mobs to get to the easier mob that has the drop you want, no content locked behind raid mobs.<br />
3. It's level restricted: you do level appropriate killing with no powerleveling and no one KS's you. Thus there is no fighting your way to some mob and then have some drunk Uber two-boxer kill your target with his left hand while laughing at you, watching reruns of Sex in the City in the hopes of seeing two girls kiss, listening to headbanger music, and godonly knows what he's doing with his right hand.<br />
4. It really was designed at least in part with casual player's progression in mind, which after PoP is, in and of itself and regardless of the LDoN's drawbacks, very encouraging.<br />
<br />
The drawbacks to LDoN are:<br />

Yeah, I know: at many phases of the game you have to run the same fight over and over. But that doesn't mean it isn't a problem here. <br />
2. Lack of sell-back was a problem at first, though I think it's not bad now.<br />
3. lack of granularity in difficulty. Lots and lots of the player base is stuck between mindnumbingly easy normals and hards that just pound 'em.<br />
3. For warriors, no real aggro weapon option at any level.<br />
<br />
I do actually think that one problem in making EQ a better game is really driven by players' rentless focus on min/maxing everything. You can design a lot of cool zones and a week after release 99% of the players are huddled around the same three mobs whining about lack of variety as they desperately attempt to get teh phat l3wt.<br />
<br />
But it's a mistake to think that casual players are markedly more risk averse than raiding players. The same basic risk-reward calculations are operating for players at all levels of the game, whether the player is hardcore or casual.Tthis is why neither newbies nor alts of highly skilled players form balanced groups of lvl 22 characters to raid runnyeye or Permafrost's lesser named. I know this is true because I've tried to get mid-20 alts of my friends to go in these places and even though they're pretty tolerant of my ideas for pointless challenges, the entire social economy, bazaar economy, and power economy of the game is against it. This is the same reason that many PoP baking drops are never for sale in the bazaar. It's not that high-level players quiver in fear of the mobs that drop it or are afraid of the level of risk that those mobs represent. It's not that they're trying to horde all the best tradeskill food for themselves, heh. It's that they have other places where the same effort will get them more stuff. Or, even less effort. It's the reason same reason almost no one does LDoN raids.<br />
<br />
The reason LDoN has such a good risk/reward ratio is because it has to. SOE can't afford to release new expansions that don't have a better risk/reward ratio than the last expansion, because no one will go there and then no one will buy the expansion. Not hardcore raiders, not causals. No one.<br />
<br />
If you are a hardcore raider and think that the problems faced by casuals finding fun progression paths has to do mostly with casual's unusual fear of risk, you are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On this one point I'm gonna have to disagree.  Though few weapons exist out of ldon with innate procs, LDoN introduced aggro augments, which gave people the ability to make non-aggro weapons into aggro weapons.  I know they arent as good as double proccers, but they are still much better than anything warriors had before.  A 17/20 with anger 3 is much nicer aggro than a Blade of Carnage unaugmented any day.<br />
<br />
Not pointing out anything you dont already know, just emphasizing that LDoN, on the whole, did more for warrior aggro than any other single expansion.  As is LDoN xp groups allow upgrade paths for ALL slots ... something which no other expansion has done before (in the xp group situation).  I therefore dont think it entirely unfair when minor item types dont really find their way in ... especially with the abundance of easy to attain aggro weapons via the Bazaar which are absolutely incredible when further augmented.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Bah, Apolyon is right on a couple of levels to disagree with my statement about there being a lack of aggro weapons for warriors in LDoN. <br />
<br />
Apolyon's point that this expansion is huge for casual warrior aggro is quite correct. The augment system, if looked at that way, is in fact better than any single-weapon drop ever could have been for helping with aggro, especially now that augments can be moved around. <br />
In fact, nonraiding warriors were facing a problem: they just get the incite line and things are okay until SOE needs to upgrade caster spells to deal with level 70 changes. Not all the means for keeping up with growing caster power could come from  raids, or eventually casters would not be able group with nonraid tanks post-level 65.<br />
I think I was sort of mentally slotting the aggro augments into the entire &quot;incremental reward&quot; benefit-for-each-class aspect of LDoNs, though they are perhaps better thought of as a weapon upgrade as Apolyon points out. The &quot;at any level&quot; part of he statement I made wasn't supposed to be about &quot;weapons&quot; but rather the warrior's own levels: that's me mostly thinking about Joe average lvl 25-50 warrior, who hasn't saved up enough LDoN points in the right dungeon for his anger aug, let alone the weapon.<br />
Outside of the anger augments, the problem with an LDoN weapon that does not have a great innate proc is that as a warrior you're not going to spend adventure points on it--by the time you have the points, you'll probably realize that spending points on an augment and putting it on a droga weapon set makes better sense.<br />
And even if you can't afford the droga set, the unaug'd LDoN weapon is going to have to be hella good to compete with a 200 pp GSoT.</div></div><hr />

My complaint about the LDoN weaps isn't so much a raider -vs non-raider thing. Its more of a LDoN itemization bitch.

<br />
<br />
True, but on the same token, rangers rogs and monks still dont get to build duel proccing weapons via ldon.  I understand it's not as crucial to them, but then again the addition of proc augmentations didnt help them as much either.<br />
<br />
&gt; Adding procs for them increased their usefulness by 2-3% (added dps)<br />
&gt; Adding procs for us increased our usefulness by 50-75% (double the aggro)<br />
&gt; Adding weapons for them increased their usefulness significantly (increased dps)<br />
&gt; Adding weapons for us only increased our usefulness marginally and situationally, as it's more efficient to simply add a proc to an existing proccer<br />
<br />
Nobody benefitted from LDoN more than warriors.  Without ldon augments, i would have never rolled apolyon in the first place, as warrior aggro was fucked.<br />
<br />
That said, i think it would be peachy if they added a weapon to LDoN merchants on a 14/19 or 15/20 ratio with a proc built into it and room for a 2nd proc ... with the ability to turn them into 16/19 or 17/20 duel proccers.  I wont complain if they dont though, because we got the lions share of the benefits already when it comes to ldon.</div></div><hr />

Would have to disagree. Anger and HP augs alone made this a must have for a raider. In fact, anger augs (and dps augs too) may be the most important thing for raiders throughout the game. That and flushing out your stuff in weak spots in off-times (esp. pre-EP). Difference is raiders do it and then leave. Casuals get stuck with it.<br />

Understandable, but there is no way to give content to casuals without the raiders seeing it as well.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anger augs are great for both raiders and casuals, but apart from them, there is not much in LDoN for a raider save hp augs, which quite honestly provide mere fractions of an increase on total hp; they merely smarten up your magelo. <br />
<br />
Also, many raiders have to go through the process twice when reaching Time due to the needless type 7/type 8 slot difference. I sure had fun going through countless Guks after maxxing out Everfrost for type 7 anger 3 before....<br />
<br />
The gain for a casual player from LDoN is still relatively greater than it is for raiders. That said, I hope the system is expanded upon and hopefully given some more variety while increasing gear options for casuals. By that I mean preferably class specific items appearing.</div></div><hr />

Imagine an assassinate mission where the final boss has an AE that makes you drunk.  Or an assassinate mission where you must kill 3 bosses simultaneously, keeping their health bars close to each other to prevent them from healing each other.  Win and you get to open a chest containing a piece of quality loot.<br />

Try getting a non-raiding group to do an assassinate at all - even without AE's or wierd health bar restrictions - some time.  :)  With almost all non-raiding groups, it's a case of, &quot;I'm not fussy, I'll do both sorts of mission.  Collects AND slaughters.&quot;<br />

You'd need to make assassinate bosses drop something attractive which you couldn't get any other way.</div></div><hr />

I used to enjoy the assassinate and rescue missions the most - and at the same time, even a group of guildies would be unlikely to go along, as they wanted their upgrades and needed points for it.  I kinda thought that those two missions shoulda had a little more time and mebbe more points attached, but that wasn't the only thing what killed doing them, for us.<br />
<br />
It was annoyances like rescuees refusing to pass empty rooms, or for that matter, that they were on a fixed path instead of /following a party member, and that they don't run.  I mean, we *got* that it was akin the hedge walk and similar events, but it busted the vibe for us.  (It's a rescue - follow me, be quick, and keep quiet!)  Assassinates were a little anti-climactic - we could  just as well do a collect mission, track the named, and get the points *and* a drop out of it.  The margin of error was a little more slackened, and we would still find ourselves stretching our limits battling through to the named.  (We actually got pretty good at juggling 4-6 critters at a time, eventually.)  The frustrations weren't challenging, just annoying.<br />
<br />
It would have been fitting, I think, to have the assassinated mob drop a decent loot item, or have the rescuee hand over a *token of gratitude*.  We chatted one night that it could have been a signet of some sort (NO DROP, LORE), to be exchanged with the Adventure Merchant (or the Recruiter who gave the mission) for a NO DROP item of choice.  This could've encouraged repeat attempts, heightened the odds of someone getting a useable item, and avoided the *no such class present* scenario.  <br />
<br />
At a successful and timely rescue, there could be sump'n like:  *Thank you, brave adventurer, for my rescue!  Would one of your party [accept this ring], as proof of your daring?  I am certain that one of my peers will reward you handsomely for it.*  The party would roll, then hail the NPC.  Assassinate targets could have a *Gem of Freaky Statue Power*, same turn-in.  No gem if  it's slain in overtime.<br />
<br />
A middle level of difficulty, once normals became easy, would have been a boon as well.  The challenge was eventually narrowed down to keeping morons out of the group.</div></div><hr />

That works on dungeons that are linear but what if you have a split dungeon like some NRO's where u can go left or right.  By the time you clear right and if the boss spawns on the left you have to clear all the way back the other way.</div></div><hr />

Yeah last one I did was Tak and the emote kept coming and I ended up circling to the top of the room (the one with the winding staircase). Took forever because directionally was the same but elevation was of course not provided. They are fun but just not worth the risk / time / reward compared to kill any 58 mobs where you can setup and have a puller feed the camp continuously. I dont do LDoNs for fun just to cap my stones and aug out my gear :)<br />
