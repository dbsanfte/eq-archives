High level beastlords are in high demand with many guilds for their unique buffs, but as far as 'solo' is concerned necros tend to rank the highest (note plrs like Zaar who have solo cleared out Fear...lol)<br />

Play a caster, necro would be good.  I'm enjoying my cleric when he doesn't die in groups and my shaman solo'ing like a fiend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Brae ... when did Zaar solo clear fear?<br />
<br />
I know Triton used to LIVE in that zone, like waaaay back when. But he solo'd it?<br />
<br />
I read a very interesting thread at graffe's once about a wizard who solo cleared fear. He shared the tactics, and was quite detailed about it. Of course no one believed him at first until he shared the tactics.<br />
<br />
But I had no idea Zaar solo'd fear.<br />
<br />
Fascinating.<br />
<br />
I recently got totally wiped out in Fear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a soloable fighter, you can't beat a Paladin.<br />
<br />
Not only is it an excellent melee class, able to wear most of what a warrior can wear, but the combination of healing spells, root, lull/soothe line of spells, AC and HP buffs and of course the stunning Lay-on-Hands, it makes the Pally a great soloable class indeed.<br />
<br />
Get a Paladin KEI'd for the heals and you can spend an easy 3 hours soloing to your hearts content with no downtime.<br />
<br />
I was in Splitpaw soloing with my 33 Pally (KEI'd) last night and in 3 hours I went up 2 levels and amassed over 200pp in loot and platinum.  No downtime, no deaths.<br />
<br />
And if you want a great Pally weapon, check out the 1-hander Massive Dragonclaw Shard - 28 dmg, 30 dly.  Combine that with a decent shield like the Sarnak Battle Shield, and a haste item like Silver Chitin Handwraps, and I can even solo red cons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm not much of a soloer.  My alts consist of a 57 cleric and a 56 druid.  However, I would suggest paladin or beastlord, from how my friends have raved over their new twinks.  =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CasEci</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlord, at 39 he and pup were soloing (duoing? heh) yellow and red cons (gotta pick careful tho) in JP. KEI and play pet cleric 90% of the time. Toss a few DoT's and DD's for giggles. When the MoB runs (bah, give us snare!) Melee it to the finish. <br />
At 49 the pet and your new spells will rock, just a long crawl from 39 to 49.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to vote shaman.  Mainly because if I want to group it's easy to find one (everyone loves shaman buffs and slows), but if I don't want to group with  my shaman, I can solo very effectively. (with kei groups actually slow me down).  Ultimately it's up to you. If you want to play a melee class that can solo easily I'd suggest a knight or a beastlord.  If you want to play a pure caster, I'd say shaman or necro. (while I prefer playing a shaman, the necro is really more powerful than a shaman for most of their career, but opinions may vary on that)<br />
