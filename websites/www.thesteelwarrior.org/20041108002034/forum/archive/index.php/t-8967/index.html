[Thu Sep 16 23:46:22 2004] The savage power fades.<br />
<br />
Parse is very short, the duration of the disc and i was too tired to parse it more than once.<br />
<br />
Was using dbotw mainhand rathe 1h offhand both anger 3 auged.<br />
<br />
1 mob dps given 12 nonmelee 11.55 kick 294.25 slash 64.9% hit rate.  Mob was a discordling taskfiend which did 133.48 dps and had a hit rate of 42.3% with oow avoid 3 mitigation 2.<br />
<br />
I realize its not all that reliable but it gives you an idea of what the disc does.<br />
<br />
FYI:  The disc shows up in timer 2 with furious and fortitude but you can use it independent of these discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That looks kind of crappy to me, how can that be better than Mighty Strike?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not on the same timer as mighty/fellstrike<br />
<br />
Though still a waste of endurance, higher upkeep than Fellstrike too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From the lucy description it looked like it would raise critical chance by 100% (so double it) and then make them all crippling blows instead of just crits, unless I'm reading it wrong.<br />
<br />
I had same results as Aspit tho, I used it twice then took it outta my hotkey bank and combat abilities screen so I never even accidentally click it again, its a total waste of endurance in its current form imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Queg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Other than the obvious increase in damage ...  what does a crippling blow do to a a mob?<br />
<br />
Doesn't it actually stun the mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It can stun the Mob , however it can't stun above a specific level (can't remember which) or if the mob is flagged unstunnable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its a second offensive disc that you can pop after fellstrike, which is kindof nice, other than the fact that its 2250 end to run the full disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PVPers gonna love this one... crips stun players real well.  Kinda hit and miss on mobs tho.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Geeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">try your parse with the new chanty haste Speed of Salik, i didnt run a parser but i did notice far more cripples with salik, due to its higher chance to crit modifier added in, than i did with VQ or SoV using DBotW/EoE<br />
