<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bought FFX a lil while ago. So far the impressions are that the game is far from stellar. Yah it has nice eye candy, but omg the story is so awful (at least the engl translation) that I think it can compete only with a story found in FPS games from ID Software. Combat is a bit slow and too easy. Sucks that the series ending with a title like that.<br />
<br />
Story always played the main part in all of FF games. It even made FF8 almost bearable. Story and quotes like &quot;chicken wuss'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Indeed FFX was pretty bad along with FFVIII.<br />
<br />
<br />
I always liked IV, V, and VII best. FFXI is VERY good also btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The series is ending? News to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">from what I've heared there are not going to be anymore single player FF games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FFXII is in development atm (by the team that did Final Fantasy Tactics &amp; Vagrant Story), pretty sure it's single player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh nice, that team is good stuff!<br />
<br />
Though I think the story in 10 wasn't that bad. Quite original and a bit complicated at times. Definately better then the 8...<br />
Just keep playing, you're probably at the very start.<br />
Battle become much harder, and very interesting. The only thing I really hated about FFX was it's linearity, and theres also a lil something missing.... call it magic if you like ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You all are crazy FF8 and FF10 Rocked!! :)  They were my 2 favorite and as Ninja said FFXI is Very fun also except you have to use the damn number pad to move instead of the arrows keys.  Anyone who is tired of EQ or wants something new should check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FFX is one of the best FF's ever.. I thought it was horrible until I played it through a second time - doesn't beat 7, but it is far from the worst.<br />
<br />
And FF12 is being developed - which is single player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nothing comes close to VI (released in us as FF 3) or IV hard (only in japan, US got FF IV easy mode as the FF2 port). VII was good for the materia system, everything after has been pretty ass - including the retro-esque FF IX<br />
<br />
If you're strickly talking FF theme then FF: Tactics was a masterful game, even better on the Gameboy Advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I doubt that they will kill the Final Fanasty Series single RPG, it is still popular.  My favorites are FFVII, FIX and FFX.  Soon to come out is FFX-2 featuring Yuna while see searches what happened to Tidus after defeating SIN looks good but the cast is all girls.  FFXII I heard that it is in development but havent read anything more about it yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I beleive that FFVII-2 DVD movie is coming out next year.  The movie takes place after sephoriath(spelling) is defeated.  They found out that he is cloned and back causing trouble.  I saw a trailer and OMG it looks very good.  The whole movie is done in CGI and WOW.  I am searching for links about FFXII and the movie and will post them here when I find them</div></div><hr />

<br />
News about FFVII-2 Movie  <br />
<br />
<br />
Rumors of a Final Fantasy VII sequel can finally be put to rest, but the outcome is not quite what gamers would have expected. Instead of being a playable title, the sequel, subtitled Advent Children, will be released as a DVD movie. This epilogue will take us back to the world of Final Fantasy VII to find out what has happened to Cloud and his cohorts two years after saving the planet from Sephiroth and Meteor. Needless to say, countless thousands of fan fictions will be rendered obsolete with this movie. A release is scheduled to take place sometime next year.  <br />

<br />
I didn't know they made it on PC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have played Final Fantasy VII, VIII and X, the only one I have finished is VII.  Final Fantasy VII consumed a month of my life in a way few games have.  I would have finished X but for my dedication to EverQuest :)  I love the fact that the FF games revolve around complex characters and an engrossing story.  I hope that aspect of the series never changes.<br />
<br />
Yeah, FFXI is tempting (samurai class wow!), but if I purchase that game and start to play it, I can kiss additional aa's for my rogue, and additional levels for my warrior good-bye.  There is still a lot I want to accomplish in EverQuest before I move on to a new MMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Talic Moore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In my opinion, the best of the series is still America 3. The individual storylines for each character were, in my opinion, the best of the best.<br />
<br />
There has always been an aspect of each game I have tried to enjoy and focus on. Of them, I'd have to say VIII was my least favorite simply because the character I thought deserved the most attention: Zell, was largely ignored. I loved VII, enjoyed IX and X, but the best three were still American 2, 3, and 7.<br />
<br />
Because Kain was, by far, the coolest character: ever.</div></div><hr />

Kain was such a bad ass, but Cecil always did the most damage ~_~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I thought Vincent was badass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nanaki (Red XIII) was one of my favorite characters in Final Fantasy VII.  He was noble in what he did which was cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">But my all time Favorite character in FF series was VIVI the little black mage in FFIX.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've finished all of FF games I think except FF1 and FF9. I've played tactics too. God bless EMU for Snes and Playstation. FFX story by far the worst in my opinion. Something about trying to kill your own father the whole game and a few of lame characters aka Luna and Waka just kill it for me. The lil complaint I have about combat system is that so far I havent found a way to kill all weak enemies in one blow without summons and its too easy. I've only lost 3-4 battles from the start and I think I am on one of the finall bosses.<br />
<br />
FF8's combat system was awfull because of the abscense of short battles and repetidvness of just have to keep doing summons, but once I got into it thought the story and sheer volume of the world there was to explore drawn me into it. Cant say the same about FFX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Draw system was the worst design in all of the FF series. That alone made FF8 a pile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Barrett was a bad-ass.<br />
<br />
He was all, &quot;GOD DAMMIT! DAMN THEM! AH, HELL!&quot;<br />
<br />
Plus he was all Mega-Man like with his gun-arm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ah, yes.. I forgot about FF3 - beats the rest hands down.<br />
<br />
FF7 and 8 made it to PC FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">im sick of final fantasy (insert number here) why cant they just give it a title of its own? the only reason the are FF is the take place in the same &quot;world&quot; setting and even the zelda games have a fricken orignal name under the series banner.<br />
<br />
other than the gay way they name them, they are fairly good games :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Talic Moore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Cecil may have done more damage after you got the Crystal Sword, but without fail my Kain ALWAYS struck the final blow on Zeromus, simply by nature of his attacks. If everyone fell, Kain was always safe because he was in the air. Freya was okay, but Kain is still the ultimate definition of a dragoon.<br />
<br />
Though coolest line still goes to Garland...<br />
<br />
&quot;I, Garland, will knock you all down!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crystal Sword = Ragnarok?<br />
<br />
Sorry been playing Hard FFIV on PS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">FFVII and FFVI (3 US) are my two favorites, probably my two favorite console games ever.<br />
<br />
Next category would be FFIV (2 US) and FFX. FFX gameplay was very good imo. Story and characters were weakish but its the most fun I have had  combatwise in a FF since FFVII. Atmospherically and Musically it was also very good. Square have a way of creating a very unique world in their games (save the usual similarities bewteen FF titles).<br />
<br />
FFI, FFIX, FFV and FFVIII in the last category. I feel V was the better of these four games though with IX close behind. Job system so powa. IX had  great characters (yay the return of a Dragoon!).<br />
<br />
<br />
I am a huge FF nut though so generally I have liked everyone I have played.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My least favorite is probably FFVIII. Artistically, Atmospherically and musically its one of my favorites if not my favorite (Triple Triad owned Tetra Master too), but I found the  characters, plot and fighting system fairly dull. While I enjoyed the depth of the Junction system I hated the reliance on Guardian Forces for everything, as well as constantly drawing. Not to mention some rare to find GF's/weapons are almost vital if you want to win this game, meaning you might have to start over or spend hours looking for them/building up or cheat using a faq. <br />
<br />
While I welcomed the challenge compared to FFVII later on it was all fubar. It was way too easy early on, then way too hard if you did not have certain weapons/GF's. Other than Squall and Rinoa I found the other characters and the story more filler than anything else. The boss while very nicely done graphically was overall very weak for a boss. You cannot follow after a Sephiroth with a weak in character boss like that IMO.<br />
<br />
And its true FFXII is coming out, and I have heard good things so far.  Ic annot wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I guess NB, I haven't played the PSOne version. It's the sword you get from the Wyvern in the Lunar Subterrane, boosts your attack power to like 240.<br />
<br />
Garland may have the best line evar, but Tellah comes in a close second.<br />
<br />
&quot;SPOONY BARD!!!11&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yeah that's it. That fight was a bitch....</div></div><hr />

My Kain was usually knocked down. Cecil was usually the one to kill Zeromus, or Edge throwing the myriads of stars I collected :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Talic Moore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Bah, Rosa just attacks till she dies. In fact, everyone but Rydia attacks till they die.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, maybe that's why everyone was dead and Kain always killed him...<br />
<br />
I bought the PSOne version, but never played through it. I got lost in Trigger and never looked back. Old memories... *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Dude the excaliber if used properly (i.e 255 battles and never run away) did 9999 a swing. with Cecil.<br />
He owned shit with that sword, I am a paladin and I layeth the smack down on candy asses. <br />
That was righteous.</div></div><hr />
