<br />
So far I have Incardine BP, Crown of Deceit, Cobalt Bracer, and Blazing Bracer of Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
I am really thinking of re-buying Cobalt Arms and Boots for those times I don't have a shaman in group.<br />

<br />
i've been wanting to get the dain hammer for solo farming and duel purposes, cobalt arms effect is a little weak. and emperor torque, but we hardly do him these days, makes me sad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SamirDaStinky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">tri-plated golden hackle hammer<br />
<br />
it's the cool looking hammer that Dain Frostreaver IV drops.  casts unlimited arch shielding.  doesn't stack with focus, but it comes in handy when there's no shaman around (like in exp groups), or even when you really really need that extra MR boost.</div></div><hr />

The belt click is a 25 AC and 4 point DS self buff.<br />
With 9th ring i have a 12 point DS up all the time.<br />
Stacks with druid/mage DS but shaman potion DS doesnt stack with 9th ring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">mmmmm- I *love* clickies.:)<br />
<br />
Here's a few more unlimited clickies, sorry if any are dupes:<br />
boots of shadowwalking (shadowstep)<br />
BFG (knockback)<br />
amulate of necropotence (illu skele)<br />
eyepatch of plunder (haste)<br />
pauldrons of ferocity (aura of battle)<br />
*AE* food/water summon items from VT<br />
etc- got most of the ones already listed in this thread, wish I had more bank space...<br />
<br />
Some much lamented nerfed items: <br />
gauntlets of the bloodfiend (lifetap proc)<br />
guise of the deceiver (illu DE)<br />
<br />
Much fun.  Got the boots of shadowwalking just yesterday, 3 second right click shadowstep = pretty cool.  Been doing some testing with them, they seem likely to be useful in a few unusual places, and of course would own for PVP (if only warriors had some channeling...).<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">read up to here made it into a list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm surprised no one mentioned the Reaper's Ring (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=31319). I recently won one with my rogue. It's a gobby earring on steroids. ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, drops from one of the named dragons in NToV (I think it was Aaryonar, though not sure).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Nice list- I'll rummage thru my collection to see what else I can dig up to add to it- there's a ton of useful charged clickies too.<br />
<br />
Also, shadowstep is FAR from useless on a -zek server... and clever and/or bored people can find some decent uses for it on PVE servers too.  Limitations: won't go &quot;uphill&quot;, won't go thru walls.  DOES work in zones that prohibit lev.  Use yer imagination. :)  You'd be amazed the places you can get to with them + a bfg.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Here's a couple more:<br />
<br />
Snakefingers (gloves from griegs) - right click poison bolt<br />
BFG - (nerfed? quest) - right click knockback, check vs. fire<br />
cloak of thorns (lady nev ntov) - right click 4pt ds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Here's ssome fixes on cast times and other random stuff on this list.<br />
<br />
Eyepatch of Plunder is 3 seconds<br />
<br />
Kizrak's Gauntlets of Battle have a 3 second click 30% haste buff, Miraculous Visions.<br />
<br />
Seru Boots are self only and are 12 second cast.<br />
<br />
The VP sword is 8 second targetable sow, something Katana, forget the name, wanna say Blood Orchid Katana.<br />
<br />
Tunare Belt is instant click. <br />
<br />
Orb of the Sky is 10 Second cast ranger buff Call of the Sky, which is a 35dd and 0 knockback proc add to your weapons, it lasts 10 minutes is all which makes it very lame.  It drops in Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Cloudy Steel Mask is targetable invis, 15 second cast, drops off Va Xi Aten Ha Ra in Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Greaves are 8 second targetable invis.<br />
<br />
Incarnadine BP is 8 second self only invis.<br />
<br />
That's it for now, may wanna make a full list with castng time, where to obtain, ect once we have a good list going.  I am sure I will come up with more givin time, it's 4am atm though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Babyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Sticky pls, I need this as a reference and if I cut/paste on a random notepad I'll never find it in my sea of disorganized files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Some corrections:<br />
Bracer of the Hidden drops very rarely from Sarnak Lego's in the sarnak fort in LoIO.  Easy to do solo, just rare.<br />
Eyepatch of Plunder is 3.5second cast time.<br />
Incarnadine bp drops off of chardok king.<br />
Bangle of Disease Warding is targetable, best to have at least a healer partner.<br />
Rage bracer doesn't really become useless.  It's good for setting rampage, and aerampage mobs when you don't have enough arrows.  It has good range, so can be used for pulling also, though the cast time is annoying.<br />
Velious bp healing doesn't become useless if you do anything solo, or for healing so the priests can save mana.<br />
Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring doesn't stack with Strength of Tunare line, but does stack with Brells, which most warriors prefer, so it's not a real problem.<br />
Pegasus Cloak doesn't require batwings iirc.<br />
Seru boots are self only.<br />
<br />
New things (at least I didn't see them):<br />
Kizrak's Greaves have 10 second targetable sta buff &quot;Health&quot;, 31 stamina<br />
Holgresh Elder Beads have unlimited charges of Eye of Zomm, 4 second cast I believe.  Was nerfed to no longer drop, but they are droppable, price is usually well over 100k.<br />
Kizrak's BP has Shield of the Arcane - 300hps, 36 ac, 30 mr.. Does not stack with focus</div></div><hr />

also there was supposed to be an item in chardok from the herbalist area that summoned some sort of plant thing that could be used as bandaids.  i never saw it so i can't say for sure it exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Bout  a year ago someone offered me a LSoEE for a Holgresh Bead Necklace.<br />

It used to have infinite charges of the Eye of Zomm spell. And my warrior could use it.<br />
<br />
I loved it but couldnt refuse the LSoEE at the time.<br />
<br />
I wish I hadn't traded it by then, because I had no idea it was nerfed and does not drop anymore. It was my dearest toy ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Bracer of the hidden also drops outside the fort, that's where I got mine.<br />
<br />
Here's another one -- goblin gazughi ring, unlimited charges of invis vs. animals.  The GG ring also has the advantage for the nightblind races of being one of the best lightsources in the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I realize it only has 5 charges but considering how cheap it is to recharge I like:<br />
<br />
Forlorn Totem of Rolfron Zek<br />
 Effect: Holy Might<br />
1: Stun(6.00 sec)<br />
2: Decrease Hitpoints by 29 (L19) to 60 (L50)<br />
 <br />
Type: Triggered <br />
Charges: 5 <br />
<br />

I usually carry 3 or 4 Totems with me for certain situations.  I like that it can be clicked from inventory :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I've never heard of the GG ring dropping from anything but the Sarnak Courier (rare spawn in LoIO). It is highly sought after by charming classes because it breaks charm instantly.</div></div><hr />

Never heard that it was prized by charming classes, but that makes sense.  I never see them for sale.  I guess it's a waste to carry it around on my warrior, huh?</div></div><hr />
