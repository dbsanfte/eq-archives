<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadmar</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've recently been having a VERY hard time grouping. I would be LFG literally hour after hour.<br />
<br />
I have also begun to notice the recent trend....Pally, SK &gt; Warrior. PoP mobs hit hard...they hit too hard for mobs to go flippity flop on casters.<br />
I have asked in group whether they would want a warrior or pally, sk, and the reply was unanimously Pally, SK over a warrior. Why? They have much better aggro with pretty useful spells in line. <br />
<br />
Today I was invited to a BoT group. Very well balanced group. I am a level 62 ogre war. I have an SoD and BoC. HP was 7600 with Virtue(Only buff). No probs with aggro I thought. But no matter how hard I try...I have been losing aggro from the start when chanter starts to tash...and slow etc. I find myself going &quot;proc! proc! proc! GDI&quot;. We then had our wizard leaving group for personal reasons...group leader decides he wants an SK who was lfg and wants him to MA. I ask him...finding myself in a wierd position...&quot;you want me to assist?&quot;. Well for the next 3 or so hours I have been poking the mobs from the back with a Narandi lance as though I was a rogue. All this time embarrassed by the fact that an ogre of my size was assisting a human SK, I turn myself into a woodelf to make the situation less...embarrassing. Fact is tho....fight went much smoother and the wierd thing was that although the SK had less hp than I did...his hp seemed to be going down slower than when I tanked. SK had NEVER lost aggro during the 3 hours. I later get a tell from our chanter...&quot;This is why I love SK's...no offense to you ogre :P &quot;. <br />
So...I have decided...no matter how much hp, gear upgrade I get...with the PoP...I'm a second choice..third actually counting pallies. I quit. I'm starting my ranger again.</div></div><hr />

Cases in point:  Monk, Ranger, Warrior, Rogue, Necro, Wizard, Paladin, Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />

I'm expecting (rather hoping :/ ) a nice change to melees within the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Can't hope for a too big change during an expansion, so just hold on till Lost Dungeons of Norrath, and we'll see how it goes :).<br />
<br />
If we're still screwed I'm thinking of making a bard or ranger twink ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
enjoy the ranger kadmar, what EQ boils down to is having fun<br />
<br />
have fun man. rangers are a trip. just don't gimp out your warrior just yet. believe me, i'm talking from experience. i wish sometimes i didn't snuff out mine; but that's water under the bridge now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the exact same experience Kadmar, except in HoH. I spent 3 hours in my last exp group assisting an iksar shadowknight. Sure, it's fun to make jokes about being a &quot;rogre&quot;, but really, it's absurd. The group clearly worked better when he started tanking -- and I do not believe I suck as a tank. I suppose the group could have accomodated me more -- but why should they? Worked great with the SK tanking. <br />
<br />
Anyone who doesn't think there's a balance problem is simply wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys getting what I am saying? All these Knights coming on here telling us we have no problems. Not a problem for them,   you guys can lay down and put up with this crap, or fight them like I am. I am tired of fighting posters on here when I am right about taunt being broken. Right now, Paladins and SKs can taunt at near 100%. Then Sony's group of trained monkeys say &quot;warriors  having 100% taunt would trivialize encounters&quot;. Well I got news for the trained monkeys, Paladins and SKs are within a (hit point/armor class) range they can already trivialize encounters.  So there is only two choices:<br />
1. Nerf knights<br />
2. Improve warriors<br />
I prefer #2, but I am so sick of the lying and gloating knights I will take #1 and be happy.</div></div><hr />

People don't fight you because of any other reason than that you present your case very poorly.   The relevancy of your issues isn't even a consideration.   You could be arguing that the sky is blue, but with your technique, no one would listen... but you'd &quot;carry on the good fight&quot; regardless eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Group of us just came out of exploring Veksar: 2 paladins, druid healer, wizard and rogue. A paladin was MT, both were blasting SU3 on the many undead mobs there, group heals, and a series of paladin rezzes to recover us from a wipeout.<br />
<br />
And once again, I was a 'rogre'. I hit /shield a few times, popped AE taunt once or twice, and otherwise contributed my l33t dps and my sunny personality. Woohoo.</div></div><hr />

I retired the old girl in January, and haven't looked back, my bard is level 65 with 45AA points now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Play my Shaman for exp/fun..<br />
<br />
War for raids only. <br />

<br />
I call him semi-retired, I bring him out when needed, and hope they are fixed where I can truly enjoy the game with him again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boofus</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it sucks, I know personally. The first time it happened to me I was shocked and like wtf? is this a joke? some tanking class we have become when we are assisting the motherfucking hybrids in exp groups.<br />
<br />
My patience is wearing thin, they better deliver on the tanking review, I have to keep telling friends of mine hang on, things will get better, needless to say I wonder if it will ever happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These hybrids really are becoming quite annoying. The reason i play warrior is to tank. I like to play for fun too, but most of the time i prefer fighting face to face with the mob as the group does their thing. Losing aggro shouldn't be part of this! Neither should be having to let some wimpy paladin do my job. <br />
<br />
I was grouping in PoV to get some quick exp for an AA the other day and before we could even fight one mob somebody said &quot;want a 65 pally?&quot; and the answer was &quot;Of course! Uber tankage!&quot;. Hmm, so a 65 warrior is not &quot;uber tankage&quot; to them? Heck, they haven't even passed trials, was a bunch of 59's. It turned out the pally was only 800 hp behind me. Anyway, i start pulling and tanking, the pally comes in with stuns right away. I taunt it off him but he got aggro back with another spell. We ended up switching aggro through the fight. Somebody in the group told me to let him tank...Why should i? I'm the warrior, i have more hp/ac, i can keep aggro fairly well. The pally said mockingly &quot;it's ok, i could switch to a lower DPS weapon&quot;. How bout you stop throwing stuns at the stupid mob when they're not needed and do your job!? <br />
<br />
Also a while ago i was grouping with a 64 SK guildie and guess what, i had to assist. I've seen the same happening in other groups too. People play warriors to tank, not assist hybrids!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna throw another thought out that occured to me recently.<br />
<br />
A few of the threads here come out and say that warriors need solidarity to get 'fixed' and that we all need to come to some agreement about what the problem is and how we want it fixed to present to the Devs or whatever.  <br />
<br />
Throughout these threads where we have countless warriors giving examples of how they are less effective in XP groups than knights and that the advantages of knights agro control make a warriors mitigation advantage not enough to earn us the tank spot in XP groups.<br />
<br />
To counter these though there are quite a few warriors from Elemental+ guilds who are saying that the opposite is the case.  Warriors are the #1 group tanks and things are infact in our favor, something I can believe looking from the perspective of a warrior with a BoW and decked out in Raex's (which isn't me btw).  Not gonna do any quotes here, but Karthunk has been a fairly strong advocet of this in earlier threads if you want to look it up.  (go go search feature)<br />
<br />
Thinking about this has lead me to a few new conclusions which hopefully arent justing retreading the same old BS~<br />
<br />
When I used to LFG in PoS/V as (at the time) and unguilded 65 warrior, 4.3k hps unbuffed, flesh grinder + red epic for weapons - so I considered myself very middle of the road - the people I was competing for group spots were not warriors from the top guilds on my server, but warriors usually from guilds raiding NToV / starting to hit Ssra, and below.  The knights I was competiting with however ran all the way from elemental equiped knights from the server's top guilds down to unguilded knights in cultural / velious gear.<br />
<br />
So the thought this gives me is that when the top tiered guilds aren't raiding, they use warriors to tank in their XP groups.  Sure when you're XPing with your guildmates you have the advantage that people will probably control agro better and know each others play styles better which is a situation more favorable to warriors tanking, but it suggests that warriors are once again the preferred tanks at the high end for XP, which only goes to compound the issue further for warriors levelling through the 60s in pickup groups / teir 2 planes because not only are they competing against knights in their own league who are now given the nod as being the prefered tank because of agro control, but they are also competing against paladins / SKs from raiding guilds often equiped in Ssra / VT / Elemental gear that give them a huge AC / HP advantage over an lower tiered guild / unguilded warrior in cultural / velious gear.  It certainly wasnt uncommon for me to be grouping with knights who had upto 1k HPs unbuffed more than me in PoV.  Who are you going to let tank?<br />
<br />
So the 'problem' we have with class balance isn't just how to fix warriors in the XP game, but how to make warriors more effective in the tanking role at the PoP Tier 2/3 level without making them even more powerful at the PoP Tier 4/5 level or simplifying the game at the raiding level.<br />
<br />
Im not suprised the Dev's dont have the answer and haven't put in a 'fix' yet, because I've read almost every post on the topic on this board and several on other class boards over the pass 6-9 months, levelled my warrior and a chanter from 60-65 in PoS/V which has given me a good view of the 'problem' from both sides of the fence, and I wouldn't know where to start.</div></div><hr />
