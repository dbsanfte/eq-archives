Nope, it won't. I hope they'll still be adjusting knight aggro after this, especially pally low level stun aggro. However, giving us initial aggro and unlinked disciplines will greatly increase our desirability in both raid and group situations. We might actually be able to keep mobs off our casters on incoming on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Will the adjustment to DI give Warriors the survivability advantage they should have in exeriance groups and raids and overcome the affects of Plate/ALL armor and oceans of mana? <br />
<br />
Nope, probably not that either. They ARE two different situations though. 5% less damage taken now than before makes us much more desirable in groups, imo. Less damage taken means less need to heal, and better survivability with secondary healers.<br />
<br />
In raids, 5% less damage means a warrior can tank the same mob and take MUCH less peak damage. Let's take a doubling 5000 damage max hit mob, for example. A knight would need at least 10001 buffed hp to be assured that DI would go off. A warrior would need only 9501 hp for the same base survivability. That, of course, does not take defensive into account. Once a mob is trivial to tank, however (both classes have enough base hp), the change does us no real good.<br />
<br />
Is the the massive****tons of needed adjustment now in the game or is it in fact time to dye my armor red, grab a hammer and chase that &quot;POWER * UP!&quot; until WoW is released? <br />
<br />
More adjustment is in the works, I hope, and there will undoubtedly be fine tuning with the things we are getting. The amazing fact that they are actually talking to us on our boards gives me hope beyond any I had before.</div></div><hr />

Solid idea, don't rain on current issues, but raise your own separately.<br />
<br />
Are Shadow Knights or Paladins going to be overpowered with respect to Warriors after this is all done?<br />
<br />
I don't believe so, I really don't.<br />
<br />
Will the Warrior aggro control system:<br />
bow /w aggro proc<br />
bow aggro augment<br />
aggro weapon/s<br />
weapon aggro augment/s<br />
worn right-click weapon aggro buff item<br />

I believe pretty strongly that parity will be acheived before Raex BP and Aug'd Bow, DBoW, EoE level.    I actually think that if we push it in gear selection, we'll be ahead in terms of sustained aggro, which is right to do.  In other words, we CAN acheive greater aggro generation post-changes than our Knight bretheren *if* we choose to invest in that which produces the most aggro, if that's our goal.    Otherwise, we can be adequate while choosing another more damage oriented route of gear selection, or we can be adequate and well rounded, the choice is ours.    I'll probably try to gear myself up for two completely different scenarios, a damage role and an Aggro role.<br />
<br />
If not, will the differences affect Warriors in experiance groups or raids?<br />
<br />
Again, I believe we'll actually have the advantage on raids and will be plenty adequate in groups.<br />
<br />
Will the adjustment to DI give Warriors the survivability advantage they should have in exeriance groups and raids and overcome the affects of Plate/ALL armor and oceans of mana?<br />
<br />
If it remains implemented the way we believe (shaving a point off of DI if a 20 is rolled), then we'll certainly have the mitigation advantage on raids, but it will lessen significantly in exp scenarios, which is right to do, we cannot have an overadvantage in this area, as game balance relies on tradeoffs.<br />
<br />
Are Warriors balanced in PoTime raids and LDoN experiance groups?<br />
<br />
I believe they will be balanced in both scenarios<br />
<br />
Is the the massive****tons of needed adjustment now in the game or is it in fact time to dye my armor red, grab a hammer and chase that &quot;POWER * UP!&quot; until WoW is released?<br />
<br />
The changes themselves are phenominal and will breathe renewed life into the warrior class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets see.  I play a shaman as my main, and I can tell you, that 400 hate is usually more than my slow, and definately more than malo.  Thats how much instant hate belittle adds.  As I see it working, I or somoene else could pull, and I could land malo on inc, or use it to pull, and one hit of belittle and the warrior will have aggro, every time.  By the time my gems refresh, I will be able to slow, and not pull aggro, as the hate dot will have ticked by at least one tick by that point.  This is with me slowing as fast as possible, and just as fast as I would with a knight.<br />
<br />
So, I can play the same as if I had a knight, and the tank will have more hp's and mitigate noticably if not signifigantly better than a knight....sounds like warriors will be my #1 choice for grouping.  Clerics have always loved healing warriors, so that can only get better.  Melee never had a problem with warriors, as they dont climb the hate-list much faster than a warrior anyways, and have ways to lower themselves.  Seems to follow logic that fixing the only real problem with warriors (initial aggro) and even boosting them in lots of other ways will make them very much wanted in groups.<br />
<br />
One thing that I would like to see to finish off the warrior vs knight issue, code the provoke like to not be useable on a target if the dot is already on that target, cast by that warrior (keep it so multiple warriors can cast on the same mob), and reduce the reuse time to ~1-3 seconds, so a warrior can get aggro on mulitple mobs, just like a knight can cast stun/snare/etc on multiples to hold aggro on them all.  This system looks great, except for the fact that a pull of more than one mob will mean that the extras are all over the place.<br />
<br />
Provoke or its upgrades will provide instant aggro on demand, which is ALL that is really needed anyways.<br />
<br />
All I can think is about how bleak the outlook for grouping/exping is going to be for knights here in a few days.  Even if warriors aggro is lacking, EVERYONE will want to group with a warrior just to see the new system in action.  For at least a few days, if not weeks, I don't see knights getting any group invites, at least not as tank, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">knight HPs still need nerfed - what used to be a 15-20% hp advantage is now a 2% hp advantage.<br />
<br />
other than that, things look good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 'think' we'll probably get by ok in a group now, though rather than locking down every mob I reckon I'll actually be saving the provoke for if a mob skips off me rather than using it on first incoming - unless there's a cast iron garantee of one mob per pull. <br />
<br />
It'll be a great help if tanking two mobs, because previously the only way to lock 'em down was to spend time on them in melee, not particularly practical.<br />
<br />
When push comes to shove, personally I'd have preferred high endurance costs, fast reuse as the trade off. I dislike the 'straightjacketing' reuse time and can't help chuckling at the wierd logic that continues to state that knight like aggro for a warrior is somehow 'overpowered' in comparison, especially given how many work arounds are currently used to make aggro a non-issue on raids...  but beggars can't be choosers.<br />
<br />
The random opening system is gonna be pretty academic as far as class balance is concerned I think, most of the abilities won't mean squat without the ability to dictate when they become available, particularly if the defensive ones cancel disciplines as was mentioned somewhere(?).<br />
<br />
Discs on new timers adds a little fun not sure of the impact in exp.<br />
<br />
All the changes together will, imho, boost the warrior's role as premier raid tank by a large margin. <br />
<br />
Shame i don't raid. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps some didn't notice this was in the outhouse.<br />
<br />
When choosing an experiance group MT -<br />
<br />
We've established that Warriors will:<br />
<br />
Not have a meaningful survivability advantage<br />
<br />
Have improved aggro ability vs. one mob only and otherwise lesser aggro control vs. multiple mob pulls<br />
<br />
Have a DPS advantage vs. Paladins offset by their ability to reduce damage taken by the group by using stuns and our need to weild aggro weapons and equal or less DPS than SK's.<br />
<br />
Not be able to Root, heal, buff, or Res.<br />
<br />
On paper I would still take a Knight as experiance group MT over a Warrior. Paladins in particular can do anything a Warrior can do and much much more. Why would you take a Warrior?<br />
<br />
Aggree Valeris,<br />
Like Defensive or AE Taunt, Provoke will likely be &quot;saved&quot; for those situations that demand it's use in experiance MTing.<br />
<br />
Aggree Mystaviant<br />
If your group single-pulls Warriors will be fine. However in the heaviest trafficed experiance zones in the game, LDoN, nobody single pulls.<br />
 <br />
It's not that Provoke isn't useful, but the 30 second reuse timer even on a different mob is wrong-headed given Paladin and SK aggro control.<br />
<br />
Now I can accept any logical argument that shows Knights will not have preference as LDoN experiance group MT's but if yer going to spout a mouthful of platitudes, the BS threads are in the other forums.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you mean warriors won't have a meaningful survivability advantage? Do you ever use disciplines in a group? If you did, then you'd see at least a little advantage right there. Being able to pop off furious or fortitude for &quot;oh shit&quot; situations, being able to defensive for any trains... add to that an INNATE increase in mitigation over our already superior tanking abilities and you have a very significant survivability advantage. Unlinking emergency disciplines and defensive disciplines is one of the most significant changes proposed.<br />
<br />
Where a warrior and a knights hp/ac start approaching the same level is high end raiding, until then warriors still have a fair edge. Even EP level warriors still have a good chunk more hp than the knights. Warriors are ALREADY better at surviving than knights are, we just weren't enough better to warrent a spot.<br />
<br />
  The disadvantage warriors had before was that their aggro sucked comparatively to the damage received. Add aggro, add better tanking and give us the ability to use our disciplines when needed and you've given us a HUGE improvement. We might not be better than knights with these changes so far, but we're at least competitive now and hopefully over the top with openings and the new disciplines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because the equipment you have on gives you more hp right now than the Paladins/Shadowknights that have yet to get that equipment for themselves doesn't mean that advantage is there forever.</div></div><hr />

Stop the speculation, it's bad for your own morale.     <br />
<br />
I can tell you from experience that the provoke line will be used FAR more often by *skilled* warriors than &quot;in an emergency&quot;, it takes NO MORE than 30 seconds to refresh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My comparison was intended to show what Warriors use (if they can get them all) to do aggro control and the simple elegance of the Knight system, which it is also worth noting is more powerful in a number of applications. Knights generally don't use the full range of props because they don't have to.<br />
<br />
Frodlin,<br />
<br />
It is entirely true thing are being changed. But during this process it's legitimate to go beyond waving pom poms and ask if the changes are adressing well-known problems.<br />
<br />
1. Plate/ALL has caused the Warrior HP advantage to all but disappear.<br />
<br />
2. In LDoN mobs hit for 200-300 HP's allowing many many classes to tank effectively creating more competition.<br />
<br />
3. Particularly in LDoN, the tendancy to min/max drives players to want to fight without pulling and generally be fighting multiple mobs. Some tanks are particularly well-suited for this - Warriors are not.<br />
<br />
4. Itemization has made it possible for non-Warriors to MT boss mobs perhaps sooner than expected.<br />
<br />
Now maybe the changes being made will affect these dynamics. If so it should be able to explain how they will.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that the changes needed to address the full range of issues are too great to even attempt at this time. Perhaps the changes that can be made are being made and a mechanism for tuning pure melee down the road is being put in place. If so, then they should just say so.<br />
<br />
However, responces like &quot;WOW THIS IS TEH WIN!!!!&quot; is not an answer to these questions. Or are some of us forgetting not too many months ago it was &quot;Classes are not that out of balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please forgive the sceptics who read:<br />
<br />
&quot;The changes are phenominal....&quot; and question it.<br />
<br />
addendum:<br />
For me, the LDoN problem may be solved by choosing LDoN hard. Players don't want 5 mobs in camp generally and wannabe tanks don't attempt it. Now if they made the reward AP's = 125 (for example) the high-level min/maxers would see this as worth pursuing and provide more Warrior MT opprotunities. If anything the new changes should make Warriors more effective in this environment.<br />

I still think tweaking should be done on LDoN so a variety of challenge can be made . . . even beyond what is currently hard, for different rewards.  <br />
<br />
I think yeah the points could be adjusted alittle more to make people want to do hard vs normal, but from where i sit it's fairly worth it already.  Still i certainly wouldn;t mind increasing the points . . . however this is seriously getting off topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Battleblade,<br />
<br />
Had you not completely glossed over my original post to continue with the pessimsm based on speculation, then perhaps I'd have reacted differently.   Go back and re-read... I was pretty clear, I have tested these changes, and continue to do so.<br />
<br />
1. Plate/ALL has caused the Warrior HP advantage to all but disappear.<br />
<br />
And it's being replaced with something completely better than that, which is a margin of safety... the benefit to mitigation, ESPECIALLY the way this one has been implemented is that at the worst times, the warrior shines the most.    HP are a terrible way of balancing because their impact is almost surreal in their lack of importance once past the threshold of CH.<br />
<br />
2. In LDoN mobs hit for 200-300 HP's allowing many many classes to tank effectively creating more competition.<br />
<br />
So do hard missions, or do multiple tank groups.   They're common in LDoN.<br />
<br />
3. Particularly in LDoN, the tendancy to min/max drives players to want to fight without pulling and generally be fighting multiple mobs. Some tanks are particularly well-suited for this - Warriors are not.<br />
<br />
I disagree vehemently, warriors are, with the changes *extremely* well suited for this type of fighting, particularly if they use their heads.   If your aggro is a problem on multiple pulls, then you're not being the puller, that one change will save you much headache... AE taunt will, /shield will, RAMPAGE will and that's just the tools we have now.   Adding the ability to hate dot an incoming mob and jumping on the other tanking it, with AE taunt and the ability to redo the aggro dot will very likely allow you to tank TWO mobs at once.    <br />
<br />
4. Itemization has made it possible for non-Warriors to MT boss mobs perhaps sooner than expected.<br />
<br />
Thing is, it's being addressed, the mitigation issue is PRECISELY to deal with this problem.   The survivability gap between warrior and non warrior is much larger now.<br />
<br />
Now maybe the changes being made will affect these dynamics. If so it should be able to explain how they will.<br />
<br />
Read the above, let me know what you think, but please, dont' ignore it and continue on the pessimism party.    Also, you should know there were few people more fervent than me about the issues warriors had....and I'm really optimistic... <br />
<br />
It's also possible that the changes needed to address the full range of issues are too great to even attempt at this time. Perhaps the changes that can be made are being made and a mechanism for tuning pure melee down the road is being put in place.<br />
<br />
They'll fix almost every issue we have<br />
<br />

Thanks for the responce. While it did not contain too much hard information beyond Frodlin assures you it fixes things, it helped.<br />

Part of the attitude adjustment problem is education.<br />

If DI is set to 19 will Warriors take less damage from a 3000HP unresistable DD or a 500HP per tic DoT? If not, would a real Warrior HP advantage help?<br />

<br />
Well, I to my knowledge have posted in the other thread the most comprehensive aggro review of knight vs. warrior available at this time based on changes.    I dont' know what kind of additional information you would like.<br />
<br />
If DI is set to 19 will Warriors take less damage from a 3000HP unresistable DD or a 500HP per tic DoT? If not, would a real Warrior HP advantage help?<br />
<br />
No, a DI advantage won't stop 10k falls or deathtouches either, and to be real frank, if a mob has a primarily spell based attack, I'm gonna seriously consider a paladin with sanctification anyhow.   Realistically, almost every mob in EQ is melee based, or delivers a HUGE chunk of damage via melee.   Citing the exception to the rule to justify an advantage which would be over the top would be bad.   I look at the description of a warrior and it tells me that I'm supposed to be the best at standing toe to toe with opponents, the means in melee, it says nothing about &quot;I'm the best at taking spell damage&quot; although I am... it says nothing about &quot;I'm the best at absorbing high damage dots&quot; although I am.    I think that the benefits of being the best at absorbing melee damage exceed any additional &quot;needs&quot; based on esoteric events which are rare beyond belief.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another part of the problem is glossing over the effects of LDoN and then suggesting that Warriors look at LDoN hard. This admits that LDoN Easy is too easy and may create competition problems for Warriors doesn't it?<br />
<br />
Actually, no... competition isn't a &quot;problem&quot;, and to be real frank, I like LDoN normal the way it is.   If a beastlord or ranger or shaman wants to tank in LDoN normal then this isnt' a problem... LDoN Normal was designed around allowing the greatest possible group versatility and shattering the &quot;min/max&quot; or &quot;ultimate group&quot; mold and I think it's succeeded.   I dont' mind having &quot;competition&quot; as long as I bring something of inherent value to the table.    I bring something of inherent value to LDoN normal, but I dont' want to have a little &quot;reserved for warrior&quot; sign on every group that's made, that would be dead wrong.<br />
<br />
And since you are in an explaining mood - can you explain why adjusting the Provoke line's hate produced, duration of the DoT, and reuse timer to 15 seconds would be wrong?<br />
<br />
1. The hate value is fine, because it's already incredibly powerful we dont need a &quot;press this button to glue the mob to you for the restof the fight&quot; button.  <br />
<br />
2. The duration is fine because the dot doesn't even wear off before the skill refreshes.<br />
<br />
3. See above for the refresh time.<br />

It's simply put... asking for too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for the responces. It's perfectly fine to know the facts and disagree.<br />
<br />
It's my understanding that setting DI=19 for Warriors affects primarily raid level mobs and melee damage. Traditionally Warriors have had an advantage in maximum HP's. While this still exists, the percentage of this advantage has dropped over time. Maximum HP can affect survivabiity in ways the new change does not. Warrior should be &quot;unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; This has never been restricted to melee damage only. If fighting Quarm doesn't qualify as a brutal battle, then it's difficult to know what does. It's OK to say &quot;You're right BB, but they aren't going to do anything about it.&quot; or a real HP advantage (say innate 10% total) plus DI=19 is gamebreaking.<br />
<br />
Instead of shattering min/max, LDoN has raised it to new levels. Players strive to complete an &quot;Adventure&quot; in 20 minutes. This tends to favor classes with pets, CC ability, and snap aggro on demand. This has the effect of hanging a &quot;Warriors need not apply&quot; sign on the door.<br />
<br />
A Hard LDoN adventure has a bit more risk and typically takes 40 minutes of sustained effort to complete. In these missions, Warrior survivability is an advantage. In my view an adjustment upward of the AP's awarded to reflect the greater risk and aproximately twice as much time to complete would give Warrior more tanking opprotunities to offset those lost because anyone can and does tank LDoN easy. Now it's perfectly reasonable to respond that the quality of drops in LDoN Hard is adequate additional compensation. My experiance has been that getting a drop is fairly iffy and significantly extends the risk/time spent in LDoN Hard vs. hunting down named mobs in LDoN Easy. SoE might have this right and it's merely a player issue.<br />
<br />
My point in raising LDoN is not because I think only Warriors should tank. However it should be recognized that if the highest trafficed zones in the game are CC/ranged snap aggro on demand MT's prefered it does affect Warrior group opprotunity. If someone wants to respond that they believe the changes overall will help in this area, that's reasonable. Denying the effect exists and even if it did it doesn't affect Warriors IMO is not.<br />
<br />
I was apparently misunderstood in what I was saying about the Provoke line. Even if the Initial Hate and Hate/tic had to be halved, reducing the reuse time to 15 seconds  would give Warriors closer to the ranged aggro on demand abilities of Knights given their reuse times. It this reuse time was not asking to much for Knights, it is not asking too much for Warriors. Please note, this is a question. It's possible Warriors will have, given all the ways they must use to achieve aggro, sufficient flexibility in their ability to respond to multiple mobs. It's also possible that the differences between Warrior and Knight aggro confer an offsetting advantage to Warriors that makes up for less flexability.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm  warming up to the new changes. I am concerned that they &quot;fix&quot; as many Warrior problems as possible. Concidering that SoE was convinced that &quot;Melees aren't that far out of balance.&quot;, the extent of the changes indicate upon closer examination our concerns were not without merit.<br />

1) Aggro on demand<br />
2) Inherent mitigation bonus over every other class<br />
3) Unlinked disciplines<br />
<br />
And you are still complaining?  This is the biggest boost to a single class I can remember (granted, I started midway through Kunark, so I missed the early days.)<br />
<br />
Raid tanking for knights is done.  With the exception of /disc fearless on two mobs, we no longer have any place in the raid tanking world.  Sustained aggro generation for a warrior with Anger III augments is already crazy, now add provoke to get over the initial aggro hump, and there just isn't a need for knights to tank.<br />
<br />
The xp tanking gap is closed.  Shammies are reporting from test that they can now slow on inc with warrior tanks.  Wizzies are nuking like they have knight tanks.  All this in addition to an innate mitigation advantage that I can never encroach upon.<br />
<br />
Based on testing that has already been done, warriors have 'good enough' initial hate, superior sustained hate generation, and an unmatchable mitigation edge over knights.<br />
<br />
What more could you possibly want?  You will be the only choice for raid tank, and the #1 choice for xp tank.  Gratz on your improvements, goodness knows your class has languished for a while.  But I'm serving up a steaming cup of STFU for you to drink with your whines.  They are illogical and contradictory to the results that are being reported from test.</div></div><hr />

It's ranged aggro on demand every 30 seconds. Would 30 seconds be a good reuse time for stuns even if they produced the same hate?<br />
<br />
Reported results? Not as universally happy as you'd indicate. Check the last few posts here for starters -<br />

there are others. On both Monkly Business and The Safehouse players are insisting their DPS adjustments are out of whack and they have concerns about the new Discipline system.<br />
<br />
Some testers report the disciplines don't stack.<br />
[edit: apparantly they do and this was a temporary bug on test]<br />
<br />
And the biggest boost to any class arguably occured to Paladins between Kunark and the present. Not only was their melee-side improved substantially, but so was their caster-side.<br />
<br />
BTW, come back and bring cheese if as Furor suggests low level stun aggro is going to get adjusted. Level 9 aggro spells and you criticize Warriors who are concerned about if they are balanced? pffft.<br />

Keep up the good work in critiquing the proposed changes. Now, while the changes are in the current stages, is the best time to do it. Every angle presented is a valuable one; both from my perspective as a warrior, and the developers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;This is the biggest boost to a single class I can remember &quot;<br />
<br />
Boosts I would classify as being bigger than provoke (in no particular order):<br />
<br />
- The original Treant Fists. A far bigger impact for a monk than provoke will ever be for a warrior.<br />
<br />
- The original Donal's BP of Mourning.<br />
<br />
- Giving Beastlords a mana and hp regen spell that stacks with everything. This gave the class a defined role and useful ability for raids and group situations. A huge boost for a class that at the time, had very little role in the game.<br />
<br />
- Extended Notes AA. A pretty gamebreaking AA when used properly. I hear it's now being tweaked on test.<br />
<br />
- Endless Quiver and Archery Mastery AAs. Talk about class redefining. Archery was a toy before these. Afterwards, it helped define rangers. Quite a worthy boost, imo.<br />
<br />
- Changes to backstab damage, and the addition of double backstab. Talk about sweeping and character boosting! Giving rogues the role they now are commonly accepted for. That was quite a heady boost.<br />
<br />
- While we're on the subject of rogues, Shroud of Stealth. The end result is rogues have become the premiere corpse recovery class in the game. It was a boost in CR power above what was previously there.<br />
<br />
- DoT stacking changes for necromancers. This boosted their group-ability, as well as their raid function. And gave them a HUGE DPS boost in both groups and raids. A very good change, and a very huge boost.<br />
<br />
- Druid and Shaman mini-complete heals. A huge boost to their in-game power.<br />
<br />
This is just some stuff I came up with off of the top of my head. I'm sure many other EQ players here can remember some past changes which were huge boosts in power (ala the rogue changes), or gamebreaking effects that never should have gone live (ala the treant fists quest).<br />
<br />
Is provoke a boost? Yes.<br />
<br />
Is it a huge boost? Yes.<br />
<br />
Is it the biggest boost to a single class in the history of EQ? I wouldn't go that far. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My concern remains with the lack of flexibility in the reuse time. particularly in light of Wandor's (a knowledgeable type that plays a wizard main) posts in the provoke thread in the arena.<br />
<br />
The problem is not other classes being able to control their agro (unless you are grouped with an idiot). The problem is that with a knight, there is no NEED to control your agro. In all cases, control agro = less DPS, which by default makes a warrior a worse tank since the group overall does less damage. This is going to address that problem, rather handily I think.<br />
<br />
From a wizard standpoint, I really like these changes. It will allow me to nuke bigger early in the fight. As it stands, in exp situations, I am totally gimped by a warrior tank. I have to nuke easy early in the fight, or in some cases not nuke at all. This not only drops the amount of damage I am able to contibute, but it kills any mana efficiency advantage I would get from using a better nuke.<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
Like Doggabone has already pointed out, you are completely misquoting me. I don't want warriors to have agro lock, I want warriors to have a chance to keep agro off me. Right now, I can't do my job when a warrior is tanking for an exp group. Sure if he gets some lucky procs early then I can do some hurting, but if he doesn't, I am hosed and at best an exp leech, but more often a liability because I am using healer mana that would be better spent healing the tank. Believe me, it's not like I don't have the tools to work with, it's a matter of game mechanics. When I am having to click 3 or 4 concussions to get a mob off me after a single nuke, there is something wrong.<br />
<br />
Now this ties in rather closely with a recent experience of mine where a wizard, who hadn't gotten hit at all during an LDoN mission with me said (last thing I saw before the desktop screen as I logged out) 'Just as long as it's not another warrior, lol' <br />
<br />
He never got hurt which leads me to believe that it was - as Wandor describes -  the requirement to walk on eggshells compared with a knight when I was tanking that put him off.<br />
<br />
When envisioning my useage of the hate dot i expected it to be supplemental to my usual control and thus the 30 second reuse didn't seem particularly worriesome. If as Wandor says it's pretty much essential to hate dot every mob to be sufficiently competative vis a vis knight aggro for the casters interests, then suddenly the lack of flexibility becomes that much more of a concern. <br />
<br />
Whenever I look back to a exp. group i've actually enjoyed there has often been a need for flexibility in choice of targets depending on how the situation develops, If the perception is that I MUST use the hate dot on any mob that the party engages (or else the feeling that warriors can't hold aggro well enough persists) then during the next 30 seconds (which can be a short time or can be a long time depending on how events progress :p) I loose any tactical flexibility in it's useage.<br />
<br />
My main question is why a fast reuse should be considered overpowered? <br />
<br />
If it's stacking that is the concern might it not be possible to code it so that a provoke from the same warrior will not overwrite any other provokes by that warrior until the duration ends? Thus you could allow multiple useage of provokes - with attendant endurance costs- against multiple targets without 'overpowering' the ability? The opportunity costs of a particular warrior not being able to revisit the mob with his provoke until the duration ends  seems fairly minor to me. <br />
<br />
Given the similarities to Furor's damage dot idea that you championed so vigorously Frod, I'd be interested in your comments on this especially given the 'multi-tanking' aspect of that idea.<br />
<br />
I'd go so far as to suggest that I would prefer a little less aggro gain from the skill so long as i had the flexibility to address any upcoming 'situations' at need (i.e. more in the region of 10 second reuse)....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While I view the changes are in the right direction, I separate implimentation changes with balancing changes. From that statement above it seems some are blending the two. <br />
<br />
Implimentation changes are unlocking disciplines, and placing them on timers. Establishing pure melee future scalability via an endurance system not unlike that of spells and mana. Allowing text sensitive information such as taunt failure to the player character. The endurance system, in and of itself, doesn't resolve balance, it just provides a different avenue to address the balance issues where SOE's current structure had difficulty.<br />
<br />
Balancing changes are ranged taunt via the implimentation above. Personally, I consider this the biggest improvement for warriors on test so far. <br />
<br />
With regard to the mitigation differential, I see that as a retro fix due to itemization issues, and not a fix to itemization itself(I'm optimistic though that SOE will factor in itemization concerns in future expansions). If someone wishes to call that the biggest boost in EQ history, then they would have to say it was due to the biggest loss in EQ history - arguably not making up fully the loss. We were just given something back that was, for the most part, taken from us. If future expansions are released without addressing itemization issues then problems will continue.<br />
<br />
The feats and actions brought via opportunities seem interesting, and the feedback seems good; those noting where improvements are needed to make it good game play. We will just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
I am impressed with the acknowlegment from SOE of the deficit facing the pure melee. The recent posts from developers in these forums, and their desire for us to critique them, suggests alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am a mid-EP geared warrior, and there are knights in my guild who surpass BOTH my ac and hp.  Individual cases are not the best comparison - theoretical magelo prfiles are.  And theoretical magelo prfiles show that warriors have about a 400 hp advantage in elementals.  Thats a 5% difference... it goes down under 4% in full Time gear.  It *used to be* 20%...<br />
<br />
I think you folks who are downplaying the importance of the HP advantage are getting distracted by all the new candy, to the point you arent noticing the fact that one of the two major problems warriors have had for 3-4 expansions is not being affected by it at all.<br />
<br />
The new system is doing two things for us:<br />
1.  giving us good agro.  This is needed, and asked for.<br />
2.  giving us a bunch of silly toys.  This is not needed, and was not asked for.<br />
<br />
Warriors have always, from EQ1.0 to early velious, enjoyed a 10-20% HP advantage relative to knights.  These HPs served us well in many ways, from AE to proc damage to melee damage and CH efficiency.<br />
<br />
Starting late in velious, and continuing in every expansion since then, this advantage has been taken away.<br />
<br />
It would be beyond foolish to not address this now, while melee balancing is going on - Do you really think we'll get another chance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm certainly not frod, but I think I can shed some light on the issue.<br />
Note: this assumes that the 30 second timer doesn't apply for all skills in the provoke line, and that lesser skills won't stack with higher end skills (no provoke and belittle on the same target).<br />
<br />
2 mobs are incoming.  For the second mob to be tanked (not the primary target), drop belittle on him as he enters camp.  Switch to your main target, throw out the second tier skill (the name escapes me).  Voila; solid, sustained aggro on multiple targets.  This can be applied to more than 2 mobs, of course...just use more aggro skills.  Also, you can change the orientation of particular skills on mobs in relation to the order in which you want to kill them.  Belittle the main target so slow can be cast immediately, drop the lower levels on secondary targets so the hate over time can stew.  There are many possibilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">arf arf<br />
<br />
To my recollection, the provoke line is on one timer.  Given that as an assumption,  I would probably Belittle one on INC, switch to the other critter while whatever  CC the group is using gets used on the Belittle'd.  This should give me time to establish aggro before the non-melee are on the MOB that I'm on.  (Without a Provoke, I have been ablo to hold aggro on the first engage of a double MOB almost every single time - I can't remember exceptions but I assume there have been some.  But the second has often been difficult.)  Wait for clean up heals and slows and such, taunt the CC'd add (if there's time) until I know I've succeeded, then Belittle for a leg up on aggro and engage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the hate dot aspect of it.   As other were saying, I'll end up belittiling the one I dont' intend to tank, and tankt he one the &quot;old fashined way&quot;.   If stuff goes bad, I save the belittle for the add and use AE taunt/rampage judiciously.</div></div><hr />

Not a flame at all, just wanted to point out that I was lumping all the warrior changes together.<br />
<br />
The mitigation increase, combined with aggro on demand, unlinked disciplines, and a new opening system, implemented together, is an improvement on par with EQ/AM3 and the others that you mentioned.<br />
<br />
I am struggling to imagine a single scenario, other than raid mobs that require fearless, where anyone in their right mind would choose a knight to tank over a warrior once the proposed changes go in.  That's a huge change from the current state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the mitigation change appears not to effect melee damage from mobs with lower DI values it will not do much in places like LDoN Easy or for lower level Warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors will not be receiving a HP boost it appears. Thus Paladins can be just as beefy as a Warriors if they obtain equipment.<br />
<br />
For me, the only open questions are unlinked disciplines and the power-up.<br />
<br />
Other than that, these changes appear to give Warriors an initial ranged aggro ability which was definately needed and increased mitigation vs. high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
Paladins still have all of the characteristics needed to be prefered over Warriors in many experiance groups.<br />
<br />
None of these changes will prevent well-equipped Paladins from MTing PoTime mobs.<br />

I'd say Paladins are more than fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Provoke line will bring Warrior aggro control past the 'good enough' line for experience groups.  It won't be identical to Knight aggro control, and there will still be some things that Knights can do that Warriors cannot.  However, a Warrior will be able to keep one mob glued to him, and have a credible chance to truly tank two mobs at the same time.  This is a huge increase for Warriors.<br />
<br />
In the LDoN (normal) missions I play in, if 4-5 mobs are pulled, I cannot gain aggro on all of them quickly (if at all).   A couple usually get mezzed or rooted off to the side and I grab 2 or maybe 3 within the first ten seconds.  A Warrior will be able to grab 2 fairly reliably in these situations without using AE Taunt.<br />
<br />
With the increase in Warrior aggro control, some of the advantages that a Paladin tank had are minimized.  Warriors will get quick, reliable aggro on single pulls.  Mobs will be able to be slowed on incoming.  Other classes will be able to open up early in the fight.  Warriors will be able to use more damaging weapons combinations without drastically damaging their ability to tank.<br />
<br />
Look at the healing situation for instance.  With the ability to glue single pulled mobs to the tank, there is no loss in healing efficiency due to ping-pong aggro.  The mob can be slowed on incoming, reducing the amount of damage taken from an unslowed mob.  The tank is the only character that gets healed.  In most camps, a single Cleric or Druid will be able to keep up easily.  Since other classes can open up earlier and Warriors themselves will do more DPS because they are using more damaging weapons.  Fights will be shorter, further reducing the amount of healing needed.  A Cleric could feasibly stun the mob early in the fight to reduce unslowed damage even further.  <br />
<br />
As for decreasing the re-use timer on Provoke, I  think it can wait for a while.  Let's see how the changes in total affect balance, and let the initial euphoria/disgust/whatever wear off so that we can really analyze what is happening here.  I understand wanting to use the initial opportunity to get everything you think you might ever need.   But I don't think it is always the wise way to go.<br />
<br />
No, the changes do not address every aspect of every situations that could be viewed as an advantage to Paladins.  Yes, Paladins will be able to do everything they could do previously.  However, there will be less reason for a group to wait until they find one instead of grabbing LFG_Warrior_01 instead.  <br />
<br />
In closing, I think the changes are more than most Warriors expected.  I think they do a good job of addressing the most glaring Warrior weaknesses without being overkill.  I think that Warriors will be much more group-friendly in most situations, including LDoN normal.  I think that Paladins will eventually lose their disproportionate share of experience group tanking roles.  I would expect, for example, the average BoT experience group to not consider passing over a LFG Warrior in hopes for a Paladin after these changes have had a while to get settled in.<br />
