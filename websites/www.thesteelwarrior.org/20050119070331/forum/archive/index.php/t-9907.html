<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been on the lookout in the bazaar for decent neck, face, and earring ac wise but nothing is catching my eye that isn't overpriced. I have around 200k. (I don't see myself leveling to 65 anytime soon to zone into MPG for the rot neck and earring.) Absolutely no ldon.<br />
<br />
For neck I have Shattered Emerald Necklace (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=40211) and Articulated Battleleader Gorget (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70115) which really is only a boost in dex and charisma, my stamina is maxed with clickie. <br />
<br />
I use Grimling Contraption (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=51255) and hate the ac. Amy Mask has always been overpriced so that's not an option.<br />
<br />
Earrings are Ear Symbol of the Veteran (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6509) and Blood Earring of Rage (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6507). Want at least the same ac plus more hp.<br />
<br />
Would a fungi be any help to me at my level now? Maybe for quickening up my down time? I've never actually used a fungi I've owned. (I solo mostly is why I ask)<br />
<br />
Any other comments are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be inclined to level if I were you, as 4362 hps and 1320-something AC are pretty good for a lvl 56 warrior, and leveling would be the fastest way to more power.<br />
If solo down tiime is a truly significant problem, and you're committed to soloing you could put some AA points into first aid and be able to BW to 100%. But I ssuspect you know that and also that that's not a standard general AA choice.<br />
What are you doing for haste? (Sorry, need more coffee if I'm going to think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Change your back item to the loyalist shield, it is fat on AC.  It is quest item and there are other threads on it.  Yes, it is a pain to do.  Keep your current back piece for the clicky effect.<br />
<br />
I had a grimling contraption at one time and liked the idea of the regen on it, but AC/hp/stats on other face items is more important  IMO.  You will also find as you level up more and hunt higher zones such as in WoS, you end up with a fair amount of regen.<br />
<br />
I agree that he is doing well for his level, and should level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">save your plat, go level.  the rest will come to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using tribute haste.<br />
<br />
Loyalist should is far too much of a pain for me to even attempt. <br />
<br />
I am leveling at the same time but I level slowly and do not picture myself going into wos any time soon. <br />
<br />
Guess I'll buy a fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should reconsider about doing the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest.  There ins't a much better back slot out there for the non-hp obsessed Tank.  And Quest really isn't all that hard.  Untill the last part that is.<br />
<br />
Also, I agree with the above poster that said you should level.  Don't work on AAs until at least 60 - With the exception of Run3, which IMHO everyone should get.<br />
<br />
Groups aren't exactly growing on trees these days though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ashes for the last part are tradeable, so in theory you can buy these for a reasonable sum.<br />
<br />
As far as buying a fungi, you might consider camping the regen bp from Riwii.  I would have to check but I do not remember a lvl restriction on it.<br />
<br />
Only decent affordable upgrade I can see for you is Horned Spiked shoulders from PON from Vhakis or however you spell it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horn Spiked Shoulders and Ashes are quite rare and usually overpriced. But I will keep an eye out for them as usual.<br />
<br />
Rather spend 60k then camp Baleful Blood Soaked Cuirass endlessly :/<br />
<br />
Planning on getting to 60 and doing a few aa's or getting flags but I don't play much, friday and weekends. I usually come into money easier than exp. Getting upgrades is the only thing I can do, saddness.</div></div><hr />
