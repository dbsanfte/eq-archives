<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone.  I'm looking for input on good places to PL myself (62 War) with a 56 druid I have access to.  Yes, I know he isn't the best to PL with, but its all I have access to.  I also realize grouping would be much faster, but my play time often dictates that I can only play an hour or two at a time, so I may not be able to group that much.<br />
<br />
Warrior's gear is okay, and can slow with a ToD.  FG isn't too bad, I get about 1% regular xp every 3 kills, but I wonder if there's some place faster/more effecient that I could park the War and Druid at, log on whenever I can, an get some kills.  <br />
<br />
I've been out of the game for about 8 months, so any help/insight would be appreciated.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once the Druid gets 58 your life will be much easier (3k heal) but until then you could try PoD or PoN or Veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, aye, PL isn't really the right word.  Maybe...uhhh...kind of heal me and stuff?  I was thinking about Veksar, seems to have some doable mobs, and I've never seen it.  But your right, maybe I should just solo him up to 58 and go from there.</div></div><hr />

or even FG</div></div><hr />

so whatever was good xp pre pop<br />
which is Hole / Sebelis / Velektor / Karnors / HS / ME (charm wolf) maybe veksar but those are pretty much pop mobs so doubt it. Forget the stupid trucheon of doom you will be probably doing half of dps your should be doing with that thing if not less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvil</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 62 druid on my other acct and honestly, after  I hit 55 I ditched him.  I would say your best bet is to first go lfg for a couple minutes, and then if you get nothing, go to some kunark or luclin zones.  With the druids limited healing, buffs, and lack of slow (or loss of DPS since your slowing with ToD), groups are really the best way to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">groups always the best way to go however nothing is stoping me from 2 boxing my druid and having a good time. I can be mean healer and tank in group or 2 box just fine my gear and lvls allows me to do it in pop now thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I occasionally 2-box a 65 war and 59 druid. We can handle Umbral Planes and Maidens easily with no downtime. I use willsapper to slow.<br />
<br />
PoI/PoN might be doable, but I hate crowds. Umbral and Maidens are nice and quiet on my server.</div></div><hr />
