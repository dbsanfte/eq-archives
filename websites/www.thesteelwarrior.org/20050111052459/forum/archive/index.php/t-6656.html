<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2box a 59 Cleric &amp; 60 Warrior, about 99% of the time that I play EQ. On occasion I have a mage or necro around lv 57 that I group with. I have hunted in the hole since around lv 54, on Destroyed Constructs and have gotten pretty good exp/loot for the last several level. The entire time I was around exactly 1/2 a level above the cleric. I noticed around lv 58 that the warrior seemed to be pulling ahead of the cleric even thou warrior and cleric never get exp outside of being grouped together. I didnt pay much attention to this fact until the warrior hit lv 60 last week and the cleric was around 4 blue into 59. This last week I have hunted in Veksar, POI, POD, and The Hole. The warrior is now 4 yellows into lv 60 and the cleric is barely pushing into the 5th yellow of 59.  Both characters are dwarfs and have leveled together since their creation. I have never noticed a difference in exp gain untill now. My question is now that the warrior is lv 60 is there some exp bonus he is getting? I ask on this board since its the only board I visit and I know lots of warriors like to 2 box with a shaman or cleric. Has anyone ever noticed this type of difference in exp gain when 2 boxing at the higher levels?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really?  I had no idea warriors got an xp bonus.  That would explain why I am level 55 and everyone else I play with, clr, ench, shm are all 54.  I thought it was just because I xp'd a few times without them and they died a few times doing things without me.</div></div><hr />

everything else is 0% I think. Correct me if I'm off on those numbers.<br />

So that means an Ogre Warrior gets a 25% xp bonus?</div></div><hr />

I knew Ogres took an xp penalty.  Really I did.   :confused:</div></div><hr />

Basicly the cleric was half way through lv 59 when the warrior hit 60, now the warrior is going to ding 61 at the same time the cleric dings 60, if not before her. That doesnt make since and that a lot more exp bonus than the +5% bonus warriors get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60 is a much &quot;smaller&quot; level than 59. That is why the warrior is nearly 61 now.<br />
<br />
And by smaller I mean it takes much less exp to go through level 60 than it does 59.<br />
<br />
Also, have the cleric and warrior both died the EXACT same amount of times and gotten the same exact percentage rez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I do 2 box a cleric, that means I always get 96% resses if I die, however, I rarely die. I cant even remember dieing anytime recently. If I do die, 2 boxing I can always tell when things turn for the worst and usualy 9 outa 10 times the cleric can always gate out and come back to ress the warrior. So if anything it should slow his progress down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">classes:<br />
warriors / rogues - 10% xp bonus<br />
all other classes are the same<br />
<br />
races:<br />
halflings - 5% xp bonus<br />
trolls - 15% xp penalty<br />
ogre/iksar - 20% xp penalty<br />
<br />
<br />
AA xp is not effected by these bonuses/penalties.<br />
<br />
As in regards to your situation level 60 is very short xp level where lvl 59 is huge. Cleric will catch up at 61.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 60 is fast...I think it's about the equivalent of going from 51 to 52, whereas 59 is just like any other level...slightly harder than the one before it.  You're cleric will blow through 60 just like the warrior did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm.. close but not quite.. iksar and troll get -20% xp penalty<br />
Ogres are -15%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the class bonus or penalty was removed some time ago.... hence so many whiny hybrids....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its 10% bonus I am certain. Here is the table made with show EQ<br />
xp tables (http://hackersquest.org/html/xp/xpchart.html) <br />
<br />
By the way its a little outdated, since class penalties were removed, but all the bonuses stayed. Race penalty/bonuses stayed the same.<br />
<br />
I did goof troll/ogre/iksar penalty. Here is the correct list:<br />
halfling - 5 % bonus<br />
<br />
troll/iksar - 20% penalty<br />
ogre - 15% penalty</div></div><hr />
