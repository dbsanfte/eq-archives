<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Michil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 65 Warrior with 47 AA's. I did most of the AA's that raise my hit points first. I'm now working on my defensive AA's.<br />
My guild is just getting ready to move into the planes, I have just a couple chara flags.  I am the raidleader for my guild, and we only have a couple Warrior's.<br />
My question is after the new expansion goes live do I level up or do I contuine to work on AA's ?  My exp is split atm 80% to AA's, 20% to regular exp.<br />
My concern is that if I level up it will be harder to get the AA exp that I need at the higher level, and since we are just getting ready to start into the planes I feel that I need the AA's more.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your opinions on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When it comes to game mechanics, 5 levels is going to be more beneficial then CA3/CS3/LR5/ID5, even though those are extremely important.  You are right in the fact that xping for AA in say, BoT, wont have the same benefit it does now, as some of those mobs may be light blue.<br />
<br />
The way AA works, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while since the last level cap raise, is if at level 60, a dark blue mob gives you 2% AA, as long as that mob is dark blue, he'll give 2% AA no matter what level you are.  Same goes for white, yellow, red mobs.  Not all dark blue mobs give 2% AA obviously, but the xp camps you are using now, will still output the same AAxp when you are level 70, as long as they are the same con color.<br />
<br />
Summary, grind out as many aa's as you can before release, then level up to 70.  Beta looks pretty good for 65+ xp groups btw ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Correct me someone if this is incorrect....<br />
<br />
I saw it somewhere where it mathematically proved that 100% regular exp or 100% AAxp was better than splitting the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've heard that splitting AA and EXP was bad because SoE doesn't know how to divide (ever tried using autosplit...)  If you want to go 80% AA and 20% EXP, then do 100% towards AA 80% of the time, and 100% towards EXP 20% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there was once a bug in the splitting process, yup ... now it is corrected, but that is still better to go 100% regular or 100% aa , and never split ... why ? 1st it will prevent problems if sony make a new mistake. 2nd, well, it is simple : splitting allow you to earn both kind of xp, while slowing the process of grinding each kind ... the problem is the xp you earn is useful only after you reach a cap ( a lvl , or an AA ), and useless during all the duration before this cap ... <br />
<br />
now imagine, the xp needed for 1 lvl is 100 xp , xp needed for 1 aa is 10 xp (in case you wonder, this numbers are not real ones :p ). imagine you splitted in order to earn 1 lvl each time  you earn 1 AA. that you need 110 xp to ding, and when you will ding, you will get both the lvl and the AA ... problem is the 108 first xp you will earn will have no effect , the 2 next will make you ding... if you went 100% lvl xp, then once you get lvl go 100% aa, the 99 1st xp would earn nothing, then you would ding lvl , then 100% aa for the 10 next xp, you will earn your lvl earlier ( 100 instead of 109/110), and get your AA just as fast ( 110th xp).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Pretty sure this is wrong too, although it's kinda hard to parse. I did compare aaxp rates with a 62 when I was 65 in BoT and the 62 player was getting xp ~10% faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow. Let's give some facts instead of wild conjecture.<br />
<br />
First of all, there is a specific formula that determines how many points of exp a particular mob gives. The basic formula is:<br />
<br />
mob level x mob level x ZEM = exp gained<br />
<br />
The ZEM is the zone experience modifier. On top of the basic formula, you get bonuses added to the base number. You get additional bonuses for fighting mobs near your level, and higher bonuses for fighting mobs that are yellow and red.  The higher the level the mob is, the higher the bonus is. This explains why a level 62 toon gets more exp per mob than a 65 does killing the same mob. The mob will necessarily be higher level in comparison to the 62 toon so they will get a larger bonus. While that sounds like a good deal, a group of 65s can kill mobs at a faster rate, and they can fight higher level mobs more effectively, negating any advantage a lover level player can get. The fact that the raw experience goes up exponentially as mob level increases means that you are much better off killing higher level mobs for maximum experience gain.<br />
<br />
There is also a group bonus that starts when you have at least 3 people in your group. The best bonus being when you have a full group of 6. When you have 6 people in the group, the exp is still divided by 5 and then awarded to 6 people, so in essence each mob is now worth 20% more than if you killed the same mob with 5 people.<br />
<br />
Knowing this, we can tell that there will be plenty of pre-OoW exp areas that will still give good experience. The mobs in PoFire at the 2nd castle and the Field of Gib are 65+ so the experience there will be good. Same with mobs deeper in PoW, Tipt, Vxed, KT, and Qvic. I would assume that there will be zones in OoW that are good exp as well.<br />
<br />
Now, back to the age old AA vs. level question. Before OoW it was generally believed that level &gt; AA for the many advantages that one gained from getting additional levels. I am a firm believer in that still today and I am sure that the same will hold true in OoW. Character level relative to mob level has played an important factor in the combat engine and the resist system. The fact is that the higher your level is, the more favorable the outcome against any particular mob. While you can certainly gain quite a bit of advantage by gaining AAs, the amount of AAs you would have to gain to receive a similar advantage as gaining 5 levels would take a lot more raw exp to gain in a given amount of time.<br />
<br />
Get your levels. They are far more important than any AA skills you could get in the time it would take you to level to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It seems to me that unless you're an EP flagged character, you might very well be better off *NOT* leveling to 70. Sure, mobs in the EPs are higher level, and that's great. But for a non-EP flagged character, the experience in BoT is going to go down drastically. Virtually all experience gain in all expansions, other than the mystery box that is OoW, will be lowered considerably. Original EQ will be green, Kunark will virtually all be green/lb, Velious will be green/lb, Luclin will be green/lb, PoP will be down to low blues in places like BoT and HoH, GoD will be lb/blue in some accessible zones (I haven't spent enough time here to know the mob levels well). Hopefully, LDoN will be scaled up for level 70 characters, which would be at least ok.<br />
<br />
  Now, on to the power granted by leveling vs AAing... Levels always have been the best source of power. There is an invisible benefit to leveling, in other words bonuses beyond straight hp/ac/skill gain. Leveling is much better than AAing.<br />
<br />
  Lastly, these points could both be rendered moot if SOE decides to change their formulas. If they extend the lb/blue range downwards for level 66-70, then at least some experience will be easily gleaned from the older expansions. Obviously, they could do something similar for the leveling bonuses. I hope they DO implement the first, and I hope they DON'T implement the second, personally.</div></div><hr />

Yes, BoT experience, or trying to level there, will be hard and it will be reduced as you level up.  Stating that all experience gain in all expansions will go down, is an assumption.  SoE seems to like their &quot;HoT Zones&quot;.   There is plenty of room for leveling in GoD.  It doesn't take an Elemental Flagged character to survive here either.  I am not EP flagged, but I do hunt in KT.  I am in a raiding guild, but take a look at my profile, only 1 piece was ever recieved from a raid (BoC was bought).  It's one groupable content to get there.  <br />
<br />
As for the orignal poster, I believe leveling to 70 would be the biggest benefit to your character and your guild.  But in some aspects, I agree with Fitemore, you'll have to go elsewhere to level and get AA's.  Assuming ZEM does not change upon release of OoW, you would have to leave PoP for GoD or OoW content for experience.<br />
<br />

Note: Not trying to discourage finishing your Defensive AA's, imho, you should level to 70 as fast as you can and get back to your AA's.</div></div><hr />

Opening Ele's to the 65 crowd would definately create another viable xp option to 70. <br />

I just wanted to put an exclamation point on this post by Wandor.  For those of you who either weren't around, or don't remember when PoP came out, Wandor and I had this exact same discussion.  He held this opinion, and I held the opinion that I was going to be better off grinding AA's and becoming a better tank than leveling because there was no increase in skill caps between 60 and 65.<br />
<br />
In my regular group, there are 2 warriors -- one played by me, and one played by a guy that I used to work with and got hooked on EQ.  Haass was around first, but we had a lot of time to sit at work and bullshit about the game, so Rasco was rolled up as the same race, with the same stats, and he eventually caught up to me, and he is equipped nearly identically, still today.  We are, in essence, the same warrior.<br />
<br />
We both stuck around at 60 until I finished all of the Arch + Class AA's that I wanted, then I took Haass to 65.  By the time I got there, Rasco had finished up all of his defensive AA's.  Our normal group did not include an enchanter, so our normal practice was pulling 2 and split tanking them down -- the difference in damage taken was ASTRONOMICAL.  Rasco would sometimes take 2 CH's from the druid before I needed a heal at all.  Understand that there is nothing else to attribute this to...we had the same stats, the same buffs, the same AA's, and the same gear, the only difference was that I was 65 and he was 60.<br />
<br />
We changed his plan and got him to 65 ASAP.  I was dead wrong about thinking that AA was superior to levels, and it's crystal clear to me now.   If you think your AA's make you a better tank than a guy who is 5 levels higher than you, you're not thinking clearly.<br />
<br />
Understand however, this does not mean that everyone should immediately level to 70 when OoW comes out.  I would probably advise against it.  Wandor speaks of a lot of high XP zones that will still be viable at level 70...and the VAST majority of EQ players do not, and will not have access to those zones because of the support requirement to be there.  You WILL be gaining XP slower if your plan is to stay in BoT or PoV or something and level to 70.  That is a completely different issue tho than thinking that your defensive AA's make you a better tank.  If you have to stay 65 so that you can enjoy the game and get XP at a rate that you can tolerate, that's one thing, but don't delude yourself into thinking that you're going to be better than ANY level 70 at all.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for not  ripping on me and stating some facts/Exp!  I also run in the same type of group as you do,  F-Crowd control, just tank stuff down.  It was just frustating for me that a BL could out tank me and we were both 65.   The tables turned fairly quickly and now that I have just CA3 I'm out tanking him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say that a lower lvl char will gain xp faster in a group than the higher lvl char if you are fighting a yellow or red. With my 50 warrior being PL'd by my 65 druid, Even fighting yellows and reds to the 50 warrrior, I am only getting 1% a kill, 2% if I am lucky.<br />
<br />
Example.... Fighting in Droga, 99% of the mobs are DB to the 65 and red to the 50. The 65 druid gains anywhere from 1-2%xp or 2%aaxp wher the warrior usually only gains 1%xp. Is this because of the lvl difference between the 2??<br />
<br />
Normally the only place I ever get more than 1%xp is in the hotzones.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong here??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No details because of the NDA, but leveling to 70 will be an ever bigger power jump for warriors than leveling to 65 was.

Stop grouping the druid with the warrior and use the DS method of PLing, you are PLing all wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Responding to White:<br />
<br />
A while ago, I took my 62 druid out with my normal group (all 65s) and did Torment for an evening.  He was gaining 2x the AA experiance that the rest of the group was getting.  We fought for about 3 ish hours and he got 3 aa to the 1.5 aa the rest of the group.  I further tested this out on my normal 4 box team.  At the time, I had a 62 cleric, 62 druid, 65 Ench and 65 warrior.  Spending 6 hours in HOH, I would net 2x the aa experiance for the lvl 62s, all other variables were equal.  However, I did push the cleric and druid to 63 and suddently there was a significiant drop in experiance.  At lvl 63, the experiance was the same as at 65.  My husband and I ran several tests comparing our bars after killing 10 mobs at a time.  There was a negligible difference at 63 compared to the difference at 62.  <br />
<br />
Something to consider about leveling up from 65 to 70 is your hunting grounds.  For those of us with EP access, we still have a wide variety of &quot;hot&quot; zones to choose from but for others they don't have the same choice.  Leveling up is fine but if you want to work aa and don't have decent places to level up it just becomes a painful grind to get those aa you want if you decide to level up first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">We fought for about 3 ish hours and he got 3 aa to the 1.5 aa the rest of the group. This is a little misleading, and let me explain why. While it is 100% true that a level 62 will get more exp per mob in a group of level 65s hunting dark blues, the reason is that the mob is higher level relative to the 62. This does not mean that at 62 you will get more exp per hour. If you replace that 62 with a 65 of the same class, your kill rate will go up. The 62 in a group of 65s is gaining more experience at the expense of the rest of the group. Not only that, but a balanced group of 65s is going to be far more effective fighting higher con mobs for even better exp/hour.<br />
<br />
I suppose I should include one caveat that Haass eluded to in his post. Level &gt; AA as long as you are willing/able to change your hunting grounds to suit your level. If you level to 65 in BoT, you will be clawing your eyes out before you ever ding 68. However, if you leave BoT when you ding 66 and head for PoW or PoFire, you will have a much easier time. For those who are not elem flagged, there are other viable alternatives as well. Mob levels in zones like Tipt, Vxed, and Kod Taz are high enough that you should get excellent experience, probably all the way to 70.  There are also other places that will yeild good results if you are a little creative. Mobs deeper in Tactics tend to go up in levels, with quite a few yellow/red to 65s in the less travelled parts of the zone. It's just a matter of finding places where the mobs are red/yellow to 65 and grinding exp there. The benefit of fighting the higher level mobs will show as the amount of exp gained per mob will go up significantly.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of how much of a difference mob level makes on exp per kill, one only has to look to the tables camp in PoFire. I am sure just about everyone has heard of this camp whether they are flagged or not. The reason this camp is so highly prized is that there is basically an endless amount of level 68 non summonin mobs with a large, safe kiting area. A full group of level 65s hunting here will get 6% AA per kill. That's right, a full 6% PER KILL.  Compared to the measly 1-2% per kill in BoT, that is an astronomical difference. The entire difference in exp per mob is attributed to the level of the mob because the ZEM is the same in both zones, and all other bonuses are the same assuming a full group. The same can be said for any other zone where the mob level is 65+.<br />
<br />
If you and your friends are willing to leave the same old exp spots to areas with higher level mobs and more challenges, then you will be highly rewarded. If you are not willing to try or are not geared enough to handle harder mobs, then you may consider staying 65 until you can handle the harder mobs. <br />
<br />
In any case, regarless of the road you choose for yourself, you will see a much larger gain in power from gaining 5 levels than you would from getting dozens of AA levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Also, we know that only one zone in OoW is locked so there has to be lvl 70 exp zones that are open to everyone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The game is made of formulas. Each and every formula can be made into a table. These tables are corlated to a couple major factors. For this game i would say the factors are level of the toon, and the exp modifier of the zone your in.<br />
<br />
example.<br />
Your in zone &quot;A&quot; leveling away, <br />
Your level &quot;B&quot; <br />
The level of the mobs your killing is &quot;C&quot; <br />
The exp you get for killing the mob is a set number for that type of mob &quot;D&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheap formula.<br />
<br />
C - B = Mod 1%<br />
D * mod 1% = Bonus exp.<br />
D + Bonus exp = what you get per killin exp.<br />
<br />
Now lets add some values to this and see if it comes out right. also for this to place it in an eq style (i hope) we are going to say for simplicity sakes the mod is figured for every 3 levels. So every 3 levels you get 10 % of bonus.<br />
0-2 = 0%<br />
3-5 = 10%<br />
6-8 = 20%<br />
<br />
your level 62<br />
mob level 65<br />
exp per mob 1000<br />
<br />
65 - 62 = 3<br />
1000 * 10% = 100<br />
100 + 1000 = 1100 total exp gained for the kill<br />
<br />
Now if your 64<br />
65 - 64 = 1<br />
1000 * 0% = 0<br />
0 + 1000 = 1000 total exp gasined for the kill<br />
<br />
Now if your 59<br />
65 - 59 = 6<br />
1000 * 20% = 200<br />
200 + 1000 = 1200 total for the kill<br />
<br />
Now you may add negative modifiers for if your over the mobs level also and will have to cap both ends for the &quot;Your to high to get exp mobs (green cons)&quot; and the &quot;Your to ubber and should not be killing this at that level (10+ level red mobs)&quot;<br />
<br />
Also remember you have the zone modifiers in there the class modifiers and the race modifiers also... all of these play a + and - in what your modifier is..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly isn't all your AA's exp gained as if your level 52 but all your modifiers are based off your level??<br />
It would explain why an ubber group of 65's slaughtering level 68+ elemental mobs get exp faster then a group of level 60's getting exp in PoV or 62's in BoT</div></div><hr />

When they realigned the consider colors (and added light-blue con), they implemented an extra XP bonus if the mob is within a few levels of you.

Because...well... have a feeling it's not the last time we'll see this question.<br />
<br />
Here are the only 2 reasons I've discovered for AA-ing rather than leveling.<br />
1. You're level 52 and there's a Vox/Naggy raid in two weeks and ya wanna tank the dragons while you can. Do Run 3 while you wait.<br />
2. You have a very good group of friends, but you play more than they do and you want to stay in level range of them, and for some reason you're not working on an alt character.<br />
<br />
I happen to think both of these reasons can be legit, but obviously neither has as its prime motivation the most efficient use of time for optimal character power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">There is an experience chart here:<br />
<br />
http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/<br />
<br />
Chart is slightly outdated, however and doesn't take into account new changes in the EQ engine. <br />
<br />
Notes on exp modifiers:<br />
<br />
- Merely by grouping with anybody (doesn't matter size of group), you automatically negate any penalties of race or class, and this experience isn't taken out of anybody else's experience in group.  <br />
<br />
- there is a bonus to exp based upon members in group, and 6th person basically is free (so there is no difference in how much exp you'll gain in a group if you go from 5 people to 6 people).  <br />
<br />
- If the mob is within a few levels of you (I think it's 3), there will be an exp bonus, this is calculated independent of what other people in the group get.  So for instance, if your group is killing all whites / yellows, and you're level 60, other people are all level 65, you will gain bonus, but they won't .  <br />
<br />
quote:<br />
&quot;As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% &quot;group bonus&quot; experience for having two to five members. <br />
<br />
Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus. Their experience is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% &quot;group bonus.&quot; For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger pie. &quot;<br />
---end quote---<br />
<br />
So formula is actually pretty complicated versus how it first started out.  <br />
<br />
The exp needed per level was basically  level x level x level x (racial mod) x (class mod). <br />
<br />
The exp per mob was basically level x level x unknown factor x zone exp mod.  This is how it remained for a while, until they started making additional steps to the formula. <br />
<br />
Now, there are more steps that werent' present when game first started, if character is in a group<br />
<br />
group exp mod (takes the amount of exp gained and multiplies it on an amount based upon number of members in group).   This is applied to everybody in group. <br />
<br />
Individual exp mod:  <br />
- You get a bonus based upon race and or class which basically cancels out any penalty you may have had. <br />
- you get a bonus based upon level of mob vs. your current level. <br />
<br />
So basically it goes in several steps when calculating exp, let's take an example of smoeone in a 6 person group, let's say everybody is 65, and one person is level 60, and the mobs being fought are level 61, let's say we're hunting in PoI with a 44% exp mod bonus (normal ZEM is .75, so this will be 1.19), and your class is a iksar shadowknight (1.2 racial penalty, 1.4 multiplier for being a SK). <br />
<br />
Per kill:<br />
base exp:  (*Mob exp squared* 61 x 61 = 3721) * ZEM (1.19) = ~4428 <br />
group exp bonus:  1.8 * (mob exp) 4428 = ~7970<br />
divided 5 ways:  7970 / 5 = 1594 per group member. <br />
Now we have counter race and class:  1594 * 1.6 (they add together not multiply) = 2550 exp<br />
lastly, mob level vs. player level bonus (unknown, but let's hypothesize and say 1.5?) 2550 * 1.5 = 3825<br />
<br />
So in this instance, the exp for this character gained would be 3825, however the racial penalty and class penalty doesn't apply for AA points, but does apply towards regular exp.  Say you wanted to find out how much a 65 human shadowknight in same group got in AA exp:  (3721 (mob exp) * 1.19 (ZEM) * 1.8 (group bonus)) / 5 (group split) * 1 (race &amp; class, equals one since AA) * 1 (for mob bonus) =  1594<br />
<br />
So, in this instance, the 60 char is getting twice as much actual exp.  Should they switch this to AA exp only however, you would see the exp drop from 3825 to 2390 actual points gained towards AA exp, which is still a fair margain over the 1594 pts a 65 would get in AA.  <br />
<br />
I tested this out with my war (56 when starting, 58 currently) and cleric (65) combo.  At first ungrouped, war would gain about 3.5% AA per kill, or about 1.5% raw exp as he was very close to some of the mob levels (such as against an archaic model).  Later tested same combo against archaic model, but grouped, cleric only got about 1 % AA after a kill, and war only got around 1.8% of an AA).  Conclusion was since character was a dwarf war, there was no inherent advantage in grouping with cleric (other than 20 % bonus for 2 people in group) as far as cancelling out racial penalties / class penalties, so I have the cleric ungrouped and have been able to get the exp very fast.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly. The amount of experience needed to gain 1 AA level equals the amount of experience needed to ding 51. The way experience works is a lot easier to understand if you think of it in D&amp;D terms. Each mob is worth X experience points (mob level x mob level x ZEM). There are various bonuses added to that number depending on how close the mob is to your level. The higher the level the mob, the bigger the bonus, with the bonus being very large for mobs higher than your level. The bonuses are all a % added to the base number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't correct in practice from what I've seen.  I rolled up a barbarian shaman and a barbarian warrior to play when Bristlebane is Bristlebroken.<br />
<br />
I've levelled them up by boxing them from the first kill to ~lvl 15.  My shaman is well over one (1) yellow bar of experience behind my warrior.  I have even solo killed a few with the shaman to try to bridge the gap a bit and keep pace with the warrior.<br />
<br />
Again, I only play these two grouped and with no other people in group.  I never solo either one except in the few fights I soloed with my shaman to try to catch up to my warrior.  I'd say there's still either a penalty on the shaman, or a bonus on the warrior (which still equates to a penalty for another class).  Can't speak for any other classes.</div></div><hr />

Since the NDA is lifted I'll post why I said that.  From level 65 to 70 your skills (offense, defense, weapon skills, etc) raise as you level, unlike the jump from 60-65 where we didn't gain any skill gains.<br />
<br />
This is a less than perfect test (much less hehe) but to test the difference from leveling to 70 I went and solo'ed a noc at the Natimbi zone in Qinimi.  He took me down to 20% health (no discs) at level 65.  With my beta char with exactly the same gear but level 70 I went to Qinimi and was able to solo 2 nocs back to back and finish at 25% health.  Of course they were light blue at 70 hehe.  The other difference was that my beta char had max AA (no omens AA).  Hard to say how much difference that makes, but my test char has full defensive AA and most offensive stuff, so the difference is stuff like PoP flurry, double riposte, etc which makes some difference but not a huge amount I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, class based penalties were removed a long time ago.  Rogues and Warriors had a class bonus, however, and this was left in place.  Racial bonuses and penalties are still in the game.  Halflings with a bonus (5%? or maybe 10, I can't remember, I don't play the ugly little buggers) and Barbarians, Ogres, Trolls, and Iksar with a penalty (5, 15, 20, and 20% respectively).<br />
<br />
Those bonuses and penalties still apply to xp earned in a group.  However, they are applied after the division amongst group members, so an individuals bonus or penalty will not affect the xp earned by others in the group.</div></div><hr />

I'm about a kill or two away from 66 (once OOW goes live) now on my warrior &amp; druid, but not being elemental flagged yet is worrying.  I guess diving deeper into Tactics would be ok, but only if I find other people in the same boat as I am in terms of flags.  I don't want to be dragging lower levels through there and have them levelling on my back, crying out &quot;AA ding #xx&quot; while I'm just trying to get to 70.<br />
<br />
Also have to wonder how many other groups will be willing/daring to ask a 66+ warrior or druid to group, probably expecting said warrior/druid to be elemental flagged already and not wanting lower tier groups.<br />

Guess that leaves finding groups in OOW post 65 and praying my gear isn't too inadequate for the job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I think Battleblade has something of a point. Particularly for poor warrior main characters, it's far easier to level from 50 on than it is to get good gear. The issue is not entirely &quot;what would make me most powerful fastest&quot; -- the answer to that is to level, certainly. But you can't just compare your effectiveness to yourself (&quot;Am I stronger at level 55 or level 65?&quot;); you need also to keep in mind that the casters and dps classes around you are growing in power as well, as are the mobs. It doesn't matter if you are more powerful than you used to be if your aggro generation is lagging so bad that you're throttling the group's ability to hammer the mobs. Likewise, if you level beyond your armor, you'd better not be MT. Sometime between level 50 and level 65 such a warrior will likely need new haste, a new weapon or two or five, cultural or better armor, and top buyable pieces in non-visable slots, not to mention augs for weapons--basically, every slot will change out, perhaps at significant cost. I'd imagine that typically such a warrior can get a few slots covered by drops; get some dropped augs in LDoNs, and so forth. But he won't loot all of his slots, and at around 100pp per LDoN win at lvl 54 ish he's going to be generating experience faster than he's going to be getting enough cash for, say, val rings and bloodmetal earrings. <br />
It's possible that people now who have not been lvl 65 for long will not see much of a need for new gear at lvl 70. It's also possible I'll be struck by a run away truck before I can hit the send button on this message. But the chances aren't high in either case.<br />
An organized guild would help with this significantly, of course, as would a keeping a careful eye on where to hunt and what upgrades are available and having a fat bank account and running a trader and perhaps farming selected items without regard to experience. One way or another, though, I'd imagine that warrior will be spending part of his time doing something other than leveling.</div></div><hr />

  My point is that now, even at level 65, you can gain experience doing a huge variety of things in every expansion. At 70, likely 3+ EXPANSIONS will be useless. It's not a matter of losing 2 zones, gaining 2 zones. It's losing Kunark, Velious and Luclin, and gaining some zones in OoW and GoD. Even LDoN missions won't be new for level 70, it'll just be the current hard missions for level 65. And no, I don't go to these older zones for strictly experience. But I do like seeing my experience bar move when I'm camping, say, FT3 boots, or epic pieces, or emp key and VT key pieces. It's just my current play style, and really not a terribly significant thing in the grand scheme of things. Just something I noticed.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't mean you won't be able to get points faster.  At 70 you're going to be ripping through what used to be a hard in less time than it takes you now, so the points will come faster.  The exp per adventure will go down, but if you do them faster that will balance out to some extent.</div></div><hr />

This is all speculation of course, but as it stands now I'm levelling to 65, working my defensive AA's until I can get some definitive statements about exp in new zones, and how tough they are to handle. I'm all for exploring, but  I'd rather not be hindered in gaining AA's once I ding 70, instead I'd rather get my defensives at 65, then when I do ding 70 I'll at least be a bit more prepared for what lies ahead in terms of what will give good AA exp flow.<br />

I myself would have to agree with this.  As a pre-elemental warrior, I feel kind of robbed of part of the money I have invested into EQ due to the flagging issues.

<br />
On the exp issue, for those of you that aren't willing to move to a different zone to level:<br />
<br />
PoFire castle 1, castle 2 and tables will still be within 5 levels<br />
Solusek Ro's Tower will be mostly within 5 levels (upped the Zem recently?)<br />
PoTactics in deep will be within 5 levels<br />
PoWater - basically all the northern half of the zone, plus some of the southern areas will be within 5 levels<br />
Kod'Taz, Qvic, Yxtta, and parts of Riwwi will still be within 5 levels<br />
PoValor at the urn camp will be within 5 levels<br />
PoTorment in deep will be within 5 levels (upped the Zem recently)<br />
Barindu, Tipt and Vxed will be mostly within 5 levels<br />

I'm sure there are more in PoP/GoD that I'm missing, but there are still places to go that aren't in Oow to hit 70.</div></div><hr />

It really isn't that bad.  People on nearly every server hit 68 last night.  Some people hit 70 using exploits.  I XPed for about 5 hours last night and came close to 67.  I figure an average xp group in KT should be able to gain a level about every 6-8 hours.  An exceptional group could probably gain one every 4-6 hours.

Smaller guilds who don't raid heavily don't have access to elems even though they may have all L65 with AA players at OoW's release.<br />
<br />
Solusek Ro's Tower will be mostly within 5 levels (upped the Zem recently?)<br />
<br />
True.  Same deal as elems though easier to get flagged for since RZ isn't required.<br />
<br />
PoTactics in deep will be within 5 levels<br />
<br />
True only if you take a right or left from zone in toward TZ/VZ.  These mobs are L68, but generally aren't a good grind.<br />
<br />
PoWater - basically all the northern half of the zone, plus some of the southern areas will be within 5 levels<br />

<br />
Kod'Taz, Qvic, Yxtta, and parts of Riwwi will still be within 5 levels<br />
<br />
I don't know of any grind spots in Riwwi that are mostly L65+ mobs.  I haven't hunted there much though.  Qvic/Yxtta... most aren't flagged.  Kod'Taz... some are flagged.  It will be good.<br />
  <br />
PoValor at the urn camp will be within 5 levels<br />
<br />
Not familiar with this one... most/all of the mobs are L65+?<br />
<br />
PoTorment in deep will be within 5 levels (upped the Zem recently)<br />
<br />
Even the back of Torment has numerous blue to 65 mobs.  I can't see it being good exp at L70.<br />
<br />
Barindu, Tipt and Vxed will be mostly within 5 levels<br />
<br />
Most of Barindu is blue to 65.  Vxed/Tipt will be good.<br />
<br />
For me personally, I don't have elem access yet.  Maybe I will get it by the time I reach 70.   That will add a couple grind spots.  For zones I'm flagged for now, I have sol ro tower, kod'taz, vxed, and tipt that will still be good at L70.  Hopefully I find some good options in OoW.  Those with fewer flags may even be down to just vxed/tipt for pre oow zones at L70, though they can single group their way to Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Vxed and Tipt are awesome exp zones.  Never camped, drop loot, and you can start/stop them when you want, swap people out, etc, especially in Vxed where you can just sit at the zone and pull all the mobs you want without ever worrying about being trained (unless it's by your puller hehe).  I will be leveling to 70 mostly in these zones, and hopefully finish my BiC stuff, get some of those elusive GoD spells for the casters, and flag some of my friends for KT while I'm at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Additionally, most of the raid content we're doing is designed with the 60-65 player in mind and tackling those encounters with level 70 toons would make it far easier and take away from the challenge I think.<br />
<br />
There are still a few AAs that I'm eager to get and until my zone options open up (Elemental flag), I'm going with a split of AA and level experience.  And for those people who wonder why anyone would want to be &lt; 70 or who have to be 70 before joe other toon, this game is more about the road and not the destination.

Oh dear God NO!  OOW is FILLED with people who took the Paludal/OT/DL/PoJ/Pov levelling train.  Many of them don't know what they are doing, trains are plentiful.  It's nice having some zones that actually require some skill to get into, as a refuge from this crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I don't know how things are working out for others, but I'm finding the biggest problem with the new level cap and actually gaining experience is relative to my equipment more than anything else.  With the experience bonuses based on mob level compared to your level, there's a very, very slim margin of mobs and zones available to fight in as a Warrior unless your equipment is fairly good or you have an exceptionally unbalanced group backing you up.<br />
<br />
I'm currently level 67, but even at level 66, using my secondary cleric, I got about 0.3% regular experience per solo kill in Halls of Honor.  With a kill rate of around 6 - 7 minutes depending on buffs, that's exceptionally crappy.  Therefore, it's best to group up for fast experience.  However, this is where the equipment issue arises.<br />
<br />
I currently buff to just over 9k HP, which is fairly low compared to many higher level Warriors, but I do have max defensive AAs save OoW and a a couple GoDs.  That said, it's nearly impossible for me to tank at all in any GoD zones beyond the sewers trials without serious risk to the group and/or serious mana-drain on the healer(s).  I have all PoP flags and all GoD flags up to Inkta'tu, but trying to tank things like Vxed, Tipt, KT, or Yxtta just leave the cleric with hardly any mana and myself feeling next to useless.<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, this problem doesn't exist to nearly the same extent with any other classes.  Dps classes, casters, healers, even hybrids (who can mitigate damage via self-spells) are much less dependant on their gear to be a valuable member of the group against difficult mobs - even if a Ranger or Rogues equipment sucks, they can still contribute to a group in Yxtta without being more harm than good, because no one takes notice to it - it simply slows the kill-rate of the group slightly, but otherwise won't matter one way or the other.  As the Warrior, unless you have another tank in the group, your gear makes a huge difference between a successful group and being kicked out or not even invited in the first place. <br />
<br />
I realize gear has always played a part of the Warrior game, but since the release of GoD (and now I imagine OoW, though I've not experienced much of it yet), the damage output of mobs is growing exponentially with their levels.  Think about it; you can find level 62/63 exp mobs in PoP that hit for 400-500 max, but in GoD a 63/64 mob will hit for 800-1200, plus many times have a very common 500+ DD proc - the damage output doesn't equate with the mob level and makes exping as an under-equipped/average-equipped Warrior at 66+ very difficult.<br />
<br />
I got an invitation to a Yxtta group the other night, and in spite of the group being all made of up members from the top three guilds on the server (Group was myself, Brd, Clr, Wiz, Shm, Nec), the cleric literally had to chain cast Holy Light just to keep me alive each pull.  Of course, that made it extremely hard on the group and my conscious, and after about 15 minutes, I found a level 70 warrior replacement and bowed out of the group, feeling the need to apologize for being there in the first place. :(<br />
<br />
My hope is that OoW provides a number of higher level zones without all the exp mobs attacking like Tier 2/3 PoP boss mobs.  Otherwise, I can foresee being stuck exping in PoEarth even after level 70 =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">At 9k+ you will tank very well in Wall of Slaughter. You can tank everything there except for maybe the raid mobs, of which I have no experience with.<br />
<br />
The hardest non-raid mob I fought there was the warfiend, and I had no shaman, was buffed to lik 8770 HP (at level 67) and we took him down with about 8 or 9 people, half of which were just dual/triple boxed characters at lvl 66 with so-so gear.<br />

<br />
What does someone's leveling method have to do with their skill?  If Paludal/OT/etc. is the quickest way to 65 then why would they do it any other way?<br />
<br />
I think your main point, &quot;It's nice having some zones that actually require some skill to get into&quot; gets lost in the stereotypes of your other statements.<br />
<br />
My hope is that OoW provides a number of higher level zones without all the exp mobs attacking like Tier 2/3 PoP boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Then OoW is definitely the expansion for you.  I buff out at about 8.6k/1640/79 and I don't have any troubles tanking in WoS.  The mobs there typically hit for 200-600, and are easily slowable.  Most mbs are 65-68 so the exp is not bad, considering how slow these new levels are.<br />
<br />
Well, except for the occasional raid mob the puller unknowingly brings back to camp.  There's nothing like being on the cutting edge and not knowing which named mobs are 1 groupable and which are raid required ... until they get to camp and start hitting for 2600 with frequent AoE's.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Well that's great news, thanks Cily and Dintorr! &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
I suppose I threw my post out there too soon before really trying out OoW... not that it changes the fact that GoD is the way it is however, but that's another story.<br />
<br />
That's not to say I don't appreciate GoD and it's difficulty - in fact, I appreciate GoD a lot more than many of the prior expansions simply because it raised the bar for the challenges.  However, my complaint really ends up being not with the expansion or it's zones/mobs, but with the reliance on tank equipment over anything else.  Where are the mobs that hit for 400 max but AE rampage over 100 range so everyone has to take the beating and account for the damage or else?  How about some AE spells or procs that lower healing or nuke efficiency?  Or decrease melee damage but increased ranged damage?  Or lower chance to dodge, parry, riposte, etc. but raise hit percantage/accuracy?  Or how about a proc that spawns a mob that hits for 50 max, then next proc hits for 100, then 150, and so on?  Or maybe an AE that reduces critical chances/damage output (for melee, spells, etc) but increases attack speed (v3) and reduces mana cost?<br />
<br />
It feels like I could come up with a million different ways to make mobs challenging, exciting, and varied without requiring everything can put out enough DPS to down a pre-time tank in two - four lucky rounds.<br />
<br />
I don't mind lots of DPS, because everyone knows DPS like that of Normal LDoNs is a joke, but find a way to mitigate it and/or spread it out between the group, requiring everyone have decent equipment/skills rather than solely relying on your tank to be uber and everyone else not matter.</div></div><hr />

because PL toons do not normally have their skills (dodge parry 1hs etc) maxed out rendering them semi-worthless until they skill up.  More importantly, they also tend to have almost no instinct as to what to do with their class.  Usually that is because they have zero skills as an EQ player.  Level's dont mean you know jack chit.  Nor do AA's.  If its like Karana on other servers, WoS is the new dumbass train zone.</div></div><hr />

No matter how long it took you to get to 65, 50, 10, 100, you can't determine when invis is going to drop.  You can try and find a new place so you can re-invis (or if you have a few potions, then click one or what not), but usually you gotta book it.<br />

Cloudy potions are instant click.  Even if you're a class who can cast invis, when you're invising past mobs you should have one in an empty inventory slot and hot keyed.

A side benefit at level 65 doing Ldon's is the current level of AA experience I recieve, which I have found satisfactory pre oow...I have heard from other tanks that have leveled to 66+, that the AA experience is reduced in the Ldon realm to such a degree that Ldons' have become non-interesting except for the point value that you recieve for succeeding, (at least &quot;normal&quot; Ldon's) Hard Ldon is another issue.

Yeah the exp sucks, I got 2% reg exp in 69 for the adventure, however the 65 hard (it's all you can get at 69) was only slightly more difficult than the 65 normals were at 65 and you do get 105 ap's on winning (took me about 47 minutes to complete 4-boxing, solo). So while the exp will be poor the points gain should be double the rate you can reliably gain at 65, unless of course you can get a guaranteed win in under 50 minutes on hards at 65 :).<br />
<br />
As to the gear, I partly agree with Cily, but from what I have seen so far, which is not very much in OOW, and stuff that I have had linked has not been quite as good as FULLY auged (including adding god augs) as the ldon tak armor. But, and it is a big but, it will take you far less time to get!</div></div><hr />

Someone has indicated on Allakhazaam that the DH instances spawn higher mobs at 68. So there appears to be a 65-67 instance set and a 68+ instance set. Frankly I am ping ponging mobs in there for runes so I will likely get to test that theory. Sucks needing like 100+ runes for your guys :)<br />

<br />
Most of the decent gear so far I have seen came from normal, non-instanced zones.<br />
<br />
By the way... in the historian zones, how do you know which mobs are named PH? Or does it even work like that.<br />

As many people have posted in this thread, levels &gt; AA.  I fully agree with this.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think there are certain times you have to look a the reality of the situation.<br />
<br />
If you are playing in BoT and you are a 65 warrior, you are not going to get regular XP very quickly.  It will quickly become frustrating if you are working on lvls all the time there.<br />
<br />
Right now, there are lots of people who are working on grinding to 70.  Many of these for some strange reason, havent even played the game for a year, but now that OoW is out, they have to get to lvl 70.  To each his own I guess.<br />
<br />
But what this means to someone who is just reaching 65, isn't elemental flagged, and isnt part of a raiding guild, is that it will be tough to find groups sometimes.<br />
<br />
I recommend going to Walls of Slaughter and trying to get a group thre.   The xp is painfully slow compared to eplanes, KT, and MPG, but it is better than BoT.  But if you can't do better than BoT, go ahead and thow some or all XP into AA until you can get a group in a better zone.<br />
<br />
LVL &gt; AA, but you do have to be realistic about the zone you are in sometimes.</div></div><hr />
