This is a post about my birthday, so shut the fuck up.  I have a right to display my beliefs without every fucking conversation becoming a political one.  YOURE the one who made it political, not me so shut up.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who CONGRATULATED ME for turning 18.</div></div><hr />

Anybody with balls big enough to chance the outhouse within the last 2 weeks would know exactly what this meant, so don't try to play the entire thread off as completely non-political.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said ....<br />
<br />
<br />
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!<br />
<br />
Next stop 21 and booze ... <br />
<br />
Next stop after that 35 and back hair ...<br />
<br />
Here's to the future!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noone was blaming you for displaying your beliefs. The elections just happened to end and obviously everybody is talking about politics and politics will be mentioned in many posts. It would really seem like you wouldn't mind it being mentioned judging by your avatar anyway.<br />
<br />
 If you wanted a thread with nothing but happy birthdays, next year perhaps you should make a special note that says &quot;post nothing but happy birthday and congratulations!&quot;. Of course, i don't think a birthday deserves a thread, but that's besides the point :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks all  <br />

<br />
Uh no,  that was my first post in the thread and in addition there was nothing politcal in it, that was Yoda. If you want someone to &quot;shut the fuck up&quot;, try to at least realize who posted what dumb ass. Thank god you could not vote, if you can't even follow who posts what on a message board thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i had no problem with yoda's comments.  my problem was with the comment you made.  i admit that i was wrong that i said you started the political bullshit, but you continued it after brutul told yoda to be quiet.  you decided to make a smartass comment that i did not appreciate so YOU are the one that i told to shut up.  please do so again.<br />
<br />
just to show you:<br />
<br />
and you wasn't able to vote because your mother waited two days more before going to hospital !!<br />
wahahahahahahaahahaha !!!! to bad for you, bush will be elected and you wasn't able to help Kerry. wahahahahaha! !!!!<br />
<br />
well at least you can now get dead drunk to forget it ... um no wait you still can't buy shoots  so will will need to ask your parents to turn you daed drunk !! <br />
whahahahahahaha !!!!<br />
<br />
pour spockmaster, I really think your are out of luck !!<br />
<br />
and then the very next post:<br />
<br />
Stop the political Bullshit please.  Take it to the many wonderful threads in the outhouse.<br />
<br />
Happy Birthday Spock.<br />
<br />
then you decided to post several posts later:<br />
<br />
To be honest, the political bullshit is in every post he makes thanks to his avatar, if he doesn't want to hear about it in every post he makes, he can take it out himself.<br />
<br />
so you see, while it was not you that started it, you continued it after someone else put a stop to it and got back on topic.  please try to refrain from opening your mouth and making an ass of yourself any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you are still wrong, there wasn't anything political in my post, furthurmore nothing negative or attacking you either. You got riled up like a little kid and made posts on the fly telling me to shut the fuck up before thinking about what was really said, and you still are. Before you make a third childish &quot;shut up&quot; post, review the reading comprehension part of an ACT practice book or something, because you are failing.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
please try to refrain from opening your mouth and making an ass of yourself any more.<br />
<br />
You filled this thread's quota already.</div></div><hr />
