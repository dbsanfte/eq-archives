<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where do you draw the line of loot whore to just being the guild MT/ST.<br />
  I am my guilds main tank or second tank for every single raid. Latly the ogre has not loged on so I am the MT. We just droped cursed for the first time other night.(woot) A few weeks back we did an HP raid and a bane wepon droped. I didnt bid on it for I figured I could just get green metal and thought it would be a nice upgrade for our 3rd tank who is 2nd tank when im MT. So he got it for no DKP I was told after i passed it up. ( i didnt know it was DKP free till after it was decided he would get it) So we go to kill AoW next. He droped the ring and a BoC. Now we have killed him 6 times 7 now. He has droped the BoC once. I didnt send a tell for the BoC becuase I wanted the ring wich is much more rare and such an awsome ring for warriors for a verry long time. So the 3rd tank gets it. I get a tell from guild leader bitching me out for not biding on BoC. Im like well I bid on the ring.<br />
  The reason I gave him for not biding on the BoC also is becuase both the wepons I am using are raid wepons. I have got 2 wepons bracer ring and the Vindi BP along with the first AoW helm when we killed him.  oh and the shiny trinket when it droped first. So I get most all first drops when we do a mob if I want it.  I told my guild leader that I am scared people will call/ think of me as a loot whore so i bid on ring and let BoC go. I wanted the BoC ya name one warrior in SSRA that dont want a BoC.. But my fear of how people will look upon me getting yet another wepon when I already know I plan on snaging the first BloodFrenzy that drops even if i have to pass on everything from now till it drops.<br />
  So for some of you more seasond guys how do you jug loot whore from just being the guilds best tank? This is farthest I have gone so all the mobs we are facing are the first time for me. Some how i seem to pull it all together and get the job done. I am haveing the most fun in this game than I ever had.... AoW....Cursed...Emp soon. so much fun to be standing at the end and see that loot go streaming through /guild chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i take it your on officer loot.<br />
<br />
in that case get everything you can. you are in the mt build up stage. without a big tank the direction they want to take the guild is imposible, and since the other guy isn't logging on. your it.<br />
<br />
just make sure they build up the st to. sometimes they foget that and hand you loot after loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your using a DKP system like you mentioned then it's not possible to be a loot whore. You earned your points and are entitled to whatever you care to bid on as long as it's within the DKP guidlines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am not an officer.  Altho I joined the guild before the guild leader was even the guild leader. We were all friends in another guild and it broke up so we formed our own. I guess your right.  I should just  be more greedy. I rather like to see others get loot tho it gives me that  warm fuzzy feeling. I was just wondering if anybody els had this same feeling at some point or if im just wierd.</div></div><hr />

What an unfair thing to do.  Your guild 'leader' should be flogged.<br />
<br />
This is precisely why guilds use a DKP system.<br />
<br />
Now then, if your weaps are lacking and you are the 'de facto' MT, I would assume your guild would work it out so that you got the BoC if everyone agreed.<br />
<br />
You would still pay points, but to the benefit of the guild as a whole and without the aforementioned childish infighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes we use a DKP system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Typically in guilds where loot is officer / loot council assigned and planned for progression then the tanks will get a lions share of loot when content is new and then very little while that content is farmed.  The way you can manage to gear yourself well as the MT of your guild without looking like a loot whore is after you have killed the AoW and picked up a BoC, Helm and Ring, you stay in your guild and continue to turn up to the next 20 AoW kills not expecting anything.<br />
<br />
Tanks get geared up well and early by loot councils to make it easier for the guild to farm more gear for the rest of the guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since you're doing points, and you felt that your weapons are enough to hold agro, I wouldn't sweat it.  If you have a lot of points, and want to save 'em, thats your business.  You seem to have an eye for some more equitable spread and that's good.  If I were doing points, I'd have my list of things I wanted and go after those.  I've used a BoC that I'd auged and It was only OK as far as both procs going.<br />
<br />
Anyway, its your perogtive, and thats the way points work.  You earn what you keep.  You're not being a loot whore in that situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shouldn't feel guilty about spending dkp unless something is obviously of far more benefit to your guild in someone elses hands.Keep your own perspective though and just do what feels right and let the rest slide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your aggro weapons are fine ... if anything i'd call you smart for having the foresight to start saving for real upgrades a bit later.<br />
<br />
<br />
DKP is a wonderful thing if you know how to control yourself and plan ahead.  Make a list of the things you want to buy and steer away from frivilous purchases.  If youre in the market for a BF and the weapons you have are fine for now ... then pass on the BoC and save save save.  Even if the BF never drops, you still have all those banked points later for even bigger upgrades.<br />
<br />
Snag a pair of anger3 augments and you can pretty well hold aggro with gnoll hide lariats pre-EP given time for a few procs to settle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yethuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been MTing since for years as Yethuy my main and only toon.  Spread the wealth IMO put in for items that are sizable upgrades   BoC is nice but when I got my first I was dissapointed  now Blood Frenzy is a greatt agro weapon  good call and good chap imo not putting in for BoC <br />
<br />
 Someone earlier posted to make a list of mobs your doing and about to be at the power level to do and write down what are its best drops for you.... Sage advice imo <br />
<br />
 And always look out for the other warriors upgrade needs skipping a relativly minor upgrade myself to get another a big upgrade makes both of you feel good and helps out the raid force <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">aye a good ramp tank is also a healty thing to have if you gonna do some SoL mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My guild has like 10+ warriors so you can imagine what a headache THAT is!  :( <br />
<br />
I agree with most of the posts here, if you are in direct control of what you want to bid on, then that is your decision. No one knows what you need more than you. Especially in the case of BoC, simply treat it like it's just another aggro weapon with some stats, a smart raid can easily compensate for the &quot;loss&quot; of aggro from not wielding that BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes we use a DKP system.<br />
<br />
Since you use dkp its not possible to be a loot whore because you earn every item you win.  We run an officer distribution model basically because its easier to gear the chars necessary to progress.  For example we have 6ish app clerics in uqua.  When time loot drops i send them tells and say you better tell on this loot based on their magelo ect.  It helps to solve the ever apparant &quot;i dont want loot because im saving up for quarm ring as an app mentality.&quot;  Also there is a point where you need to gear warriors and clerics to advance.  Once you cross that line you are being a loot whore.  In fact if you want to see a prime example, look at guilds where the leader is a monk or shadow knight and they claim the first and newest loots for themselves.  It is obviously not in the guilds best interested, and can be construed as loot whoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you read through the posts, the orignal poster the officers don't always charge DKP, sometimes they would let the items go for free to benefit the tanks.  I believe the orignal poster knows the guild officers will give him most anything he asks for, but doesn't want to whore too much.</div></div><hr />
