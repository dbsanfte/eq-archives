<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KnomeEatter</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a level 25 warrior just recently coming back from a long, long vacation and have a couple questions about equipment.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=774190<br />
<br />
Now, I have quite a few questions.<br />
<br />
1) Haste.  I'm using a FBSS, and want more.  I was looking at either a Runebranded Girdle, or for 3-5k more I can get a Mask of the Forgotten (either way it will take me awhile to get it).  If I get the mask, that leaves a lot of room for improvement in the belt/back slot as opposed to a CoF or RBG.<br />
<br />
2) Armor.  I need some serious upgrades, I know.  I want a full suit of Fierce Heraldic, but are there any pieces that are halfway there and will hold me over until I start making real money in order to afford it?<br />
<br />
3) Weapons.  Yeah, they need some work.  I don't even know what's available after PoP, LoY and most of SoL.  I'm lost.<br />
<br />
4) What order?  I know the haste will be nice, and so will weapons...but armor makes a huge difference in how much I can take, I know that much.<br />
<br />
I also have an Ikky Regen BP for regen, so that's covered.<br />
<br />
Any help is more than appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Sure it is fast, but I was alway told that the dly of the sec weapon doesn't matter greatly.  I would advise a high dmg weapon there instead of a lammy.  I think a Sarnak Parrying Blade would be a good choice,  dly 30, dmg 16, and ac 10.  But that I think is my personal preference.   In the end you have to do what works for you the best.  If you are there to hold aggro or just to do a ton of dmg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Earrings are fine for a while.<br />
- Don't worry too much about resist gear till you get to L50<br />
- Collar, neck pieces are HARD to find good ones, let's leave that be for a bit<br />
- Head - gtg, keep that till L50<br />
- Ears/rings - gtg<br />
- bracer, get Bracer of Fortitide, Fierce Heraldic bracer (semi-expensive) at your stamina level, the +15 point increase will be a lot of hitpoints. And that ratio will get better as you get more levels<br />
- arms/hand are ok for a while. I wouldn't spend any money there, they'll be fine till L40's when you can start collecting Thurg drops in kael<br />
- mantle good, till you can save to get Barbed Dragonscale or FH Pauldron<br />
- barbed ringmail is very nice. You can keep that till you get Velious armor<br />
- back piece. Cloak of Greater Pernicity would be the optimun choice, you can start vulching drops in Tier 1 place when you reach L46.<br />
- legs - crusty or crafted<br />
- crystal spider eyes would be nice there<br />
- boots aren't bad for L20 char<br />
- weapons. Get rid of one and buy Centi Longsword. Also don't forget to buy other types so you can build skill when not tanking. I'm L64 and use 2hb as main weapon. You never know what you gonna need, so use them all.<br />
<br />
Now, Crustacean Shell armor is good, Crafted is better. Don't worry about Cobalt, it's just AC and clicky stuff. If you get cobalt, get for clicky, not to wear.<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic is too expensive. But if you have money, it's good choice.<br />

a note about delay, you want fast weapon in primary, and high damage in offhand. Fast weapon in offhand does not make offhand work faster. Only delay in primary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't this an old disproven myth?<br />
<br />
I thought offhand swings were completely unrelated to main hand delay. Every time your offhand is due to swing (based on delay) it makes a DW check, and if successful it swings. It doesn't matter how fast it swings, because there's no damage bonus on offhand, so swinging 10 times a minute for 50 damage is the same as swinging 5 times a minute for 100 damage. Mainhand speed is important because the damage bonus is applied every swing - more swings per minute, more times the damage bonus is applied. Try equipping a non-weapon (ie: infinite delay) in main hand, and if offhand swings are tied to mainhand delay, you shouldn't swing offhand at all. <br />
<br />
In short, for offhand weapons the delay and damage are irrelevent on their own, and pure ratio is what's used to compare</div></div><hr />

<br />
my point is, having small delay weapon in offhand does not help dps. get big damage weapon. Centi longsword best choice for original poster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">theorize away, but back up with parse.  <br />
<br />
Right back at you. I've already given you an example to disprove your theory. Equip a non-weapon primary hander like a Stein. If offhand swing rate is tied to primary hand delay, then since primary hand isn't swinging, niether should your secondary hand. <br />
<br />
Or was I wrong? I thought it was common knowledge that was how dual wield worked and something everyone who knew anything about melee knew this. I didn't feel the need to clarify something like that with a parse any more than I need to parse that fast weapons in primary hand mean more application of the primary hand admage bonus, therefore faster weapons give more DPS in primary hand. <br />
<br />
Check all the results from entering  +&quot;dual wield check&quot; +primary +secondary  into google and you'll see it's almost universally accepted ,including the following synopsis:<br />
<br />
Many people have gone to great lengths to prove that secondary hand delay is independent of primary delay. If you have a 19 delay in primary, and a 34 delay weapon is seconday, the primary will swing every 1.9 seconds. Every 3.4 seconds, the dual wield check will be made, and if it succeeds, the other weapon will swing.  <br />

Demorgoth is right, but Sardaan's advice was to get a big damaging weapon in the offhand, which, if he means a high ratio weapon, is solid advice. Sardaan even said fast offhand does NOT affect main hand, which Demorgoth appears to be responding to as if he said it did.<br />
<br />
All this is easy to test with a fire beetle eye, but totally unnecessary. The swings are independent, as Demorgoth says.<br />
<br />
I dont' really get why everyone is so in love with the centi longsword though. Stupid graphic, and there are many better offhanders. And crustacean is certainly better than crafted at some slots (legs and arms at least, probably bracer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janthor</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So then I don't understand...why don't people just get REALLY high damage and whatever delay in offhand, and keep low delay high damage in primary...if the delay in offhand doesn't mean anything, then wouldn't something like Wurmslayer be great due to the high damage?  I have noticed that the delay in the offhand does matter...but I'm still not sure how much as I don't have anything to back it up....just from what I see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if the wurmy could be put in the offhand; hell; a lot of people would be using it :D <br />
<br />
but yeah, primary hand=speed is the precedent(than benefcial proc). secondary hand = ratio + damage is key. the offhand doesn't grant a damage bonus either like the primary hand so ratio is where you can put near anyhting there and it's good as long as the ratio is 1:2 or better ( these days you can prob even say 1:1.5 or better )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because RATIO and DAMAGE are two different things<br />
<br />
Saardan is wrongly saying having small delay weapon in offhand does not help dps. get big damage weapon  The 'damage' part of the 'damage and delay' on a weapon, on it's own, is irrelevent.  <br />
<br />
50damage 150delay for example, whilst having a huge 'damage' componant, only has a 1/3 ratio. <br />
<br />
10damage 20delay for example has a much lower 'damage' componant, but with it's higher 1/2 ratio, it's a much superior offhander.<br />
<br />
Saardan's posting suggests that the 50 damage weapon would be superior offhand due to it's higher 'damage' componant, but  is false due to him not understanding that dual wielding is completely dependant of offhand delay, and has nothing to do with primary hand delay. A 3dam 6delay weapon offhand would be almost identical offhand dps to a 50dam 100delay offhander.<br />
<br />
In short, the best weapon for your offhand is the one with the highest ratio: damage divided by delay.</div></div><hr />
