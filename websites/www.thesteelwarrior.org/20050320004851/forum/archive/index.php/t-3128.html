<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudrin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all<br />
<br />
I just recently got EQ and was wondering if anyone knew the approximate accuracy of the Server sort by Population check mark box on the choose a server screen<br />
<br />
I have made a dwarf warrior and was wondering if it is pretty accurate indeed that servers like Fironia Vie and Maelyn Starpyre (sp?) are indeed the lowest populations?<br />
<br />
Are these the newest servers besides Stromm and other than the PvP servers?<br />
<br />
Is it better to pick a low pop server nowadays since the game has been out that long or is it better to pick a server lower on the list?<br />
<br />
How is grouping in EQ now that it is so old, is everyone real high level or does a new player stand a chance? Wondering if a warrior was a bad choice I was reading that shamans can solo and druids and necros but I want a dwarf fighter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you grp at low lvls you will be with twinks if you can find a grp, they are out there, but nothing like it use to be. I would go Stromm as far as servers if you want the most untweaked players and nonscrew economy. Granted aome people know the game on there well enough they are already high lvl and full of pp. But it is your best chance IMO to get the game in its intended state.<br />
<br />
I would play a bard, if your hands can take it or a wizard. Just my opinion there too :) Good soloers and good groups alike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, Stromm (even tho we got robbed on the naming of the server *shakes fists*) is likely the closest you'll get to that &quot;warm fuzzy walk in North Ro for the first time feeling&quot;.  Even though you can still move thru the world 100 times faster via PoK, the quality and frequency of major twinks should be downgraded.<br />
<br />
For fun I suggest taking all the boats at least once, round trip...  then imagine when that was the only way to get from one continent to the other :P.  Oh, and run from Freeport to Halas ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudrin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow a wizard?<br />
<br />
would have never thought that one<br />
<br />
interesting.<br />
<br />
i dont think i will run from freeport to halas lol<br />
<br />
I made a barbarian once a couple of days ago and got lost trying to get to that blackburrow place.<br />
<br />
he died and i just deleted him ROFL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a new wizard alt and I am nothing short of happy with him. As my warrior could solo early on, he was nothing compared to the wizard. I am oonly 21 right now, but still soloing yellows and a few reds, my warrior was not able to do this with ease or the speed that the wizard can. And I dont have to run much either, gates and ports rock :)<br />
<br />
I had a barb as one of my first toons. I enjoyed getting lost in the snow covered maze myself, once you find your way to BB you will feel warm and tingly. Of course if you die, you had better have a light sorce in the bank or that tunnel is hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudrin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IF i got my wife to play, which she might, would a warrior be ok then if she makes a healer like a druid or cleric?<br />
<br />
I figure then my chances for survival would be much better. Even at level 5 i was sure sitting down a lot Bind Wound didnt help too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman would be a good partner. But remember, if you dont lan on grping much, you will be beggin her to play lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudrin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh that settles it then she must play!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a shaman would make a good choice to partner with but if you cant get her to play then maybe you should think about playing a beastlord or a necro....easy to solo with those classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally if you want to play a Warrior do it. Don't worry about soloing or getting elite lewts just play and have fun with your toon :)<br />
<br />
*shakes her head at all the ANTI-WARRIOR crap she read*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudrin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL thanks Raychael I feel a little better about what I picked at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will definitely want to group with a healer.<br />
<br />
Shaman - Slow/dots/utility<br />
Druid - Ports/snare/damage shield/nukes/utility<br />
Cleric - Best healer/best hp and ac buffs/Rez/least utility<br />
<br />
The druid and shaman will have more trouble healing you until the high 50s but they have other nice things to offer like SoW and Invis that will make your life as a warrior more pleasant.  Plan on some downtime with the druid or shaman in your 40s and early 50s, but in the upper 50s and 60s druids become very good healers and slow is very powerful.<br />
<br />
Cleric is my personal favorite, but most people here would say shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My warrior was the first character I created when I started playing a bit over a year ago.  My only piece of advice is that if you start with a warrior expect the going to be tough and a lot more work than other classes.  I would say that I managed to survive with below average equipment on my warrior all the way up til my low 50s, mostly because I found some friends and people tended to like me :)  The fact is that you will not be out in Rathe Mountains soloing HGs any time soon (like those damn droods) to be able to afford all of the upgrades that a warrior needs, and we are indeed the most equipment dependent class in the game.  If you're willing to accept the fact that you will most likely not be geared as well as some 65 necro's twink, and that that fact will be glaringly obvious for our class unlike some others where you would hardly notice, then by all means go with the warrior.  Not to talk you out of it, I consider myself now to be a much better player of my warrior for starting from the bottom up with him, I believe in a lot of ways I learned far more about how to correctly play the game by struggling along.  Good luck to you.<br />

ps  my intent was not to bash the warrior class, but I think most people can agree that access to good gear is indeed a limiting factor to starting up with a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudrin</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what about a shaman and shadowknight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would also be a good combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd lean toward shaman.  The exp you gain and how fast you'll breeze through 50 gives the nod to the shaman.  Slow = melee gold for duo'ing with a melee.  Keep yer regen up, get DS potions and slow nicely mitigates the relative lack of healing power that the shaman have thru the 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">best would prolly be let your wife play what she wants, and you play the supporting toon. makes them much happier and willing to play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman + paladin is a great all around duo. Complementary buffs, tankability, healing, basic CC, rez, heals, etc, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even better letting her be what she wants...<br />
<br />
My wife likes being a dr00d but I'm almost convinced she'd rather be a ranja... I'm inclined to let her but gonna put it on another acct cuz all my healers are on the one she's on :P.<br />
<br />
Not sure how well an SK and Ranja would do duoing :P</div></div><hr />
