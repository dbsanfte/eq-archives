<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treyon</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make warrior only usable arrows that have like +300 hate or arrows that depend on level for the amount of hate on them.<br />
<br />
It would not nerf anyone but give us same advantage that pallies and sk have --high agro ability on inc.<br />
<br />
Honestly how many arrows do we normally fire on mob INC. 1 or 2. The only time we would be firing more arrows is if the mob stops this would allow for the fast cast of tash malo but make them wait on slow the normal amount of time. I would even stay with our current ablity to hit with arrow so there is a chance on lower amount of agro we can generate.<br />
<br />
It would avoid change taunt key range but also give us a different option for the running mad man that had to over nuke even. It would also bring us back up on hate list so the shammy - druid that has 5 dots on mob isnt next to die.<br />
<br />
To me would work out for all we would not be asking for any major change could either put in a new arrow buyable type or even as a combinable item. Such as warrior level 1-20 arrows with +30 hate, level 21-40 arrows with +100 hate, level 41-50 arrows with +150 hate, level 51-60 with +225 hate, level 61-65 arrows with +300 hate. Just add in a 5 part to combine in the fletching kit with those level requirements on them.<br />

They did not do anything about it then doubt they will now. While it isnt a bad idea they dont seem to want to do anything for us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most knights reckon that giving us their burst aggro at range (which essentially is what this is) would see them back in kunark for groups. i don't actually agree with that but I'm convinced that making tanking and aggro generation trivial is ultimately a bad thing because it further entrenches the ' one tank only' style of grouping. We want more reason to include more than one tank in a group not less.<br />

They could either up the amount of hate or lower it so wasnt equal to agro lock BUT allowed a form of ranged hate. This would make us back on par with our caster tank hybrids. <br />
<br />
I think most of us would agree --Give me 1 proc from BoC on incoming would give us our EXPERIANCE groupablity equal footing it would not effect RAID encounters.<br />
<br />
Such an idea would not lessen sk or pally ability to tank for a group so it would be maby finally what tank is lfg grab them --- as for stacking it would allow sk to still increase our during melee hate generation use spells on incoming with less fear of stealing agro, pally could cast stuns right as a mob hits group without gankin agro be able to still stun the mob if it charges the robe dressed.<br />
<br />
If they think upping our mitigation or hp would severly alter RAID set ups giving us a minimal range hate would fix our grouping problem.<br />
<br />
This is only in reply to all the what should we really ask dev's to do for our groupability. Compaired to hybrids this is where a warrior lacks ----The ability to generate any hate on incoming.<br />

Instead, they need to just seperate the gap of defensive ability between Knights and Warriors (Not through AA/End Game equipment, as that doesn't help alot of the people who really need it the most).</div></div><hr />
