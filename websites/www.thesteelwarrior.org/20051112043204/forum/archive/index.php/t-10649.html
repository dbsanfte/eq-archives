With 2 healers (priest/shm), it is a COLOSSAL WASTE OF TIME, efficiency goes out the window, take my word on it.<br />
<br />
Prot spec is the ONLY way to go for instances (i mean the last 4 instance not the early trash ones).  Offense tank later becomes an offtanker (which you don't need) or tank #2 in 2nd group (for those who can't handle it so they raid it).  Sure people will give the we raid cause it's a pain in the ass clearing the trash yadi yada,  when they mean to say 'we get tired of getting pwned every time as 5man so we gave up'.  My group now clears lbrs in about 60~70min when it used to take us more like 120~150.  I am still a firm believer of doing the 1 group instances like it was designed to be as 1 group.  Sure the early road is rough but it teaches people fuking skills on how to react fast when shit hits the fan and teaches the instances as to what we can avoid (no need to clear ALL the trash along the way) whereas a raid zergfest teaches nothing cept that numbers win in an instanced designed for 5 people.  The end result?  A dedicated team of 5 who learn all the instances becomes much better players overall in terms of quick judgement and reaction speed, not to mention they have much much better gear then your zergfest joe.  This is not for everyone though as our guild strive for challenge and perfection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may be able to tank an instance effectively without a protection build, however, you will never tank as well as someone who is (just as a protection build will never do damage as well as an arms build).  That's why we have skill tree options.<br />
<br />
I keep hearing mixed reviews on prot spec being required in the end game.  If it is to stay true to the &quot;spirit&quot; of talents then prot spec wouldnt be required.<br />
<br />
I see those mixed reviews, and the folks usually posting them are arms spec people.  I think you have the &quot;spirit&quot; of the talent system backwards.  If a warrior can do everything, from damage to raid boss tanking, regardless of how he is spec'd, what's the purpose of having a talent system?  It has been pretty  common knowledge since beta that the high-end instances were designed assuming a group would have a protection spec warrior and a strong healer (generally a holy spec priest).<br />
<br />
I too would like to know what exactly Krun found that was causing efficiency to go out the window.  Aggro? Survivablity? Something else?<br />
<br />
I can't speak for Krun, but I can speak for my experience in Marudon/Zul Farrak/Temple of Atal'Hakkar.  I think the word is efficiency.  <br />
<br />
In an instance the goal is to maximize kill rate while minimizing risk.  Kill rate is not determined by how quickly your group kills a single mob or cluster of mobs, but rather by how many mobs you have to kill before you have downtime to sit and drink.  Usually the one person in the group who's mana determines this is the priest.<br />
<br />
A protection spec tank boosts group efficiency by soaking up damage more effectively and by controling agro more reliably.  Better mitigation = less heals needed on the warrior.  More agro control = less emergency heals tossed on the DPS classes, or less chance of the priest getting mobbed.<br />
<br />
The low hanging fruit in protection spec can help with this -- shield spec, toughness, maybe anticipation.   The better skills, however are higher up in the tree.  Defiance, improved revenge, concussive blow (yes many bosses are immune, but you have to clear a dungeon to get to the bosses).<br />
<br />
I've not done the highest instances yet, but I have done runs where I was main tank (protection spec) and others where a higher level arms-spec was main tank.  My regular priest could surely tell a difference (and now she insists I tank regardless of who else we have in the group).  <br />
<br />
It isn't a question of whether an arms-spec warrior CAN tank these zones.  It is a question of how do you maximize the efficiency of a group, and in general that is better served by soaking up damage well and controlling agro with certainty rather than by adding a modest amount to overall group DPS.</div></div><hr />

I have no points in defiance and I have zero aggro issues after playing the game for a few months to figure out how aggro works.  Defiance is definitely not required for single gorup content.<br />
<br />
If aggro is provided by revenge, it's provided by the skill, not the stun, hence the talent points are useless.<br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs to be made a guaranteed stun even on stun immune mobs, or that skill is fucking garbage.  It doesn't produce aggro, and 90% of the time, it's not gonna land on the mob you need it to land on anyway (the high DPS boss).  <br />

Well, I certainly wouldnt expect prot spec'd folks to have much valid input on how effective an arms build is tanking unless they've done both. As I understand the spirit of the talent system, its only supposed to enchance your toon, not make or break it.  Its not supposed to be like AA's, where they were a requirment, if I understand the spirit of the talent system correctly.<br />
<br />
Effectiveness is a relative measure. It usually depends on the people involved.  Anywhere in PvE a prot spec will &quot;tank&quot; more effectively in terms of health and (possibly) aggro managment.  No doubt about it.  What is painfully clear in the low to mid game, a pure tank isnt really necessary.  It definatly helps, but its not 100% required like it was in EQ.  Less than ideal groups can get the job done too.<br />
<br />
In the high end 5 man instances, there are Arms spec guys saying they are tanking just fine.  They are getting the job done in otherwords.  As effective? Probably not.  But do you have to perform at peak efficency to achive results (to kill the boss, take his loot, finish the quest, etc)?  With the right group of players, I highly doubt it.  Of course it will be easier prot spec'd, but not entirely impossible arms spec'd either.<br />
<br />
In a raid setting, where heals are hopefully abundant, it again comes down to a question of is the prot spec absolutely necessary to achive results or can arms spec do the job, even if it isnt as effcient?<br />
<br />
For maximizing your PvE efficiency in groups, prot seems the obvious choice.  But that only covers about 1/3 to 1/2 of the total game play in WoW.  PvP issues (and to some extent solo issues) are of equal importance when concidering how to spend talent points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't see much improvement in prot spec.<br />
<br />
Last night, I did the weaker side of BRS (up to the lv55+ fire elementals and dragoons, after that our priest had to go to bed). I'm lv53, and I had absolutely no trouble tanking a lv60 backstab rogue, 59 fire mage, and 58 shadow priest. I don't think we had any downtime except for bad pulls or when the mage and I spammed AOEs to kill swarms of non-elite mobs.<br />
<br />
Really, if I can tank a +7 level rogue critting for 700 nonstop, Arms can't be that bad. Although I am considering going Arms/Fury as I have a 2h mace waiting for me at lv58.<br />
<br />
For reference, I'm 31 Arms/13 Fury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thengel</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that the talents in the protection tree are just SAD.  The stuns are cool on non-immune mobs, the +armor is nice, aggro is sometimes needed.  The &quot;bang for your buck&quot; factor is pathetic, however.  Every talent you spend in the arms tree gives a pretty good power boost.  Fury is less so than arms.  Protection is far, far behind.  Then at the very top of the tree we have shield discipline, a horrid excuse for a talent.  <br />
<br />
I've been protection spec from the time I got my first talent point and dropped it in shield specialization, and ever since I've been disappointed, all the way to l evel 60.   Arguably the best defensive talent warriors get isn't even in the protection tree - deflection.  Anyone else notice that you can get 1-2% dodge/parry from items or 10-25 defense, yet our talent gives +5% parry and the other gives +10 defense.  5% parry is 3-5 rare items worth, +10 defense is half an item.<br />
<br />
So last night I did a full respec.  Went from protection to arms / fury.  I'll see how it goes.  I know my damage output is a ton higher.  I know soloing is far easier.  In instances I actually feel it matters if I equip a good weapon instead of my 1.0 DPS nooby sword.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That you are able to tank without defiance is great, but about as relevant to how useful the skill is as my ability to solo as a protection spec is to the usefulness of mortal strike.  I've tanked both without and with defiance (after a respec), and have found it to be an improvement, especially when trying to hold agro on multiple mobs.  Spaming sunder is great for locking agro on one guy, but on four you must be constantly swapping around,  agro'ing just enough to hold it then swap to the next mob before it drops onto your priest.  The 15% hate bonus of defiance makes this task easier (though I'd agree it is a min-max kind of skill, not a &quot;holy shit that rocks&quot; kind of skill).<br />
<br />
If aggro is provided by revenge, it's provided by the skill, not the stun, hence the talent points are useless.<br />
<br />
Your right, agro is provided by the base skill in revenge.  The stuns are gravvy.  To get to the 3 or 4 boss mobs in an instance, you have to clear 100-150 normal mobs.  The normal mobs are not stun immune.  Being able to revenge stun them substantially reduces the damage I take, reducing the amount of mana the priest has to spend healing me, decreasing the amount of time she needs to spend drinking, increasing our kill rate (and allowing us to get to the bosses faster).  It is also one of the most useful skills in the protection tree for solo'ing (probably the most useful, actually).<br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs to be made a guaranteed stun even on stun immune mobs, or that skill is fucking garbage.  It doesn't produce aggro, and 90% of the time, it's not gonna land on the mob you need it to land on anyway (the high DPS boss).  <br />
<br />
Oh I don't know.  Ever needed to buy some time for a heal to land against a non-stun immune mob?  How about stopping a caster from getting a spell off when shield bash isn't up?  How about getting a mob to stop wailing on your priest when taunt isn't up?  Do you ever PvP? (hint-it is one of the 3 or 4 most useful PvP abilities warriors have).  Hell, when your solo'ing a tough mob, try whacking it with concussion blow then bandaging yourself.  <br />
<br />
I'd love for it to stick on any mob, including bosses.  But even in its current form it is far from garbage.<br />
<br />
And this is coming from a prot spec tank.  Sorry, prot spec is sorely fucking lacking at the moment.  Don't get me wrong, you can do your job just fine, but there is no &quot;Wow&quot; skill at the top of the tree like there should be.<br />
<br />
Protection spec tank here as well, and I agree, the tree needs some work (as do arms and fury).  Iron will, imp shield wall, improved disarm, etc... are a waste of space.  But there are abilities in it beyond shield disc and toughness that greatly increase our ability to take damage and control agro, and though it would be great to see them buffed, they work ok as is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a lot of things in this game that I doubt, and one of them is this.<br />
<br />
Until we see an actual functioning parser, things like this are just gonna have to go as &quot;fact&quot; until we can properly debunk them.  Mobs swing IMMEDIATELY upon being unstunned, meaning that their combat cycle does not stop when they're stunned.<br />
<br />
The net effect of a revenge stun, is therefore, at absolute best, 1 hit mitigated.  Off of a trash mob.  Every 15 seconds (diminishing returns).<br />
<br />
How many trash mobs live for 15 seconds, even in an instance? <br />
<br />
Revenge does not substantially reduce the amount of damage you take.  It may very slightly reduce it, but it in no way is a major contributor to reducing the damage you take during a fight.<br />
<br />
Ever needed to buy some time for a heal to land against a non-stun immune mob? How about stopping a caster from getting a spell off when shield bash isn't up? How about getting a mob to stop wailing on your priest when taunt isn't up? Do you ever PvP? (hint-it is one of the 3 or 4 most useful PvP abilities warriors have). Hell, when your solo'ing a tough mob, try whacking it with concussion blow then bandaging yourself. <br />
<br />
Been there, done that.  Ability to miss + Next Melee + 45 second cooldown + useless on bosses = Fucking garbage.<br />
<br />
Compare to MS, Ability to miss + instant + 6 second cooldown + useful on bosses.   <br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs A LOT of work.  It may be one of the 3 or 4 most useful  PvP abilities we have, but it's number 3 or 4.  Behind such things as Hamstring and Rend for christs sake.  That's not what I think the definitive skill from a tree should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwaern</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">interestingly enough, improved shield wall is one of the only prot tree talents I see garnering praise from folks that have used it on raids.<br />
<br />
Spec'ing improved shield wall takes the base ability from being 10 seconds long to 16 (on a half hour cooldown timer).  At ten seconds it is barely useful, at 16 it is marginal.  If it were 14 seconds and spec'd out to 20, it would be a much more useful skill.  It is purely a tanking ability, and only really useful in boss mob situations (or &quot;oh shit group wipe&quot;) situations.  In either case, the duration marginalizes the skill substantially.<br />
<br />
It's usefulness is further reduced by being on the same timer with retaliation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;It has been pretty common knowledge since beta that the high-end instances were designed assuming a group would have a protection spec warrior and a strong healer (generally a holy spec priest).&quot;<br />
<br />
This really isn't true at all.  Talent points had absoultely nothing to do with the design of high end instances. I too am a protection spec'd tank. I min-max to the extreme defensively. I can tank an instance &quot;better&quot; than an ms spec'd tank by a decentish margin because of a combination of my talents and gear.  However, I don't know many MS tanks that don't carry around a good shield and a few items to swap into when they're tanking instances, and they can tank it 90% as effectively as a protection spec'd tank.  In the same gear the difference is marginal, and an MS build or even a fury build can do the same things we can. <br />
<br />
Since the game is partially PVP and partially PvE, implying that protection spec'd is the only way to tank is fascist , incorrect, garbage. <br />
<br />
Also, &quot;holy&quot; spec needs work for priests, it actually isn't that good, even for a min-max build. Shadow priests get silence and a number of other abilities that can mitigate damage more effectively. My normal priest switched to shadow spec a few nights ago, and it's actually been working out better for instances/etc. Even on raids, a holy priest has very little advantage. Don't forget killing faster mitigates more damage as well. This isn't EQ, classes aren't 1-use wonders.<br />
<br />
That said I love being protection spec'd. Improved shield wall is one of our best talents, and the 5-10 point talents are great. The rest of the tree can use some work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here's my  thoughts:<br />
<br />
Gwaern really hit the spot with 'efficiency' it's all about reducing downtime and progressing faster over higher dps.  Atm prot spec is pretty fuking weak in the sense we don't have an end skill that defines it (like MS does for arms), i tried shield disc finally and yes it 'may' be decent for the 3pts needed (2sb and 1 sd) but not worth it considering the pre req of 30.  It's like Flurry, great skill to have but not worth due to the weak fury tree, unlike the arms tree which is very nicely tuned for MS.<br />
<br />
Basically what it boils down to is this, an offensive tank won't be an 'efficient' prot tank even if he changes to 1h+shield no more then a defensive tank can  be effective with a 2hander without ms.  You want specifics?  Prot talents on a whole are not 'great' or more synergenic then the arms line that builds to ms.  But due to the game mechanics you cannot get all the 'real' gems of prot if you dump 31 into arms.<br />
<br />
Before i get further let me show and explain my build as a prot tank:<br />
<br />
Arms: 5 Deflection, 5 Tactical Mastery, 1 Anger management, 2 Imp Charge<br />
<br />
Fury: 5 Cruelty<br />
<br />
Prot: 5 Shield block, 5 Anticipation, 5 toughness, 3 imp revenge, 5 defiance, 2 bloodrage, 1 last stand, 1 imp shield block, 2 shield wall, 2 imp taunt, 2 imp sunder armor.<br />
<br />
Essentials i find are : 5shieldblock, 5 toughness, 3 imp revenge, 5 defiance, 2 bloodrage, 1 last stand, 1 imp shield block, 2 taunt, 2 shield wall. Which is 26pts thus making it impossible to get MS.<br />
<br />
My previous build was i ditched anticipation, and imp sunder and with the 7 pts i put into 3 imp rend, 3 deep wound , 1 impale.  But due to the recent high AC + to defense gear i got lately (which i am now a big fan of) Anticipation was needed to further maximize it thus making these changes.<br />
<br />
An MS tank can get Last stand but can't get shield wall basically and i find  that extra 5 sec makes a big difference (not only against boss but against unforseen events where things turn ugly forcing you to use ae taunt)<br />
<br />
A hybrid concept was designed 31/20 arms prot tank 20 being, 5 shield block, 5 toughness, 2 bloodrage, 1 last stand, 1 imp shield block, 1 imp revenge, 3 defiance, 2 imp taunt.  Basically the bare min of prot build and sacrificing cruelty along the way.  It may look ok on paper but not on actual practice.<br />
<br />
MS is a rage dump ability that reqs 30 rage and i don't know how the hell a prot main tank can maintain MS dumps at the final instances.<br />
<br />
Scenario A:  6 mobs 4 of them elite, say you sap 1, i'd go in with charge demo shout, pull it back a bit ( away from sap/sheep mob ) use T clap (Yes T clap), switch to defensive demo again, then proceed to go counter clockwise and add a sunder to each elites, use taunt if a mob turns on someone, accumulate 20 rage, switch to battle T clap again, switch back sunder, demo etc.. it goes on.<br />
<br />
T clap is very very good in terms of aggro generation AND the 10% slowing of attack speed for further dmg reduction,  my rage never goes beyond 40, as i use a sunder then switch to T clap, and if it does i use dumps like shield block (not to mention revenge whenver it pops), and even shouts to keep my rage at optimal effeciency.  A friend of mine recently brought his MS warrior to act as a dps/offtanker, and he was getting his bang for the buck for MS cause all he'd do is charge in MS, switch to zerk stance, use zerk rage, bloodrage, and just keep using Ms whenever he can without having to worry about Aggro since i was keeping it all.<br />
<br />
So basically my tanking job never lets me get the 30 rage for MS and it is not worth for me to pump 31 pts into it just to get the odd MS here and there when i get over my 40 rage efficiency level (which happens on a crit, or shaman windfurry buff procs) etc..  As a singular talent prot is much weaker, but every little bit helps, talents like imp taunt, anticipation, last stand, shield wall cannot be overlooked as well as the most obvious other ones.<br />
<br />
With my MS testing build, i found i did i was lucky if i did 1 MS per 'set of mobs' which is beyond pathetic for the 31pt input into it.  While all the little 'talents' of prot i was missing was impairing my efficiency in terms of tanking to holding aggro which caused further downtime and thus i concluded that it was not &quot;as  efficient&quot; as my old build by 99999999999999 miles.  I am hoping they change shield disc and give prot tanks a workable 3rd tier skill to improve things, but for now i am happy with the way things are.  The last instances requires so much micro and quick reflex that it's sadistically fun to play them, and prot tanks are ANYTHING but boring (if you think they are then you really need to understand how tanking works).<br />
<br />
BTW all of my comments are directed for people who strive to learn how to play properly (doing brs,lbrs,schol,strat) as a single group &quot;efficiently&quot;.  Not to those who sold out to bandwagon raids that teaches nothing cept that you can get by with shitty playskills by hanging out with 15 others in a 5man instance.  If you take along the 'raid' aspect i believe even MS tanks can do 'ok' since u'll have so many healers and so much more dps that it won't matter what talents you have.</div></div><hr />
