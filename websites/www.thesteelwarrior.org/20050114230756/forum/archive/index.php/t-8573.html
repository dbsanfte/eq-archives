I'm looking for suggestions on gear upgrades. I'm not elemental flagged or time flagged yet but getting closer. In the mean time I'm struggling collecting LDoN points (specifically NRo) and have 125k banked. <br />
<br />
Here is my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=866238).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites, Stonewood Bow, Warlord's Steel Gauntlets, Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet. I can't think of some arms off the top of my head right now, Pitted Vambraces? Anything from hard ldon or god would be an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have Gates, take a group and go to the arena in Riwwi.  One of the Pixxt that spawn will path through the arena, a female with the lower torso of a snake.  She can drop some dang fine greaves.  <br />
The stats as best I recall:<br />
38ac, 70hp/mana/end, some str/dex/int, attk 20, regen 2 and assorted saves.<br />
Plate classes only.<br />
VERY nice greaves and single groupable.  I think they are called Hardened Serpentscale Greaves.  I had these myself, but gave them away as I had slightly better. <br />
<br />
If you feel like goofing off in natimbi, camp a Shell Inlaid Collar or buy it for too much in the bazaar.  <br />
It is also past time for the indo arms to go!  Something as simple as unimbued brellium vambraces will hold you over til you can camp better or buy something from ldon. <br />
Also, if you do hards, try Everfrost for the mana threaded bone bracelet, or keep an eye out in the bazaar.  <br />
Your offhand won't net you much aggro.  Use your SotBS or CHoS.  Oh, and put your CoF back on. ;)</div></div><hr />

I think he meant 125k plat.  I don't think anyone around has earned 125k LDoN points so far.  If someone has, then uh.....wow, get help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">etepiqari</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye 125k plat and also wanted to point out that I have equipped a CoF and not the lodi shield (must have been there while running through the Grey and doing an update at same time).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerberus</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Red Dragon scales &amp; Spiroc wingblade  :D <br />
<br />
Also a good upgrade for the CoF that I have is:<br />
<br />
Dreadscale Cloak  <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 0.8 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Slot: BACK  <br />
AC: +10 Str: +9 Sta: +9 Wis: +9 Int: +9 Disease Resist: +10 Poison Resist: +10 HP: +70 Mana: +50  <br />
Classes: Beastlord Ranger Paladin Shadowknight Bard Monk Rogue Warrior  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
 Required: Yes<br />
 <br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
 Effect: Haste<br />
1: Increase Attack Speed by 2% (L1) to 50% (L49)<br />
 <br />
Type: Worn <br />
Level for Effect: 35 <br />
Haste: 36% <br />
<br />
Not the greatest Haste item but relatively easy to get with a casual guild and the stats are better than the CoF. Drops of Innoruk in Nadox. IT can be gotten with 2 groups of people Moderately equipped. Good thing about it is you can sell the CoF and make 50k and buy some more gear. Kizraks gauntlets of Battle would be another good upgrade for the Kylong gaunts. Will add another 20% haste.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />
