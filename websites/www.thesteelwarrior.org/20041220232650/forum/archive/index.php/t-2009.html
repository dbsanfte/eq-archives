<br />
The above link is to a thread on this topic from the old board.  It contains the famous Sscaley parse.  Sscaley posted parses that showed the same decrease in damage taken over time for both LR and ID.  The last line from his post says it very well:<br />
<br />
From this little test, I would hypothesise that ID and LR are about the same efficiency in reducing total damage taken - however, LR will make you get hit less which can affect any innate proc related additional damage/stuns.  <br />
<br />
Is there any chance of getting that post, or the whole thread, copied over to this board and put into the library?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While they may both reduce about the same amount of damage, IMO LR &gt; ID.  I would much rather have a better chance of completely avoiding a hit when a CH chain hit a glich or some other unforseen thing that would cause my life to fall dangerously low than mitigating it for only paritial damage that could still kill me.  Also as already stated, avoidance helps avoid procs as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say that avoidance reduces procs, if they dont hit, they cant proc.<br />
<br />
Are we sure this is true?<br />
<br />
I know you can Proc on a mob that is too far away to hit in melee.. did it in TZ with a BoC<br />
I know you can proc on a mob that is IMMUNE to your weapons.. did it on EmP with a frostreaver.<br />
I know you can proc on a mob that is dead.. seen it done on CORPSES with a OT hammer to gate out...<br />

Are we sure if u dodge/etc  will not get proc'd on?</div></div><hr />

While both reduce melee damage taken by the same amount, avoiding procs and being stunned makes LR better to get first.  You will want to get both tho, great AA's.<br />

Ean, a mob cannot proc on a mis, unless he has a proccing weapon equipped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you see what I am asking?<br />
<br />
In order for you to activate LR5, the mob must pass the 'TO HIT' test, so technically he did HIT you, you just avoided it. And when the proc checks if the mob hits, does it look before or after the LR5 test? If the programmers are lazy, and all good programmers are, they would use the same coding in both locations, so I would guess that the 'Hit' variable is independant of the avaoidance effect.<br />
<br />
I know I am getting technical, but this is a common belief, yet has this ever been checked? <br />
<br />
It was belief that a successful taunt always gave you aggro until just a short while ago, when we decided that there is more involved in aggro than just being at the top of the hate list, per the 4 taunt effect...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope the parry/dodge/repost check is before to hit. (Otherwise you would have the odd situation of reposting more on enemies who are higher, and less on that suisidal skeleton.)<br />
<br />
There was a bunch of work on this issue, using repost mod weapons and the like.<br />
<br />
Besides LR should not produce dodges, but clean misses (at least if I am remember the description correctly).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My view is exactly the opposite, at least, when tanking boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Spike damage is what kills MTs on bosses. I'd take a steady 3k/round melee every time, over a 0-4k melee/round, averaging out at 2k/round. Why? Because you have to be healed for 'worst case' at all times. Although you'll get lucky a lot of the time on an avoidance based tank, average spike damage will be a lot higher than on a mitigation based tank. Assuming healing isn't fubar, a mitigation based tank will have less spike damage death than an avoidance one.  Proc damage may appear to happen less, but that's irrelevent - it's the rounds a quad gets through that will kill you.<br />
<br />
If spike damage isn't a danger (eg: exp groups) it doesn't really matter as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When dealing with spike damage, ID has the same effect.  It only gives you a chance to mitigate it more, you wont mitigate 100% of the time.  So that theoritical quad where you don't avoid, you also may not mitigate meaning you die either way.  Also, when speaking of VT, which the asker of this question is refering to, the bosses in VT do not have a high spike damage factor that I have ever noticed, they proc more than they will have damage spikes.  I still will stand by LR being better than ID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it's true that in raid situations, what you're trying to minimize is spike damage, ca/cs/lr/id all actually increase the spike damage, because while they reduce on average the amount of damage you're taking, they do not reduce the maximum you could take.  Whether you go with avoidance or mitigation aa's, all you can hope for in either case is to reduce the chance of a spike, because neither actually reduces the size of the worst case rounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is wiered I used to be a strong beliver that CA/LR did much more for me then CS but then I did some number crunshing based on that old thread.<br />
<br />
averge hit/ttl hits/ hit % difference / total dmg taken / dmg diff<br />
287	38000	95	10906000	26000<br />
272	40000	100	10880000	<br />
<br />
so if we say lr make you avoid 5 percent of hits you would take 26000 less dmg if you instead mitigate 5% dmg with ID5 based in 40000 hits in pov. Hmmm. I may be going and maxing that AA.</div></div><hr />

If you are afraid of spike tanking.. then call out for early heals or something.. don't do shit job on your aa cuz your afraid of some mob missing you and then hitting you for more dmg and messing up a ch rotation and what not , I mean even if You do LR theres going to be hits that are much harder than others...in conclusion LR &gt; ID... btw Dima kicks a$$ btw.</div></div><hr />

Eureka! Thanks Zakneffan, I R SO N3wB!!1!. I'll just ask for them to heal earlier on their CH insta-rotation whilst mobs are hitting me for 3k a swing.<br />
<br />
Choo...Choo....The clue express is coming to town....<br />
<br />
Sscaley posted parses that showed the same decrease in damage taken over time for both LR and ID.<br />
<br />
LR: You are missed (ie: 100% mitigation) X times<br />
ID: You mitigate the damage (ie: 1-99% mitigation) Y times<br />
<br />
In order for the same amount of damage to be taken in a period of time Y &gt; X, or in 1d1ot's terms: ID fires much more often than LR. The more times ID or LR fires, the lower the chance of 4 max hits in a single round. Sorry if this math stuff is outside your brain capacity, but your simpleton 'conclusion' is about as valid as saying ID &gt; LR because it's worth more in scrabble.<br />
<br />
the simple fact is 1 . YOU DO NOT GET HIT AT ALL and ARE MISSED or 2. YOU ARE HIT AND IT IS MITIGATED INTO LOWER DMG<br />
<br />
I assume you MT with /disc fortitude rather than /disc defensive then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if ID lowers average hit as he has shown... and LR lower percentage of hit taken... ID &gt; LR if considering only total dmg reduction. Here is why let me explain in detail my math....<br />
<br />
Keep basing my calc on tests by Sscaley. Let do a calc 40,000 hits on tank from PoV mob. One with ID5. One with LR5.<br />
<br />
ID5 - lower average hit to 272<br />
so 40,000 hits x 272 = 10,880,000 ttl dmg<br />
<br />
LR5 - lower number of hits by 5% so to 38,000 hits ttl and average hit stays at 287 <br />
so 38,000 hits at 287 = 10,906,000ttl dmg<br />
<br />
as you can see ID5 saves you 26,000 ttl dmg taken on 40,000 hit sample,<br />
<br />
edit: thought about it some more and it actually turns out to be that even thought 26k dmg seems a lot, its less then 1 percent of ttl dmg and data is no where near acurate enough anyways so disregard ID &gt; LR they are about same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't see this answered (didnt pay all that much attention however)... but dodge IS indeed a miss.  You can test this by changing your hitsmodes to miss only... you will see just misses, instead of repostes, dodges, parries, etc in addition to normal misses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
erm... I thought I was insulting Zakneffan rather than you... I niether quoted you, nor used your name, so no idea why you were the one taking offense. I was in fact agreeing with you that mitigating more hits was safer for MTing a boss than having a few completely miss you.<br />
<br />
Anyone have an parses on NumberOfMaxHits to LR or ID? I'd expect ID to probably fire a lot more often. By definition of the fact the damage taken over time is around the same, ID *MUST* lower the damage on a greater proportion of hits than LR does. That means, by definition, fewer rounds that are likely to outright kill you.</div></div><hr />

First off I never said Call your early heals, I said if Your HP spikes and you feel you need to do other than just stand there , maybe call for a heal like calling rampage , second off If your tanking mobs that hit for 3k and don't have both LR and ID... you need to do some exping because all of the elemental tanks I know have these AA's, I'm not the type to go and play Devil's advocate when people say something that seems like common sense ( Mobs missing you *completely or mobs hitting you just for less mitigated dmg.) IMO LR &gt; ID for that reason, They are both awsome abilities...You get what you want... Flaming someone for posting about AA abilities is a little immature , and shows you have waaay too much free time on your hands :)... anyhow maybe now I cleared up confusion on my last statement...

The post is still there.<br />
<br />
When you're MTing a mob, like the OP was talking about doing in VT, you have to have a rotation set up for the majority of possible max damage rounds. There is no time to call for heal and wait for it to land. If you're being hit for &gt; you max hps between CHes, you are dead. You work out what the likely max damage round will be, and how many you can take between CHes, and set up a rotation based upon that. If you dodge 90% of swings, it's irrelevent, because you'll still be being healed for 98% of potential damage taken.<br />

<br />
But fortitude comes under your 'missing you completely' and defensive comes under your 'hitting you just for less mitigated dmg', so it's a no-brainer that you use fortitude right? Of course not, because of other facts that don't come under your black/white agrument. with disc/fort the obvious one is time. With ID/LR the obvious one is that ID has to effect far more swings than LR does. Therefre, by the lore of averages, it makes 'max damage' rounds far less frequent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, please, could you do that?  Note, that back in January, when the thread with Sscaley's parse was active, Tug asked then if it could get stickied, so we don't have to answer the same question in six months.  Sure enough, 6 months later...:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your clerics are always setting up CH rot with worse possible scenario in mind, what difference does it make wether you mitigate or avoid?<br />
<br />
Further more, as you point out it is not black and white. For example, if I did not have max Stalwart Endurance and I am not an ogre, I would be inclined to go avoidance for whatever miniscule reduction in stuns I get.<br />
<br />
Also, you cannot ignore mobs that proc for several thousand damage. There are plenty of mobs that proc for much harder than they hit for, making avoidance, once again have a secondary utility over just helping you survive a typical combat round.<br />
<br />
Ignore damage procs and look at some annoying ones like FD procs and I am sure glad I grabbed LR5 first.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there comes a time where clerics simply can't heal for max damage on a non defensive tank. Quad 3k melee +AEs for example. When that happens, you can only attempt to reduce the number of times you get hit for above 8k between CHes. Other times (eg: VT/Ssra) the fights are so long, you have to balance damage with rotation frequency. You heal less often, knowing a back to back max round would kill your tank, but you can't heal fast enough for long enough to make an insta-rot viable. It's all about balance, and IMO a steady mitigation which reduces 'danger zone' spikes makes for a longer living MT a greater proportion of the time.<br />
<br />
I concede that I'm probably taking a onesided view on this due to having pretty much left procing mobs behind now, as well as the either/or debate being somewhat moot in my recent experience, since you have to have max defensive AAs to tank PoTime (just Inny and Qualm to go! whoot!). That said, I've always taken the 'steady' view with regards to tanking, being a mitigation based tank, and preferring conparable stable DPS based agro over unreliable procs wherever the choice is close. I know I'd take a shielding mod over an avoidance mod every time for example, and preferred Agnar sword over HG/BoC in offhand.<br />
<br />
The whole discussion is fairly hypothetical (yet interesting), since as soon as you finish one, you'll start on the next, so the period of one without the other will be fairly short for an active MT. I'd also put SE above all these defensive AAs, just like AET. The purported 70% reduction in stuns is huge for maintaining agro, and agro should  always be a MTs primary concern unless it's minimal such as incremental DPS gains from offensive AAs.</div></div><hr />

Thus not getting hit &gt; getting hit for minimum, even more if you are already nearing minimum hits by having the sheer raw amount of AC to just mitigate hits.<br />
The discussion is moot anyways because of the related nature of both AA's - if I remember correctly consensus on the LR/ID discussion was to get them both as fast as possible.<br />

Why you may ask? Go tank a mob that procs something (a bunch of high end encounters)<br />

Exping? the little damage from ID&gt;LR won't really matter, but it adds up, might be your argument.<br />

There are from what I have observed several different types of procs from mobs.<br />
<br />
Innate Spell -  FD / DD / AoE etc.<br />
<br />
Innate Ability - Rampage / Flurry<br />
<br />
Weapon - Weapon Wielded by mob.<br />
<br />
I do know that some are affected greatly by Haste/Slow, Cripple. And I do know that some can &quot;proc&quot; even on a miss. Exactly Which I am not sure.<br />
<br />
But, I think the &quot;Belief&quot; that LR will prevent procs without getting definitive response from a developer is misguided. <br />
<br />
I know I have proc'd on a miss, and on mobs that cannot be hit, or on mobs OOR, sure this is with a weapon, but An easy way to test is using a ranger/paladin with their self procs and see if they  do the same.<br />

As others have said, you will maxx out both anyways, so the discussion which is better only is academic.</div></div><hr />
