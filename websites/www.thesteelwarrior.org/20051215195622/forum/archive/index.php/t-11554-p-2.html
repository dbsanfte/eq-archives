When I see a level 60 pally charge solo into the middle of Xroads and take down 6 people  before he even starts to loose health, and that's just on his first life he's got 4 more to go mind you, then the DPS thing is horse shit.  I realize they don't have the DPS of a rogue, but a rogue doesn't have a mana pool, plate, or god mode.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer what the rogue has over what my warlock has with mana.<br />
<br />
and to have incombat mana regeneration (that matters, not that spirit crap) they use blessing of wisdom, which prevents any other blessing.<br />
<br />
Dont forget the free mount, and thems rolling on valor!~ <br />
<br />
nobody cares about the level 40 newbie mount when you get hunted down like the prey you are by epic mounts, and the epic mount quest definatly is NOT free and has many disadvantages over an item epic mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw, not that I disagree with him, this is funny as hell because just a few days back Haass was trying to tell us about class balance when I posted a rant  :p<br />
<br />
I think the thing with Paladins is that in open PvP with all the CC, they can have a difficult time dealing damage, even if they are specced that way.  It mostly because many classes can kite the hell out of them.  They can us blessing of freedom, but its only ten seconds with a 20 second cool down.  Blessing of freedom does not let them catch classes.  So in the little time they will be close to their opponent, they are sitting there praying SoC procs.  If it doesn't proc, then they are no better than a warrior using nothing but auto attack for burst damage.  A warrior can at least catch someone, and when he gets there he can pop out 2 attacks at once when he has the rage.  If a Paladin is equiped for damage potential, then his mana pool is tiny and not very effective.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like to see more paly's focus on healing.  They can make incredible party healers because they are so hard to kill.  Best PvP party I have been with was one where the paladin with us timed crucial heals.  We were demolishing foes because we did not have to worry about getting a little low on HPs.  Paladins are generally ignored because it takes so long to kill them, people just avoid them.  So if your paladin can dish damage if they can stay close, then help them out by leading your opponents to them.</div></div><hr />

It's ok that paladins can heal but its not ok that I have absolutely no way to counter those heals without burning bandages or potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">holy paladins are grossly overpowered. with chain gear (shaman set for example) they have a lot more int than with lightforge set while maintaining their survivabilty. in small group PVP paladins are invulernable priests. grossly overpowered<br />
luckily enough most paladins go retribution</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm you know all classes start to regen mana 5 seconds after casting their last spell, so a paladin doesn't have to spend anything to make back mana in combat. My 9th pallie meds back over the course of a fight and I don't even have seal of wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, most go retribution and totally ignore healing altogether.  A good Paladin can be a powerful core to a party if they heal.  Even retribution paladins can spec partial holy and be decent healers, but most ignore healing their party members.  If only more would heal.  They should be our frontline healers, with the priest being able to stay farther from harms way.<br />
<br />
As for overpowering, what about horde warriors that get the benefit of windfury.  Almost makes me regret going alliance.  Seems like it would even itself out to me in groups.  However, it doesn't because most Paladins refuse to heal.  Personally, if i had time to level up an alt, I would make a Prot/holy Paladin.  They are still awesome duelers, but would be main focus on healing in a group.  And with redoubt, reckoning, and Holy shield, attacking this build is like impaling yourself on a stake.  With every block, this build can return upwards of 150-200 damage with every block, god forbid you crit them, because that is a free attack and improved block rate.  Its sort of like why you do not see many priests, despite shadow priests being excellent pvp characters, its not cool to have to be a support class in groups.  Try suggesting that paladins focus more on party support and you get angry cries, despite that they can exponentially increase the power of a party by accepting that role.</div></div><hr />

Spirit regeneration fucking sucks ass, ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't when your pool is small and you don't spend mana often.<br />
<br />
It only sucks when you use mana a lot and have a huge pool like priests and mages.  Paladins take so long to beat down and do most of their damage with melee or a 30 second duration seal that they have plenty of time to regen their small pool.<br />
<br />
And for those who say they can kill paladins easily, let me restate what Haass said:<br />
<br />
The fact that 95% of the paladins in this game are absolutely utter horse shit players is the only thing saving this class from total invulnerability to anything and everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, I'm loving the commotion on the boards about a bug that allows Protection Paladins who have the Reckoning Talent (gets an extra attack from crits) to store up attacks and unleash all of them the first time they strike.  Insta-death without counters.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Paladins are actually defending it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass yes I know thanks. however congrats on taking my sarcastic post seriously!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's all fine and dandy, but totems have a radius.  Don't fight in that radius and you don't have to sweat windfury.<br />
<br />
I can't just move a paladin 30 feet and drop his DA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to mention windfury comes from--gasp--a second class. No warrior can windfury himself. A paladin only needs himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">05-07-2005, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">let us know when you see a soloing paladin win 2on1s against highly skilled 60s repeatedly and get to top10 =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-07-2005, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Point is, this is a warrior board, nobody gives a fuck if spirit mana regen is sucky (which it is not if you look at the numbers). So take your gripes about it elsewhere. Keke?</div></div><hr />

but warriors whining because paladins regenerate mana during combat...<br />
<br />
<br />
warriors whining for WHATEVER reason is retarded. Whats this, the warrior subforum of forums.wow.com?</div></div><hr />
