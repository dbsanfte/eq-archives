<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having some time to read over the posted changes, and give some thought to questions for the chat, how about we compile a definitive list here?<br />
<br />
Would be nice if everyone able to attend would be able to take in the same (fairly) comprehensive list so that the most important questions we as a community come up with have a good chance of being asked.<br />
<br />
Compiled from posts - topics chosen based on frequency of related questions, in no particular order of importance.  There has been some (minor) rewording and not all questions are included (covered by another or merged into a single question)<br />
<br />
If I missed any ... post again :D<br />
<br />
Warrior concerns (Agro!)<br />
<br />
 Since adequate (as judged by potential groupmates) survivability and aggro control are fundamental tanking characteristics, are Warriors to be tanks or are they being re-defined as Rogues (special attacks) that fight from the front?<br />
 The single biggest issue facing the warrior community has been agro generation as compared to knights.  That is, warriors have a very short range unreliable method of gaining agro compared to knights ability to generate and control agro at range and at will.  If all “openings” are random occurrences, how do these changes address this issue? <br />
 Will agro produced from the endurance stun ability produce more hate than the cast stun spells?<br />
 Are there plans for further changes to hate generation?  If so, do they include a means independent of the RNG and/or triggerable for warriors to generate hate<br />
<br />
<br />
Itemisation<br />
<br />
 Will there be &quot;Endurance Points&quot; retroactively added to existing items?<br />
 Will there be any conversion for mana to &quot;Endurance Points&quot; for existing items?<br />
 	If so, have you considered the effect this will have on those who have focussed on gear without mana?<br />
 Will there be focus effects on items to enhance Endurance usage as there is for mana? Eg “Flowing Endurance”<br />
 From where will items with “Endurance Points/Effects” be obtained?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regenerating the Endurance Pool<br />
<br />
 How can we regen endurance? <br />
 Which classes will get &quot;endurance regen&quot; spells?<br />
 Will melee get their own endurance regen abilities in the same way casters get their own mana regen spells?  How will this be implemented? (AA, skill such as Improved Bind Wounds etc)<br />
 Will some classes regen endurance faster or slower than other classes?<br />
 Will there be a way to turn endurance into health to lower downtime?<br />
 Will endurance regen be stat based? Eg higher STA = faster regen<br />
 Will sitting help? <br />
 Will there be a regen difference between standing still and running/fighting ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Disciplines<br />
<br />
 Will disciplines still have the same duration as they do currently?  Or will they end when the endurance pool is emptied? Or whichever comes first?<br />
 Are there any plans to add new disciplines, or implement current discipline upgrades?<br />
<br />
<br />
Availability/Ability Restrictions<br />
<br />
 How accessible will these new abilities be?  I.e. as with spells, will the majority of them (say, up to level 60) be available from trainers/merchants in the Plane of Knowledge?  Will more time/effort (read: high-level raids) be required to obtain the more rare abilities?<br />
 Will there be any race/deity/level restrictions on any of these abilities and, if, so, what will they be?<br />
 What particular skills will be special to the warrior/monk/rogue alone and how do you see them as promoting a warrior/monk/rogue to groups over another pure melee?<br />
<br />
<br />
Using Them<br />
<br />
 Are we using hotkeys, or an instant-spell type system? If they are hot-keys, will the hot-key window be expanded beyond 10 keys/page?<br />
 Do these &quot;opening&quot; messages appear in the chat window or some new XML window?<br />
<br />
<br />
Stats<br />
<br />
 Which stats will the endurance pool be based on?<br />
 Will these stats affect the endurance pool equally or will their influence vary; if it varies, how?<br />
 Will stats influence the costs of abilities at all?<br />
 Will pure melee's be able to upgrade the cap for the stat, which will define the endurance pool, via AA points to 355, like casters can for wis/int?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mechanics<br />
<br />
 How often are openings going to appear?<br />
 Will some openings not be random, and produced at (limited) will? E.g. on a successful Bash,<br />
 Will de-buffs like &quot;cripple&quot; or other special de-buffs be available which increase the rate of opportunities?<br />
 Will all the skills made available depend on &quot;openings&quot;? Or are those only certain skills, while others depend solely on Endurance, or solely on a timer, or both? (or maybe on anything else? like stats)<br />
 What part will character versus mob positioning play in terms of the frequency/type of openings that appear? E.g. In front versus behind versus ranged (archery)<br />
 What kind of skill trees are we looking at? Diablo 2 style?<br />
 Will training of one combat skill type prevent you from training another type?<br />
 Is some form of Book of Tactics being thought of, for keeping acquired abilities?  Or will the abilities be available directly through a List, like it was made available for casters recently?<br />
 Will the &quot;stun&quot; attack mentioned in the example be treated as a melee stun or a spell stun?<br />
 Will a &quot;snare&quot; type of attack leave an icon? How long will it last?<br />
 How long will the AC de-buff attack last? Stacking issues?<br />
 You said some openings will apply to all people in range, does that mean that skills of one class will have some kind of synergy with skills of another class e.g. allowing two or more people to link skills for greater or more effects ) OR does is simply mean it is a time where everyone around can use their skills all at once?<br />
 Following on from this, will there be potential for renkei style skillchains like found in FFXI? Ie., say the warrior does a special move which is immediately followed by the monk executing a related move which allows the rogue to execute his move for a large damage bonus.<br />
 Will the &quot;openings&quot; and small timeframe for reaction, be based on the client side, or the server side?<br />
 How are the &quot;Openings&quot; going to work during high lag situations?<br />
 What current Melee tools will be changed to make way for this change?<br />
 What will be the effective range for these special abilities? Will we be able to use them at max melee range, or will they have a shorter range, such as taunt and disarm?<br />
 Will any races get an innate bonus for endurance in much the same way that trolls and iksar have innate hp regen bonuses?<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
<br />
 When will this system be put in place? I'm not looking for a definite date, but are we talking a few weeks or a few months here?<br />
 How will you be testing the system prior to introducing it?<br />
 How will this affect Hybrids in a direct way? I.e. Will hybrids get the same endruance disciplines as pure melee? Or are their existing disciplines getting endurance pools only.<br />
 How do SoE expect these changes to affect the warriors’ groupability/ability to perform the main tank role?<br />
 Will mobs be able to do this too?<br />
 Will there be any new AA added to the game associated with these new combat enhancements? If so, what kind of AA?<br />
 Will certain Melee AAs or current skills be linked to Endurance?<br />
 Will the Warrior AA Warcry be modified in order to act as a sort of Group Paragon/spirit of wood that refreshes the Endurance Bar over time such as 36 or 48 seconds? <br />
 Will existing skills such as Disarm, taunt, kick, backstab, flying kick(+other monk moves), Instill doubt, etc, move to this new system, and as such require endurance? Or will they remain on their current timers?<br />
 Will the current content of the game be tweaked a bit, to be more compatible with the new powers available? (cf Velious for casters) Or is the plan to keep the change small enough to fit into the current content?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will defensive last 3 minutes or until my endurance pool is empty? Or whichever comes first?<br />
<br />
How can we regen endurance? Flowing endurance items available or not needed?<br />
<br />
Will the aforementioned &quot;stun&quot; attack be treated as a melee stun or a spell stun?<br />
<br />
Will a &quot;snare&quot; type of attack leave an icon? How long will it last?<br />
<br />
How long will the AC debuff attack last? Stacking issues?<br />
<br />
What kind of skill trees are we looking at? Diablo 2 style?<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd like some details on the aggro generation portion of this, is aggro limited to another random skill based event with a chance at failure, or is there a plan for another aggro tweak that hasn't yet been unveiled?<br />
<br />
If these are hotkey based, will there be an expansion of the hotkey window for more than the current number of hotkeys?<br />
<br />
Will there be a way to turn endurance into health to lower downtime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valorie</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some more thoughts:<br />
<br />
1): Will hybrids get the same endruance disciplines as pure melee? or are their existing disciplines getting endurance pools only.<br />
<br />
2): Will the new endurance agro effect result in more agro than cast stun spells?<br />
<br />
3): Will the way agro is handled by the AI be changed as a result of this? <br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Which classes will get &quot;endurance regen&quot; spells?&quot;<br />
<br />
-In addendum to that question ... since casters cast their OWN mana regen &quot;spells&quot; ... shouldn't MELEES have their OWN endurance regen options available to them? <br />
<br />
-How will the changes in melee disciplines affect the popular discs, like stonestance and defensive? Will it enhance their use any or restrict it?<br />
<br />
-Will there be &quot;focus effect&quot; type of effects offered to enhance the use of these feats and the endurance bar, just as there are focus effects offered to enhance spell casters?<br />
<br />
-Since a large portion of the game's SPELLS up to level 60 are currently available in the plane of knowledge library, will there be an equitable treatment of these &quot;tomes&quot; to get new &quot;skills&quot; ? In other words, will the more common, and under level 61 skills also be available for easy purchase just like spells are?<br />
<br />
Those are some of my initial questions, just reading that jibba jabba from the dev corner.</div></div><hr />

will all stats have same effect on pool ?<br />
will we see something like STA giving the EP size and str or dex influence the endurance cost of the special moves ? (after all, someone with high str will more easily stun target, and a dificult move is a bit easier with high dex .. )<br />
Endurance regen : stat based (more STA = more regen)?will sitting help ? will there be a regen difference between standing still and running/fighting ?</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify the depth of the system, will different openings/opportunities also appear based on position? <br />
<br />
Incoming mob/pulling - openings for aggro-generating skills?<br />
<br />
Tanking mob - as given in the example, apparently openings given for successful parries and presumably other 'events' (dodges, ripostes, critical hits?, disarm:D , etc.)<br />
<br />
DPS from behind mob - since we're not likely to be riposting, dodging, etc., will the game 'know' from where we're attacking and present us with different openings and opportunities for different situational attacks?<br />
<br />
Ranged attacks - for those mobs where we stand back and plink away with arrows, will we see a different set of opportunities?</div></div><hr />

These &quot;openings&quot; seem to be random in nature, and as such the aggro strike seems to only be yet another dependence on the RNG to generate aggro? This deficiency is a fundamental part of the reason why hybrids are chosen over warriors in EXP groups.</div></div><hr />

Will there be any spell buffs given to any classes to increase regen rate for endurance? If so, which classes and what kind of spells?&quot;<br />
<br />
To build on this question, I think we need to keep this in perspective. It's very important that sony realize this point.<br />
<br />
ENDURACNE and FEATS are NOT MAGIC.<br />
<br />
And thus, SPELLCASTERS should have NOTHING TO DO WITH REFRESHING ENDURANCE.<br />
<br />
An enchanter can cast KEI and get &quot;brain power&quot; back.<br />
<br />
A shaman and a necromancer can convert their own hit points back into mana.<br />
<br />
These options should be AVAILABLE to the melee classes.<br />
<br />
Recovering and buffing endurance should be ONLY AVAILABLE to melee classes.<br />
<br />
I should NOT have to go to an enchanter to get my endurance pool refreshed.<br />
<br />
I should have to go to a WARRIOR or a MONK.<br />
<br />
Because enchanters should not know ANYTHING about physical feats and the energy pool that vitalizes them.<br />
<br />
But a monk or a warrior, who specialize in melee, should know a thing or two about revitalizing physical energy pools.<br />
<br />
Don't FUNK THIS UP SOE.<br />
<br />
Leave MIND buffs to the sissy robe wearers.<br />
<br />
Leave BODY buffs to the rough, rugged MELEE people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would all be well and good except that enchanters and priests get Invigorate and Shamans get Acumen as well, which is returning stamina based power, so it's not a big stretch to infer that this will likely hold true for Endurance power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Will the current content of the game be tweaked a bit, to be more compatible with the new powers available? (like in velious for casters)<br />

<br />
3) Will there be more rare skills be available through more work? Or will all the Tomes of Knowledge be easily accessable?<br />
<br />
4) Will some openings not be random, and produced at limited will? Like a successfull Bash,<br />
Or perhaps being the first person to damage a mob, could give: Warriors the opening for a &quot;Cruel Welcome&quot; skill inducing Hate,<br />
Rogues the opening for a &quot;Poisoned Welcome&quot; skill inducing a DoT,<br />
Monks the opening for a &quot;Painfull Welcome&quot; skill inducing  high damage/knockback <br />
<br />
<br />
5) Will the &quot;openings&quot; and small timeframe for reaction, be based on the client side, or the server side?<br />
Having it server side will easily cause troubles with Lag.<br />
While client side may leave freedom for hacks.<br />
<br />
6) Is some form of Book of Tactics being thought of, for keeping acquired abilities?<br />
Or will the abilities be available directly through a List, like it was made available for casters recently?<br />
<br />
7) Please oh god, don't make Mana turn into Endurance....<br />
the last thing I want to happen, is for people who opted for Melee oriented items, to get the short end of the stick... <br />
:p<br />
<br />
8) How big a role, do you wish disciplines to play in this new system?<br />
I was surprised to see Planes of Power completely void of new disciplines.. <br />
<br />
Any plans to add new disciplines, have current disciplines upgrade depending on levels.<br />
At level 65, our most usefull, and almost only used discipline, is one we get at level 56.<br />
<br />
9) How will this affect Hybrids in a direct way?<br />
<br />
10) What current Melee tools will be changed to make way for this change?<br />
<br />
Will certain Melee AAs or current skills be linked to Endurance?<br />
Like Rampage, Area Taunt, Feign Death, Backstab etc...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can we do as well as we do now, without these skills, or will this be a limiting factor on mellee?<br />
<br />
One thing that worries me is the timing issue.  In a big fight, you may get 10 or 20 lines pop on your screen at once due to lag. In an ideal world, it sounds promising, but in the reality of gameplay, timing is quite variable due to lag/communication delays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They could implement the system solely on the client side, and have the move itself be executed only when the connection is met.<br />
So while lag delaying the time between executing the skill and having the skill actually happen, <br />
it won't affect the length of your opening.<br />
(Though client side is dangerous for hacks)<br />
<br />
It's also pretty easy to just code it in such a way that the timer isn't cut short by the lag...<br />
<br />
There's two different problems that can be caused by lag:<br />
<br />
1)You don't see the &quot;Opening&quot; message, before the timer is over. Not being able to execute any moves.<br />
<br />
- There are ways to have the timer start only once the &quot;opening&quot; message is well recieved.<br />
<br />
2)Using a skill while the opening is available, but due to lag, the information of the skill being used, isnt recieved by the server before the timer is up.<br />
<br />
- I guess this could be worked on by using the client's clock as reference,<br />
or having the &quot;opening's&quot; timer client based.<br />
But giving possible ways to hacking...<br />
but then...<br />

I have yet to be able to see the target rings due to my graphics card not being supported, and last time I checked on EQs own bards tehre were 147 other people posting trouble on the same issue, they all had graphic cards FAR better then mine.</div></div><hr />

Of course SOE will be more open to questions regarding the system, then new ideas... but it can't hurt, and I'm sure the excellent ideas will be taken into consideration by some devs present there...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be bad for game balance to make melees even MORE dependant on casters.<br />
<br />
It would be bad for the economy and for game balance to give casters, who already corner the market on mind buffs, the entire market on endurance buffs.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense at all from any logical standpoint to give spellcasters, who deal in magic, ANY sway or power whatsoever over ENDURANCE ... which is ... not ... MAGIC. It's physical prowess.<br />
<br />
A dress wearer or a priest should have no conceivable way whatsoever to deal with physical feats. It's not their realm.<br />
<br />
Just like we melees have no way to deal with magic.<br />
<br />
We don't enhance mana regen.<br />
<br />
There's no logical explanation or justification to give a shaman or an enchanter a way to improve ENDURANCE.<br />
<br />
This isn't the stamina bar.<br />
<br />
This isn't zing or acumen.<br />
<br />
This is a whole new bar, supposedly, according to SoE.<br />
<br />
And magic users should have nothing to do with it.<br />

Or it will make the BALANCE issue even WORSE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Number of hotkeys? As a warrior I use at least 8 hotkeys allready.(Info for Nonwarriors:attack, taunt, kick, righclicky for those dispeller mobs, ranged attack for pulls/tags, Area taunt,Dis evasive, and 1 hotkey with &quot;assist me on %t&quot;)<br />
<br />
Warrior clickfest? A mage has to hit 3 buttons during 1 fight, I as warrior probably 20+, and now they want to give us more to click/hotkey? (If I wanted a clickfest I would be playing WC3)<br />
<br />
Time frame? Rangers waited 2 years in which no group took them before they got fixed. I fear the worst here!<br />
<br />
Will these changes make our AAs worthwhile in any way? Will still all classes get &quot;the best&quot; warrior AAs like ND LR  etc?<br />
<br />
If they implement a whole new melee system, why won't Pallies/SK come out ahead again?<br />
<br />
Playing EQ since 1999 I am quite pessimistic on all the above topics.  IMO as in the past Verant won't fix the old imbalances, but will go and create new ones.<br />

You have 100.  Surely you can fit the new melee things in somewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I dunno what game you're playing, but I rarely have to hit even half that many, and that's including all the &quot;extra&quot; stuff.  That's not to say it's not possible...I just have no idea how.  Most likely, this will be a non-issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time frame? Rangers waited 2 years in which no group took them before they got fixed. I fear the worst here!<br />
<br />
I ~believe~ I read mid december somewhere, but it's entirely possible that I'm wrong, seeing as I'm really tired right now.  Anyway, that can be hashed out in the chat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will these changes make our AAs worthwhile in any way? Will still all classes get &quot;the best&quot; warrior AAs like ND LR etc?<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with AA...the only way to fix something like that would be to take those AAs away from the classes that have them (other than us).<br />
<br />
<br />
If they implement a whole new melee system, why won't Pallies/SK come out ahead again?<br />
<br />
Impossible to say for sure (and this is the most important question you posed), but these &quot;openings&quot; are for pure melee only.  No SKs, no Paladins, no rangers, no beastlords...just us, monks, and rogues.  If there's something built in to help out the taunt situation, so much the better for us.  If there's not, the stand down's just been postponed till the 2nd, not cancelled.  =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  None of that was meant in any offense, if it came off that way.  Just trying to answer some of these questions beforehand so we can ask only what we really need to ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you switch between hotkey panels during the same fight? I hope I don't need to, unless on raids.<br />
About the 20+/keyboard strokes i need (in some fights)<br />
Mobs are incoming, autoattack (1), mobs leave me and go for the healer, my taunt(2) hits only empty space, so i turn(3) and move(4). Area taunt(5) needed as they bash the healer before CC can do anything. Slow lands on my mob, and the mob aggros slower. I turn(6) and move(8). Taunt(9) not working and the slower moves away from the damage, so I turn(10) and move(11) again. CC used an AE mezz and luckily all mobs stand. I stop autoattack (12), taunt(13), and hit autoattack(14) once more. This taunt worked, so mob stays on me. I turn(15) and move(16) to enable the mage pet to backstab  but the mob is slightly pushed by mages pet, so I turn(17) and move (18). At low health the mob runs and I turn(19) and move(20) after it, rounding a corner , turn (21) and move (22) and kill it. I bet if i would really count every keystroke during this  fight i would end up at a much higher number.<br />
<br />
Assumed mage has 2 hotkeys:<br />
1.  /assist MT<br />
     /pause 10<br />
     /pet attack<br />
     /con<br />
2.  /stand<br />
     /pause 10<br />
     /cast 1<br />
     /pause XY<br />
     /sit<br />
The mage could do all her work with 3 keystrokes: Send pet in and nuke 2 times.<br />
I am not an ubar equipped super warrior like many here seem to be, but I have played warrior since 1999, and I get comments that I play my warrior well sometimes in pickup groups (not to brag, just to show I am not doing everything wrong)<br />
Will they fix F8?<br />
Will they stop mobs from summoning people that are already in melee range?<br />
(You can get stuck badly when that happens)<br />

<br />
Endurance regen already been discussed so no need to mention.<br />
<br />
What, if anything, can we expect in terms of INSTANT agro generation at the beginning of the fight (not based on openings)? This really has been the major gripe of warriors recently, so I believe true balance cannot be achieved without providing something in this area.<br />
<br />
What can we expect in terms of stackability of these skills if they have duration?</div></div><hr />

The regenerated Endurance becomes the standard... and you then become handicapped if you dont have the right class with you.<br />
We already depends horribly for our hp, let the endurance stay independent ... please...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This isn't a question to ask, but rather a recommendation on how to approach the chat session and the new system in general.<br />
<br />
Don't go into this using the mentality that Sony has to deal directly with the current issues as they exist today (ex:  taunt.)  They may not give us snap agro, but that doesn't mean they won't fix the current balance issue.  I agree, snap agro is huge the way the game currently works - but that doesn't mean the only way to balance the classes is to give warriors snap agro.  Changing how the game works is also another viable alternative.<br />
<br />
Also, I think we need to be open to the possibility the function our class serves may change slightly.  Maybe knights will remain the best choice for initial agro, but maybe warriors will be able to give the group a big advantage by taking over tanking once the mob is engaged - therefore making both classes desirable.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is how the system will work - at this point I don't know.  But I am saying we should be open to possibilities and focus on class balance - not necessarily changing how specific existing features work.<br />
<br />
Rather than taking the easy solution of tweaking the existing framework, Sony has decided to upgrade the entire combat system - taking some ideas from the newer games, and adding some twists of their own.  In my opinion this is very ambitious and far thinking approach by Sony, and bodes well for the future of EQ.  I say this because this approach is not the cheap way out and shows they see a future for this game.  In return, we need to have some flexibility and patience in our thinking.</div></div><hr />

You don't even need to hit ALT-#...just bind the suckers to your numberpad on your keyboard like a huge number of casters do, or bind it elsewhere to whatever you want.  No need to use hotkey slots at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro and survivability are and are very likely to continue to be what defines a MT. I in fact object strenuously to Warriors being redefined into not a MT while Paladins have been defined into being one.<br />
<br />
Is their room for all three traditional tank classes to MT? Yes, if all three have adequate survivability AND aggro control. Two of these classes have these attributes. The third (in fact the archetype Tank) has been hung out to dry somewhat.<br />
<br />
Because this is intended to be questions for the chat -<br />
<br />
Since adequate (as judged by potential groupmates) survivability and aggro control are fundamental tanking characteristics, are Warriors to be tanks or are they being re-defined as Rogues (special attacks) that fight from the front?<br />
<br />

<br />
There are a few potential abilities that seem interesting warrior-wise, like Barrier, Rallying Cry etc... <br />
Funny how everyone seems to translate &quot;special attacks&quot; into dps...</div></div><hr />
