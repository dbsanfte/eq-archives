Only a few remains in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is finding them for sale.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One sold for about 30k the other day on my server, only one Ive seen since the revamp. Glad I picked mine up for about 2k a few months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/cry i want one, No one on my server seems to want to give theres up ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">back when i did yael for the ore for myself and others earthshakers dropped damn near every time, some times twice. usually they rotted unless some one (myself) actually wanted one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">stole mine yesterday for 15k..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought mine a long time back for 1k. It looked like the person was trying to scam people due to the fact the earthshaker is flagged GIANT and would fall to the ground if you did not have a giant slot. When he clicked trade, he walked backwards...paused...said...BAH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still cant believe my luck. After 100 AA I started thinking it was time for some fun ones so started checking bazaar everytime I had a chance. Didnt see one for weeks and then one day come home from work and do a search with my trader and resulsts come back as one for sale, for 250 plat :)  Well it only took me a few seconds to drop trader mode, run there and buy it from someone who prolly had it sitting around for years and looked at stats and said damn this cant be worth much!<br />
<br />
  And I just trained Rampage other day, still havent had a chance to try it but maybe today is a good day to go play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CasEci</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember trading a Throneblade of the Ykesha for a Earthshaker, back ohhhhhhhh around level 50 or so. Someone is prolly gnashing their teeth as I type. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw 2 for sale, at 350pp, about 6 months ago. I bought one for myself (/whew!) and told some warriors in my guild about the other one.<br />
<br />
None of them took me up on it.<br />
<br />
Ah, well, nice to finally have something that isn't in the game anymore. I'll keep it right next to my Band of the Arisen Cultist (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=21847).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought mine the day after the post went up about the rampage thing for 500pp....apparently the person wasnt aware of the value lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I'm not even a warrior and I snatched one of these up...purely because I'd heard about the combination of this and Rampage for fun, but the PoFire post hadn't popped up yet.<br />
<br />
Found one in the bazaar once for about 1250pp...I had excess money at the time and was feeling impulsive.  Rather glad I snatched one up before they stopped dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Payed 450 plat yesterday after a few weeks of looking!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monglok</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just out of pure curiosity, when was it &quot;nerfed&quot;? Would it be available on the Sullon Zek server? If so, tis my new search to find! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was never nerfed.The Hole was revamped and the dropper (Master Yael) was removed because the loot was insignificant at this point and people didnt like having to deal with a DT mob for old world items and quests in the whole(Master Yael DTed quite quickly)<br />
The weapon wasnt nerfed,continues to work like it has for 4 years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalrek</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seen a couple go for as much as 50k on Mith Marr lately</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't sell mine for 100k. It's fun, and warriors don't get much of that.</div></div><hr />
