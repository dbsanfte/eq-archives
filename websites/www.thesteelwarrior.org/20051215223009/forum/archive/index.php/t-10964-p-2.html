<br />
Well, do the same thing while trying to stay alive....it slows the whole process down quite a bit, and gives you significantly more things to do.</div></div><hr />

Being hunted, camped, griefed, and harrassed is not exactly the way I wish to decrease the speed at which I consume content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm all for it when the fight is remotely fair level wise.  Its the 40+ pickin on the 20+ like it takes skill or something that gets me hot under the collar.  If you asked Steely Dan, even they would say 'Goddamn thats gay!'<br />
<br />
Seems like they could put some anti-gank code in that wouldn't let you attack a grey player until the moment they engage in combat with the higher level.  Or cause the high level to gain dishonor if they initiate the attack.  If the lowbie jumps into a high level fight, its fair game.  But the other way around is rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, don't get me wrong, I fully fucking agree with you guys.<br />
<br />
However, I also know that griefers, on the whole, have zero fucking skill.  And I truly do mean zero.  The only way that they're able to kill you is if you're half their level.<br />
<br />
I just hit 44.  I saw the difference immediately in my 30's....the minute I wasn't half anyone's level anymore.  They're starting to go down...and often.  I downed a 49 pally this weekend, solo, and he had both DA's and LoH up.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;Kill on Sight&quot; lists we're making are gonna be a lot of fun in about 10 more levels.  And since you can basically go from 1-60 in purely instanced zones, I'm not seeing a problem with leveling up to deal with these imbeciles on their own turf.  It gives me a profound sense of joy to be sitting in Brill or something and see a level 31 warlock harassing the level 10's, then kill him several times over.<br />
<br />
I pass over grey cons for PvP, but I kill anyone whom I see not obeying that rule.  And that makes me happy :)  It's enforcing a code of justice on the gimps.</div></div><hr />

BTW, making a priest on Boulderfist atm.  She's a bad ass level 18.  I, like, never  see any of you fuckers online.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and Varaho is out to sea.</div></div><hr />

We got collector's edition accounts so we could have pandas with our undead.  So I deleted Sadi on my old account and am remaking her.  I logged her on purely to dump her, like, 1 gold worth of crap on my alt.  The alt is Diva, level 18 priest.  Chal is Maker, 18 rogue.  We are randomly doing shit in the barrens atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">09-28-2005, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think everyone's felt the burnout with each character once they hit lvl 60.  Theres just only so much to do really, it get boring fast.  I started out on a PvP server and when my guild of RL friends disbanded I quit the game.  Was alliance with a warrior from the start when the class sucked, stuck through with it though.  I managed to lvl a priest up to 56, was exciting at first to twink but sucked later on.  I took a break from WoW, I think that helped a lot.<br />
<br />
Few months later I join up again, this time on the Horde side (and normal server).  I highly recommend you try both sides to see what its like.  Tried a rogue this time, got to 55 and found out Im doing the same boring stuff.  I dunno, just something about the end game that turns all the fun of the game into poo.  When it stops being fun to play again, take a break from it or quit for a while.  <br />
<br />
WoW was a pretty awsome game, but not the best imo.  If something good came out a few months ago I wouldnt have bothered with starting up again on the Horde side.  I think its the combination of nothing better out there and the ability to experience all the Horde areas and classes that brought me back.  <br />
<br />
I already canceled my account yet again, just the same old path once you get up there.  I guess I was hoping the horde side was different, but its the same exact game that I dreaded.  The main thing I think was having a nice guild you like to play with.  I told myself no more EQ type raiding so that elimates MC and higher instances.  Other than that there just isn't much to do in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-06-2005, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's tons to do!<br />
<br />
I was strictly anti-PVP servers to start.  I viewed them as hatemongering, griefing cesspools.  <br />
<br />
I think I was right.<br />
<br />
But the thing is, if you play on a PVP server, you really do start feeling a sense of community.  I can't tell you how often people came to my rescue while I was leveling up my horde in Hillsbrad.  You also start growing a sense of hatred and, probably, start thinking &quot;when I'm high level, I'm going to camp in fucking TM and kill those ganking sonsofbitches.&quot;  Or maybe that's just me.  I'm guessing it didn't have that effect on you, Lor, since you did do PVP and still want to quit now. <br />
<br />
In any event, I'm having a blast on a PVP server.  Even though in my experience the only alliance who PVP are about 20 levels higher than I am.    PVP is significantly more fun to me than raiding MC/BWL for the 382010438484th time.  I wanted to kill myself on an almost hourly basis playing my druid and raiding.   Now I want to kill other people on an almost minutely basis playing my priest and pvping =) <br />
<br />
If you get bored, go Boulderfist horde.  It's good to be the bad guy. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">10-06-2005, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spirestones world PvP has been pretty dead for the most part since the BG's came out but I still get to whack some alliance here and there with my Earthshaker out in WPL farming AD faction.  Its fun as hell! After experiencing that, carebare WoW servers are just too damn dull for me.</div></div><hr />
