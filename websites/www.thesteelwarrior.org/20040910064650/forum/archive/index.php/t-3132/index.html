<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, just wondering, what does everybody do while playing? Be honest when voting, you don't have to say who you are. And noone here will bash you anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i play counterstrike while i aint mt :)<br />
if there's anough warrior to tank mez i'll auto follow if raid if not important :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on the raid.  Though it is a habit of mine to eat often during raids (have mini fridge right behind me to make this easier).  TV is right next to my comp, so it is on often also.

How do you pull that off? My CS runs slow when I run Everquest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">with all the new content in LDoN that I can't see; I just browse EQ Traders while mastering tradeskills or watching guildchat while they're in elementals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I eat, alt-tab and look up stuff, read msg boards, chat alot, listen to mp3 player, and on raids im the guy who's not the RL or ARL, but assigned to call people on their mistakes, and explain tactics and list loot etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i play CS from the comp next to the one i run eq with, forgot to mention that. i keep an eye on EQ in betwwen rounds or when i die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dall18or</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do a combination of things....<br />
<br />
I scratch my self in various places while waiting for something to do, and I somtimes play with my nipples.<br />
<br />
I slide down in my chair and put my legs onto a nearby chair, so my head barely in lvl with the keyboard, and I lazily type tells to friends. <br />
<br />
I take afk breaks to do push ups. Also whenever I do a 10 minute zone i usually go and do crunches and push ups. <br />
<br />
I stick a piece of plastic in my mouth and crew it till my its unrecognizible. <br />
<br />
Sometimes i lead raids and actually keep my eyes on the computer screen.<br />
<br />
Oh I have slept at the keyboard. Darn Plane of Sky raids back in the day. Cr = waking up at 6 am to a string of bodies at my bind in kael, and a full chat box of people swearing at me. <br />
<br />
See I have it pretty good, huh? <br />
<br />
Although lately I haven't been playing EQ, been lifting weights and practicing my soccer moves. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I usually sit here playing guitar when not doing some form of tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Danca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I stick a piece of plastic in my mouth and crew it till my its unrecognizible. I do this at all times, unless I need to talk to someone or am around enlisted guys (it looks bad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">During raids: I'm always, always paying attention to what's going on on my screen.  I hate people who don't pay attention on raids, so I make it a point to be wide awake and ready.  (Plus, I often make the loot calls, being the guildleader and all. :b)<br />
<br />
Grouping with others: Always paying attention.  I view people who don't pay attention while exping as not pulling their weight.  <br />
<br />
Botting by myself: (ahh.. my normal means of exp on my warrior =/ )  I'm constantly swaping between the screens to see what's going on.  Does the cleric have decent mana for the pull?  Anything I need to root park off? etc.<br />
<br />
Soloing (any char BUT the warrior):  I'll kill until I need to med.  Then I find some safe spot to afk at til mana is ready again.  While I medding, I'll read boards/post, chat on the phone, what have you.  This seems very sloppy playing to me, heh.  But since I'm alone during that time, no one else suffers for my inattention.  ;)<br />
<br />
Ah yes, I have a dorm size fridge near my computers, too.  So chances are, I'm eating if I'm hungry at the comp, too. =p</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">damn  channels ?? hehe<br />
all i got is guild chat, guild channel, guild warrior channel and tells, when not in raid i add TSW but too much spam for raid situation :/ oh and + tells :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Guild chat, friend channel, TSW, EQTraders, guild alliance channel, and every now and then the pally channel.<br />

  <br />
<br />
Heh. I used to chew on bits of metal or plastic, about anything I had lying around.<br />
<br />
Getting a tongue peircing actually cured me of that. (not that I reccommend this)<br />
<br />
I usually pay attention to everything that's going on and chat on top of that. Sometimes I attempt to paint my Warhammer/Warhammer40k minis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">usually i'm paying full attention during battles and moving and stuff like that, but when there is downtime, i usually glance over at the 2nd pc and watch tv. I take smoke breaks on downtime too, but 99% of the time i'm watching the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I chat up a storm, but when the time comes to go to town, I'm totally focused.  Since I don't get to MT often, I can get in and start beatin on the mob and chat in the other window :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've learned a painful lesson more than once... that when you start to chat when not MTing but still beating on a mob, it will always somehow memblur(for certain mobs) and turn on you, get pushed in a direction that  puts you in AE rampage or enrage and turn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gudrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i surf the web on my 3rd comp or im two boxing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's not hard to spot the &quot;afk playing counterstrike&quot; people on raids.  They are the ones standing in the middle of the room with their arms at their sides after the mob is dead and everyone is back in camp, or worse yet standing in the corner staring at the wall.  I can't say I always pay attention, but that's what I try to do.  I have the TV on behind me, but don't pay any attention to it.  Have been known to websurf during downtime on raids, but not while there are mobs in camp.  This all goes out the window if I haven't had enough sleep though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Play guitar, listen to music, watch some tv, chat with people... and of course, play EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I drink beer or 7&amp;7 while listening to MP3's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rotep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">pay attention. i don't have an enraging weap, so the mob could ping pong on me and eat members of my party like clerics and chanters.</div></div><hr />

I play warcraft 3 while running EQ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must not be married...  Throw a wife into the mix and you'll be so confused with whats going on, you'll end up trying to tank emp with one of your groupmembers targeted. =P  <br />
<br />
You gotta love the demanding of your attention at all times when they have something to say to you about their day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Generally am raid leader/group leader so I keep my attention on the group. That and I dont have any eb weapons so I have to keep a close eye on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">hahaha terrorus so true ~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Needs a girl in charge option! ;p<br />
<br />
I'm most commonly found leading raids, chatting to friends, talking in alliance/warrior/chchain/officer chats, boxing a cleric, listening to mp3s, reading message boards/looking up strats. Oh and did I mention I'm usually MA?<br />
