Might be a little - I guess we can all agree that it would be much harder for warriors to solo than wizards - for exp anyway. If you don't agree with that - then you really dont know much about EQ.<br />
<br />
The point was that Verant is making a bunch of changes and putting warrior issues on the back burner AGAIN.<br />
<br />
When the issues mentioned in the SOE press release and that are being addressed this or the next patch - they also acknowledged then that there were warrior issues unresolved and also mentioned they were looking for a way impliment a useful mechanism for making a shield more desireable for warriors and other duel wielding shield classes.<br />
<br />
I havent seen crap about that. What I do see is my lvl 65 warrior - complete with bloodfrenzy and VT gear - sitting around LFG while groups take HOT (not even NTOV) geared Pally's and SK's. Granted that's an exageration, but it HAS happened and its a profound class disparity that is recognized by warriors, other classes, and SOE - yet its more important to SOE to address ALL the other issues FIRST.</div></div><hr />

I see no justification for any of the caster classes to NEED more mana.  By giving them more mana potential, they give every single mana using class a significant upgrade, and spit in the pure melee's eye yet again.  Hey, how about a freaking across the board increase in Warrior HP by 50%?  Huh?  BAH!  Bastages!</div></div><hr />

We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons<br />
<br />

<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons<br />
<br />
Thing is, i dont want disciplines to increase damage, i want something done to the class to make regular everyday hits do more damage. Casters can do insane amounts of damage with spells. All they gotta do is cast, disciplines are not the equivalent of spells. <br />
<br />
Damage increasing disciplines currently last short durations with long refresh time. In tanking/raiding situations its not real prudent to fire off an Agressive or Fellstrike or whatever if you want to use because that is gonna be 20-60ish minutes before you can defensive or evasive, which if youre on a raid pretty much makes you useless to tank mobs. Im sure a naysayer may reply &quot;you can use the new discs in groups&quot;, i dont want a situational upgrade. If they are going to implement a damage increase to help balance out the caster damage, it needs to have universal utility.<br />
<br />
My guild currently uses rotating tanks for raid level mobs (such as the fire minis) depending on whose disc is up and available. I cant even dream of using an offensive disc unless i know we're having a 20 or so minute downtime after the mob, or unless its the last mob for the night. <br />
<br />
They can pile on all the disciplines they want, but unless they refresh in under 10 minues like the defensive discs, they will sit on the shelf quietly beside Mightystrike.</div></div><hr />

Eight months since PoP came out and the only significant change they've made to melee weapons was to nerf the drop rate of Windblade.  Somehow I don't see them suddenly making weapons suddenly more readily available given the hue and cry about Windblade, do you?<br />
  <br />
Improving damage increasing disciplines will help Warriors exactly how?  We're already locked into not using disciplines 90% of the time because we never know when defensive/evasive might be needed and they are the ONLY emergency situation abilities we have!  No FD, no LoH, no life taps, no heals, just freaking defensive/evasive!  Like what Warrior is going to throw away their only emergency reaction ability on a regular basis?  Answer is, almost NONE.<br />
<br />
They obviously have no real understanding of the Warrior class if those are the only options they're considering, which doesn't surprise me all that much.</div></div><hr />

so everyone undea 52 is still screwd, and people not using PoP wepoans get fucked well, i have both these things but im not leaving my fellow warriors in the cold. like people have said lets get some more HP or Dmg across the board, a skill i can use 10 seconds every hour is piss poor to look forward to</div></div><hr />

This does nothing to alleviate the fundamental class imbalance issue. If I'm a 5, and the pally over there is a 10, then adding 5 to us both doesn't do a damn thing to address class imbalance. It just perpetuates the problem while allowing SOE to say, 'we upped your damage, geez what more do you warriors want??'.<br />

The problem many of us average geared warriors is that when we compete against our rogue/ranger/monk buddy, it is hard to retain aggro for a long period. Yes you hit taunt, and you are #1 on the list for a split second until that backstab lands again.<br />
<br />
I understand that you must work for gear, but I donnot want to leave my guild so I can get uber_weapon_01. Instead I would like to be able to maintain aggro over the long haul. I have decent weapons for the level I am and the guild I am in, though aggro is a steady issue when fights extend passed a few minutes.<br />
<br />
I try to better myself with aa and gear upgrades, but I feel horrible that at times I need a raid-quality weapon to hold aggro in an XP group. The 'balance' is not there.<br />

At the same lvl, with the same gear a warrior will out agro those classes.<br />

<br />
We cant ask for sick fucked up tools like pal/sk/ranger. (stun/drain/snare).<br />
That will out agro anyone under any condition.<br />
<br />
But we can ask for some nice tools.<br />
Improved taunt rate is the only one i can think of that wont unbalance the game.<br />
<br />
And will give War0129 a way to have almost reliable instant agro.<br />

Hell add a +50agro on taunt key. That will surely fix the issuse for good.</div></div><hr />

Asking for a warrior insane agro capacity is retarded.<br />
Not only will it be refused but it will make us look bad on future claims.<br />
That i do not want.<br />

Increase the taunt rate. Add a +50 to +75 agro per taunt.<br />
And the problem is solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/runs and hides from angry hybrids<br />
<br />
I've learned to just accept that warriors will never get fixed, and I'm going to have to make do with what I have.  I really hate it for the mid 50's warriors who don't have PL buddies.  I remember at 52 or 53 I had real crap for gear, and it was tough.  I felt the squeeze in xp groups.  I did crappy damage, was a crappy tank, and held agro for poop.  I wish there was a way to help out our lower level brother and sisters without making it some sort of way too easy thing which could be farmed and sold to richer warrior twinks.<br />
<br />
That is the problem with being the class most dependent on your gear.  Fixing taunt would we awsome, but I don't think SoE will have the motivation to do a major rewrite of taunt.  They have too many other sources for future income.<br />
<br />
As for improvements, someone mentioned a long while back giving warriors a slider for offensive versus defensive.  If you move more offesive, it would be more like aggressive disc, if you moved more defensive, it would be more like defensive.  Take those two discs out, and let us choose how we want to perform that way.  Interesting idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">New disciplines would be nice, but they won't be used unless Defensive and Evasive are moved to a separate timer.  New weapons would be nice, but honestly how many weapons can you use?<br />
<br />
There is a serious problem for warriors in general and definitely for those under 65.  It isn't just us, rogues and monks are feeling the pinch as well.  Rogues at least can get SoS at 63, which is a huge increase in utility for them.  More and more though, we fall behind the mana classes.  AE Rampage anyone?<br />
<br />
I really hope SOE is honestly looking into doing something for pure melees.  Something that hybrids won't get and something that will actually help us out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a more radical change, give us a fighting-style slider. Move it one way and we're offensive, move it the other and we're defensive. Implemented intelligently and with a timer between being able to change your fighting stance and people might have to think beyond the next 10:30 defensive reset. It also increases stackability of warriors on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
make the mods scaled down like focus effects on all grades of quested type armour i.e. crafted pieces may have a worn effect like +taunt or +defense or of the likes ( +2% or so ); stepped up on velious grade armours having the next step up from the crafted line in +mods ( say +6% ), than from there up to the raex/etc. grade make them the end-of-all-arguements +mods which grant bonuses like a working mod to already maxxed skill as in a +defense, +atk, +riposte/dodge/whaever modification ).<br />
<br />
gotta make the 40 to level 65 minus l33t gear a bit more of a valid choice for groups over hybrids IMHO and to spark more interest in making the other classes want to choose that warrior for a group who only can bring sub-par off/def attributes to the group dynamics at the level they're at now.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to give warriors the same aggro control as hybrids. I do infact like the idea of possibly +50 hate on top of successful taunt. This would give us a minor head. Remember that in Taunt's current form, it is +1 above the highest on the list, meaning if I hit taunt and get 1 point above that random_melee_01 then I better pray my next swing lands before his. Even if you try to time your weapon swing to land just after /taunt, it is still alot of luck.<br />
<br />
I would have to say that some of my friends are better equiped, but not all. I don't think that I should have to be the very best equiped person in the group to do my job. My equipment is fair-good but not amazing by any means.  I am only asking for a little help in an area that almost anyone would agree we need help in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the perspective of somebody who plays another class primarily, I think warriors need help. <br />
<br />
I've always like the warrior class, and I've probably had a dozen warrior characters over the (almost) 4 years I've played. Sturgis is the latest and highest level of those. I really feel sympathy for my warlord friends who sit around practically begging for something to do, and have often times taken them off to duo someplace with my main.<br />
<br />
And, contrary to how a lot of people think, I do think warriors should be able to solo. I guess it's the old D&amp;D thinking in me, but I always looked at the classes as the pure classes, and all the rest. The pure classes are Warrior, Wizard, Rogue, and Cleric. <br />
Each of these classes have one core funtion that they do better than anyone in the game (that is, they SHOULD). Warriors fight. Wizards nuke. Clerics heal. Rogues stay alive...I guess. Each of these four classes SHOULD be the ones that are known as being good soloing classes..because they are the basics..the purest classes in each area. Of course, they shouldnt be able to walk in and kill a god or dragon single-handedly, but they should be able to handle your everyday exp mobs as easily (or easier) than anyone else.<br />
<br />
So, if you dont mind a non-warrior brainstorming a bit, I'll tell you some of the things that I think would make warriors better. And, Varaho, dont pay attention to that thread over on the Crucible...some of the things posted there these days are stupifying. A lot of us shamans actually realize our class is far from broken and other people need some attention.<br />
<br />
- One of the first things I noticed about my little warriors was the 1/2 point of magic resist each level. This is cool concept..the warrior class having a natural resistance or aversion to magic..but nothing has ever come of it. Some ideas: <br />
a) give warriors twice as many points of magic resist if they train those AA's that add to magic resistance (General)<br />
b) give warriors an AA ability that gives them a large permanent magic resist boost..say 50 MR for 3 or 4 AA..maybe let them train it 2 or 3 levels even (Archetype or PoP)<br />
c) give warriors an AA that makes them immune to harmful magic for a limited duration - say 30 seconds, with a reasonable re-use time (Class or PoP)<br />
<br />
- Stuns. I dont know if they're a big deal to you, they've never been a big deal to my barbarian. But, some shamans seem to care about the ogre no-frontal-stun thing. I never have, but none-the-less warriors live and die in the trenches. Why would they see birdies if they got clocked a good one? Leave that for the robes.<br />
a) give warriors a cheap, passive AA that makes them permanently immune to stun, from any direction..and by cheap, I mean 1 or 2 AA at most (Class or PoP with no prerequisite). Get rid of Stalwart Endurance<br />
<br />
- Damage. Rogues and monks should not be the melee damage kings. Warriors should be, in all aspects of melee combat, the masters...well, maybe give evasion to the rogues cause I'm not sure what else to give them. Warriors should not only be able to take more damage than anyone, but I feel they should have no equal in dishing out damage as well. If that were the case, some of the aggro problems would be taken care of (not all). Some ideas:<br />
a) Make Fell Strike discipline a 7 minute re-use. Right now, a 58+ warrior can do 12 seconds of planned 4x damage per half hour. A rogue can backstab every what...10 seconds? So, in a half hour a rogue can do 180 backstabs. How many attacks do you make in 12 seconds? 20? 30? 50? These are very general numbers, of course, but a rogue with simple backstab alone can get almost 4 times the number of 4x damage attacks as a warrior with Fell Strike. Combat Fury is just icing on the cake for that rogue.<br />
b) Or, as an alternative to the change above; give warriors a discipline (or skill) with similiar re-use time as backstab that lets you throw out one combat round of 4x damage...call it weaponmastery, or something.<br />
c) make Area Taunt usable at the same interval as normal taunt, you could have one hotkey to taunt, one for area taunt when appropriate<br />
d) monks and rogues both have haste disciplines; why dont warriors?<br />
<br />
I could probably throw out more ideas, but this has gotten pretty long and my attention span is short. Please dont flame me for innaccuracies or misperceptions, I already admitted I'm a newbie as a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Some poeple here have already posted their letters to developers on this board, myself included. Anyone that thinks SoE is gonna suddenly jump up and read these boards and fix us is dillusional. If you're that concerned, send a letter. Hell, copy-paste mine and edit name if you don't want to. The bottom line though, want response, spam e-mails, simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The developers do read class boards. Just because they dont respond or tell you who they are, doesnt mean they arent reading. I've seen quite a few changes over the last year or so to shamans that were nearly identical to ideas posted at the Crucible. Spamming emails is not the only way, nor even a good way, to get your ideas heard either. If it's a good idea, they only need to hear it once not have 1000 emails saying the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, but some folks have been posting good ideas for a reeeaaaaaallllyy long time, and thus far have been ignored.  The ONE time that Absor posted here, it was to hawk the new no transfer server. If he actually looked at anything else, I've seen no indication...aside from the usual &quot;we're looking at &lt;insert melee problem of choice&gt;&quot; that we always get.   Note that they said melee, not warrior.   The last time they looked at a &quot;melee&quot; balance issue, it was to partially undo the monk nerf that they so royally screwed up on in the first place.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I hear ya. Shamans have some of the same issues..things that have been fubar for a long, long time. But some things have been slowly getting worked on lately.<br />
<br />
One of the things I see over there on the shaman boards is people posting ridiculous wishes that are in no way going to happen. Sometimes players dont think through their ideas and look at it from more than one angle. Whenever I think of something that could be an improvement for a class, I always try to think of a way it might be abused. If I can think of a way to abuse it, then I know other people can so it's probably not a good idea. For example, when we were brainstorming about new alchemy potion ideas a couple that came to mind for me were feign death or charm potions. Then I realized that would be way too powerful. Imagine a whole raid able to charm a pet or feign death..there's a reason you dont see any items with those effects on them. Well, there is a feign death ring for shamans, but the quest drops are so insanely rare I dont know of any shaman that's ever gotten one...and it only has 2 charges.<br />
<br />
But, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of a weaponmastery skill for warriors. Just have it be like rogues backstab, except it wouldnt matter where you were positioned on the mob. Every 10 seconds or so, you could toss out one combat round of 4x base damage which would help up your overall dps and most likely be a nice taunt factor as well. I cant see any way this would be overpowering or abusive, since it's exactly what rogues have with backstab. And it should be a skill, not a discipline, so you'd be able to still have defensive ready when needed.<br />
<br />
Then again, one of you guys also said something that got me thinking too. The thing about moving defensive to a separate timer...I'm thinking, why stop with defensive? Tune up the warrior disciplines and make warriors unique in that they have all their disciplines on separate timers. Like knowing multiple combat styles or manuevers...but only warriors know enough about combat to learn disciplines this way. And, they would probably want to look at each discipline and make adjustments to how they work so this wasnt overpowered.<br />
<br />
Just some random thoughts..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So that ppl on allakhazam could argue over the best class to use it~<br />
<br />
As for fixing warriors...<br />
<br />
-Increase the stupid piercing cap... always bothered me that our cap was lower than slashing or crushing.  Aren't warriors supposed to be the Quon of weaponsmasters?<br />
<br />
-Do something to taunt, make kick a taunt... do something.... even if it's an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding effects like +taunt and +defense to gear is a nice addition, but it will only improve the tanking warrior, not the warrior that are just another DPS toon.<br />
<br />
I have now seen a few suggestions on changing to disciplines to seperate independing timers, but this would allow a tank to pretty much switch between defense and evasive all day long.<br />
Maybe something between the current and the suggested solution would be more reasonable, like having two groups of disciplines. One group could be defense skills and another could be offensive skills and each group would be on its own timer, so you could be offensive and then defensise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mezzery</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love how they think that if they make PoP weapons better we will all shut our mouths for a bit and play with our new toys. Well thats good you can upgrade PoP weapons all dam day and thats not gonna change a thing! Most of us have shitty DPS because we CAN'T GET PoP WEAPONS!! It hard to get on a raid to have a shot at PoP weapons because my gear is to shitty to hold a stick against someone like Rallos Zek. <br />
<br />
    All they are doing is improving the upper 3% of the warrior game. totaly spooging all over the other 97% of us that arn't in uber guilds. So if they go upper 3rd tier weaopns thats not gonna change anything at all! They need to sit down take some time and seriously take a look at warrior in general. They need to do ALOT of work to balance us out. At 61 my avg DPS is something near 60-70. And in a Valor grp we where tracking the rangers DPS in the grp. He was avg. 80-110 DPS! Thats stight melee not his bow.. cuz hell with his bow he was over 220 DPS.<br />
<br />
   Now when I was a young warrior rangers where a thing to laugh at now they are godly! I guess i didn't get the meesage about hell freezeing over that day huh?<br />
<br />
   They really need to take a good hard look at all warrios over all from lv 1s in West FP killing bats to the lv65s in the Rathe Council battles.  I think that is the only way we will be balanced and we all know there is no way in hell that they are gonna take the time to do that. So I guess untill we make our voices heard nothing will be done =(<br />
<br />
 But I will contine to sit and LFG...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hear people posting how they want to solo for exp, want better this and that... Yes we need something fixed so people can say &quot;yeah we need a warrior over the generic &quot;tank&quot; title&quot;. Lets say warriors got a defensive increase like monks... we were able to tank a blue mob in PoV without a heal since we aren't getting hit as often due to the increase.... what do you think your gonna see?  Remember before PoP came out, walk into velks and seeing 20 warriors and monks in the zone soloing... well i saw on my server and i did it aswell for a time, it was slow but it was +exp for my time between raids. Had to fight for a single spawn because the warrior could heal themselves in the time for that spawn to repop. I wasn't ubber, hell i was 60 in Barbed ringmail tunic and peerless leggins wielding an axe from CT, been so long i forget the name 44/44....<br />
<br />
I also have a 62 druid that goes LFG because all the kiting spawns are taken by rangers, bards, necros, other druids...  So soloing isn't a prime choice of complaining imho, you'll have 200 warriors soloing across the zones instead of having to group and your back to LFG.  The game is geared to group, build friendships, make reputations (good or bad).  I like the firepower my druid has since i pretty much don't have that with my warrior.  <br />
<br />
I like the idea of +50% chance of taunt success rate to under level con mobs. It still has a chance of failure, but at lvl 65 (roleplaying out) we should have learned all the tricks to make the mob mad at us.... like that senseheading button.. even wtih 200 skill it still says &quot; You THINK  your heading North&quot; that should be changed (its a pet peave but ).<br />
<br />
126days played and still can't make a good taunt, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the that point really isn't that Warriors can't solo.  It's the fact that we are the most dependent class in the game who must absolutely without a doubt have a group to accomplish anything worth doing and we've had our group desirability blown to crap.<br />
<br />
The balance was supposed to be the more independent the class, the greater their ability to solo and as a result they frequently took a hit in their group desirability.  The more dependent the class, the lower their ability to solo and the greater their group desirability.  At the current point in the game Warriors have NO ability to solo, which we can live with, and we've been shifted back to number three tank for groups, past level 60 of course.<br />
<br />
This really sucks camel hump.  Our only real plus is we're wanted on raids.  But plenty of us hardly raid at all.  And we lose in every other catagory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not really interested in solo'ing per say but have kind of pushed on why we can't even get a mob to half way that others can out right kill one evey 5 minutes or so with comperable gear. That is on PoP mobs. I really never expect to be able to solo anything in PoP but surely some other places with light blu or green mobs. <br />
Recently I zoned in to Akheva, this seems to be the best place I have found for me to check out any new gear and see what changes they have made outside of the group role for our class. I can't help it, I just have to check once in a while when I think something is different. I am by no means one of the top 10 tanks on my server. I wear a full set of Myrmidon gear with the exception of Vindi BP. I wield a Wind-Worn handblade in my primary and a Shadow Heart in my secondary. All other is fairly decent and good gear for a 63 warrior with 20 something AA's. These mobs are light blu and should not pose a big problem expecially with the use of a discipline. You would be surprised. <br />
I can take the Patrolers it seems every time as kick does enough stunning to keep their casting from doing much damge yet they still get me down to 30-40%. This changes drasticly when I take on the lite blu melee mobs that stand in the front of the first hall. I can kill these on occasion with the use of a disc but more often than not i am sent scurrying off with my tail between my legs. And that is after using almost any discipline i have tried. So far I have used defensive, evasive, precision, and aggressive. Some times even though I think my gear rocks really I can't help but feel frustrated when a level 50 zones in and procedes to wipe the front out with nothing more than pre velious gear and spells.<br />
I am not sure how much more obvious it can get when I look at that type of situation. I just have to laugh and hope they do not ask to duel me once they get done killing everything else=(</div></div><hr />
