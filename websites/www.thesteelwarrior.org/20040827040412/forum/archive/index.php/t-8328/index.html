<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sarsippius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No not me...just the UI.  I have just completed the formal handover of power to Bonekracker and his team to keep the UI going and my legacy alive.  For all of you old users who are already accustomed to my UI, it is now fully updated and ready for download.....For all of you who have not heard of it or have not given it a try....the website is http://sars.has.it.  You owe it to yourself to give it a try!   The only UI made for a warrior by a warrior!!!  (Melee version)<br />

Have fun and kick ass!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Link works for me :)  Can't wait for my HoTT bar and Leader Exp to work correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Loaded all the new patches and I am very pleased with it's performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been modding mine to suit me, being a beastlord, not a warrior, but there is one thing that irks me...<br />
<br />
The HUGE hotbutton, stats, exp window.  Is there any way to make that thing smaller on my 800x600 screen other than raising the resolution?  I have a slow machine, so going 800x600 cuts a lot of lag for me, so saying 'raise your resolution' isnt really a fix.<br />
<br />
Maybe about 2/3 the size it is now would be nice.<br />
<br />
On my resolution, the spell gems, buff windows and other stuff is ok sized, just that one box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, Sars is designed to run at 1280x1024<br />
<br />
I'm sure you can resize the box, but I'm not the one that can tell you how to do it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I had those issues when I first loaded the UI.  It definitely isn't for 800x600.  Or even 1024x768.  <br />
<br />
It took some squinting at first but I love the UI.  I've looked at several others but they were glorified caster UI's.  This one is great for melee.  Having the hot inventory slots on top of the bags is totally cool.  Makes it so easy to switch pieces for clickies.<br />
<br />
Nice having all the screen real estate open too.<br />
<br />
When it went without an update for so long I tried to find a replacement, but couldn't.</div></div><hr />
