<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You mean like the thread in this very forum called 1.5 -&gt; 2.0? Try skimming the forum before you post. Already a 5+ page thread on that very subject as we try and figure out the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - Kill the Possessed Brute in Murmanite Proving grounds, get Kertjnok's Muddled Rage.<br />
 (hits for over 2500) Single groupable with good time level group.<br />
 possessed brute spawns left of the big square/rectange section in the middle of the map<br />
<br />
2 - Give Kertjnok's Muddled Rage to Korbuk who then says.....<br />
<br />
All too easy. For you, I mean. You did well. I'm..I'm getting unclear visions fromt his essence. I can't seem to understand what it's trying to tell me. This essence is impure and needs to be purified. I happen to know of a [purification expert] dat can help us clear this mystery up.<br />
<br />
You're going to need to travel to da frozen underbelly of Norrath to find a gnome I've not seen in a long time. I coudln't begin to tell you where to find him, but you might try da frozen ocean as a starting point. If you can't find him, you may be able to find someone else who knows where he is.<br />
<br />
3 - Hail Fazzle Thumpkin in Iceclad Ocean<br />
<br />
Fazzle Thumpkin says 'Damnable interruptions! Can't you see I'm looking for my pestle?! I lost that blasted thing months ago and haven't been able to find it! What will I do without my pestle?! My poor, poor pestle. Where have you gone? I thought I'd lost it around here somewhere, but maybe I left it near one of those statues during my surveying of the islands. Drat and double drat! Where did I leave you? Woe...'<br />
<br />
4 - Find frozen pestle at pos 1068 pos 5225 in iceclad<br />
<br />
5 - Give frozen pestle to Fazzle Thumpkin get no rent map. You can hail him again and again and say &quot;what map&quot; to get the map for later tries. <br />
<br />
6 - Go to EW with the map. Use the map to guide you to a spot. 8pm game the map starts working. Hold it on your cursor. Larnik the Recluse spawns and starts a run to Kael. Hail him as he runs. <br />
<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'Ahh! I've been found out! Who are you and where did you come from? How did you find me? It was that bothersome Fazzle, wasn't it? I knew he couldn't be trusted with the map! I knew it! Leave me alone, I don't want to be bothered! Away, away!'<br />
You say, korbuk sent me. At this point he stops<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'What? What did you say? Who sent you? Korbuk sent you? That's impossible. I told him to be gone long ago. I told him never to speak of me or send anyone my way ever again! That fool! Why would he send you here?'<br />
You say, 'great purification'<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'Raaaa! I'm out of that business! I'll never help him or anyone else purify another thing so long as I live! Get away from me!'<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'I'll not be hunted any more! Begone with you!'<br />
Larnik the Recluse tries to punch YOU, but misses!<br />
Larnik the Recluse punches YOU for 1630 points of damage.<br />
kill Larnik the Recluse, he drops a locked chest<br />
<br />
7 - Give locked chest to Korbuk he turns it into a container and returns it to you. Telling you to use it to combine the Kertjnok's Muddled Rage in it. <br />
<br />
8 - Combine Kertjnok's Muddled Rage in Korbuk's returned container to get Kreljnok's Focused Rage (no drop potion)<br />
<br />
9 - After the combine of the purifying box hail Korbuk again:<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'You were able to purify da presence, good. Just <br />
as I thought, da essence is pure and unadultered. Things are becoming <br />
ever clearer da closer we come to unraveling this mystery. Even without <br />
touching da essence, I can see pure rage surrounding a sword. I cannot <br />
even begin to express what it looks like. It's a very powerful image, <br />
to be sure. We're not quite done yet, however. There's a bit [more] dat <br />
needs to be done.'<br />
<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
You say, 'more'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I have sensed a strong and powerful draw from da <br />
fallen palace to da north. I've heard whispers dat it is called Anguish <br />
and is a terrible place to go. I don't know any more than dat, except <br />
dat there is... something there. My visions about this are chaotic and I <br />
don't know what to make of them. Be careful, there's no telling what <br />
may lie in wait for you there.'<br />
<br />
10 - Search Anquish (Ground spawn?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you search Kreljnok on Lucy now, you will get 3 spells, two of them are epic 2.0 effects, and another one is an AE:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6118&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
which I believe was casted by the epic 2.0 final boss in Anguish, maybe there is a mob named Kreljnok in Anguish and all we need to do is kill him? =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That would be relatively quick if that is true...i guess all the 2.0 quests are like the ranger 1.0  You get a weapon more than halfway through (at least) then you only have to do a few more things for final quest.  Makes sense to me lol... :p</div></div><hr />
