<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lelara</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Wudgurorm,<br />
<br />
Here's my experiance with that Kerafyn looking type mob.<br />
<br />
The Planar Projection spawns somewhere around the flat platform that can tilt 90 degrees.<br />
<br />
What happened on my raid was someone &quot;opened&quot; the platform and then the planar projection &quot;droped&quot; down into the water but could not be found. However it was on the ranger/druid/bard track.<br />
<br />
We petitioned, and of course, GMs couldn't do a thing.<br />
<br />
So our lesson was never open the platform with the planar projection on it.<br />
<br />
In your case, you may have taken too long to take down the Mindless Minions and by the time they were down all down, the Planar Projection may have depoped. Most probably that is not the case but it's a possibility.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as to how to deal with it?<br />
Most probably the best answer I can give you is...deal with it.<br />
Hehehehehe.<br />
Unless someone out there can provide a better answer, I would like to hear it myself.<br />
Don't count on the GMs to help you that much on Planar Projections. Everytime my guild has encountered a bug with those things, the GMs can't really do a thing about it. All we do now is wait till the mob respawns naturally and take it down again on our own. It sucks but look on the bright side, someone will get thier equipment or spell upgrade in some way or another.<br />

<br />
The answer is, somewhat rarely, projections can poof early, and even rarer is them sticking around longer than the normal time of 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
I think we had AD projection poof 2 or 3 times after around 3 minutes of being up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen that projection poof after like 90 seconds, and I've seen it stay up for nearly 20 minutes.  We always have a loot officer or backup loot person on corpses immediately, I have a hard time believing that checking his corpse has anything to do with how long the projection sticks around.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, Bertox projection stayed up for us for a grand total of about 130 seconds. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which is why you drop something that has a planar projection, you make a point to run over there, and hail it before it poofs. Just a thought, seeing as it's NASTY when they depop too fast. I made a bee line for the bertoxx projection and hailed it fast. First time we dropped that fugger he gave out the 72 flags in a matter of about 30 seconds. The spam was ledgandary.</div></div><hr />
