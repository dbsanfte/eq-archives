<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just trying to find some clarification on this. Friends already in the elementals, told me they could raid flag in the past but my guilds recent attempts haven't been successful. We've tried forming raids in HoHA and HoHB to make sure no zone bugs occured.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I cant make out what the hell you talking about in your post so I'll just reply to the thread topic on allownce of non flaged in hohb.<br />
<br />
The answer is yes you can get unflaged in there to kill MM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK let me clarify then. We've tried to raid flag into HoHB and have not been able to do so. We've form up the raid in HoHA and tried w/o luck and we've also formed up the raid in HoHB without luck. Even w/ 40+ flagged we get the will is not sufficent message trying  even 1 non flagged. Has anyone else had recent problems with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zerapheus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We've had problems with this lately on our last backflagging episode of MM/HOH-b, and what was found out is that you need the Aerin'Dar flag to help with raid-access to HoH-B.  So even if you have more people who are completely trial-flagged over Aerin'Dar flagged, you'll have problems getting in.  AD seems to be the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hoh trials never registered without aerin flag iirc, so yes you would have to have 36+ fully hohb flaged ppl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We tried both ppl w/ and w/o AD flags, still no luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vladimoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild seems to have the same problem getting people without all 3 HoH trials AND Aerin'Dar flags into HoHB most of the time.  Occasionally for no reason we can determine the raid will allow 3 unflagged in with about 10 full flagged groups.  Now with 60 full flagged we should abe able to get ~6 or 7 in (I'm too lazy to do the math) but we could never get more then 3 unflagged in.  Other times it will not allow any inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">form up in hohb, when u reach 32, make a new group leader and have that person zone back/gate to add ppl. main thing is you dont want the raid leader zoning or anyone else more than they have to.<br />
<br />
if ppl arent getting in its because too many ppl are zoning back and forth and the raid breaks. just need to reform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can get people without flags into HoHb but it seems kind of buggy.  We did MM last night and had unflagged people there but we couldn't get as many in as we should have been able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at some point your raid broke, we have had the same problem. we had 5 ppl in but should have been able to get 10. reformed and got 10. if the only person zoning back and forth is the person inviting unflagged ppl, you dont have much risk of it breaking.<br />
<br />
on RZ for example, the raid breaks 100% of the time after we TL out to zone back in for the last part.</div></div><hr />
