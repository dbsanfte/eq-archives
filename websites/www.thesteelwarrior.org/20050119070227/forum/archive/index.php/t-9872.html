<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could try Dulak harbour or Velketors Labyrinth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorphen</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried Velks they still have a few to many hps to make it effective. And ive been to Dulaks the scouts are all light blue and the guardians I could take but the scouts always pop and add. I wish I knew the zone better or I would invis and venture further. I guess thats what I get for taking a year off though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I marked the places where i used to camp in dulak on a map. Camp where the red square is. Get to camps invis.<br />

<br />
Spot 1:<br />
Camp at the wall. You can single pull the whole open area, the wandering guards and armory guardians. Scouts could be already LB as you said, but give nice cash loot (some PP and gems). This is the easiest camp in this zone i found.<br />
<br />
Spot 2:<br />
This is a nice safe spot at the wall. Sometimes groups camp here. You can single pull the whole open area.<br />
<br />
Area 3:<br />
I used to hunt here too (no special camp place). Most mobs are single pulls. If you get more then you can handle run up the ladder and zone to torgiran. Just make sure you are sowed all the time and don't play the hero. Then you shouldn't get in trouble.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something else to mention:<br />
On the way to dulak i always had a short look into Nadox. When you zone from the caves of Gunthak into Nadox there are 3 Fire Elemantals near ZoneIn. They are all single pulls and great exp at your level. I always killed them on my way when they were up. If you cant take them you have the zoneline right behind you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck  :)</div></div><hr />

I can't remember what the lvl was for that zone so maybe someone here can give a little more info for you on Nurga.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda depends on why you want to solo. I try not to solo for my exp., but i will for drops, plat, or faction.<br />
What I've done before is camp the ice giants in Everfrost. They're a mix of light and dark blue, drop fair plat. It's not a great exp camp, though. I did it for the plat and the cultural temper drops, especially when I was lfg and wanted an LDoN (the Everfrost adventure camp is very close).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorphen</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brable im up odd hours so I group in the afternoons then im up all night when nobodys on. So rather than do nothing i try to solo as much exp as I can manage just to get a little ahead. <br />
<br />
Thanks Elfried I had no Idea there was another zone out That will make it a little easier. I mostly didn't want to venture because I hate having to train the zone to gunthark. There is usually a Necro or sombody there.  And I only play the hero in groups lol not solo, no use in dieing trying to save yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If you had ever seen me play a caster you wouldn't even sugest that  :eek:<br />
<br />
I did try a Necro once, it took me 3 times longer to solo him to 40+ than it did soloing a warrior there.  And now that we can bind to 70% its that much easier. I was like the forest gump of necro's &quot;Every where I went I was running........... Away screeming!&quot;</div></div><hr />
