<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>H001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, <br />
<br />
We've started working to completing the 3 KT trials. I have seen some posts about the subject but none really answered my questions.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any confirmations yet about the Tasks- I'd like some info since many of us aren't KT flagged yet and I'm wondering if we should put all effort in backflagging right now, or if we should finish up the trials and start working on the Tasks asap whilest sacrificing backflag time for this (meaning we'll backflag when Ikkinz raids are openned up). Our backflagging (and normal flagging) strongly relies on a few individuals, and therefor it would be hard to focus on both simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Do all the 3 tasks have to be done by 1 person only to unlock the raids? Or does everyone need to?<br />
<br />
And how many folks would be needed for the Protector/Summoner Ring? Biggest chunk of us is in Luclin gear still. (I know that it would be best to get dressed in EP/Time gear so no need to give advice on that issue :)). We haven't really tried yet but it would be nice to know approx number we would need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 summoner ring not needed to proceed to ikkinz raids<br />
2 if youre in luclin gear you wont be beating ikkinz trials<br />
3 have a rogue do all the tasks, they can do 85%+ of them by themselves &amp; are the prefered class for starting raids anyways due to the dorfs position</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well the way you put it, I would worry more about getting everyone flagged for Kod'Taz than Ikkinz raids, since really, what's the point of enabling raids if your people can't even get into the zone.<br />
<br />
If you have to rely on a few people to get everyone else through to even zone into Kod'Taz, I would doubt that even they could complete the trials, and as has been said already, you'd die on the raids.  <br />
<br />
The raids aren't really free loot for everyone.  On my server, I rarely if ever see anyone outside of the top four guilds (all guilds who are in time) in Kod'Taz, and only two of those guilds have access to the raids, both of us having been in time 6 months or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With the tuning they did to the Ikkinz raids last week, they are significantly more difficult. My guild hit them kinda midstride. We had the first three completed then they made the changes. They are more...challenging now, and we're a post time level guild. Being luclin geared will make this all the more difficult.<br />
<br />
Now that the public service announcement is out of the way, to answer your question, yes, only one person needs to have access to the raids to start them for everyone. After the three single group Ikkinz trials, one person needs to complete the task involving the destroyed temple near the altar of destruction. Find the dwarf npc near the Yxxta zone and i think the trigger phrase is &quot;what ritual&quot;. That should give you the info needed to complete the raid task.</div></div><hr />
