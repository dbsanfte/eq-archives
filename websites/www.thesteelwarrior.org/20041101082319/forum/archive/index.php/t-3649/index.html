<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Slimestone Fragment of Shock (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24380) <br />
Strike of Ykesha <br />
0.0 sec stun<br />
100 hp DD<br />
Slots: Primary, Secondary, RANGE<br />
Aug: slot 4<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Zone: Guk<br />
Points:  510<br />
<br />
Anyone tried putting this in their bow? (archery range slot bow, not a BoW).  Slot 4 is procs... This should proc.  Just wondering how effective this would be for tags on pulls and how frequent this would proc.  <br />
<br />
Anyone done any tests? i'm willing to get this and put in my Stonewood Compound Bow to see how well it does work.  Maybe even get a fleeting quiver and a lower delay bow to test out speed.<br />
<br />
If this does seem effective, maybe have extra bows for situational fights just like we have extra weapons.  Probably put this augment in a quick bow with stats (Featherwood Compound Bow (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17778)) for xp groups and tanking situations.  And leave my Stonewood Compound Bow (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19096) for non-aggro ranged fights.<br />
<br />
Suggestions? Ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I once asked a few rangers about the various procs on bows, and the reply I got was that archery procs are pretty rare.  I assume this would carry over to augmented procs.  <br />
<br />
I like your logic on ranged fights though, I sure wouldn't wanna have an aggro proc on my bow for them.  A DD proc perhaps would be nice (might put a really cheap proc to test out the rate).  More than likely I guess people will put type:any augs on their bows.<br />
<br />
Now that i'm thinking about it, I might stick a really cheap dd proc on my bow to see how it does.</div></div><hr />
