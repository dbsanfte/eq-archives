Anyone have any personal experience/thoughts they would care to share of this weapon? please  hehe The stats are nice and the dmg/dly is very nice, but will it hold agro ( will add an anger 3 proc if I decide to get it ) better than say SotBS. Thank you in advance for your imput :)</div></div><hr />

However, if you save yourself a boatload of cash and instead augment the SotB with Anger3 you'll have an agro monster of a weapon.<br />

If you are concerned about DPS, stop looking at 1-handed weapons.</div></div><hr />

It's overpriced to start with, and secondly, a warrior's job is to keep aggro, and maybe do some damage too. CHoS and SotBS are both better for a warrior. BoC is better if you have cash, as is SoD, though its a waste. Any buyable 1hander with +hate, stun/dd, or other aggro procs &gt; SBoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. keep the worthless SBoD as a dps weapon<br />
2. waste a proc by putting it on a proc-less weapon<br />
3. sell the overpriced PoS, buy a CHoS/SoBS and spend 90k on upgrades elsewhere.<br />
<br />
better yet, i love the warriors i see with SBoD mainhanded and BoC offhanded.  they buy an anger3 ... put it on SBoD ... and offhand the BoC with no augmented proc ... that just seems plain dumb to me. /shrug<br />
<br />
i see no reason why any self respecting warrior would swing this unless they wanted a no aggro dps weapon and the rest of their gear was non-upgradable via cash.<br />
<br />
CHoS in mainhand = ~1000hate per min with procs<br />
SBoD mainhand= 0 hate per min with procs<br />
CHoS + anger3 = ~2200 hate per min with procs<br />
SBoD + anger3= 1200 hate per min with procs<br />

sure, the SBoD + anger 3 will be decent aggro ... but hell ... anything with anger3 will be decent aggro.</div></div><hr />

In addition, I never said it was the best buyable weapon but instead one of the best.  14/19   20 ac 90 hps 15 str 15 dex plus other stats.. I know its not oober.. but what weapon has better dps ratio that you can purchase.  BoC 15/20 is the only one that is comparable.. but $$$$<br />

The best thing about my normal weapon combo (CHSD and SBoD) is that they're the same color, and look sweet with my dyed grey armor.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it comes down to this.  As a warrior you want as much aggro as possible, there is no such thing as too much aggro.  Augmenting a weapon without an aggro proc is limiting your aggro potential.  Therefore, your best option as a warrior is to augment weapons that already have aggro procs which gives more total aggro.<br />
<br />
Of course if you have a great proc weapon main hand, especially an augmented one, then the aggro loss from putting the SBoD in the offhand vs a dual aggro proc weapon in the offhand is really minimal.  The stats on the SBoD and the ratio are very nice.  It's a trade-off that some people would make, they'd rather have the ratio and stats then the minor aggro obtained from a second proc on the offhand weapon.  I personally would not make such a choice, I'd rather have the aggro of the second proc, especially because of how overpriced the SBoD is.  If the SBoD was 10-15k then I might consider offhanding it with an aggro proc.<br />
<br />
Plus, in my opinion, the SBoD is ugly as hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because a CHoS with a ~500point aggro augment will hold aggro better than 16/19 with 1 proc, and it takes a hell of a lot less time then saving points to build a sweet ldon weapon.  as a tank your first job is to hold aggro and take hits.  2nd job is to do dps.  that is why 13/20 with forceshock + anger2/3 or yak works much nicer than a 16/19 with 1 yak proc.  if youre relying on your extra dps to hold aggro, then you will get pwned every time you group with a 180+dps rog/monk or a high dps caster, because, quite frankly, your dps will never be high enough.<br />
<br />
if you want to do dps, buy a decent 2hander from the bazaar and it will put out as much or more dps than this duel wield combo.  hell, you can even buy a GSoT 31/30 with an innate proc and slap a ldon aug on it.  it will put out as much dps as your duel wield combo, as well as providing you with stronger aggro.  if you want aggro than find some weapons with an innate proc and then add augmented procs on top of it.  more procs the better.  i can guarantee you that a CHoS + anger2 will handily outaggro your yak blade with 1 proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
bigchest, and as to the &quot;dont buy BoC&quot; statement i made,  the BoC is wonderful, but 500k could be spent better elsewhere unless youre loaded.  the same goes with a SoD.  the are both the best buyable, but the price offsets the practicality of either.   i personally wouldnt buy one unless i was dont &quot;buying&quot; any other upgrades for the most part.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the SBoD was 10-15k then I might consider offhanding it with an aggro proc.&quot;<br />
- my thoughts exactly.  if it werent so expensive, the stats/dps might be worth it.   as is, its over 100k on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's usually around 80-100k on my server.  SoD's go for 230-275k.  I'd MUCH rather have a SoD for just over double the price than a SBoD.  I've even seen several BoC's on my server for 250k, although rare, and commonly they are 300k or so.  I just can't imagine spending 100k on a SBoD when for just over double that you could have a BoC or SoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not true ... the CHoS and SoBS procs are more than 400 hate.<br />
<br />
<br />
i have a CHoS with anger2 (offhand ... used to be mainhand), and a GSoT with anger2.  in fights, if anger2 proc goes off in the first 5 seconds without incite and shaman lands a successful slow, i lose aggro.  if i get either the force shock on hammer or stun proc on staff, in the same 5 seconds and shaman slows, i lose no aggro.  anger2 was a nice bonus on top of the innate procs, but i was always more confident when the stuns went off early vs the anger2.<br />
<br />
got a GBoS with anger3 mainhand now and its pretty much the opposite.  i love seing the &quot;%t's face contorts with rage&quot; at the start of the fight because chances are it just gave me some monster aggro :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's right, stuns have been parsed at ~400 hate per stun. There was extensive testing on this using SKs and pallys to exactly measure just how much pure hate it took to overcome the agro of a stun. The results can be replicated easily.<br />
<br />
As for SBoD and the other weapons in this thread, I have owned every single of them and currently dual weild BoC+GBoS. I've said it before and I'll say it again - putting A3 on ANY weapon makes it decent for holding agro, but putting A3 on ANY weapon with a stun/hate proc makes a superior weapon for holding agro. All of the weapons in question have similar ratios, there is no way in the world that even a 16/19+1 proc weapon will do so much more DPS as to out agro a 13/20+2 proc weapon.<br />
<br />
I don't care how good you think you have agro with a single proc weapon, YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AGRO AS YOU COULD HAVE. You are screwing your group/guild in the process as well because guess who has to throttle back DPS to match your agro? Do you really thing that a little AC, a few HP, and some stats are worth the drop in DPS of EVERY person on your raid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree that the SotB and CHoS are better bang for your buck than the BoC if youre going to buy a weapon, i havent been in bazaar in a while but im guessing they go under 10k whereas BoCs on my server are 400k + but the BoC is still signifigantly better than the droga weapons<br />
<br />
and your examples about shaman slowing are hard to take seriously as they are all rough estimates of 5 seconds and how many procs ect, youlle need parses to make it actual evidence</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you're wrong.  In a number of long parses, both against the Katta bankers as well as the red con mob in PoI factory, my BoC/CHoS &quot;agro&quot; combo outdamaged both my WB and WMBS.  Not by much, but by enough to make a difference.  The only procs I have on the 1H weps are anger3 and 2, and the 2H are non-augmented.  My next weapons upgrade is going to be a Great Blade of Storms from BoT, so the gap will widen with that.  Next upgrade after that will be GSot4W, which I think will handily beat my 1H combo for dps by a good margin.<br />
<br />
I'm curious though.  Does anyone have any parses of GSot4W vs. WB or WMBS on the same mobs?  I'm wondering what kind of DPS improvement I might expect to see by upgrading to that.  Currently, with 31% haste and no offensive AA's, I'll parse around 58 DPS on the Katta bankers with my current 2HS weapons.  I've been wondering though, about possibly building a pair of the 16/19 weapons available from LDoN, to see how they would compare for DPS vs. the GSot4W.  As WA5 is next on my AA list, followed by 1H offensive AA's, I'd get more benefit from them I think, by having a 1H dps combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The GSO4W is about 25% DPS improvement over a WMBS.  I don't have logs handy here at work, though.<br />
<br />
From trying to parse others, it appeared to me that a BOW is a 20% DPS improvement over a GSO4W.</div></div><hr />

raid haste vs self-haste or no haste could make a noticable difference, especially when comparing 2handers vs 1handers.  the katta banker, also, is a poor example because youre effective dps will be much different against a non-greencon.<br />

BoC + CHoS would outdamage a GSoT i'd imagine.  i dont doubt you there, but if any warrior is looking for dps rather than aggro, a good ratio'd 2hander is always the way to go.  a buyable one such as GSoT or WMBS may not do it for you, but, then again, GSoFW is really pretty easy to get, and is arguably one of the top 2 or 3 DPS weapons available to warriors pre-EP's</div></div><hr />

that too ... punishing blade 3, ferocity 3, and max flurry do amazing things for 2hander dps.  with max offensive there is no dps like a good 2hander.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the purpose of comparing weapons against each other via parsing, haste makes no difference whatsoever, as each weapon will be hasted the same.  Saying haste will affect a 2H weapon more than a 1H weapon is inaccurate.  Using raid haste, while showing the max DPS your combo will do against that particular mob, is actually pointless, as unless you have a bard and chanter there with you for a number of hours to keep your haste constant throughout the entire parse, your parse will be on the short side.  You'll notice this in your own parses, as your parses on the same mob have you varying by up to 15%.  Longer parses, which aren't dependent on having ppl nearby to buff you, are more reliable.  Also, you'll notice again that I stated I used the red-con mob in PoI factory for parsing as well.   The ratio of 1Hdps/2Hdps was approximately the same in both cases.  You're missing the point of the parses.  It's not to show max DPS, it's merely to compare the different weapon combos to each other.<br />
<br />
Sassinak, you're correct about my lack of offensive AA's hurting my 2H dps more than my 1H.  However, it's still going to be some time before I do offensive AA's.  I still have to finish up LR, and then my pre-GoD hp AA and defensive AA's are done.  However, after that, I get to look forward to spending the next long while working towards WA5, and then sturdiness 5.  After that, it's going to be other things such as PP5, or hastened instigation.  As a result, I won't have offensive AA's for a lonnnnng time.  Using your number of 25%, in my own parsing situation *katta banker, worn haste only, overnight, safe and undisturbed*, I can expect to hit around 75 DPS or so by using GSot4W.  Right now, using BoC/CHoS, I hit 63-64 DPS.  If I can get that number closer to 75 using LDoN points *I have quite a few LDoN points, as when I'm not raiding with the guild I'm usually in LDoN with the same group of friends.  I also have most of the LDoN gear/augments I want now*, I'll do it instead.  That would save me from using my guild's version of DKP points/goodwill, and as well it would give another DPS weapon to the guild.</div></div><hr />

PB for dps?  <br />
<br />
In my own opinion, and as well I could be wrong, the offensive AA's such as ferocity, and flurry, will benefit 2H more than 1H.  I look at it this way.  If you have the RNG smile on you, and are allowed an extra attack per round; with 1H weapons, you have a chance to improve that's round's peak DPS by 60% we'll say.  Whereas, if you are given that same extra attack per round using 2H weps, you can now improve that round's peak DPS by 100%.  That's how I look at it, anyways.</div></div><hr />

because a CHoS with a ~500point aggro augment will hold aggro better than 16/19 with 1 proc, and it takes a hell of a lot less time then saving points to build a sweet ldon weapon.  as a tank your first job is to hold aggro and take hits.  2nd job is to do dps.  that is why 13/20 with forceshock + anger2/3 or yak works much nicer than a 16/19 with 1 yak proc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I missing something or SOE just made me extra special in regards to holding agro, but I never have a problem with agro with the current weapons I have, even with Rog, Monks, ect who are putting out more dps than me. I do see your point though  about creating more agro with a double proc weapon but if the one I use now is doing the job then the extra dps and better stats should be the way to go... I actually replaced my CHoS with the CSLB.  I was using the combo CHoS and SBoD/SSotB (switching back and forth) and it was also doing great for agro.  However, now I have notice the considerable difference (parsing) in Dps that the 16/19 does opposed to 13/20.  <br />
<br />
I sometimes break out my Fabled Exe Axe with no hate proc, to produce more dps and the funny thing is I can still hold a steady agro in my groups.   Guess incite works pretty good :)<br />

              getting near-instant aggro may not be important in average xp grind, but when youre clearing trash mobs that can quad/triple for over 800 (or much more), and quickly, the last thing i want my slower to have to think is ... if this is resisted am i gonna get ripped to shreds??  its amazing how quickly an unhasted 800-1k quad/triple attack mob can chew through an ench/shaman/cleric .. even if they have max defensive aa's.  by this point in the game if you cant hold aggro consistently throughout an xp grind then either your casters are triggerhappy ebayed duke nukem addicts, or weapon selection needs to be seriously reconsiderred.  holding aggro in xp situations shouldnt be a measure of how good a weapon setup is, because it should be a given that you can.  its a completely different level of tanking to jump into an encounter where quick heals are possibly needed left and right and an early slow is a must.  call my silly, but doubleproccing weapons are my security blanket.</div></div><hr />

EVERYONE does more DPS than you. That is not in question. The problem comes with HOW MUCH dps other people can do when you are tanking. It's a simple case of math. I guarantee you that there is no way on God's green earth I could pull 400+ dps with a tank using unagumented CHoS+SotB. As a matter of fact, I would probably be lucky to be able to sustain 250 dps for any length of time. However, you toss a couple of A3 augs on those weapons, the tanks DPS has not changed one iota, but I can now safely crank up the pace and pull 300 dps or more.<br />
<br />
More hate = more DPS from the people who do DPS.<br />
<br />
This is always true no matter what. The less likely a mob is to turn on a soft skinned DPS class, the more DPS they can crank out. More hate means less FDs, less time casting jolt, less time casting concussion, less waiting between nukes, less evades, more DoT stacking. This, by default, means that a weapon that generates more hate regardless of the DPS output is better overall. Who cares if you lose 20 DPS when you are getting 25 DPS more from EACH rogue/wizard/mage/monk/ranger that you are tanking for. THAT is the point that people are trying to make. Putting A3 on any weapon is going to make it decent, but putting A3 on an already decent weapon makes it fantastic. You have to look at what your job is as a warrior. Your sole purpose in life is to take a beating and to keep the big baddies from beating on the people who can dish out serious amounts of damage. Sacrificing a little DPS for a huge incrase in raid DPS is a good thing. Increasing your DPS at the cost of overall raid DPS is a bad thing. You will never in a million years make up the difference in DPS that just 1 wizard/rogue loses when you are working with 2 procs instead of 4.</div></div><hr />

My point is this.. yes I could get more agro generated from mob's by getting two hate proc weapons, and if I had problems I would but as of right now I don't have problems, complaints ect.. I use to dual wield the CHoS and the SSoBS and the combo I have now I dont notice any less/more agro than before but I sure do lub em heck of alot more.  With incite, taunt and both Ldon aug's procing like crazy I think I'll be alright.  So until I get complaints or have agro problems I think Ill go on doing the job I meant to do..  <br />

All I did is give an honest answer to the original post. The question was would you have problems holding agro with SBoD and anger aug.  Very simple question and based on my EXPERIENCE with it I dont have a problem with agro.  End of story.</div></div><hr />

When that wizard gets 5 more FT and wants to nuke more per fight, and gets a focus item that makes him do 15% more damage on every hit, then he will start running into your limitations instead of his own limitations.<br />
<br />
Most wizards and necros that I know simply cannot go OOM in a group setting.  If they try to spend more of their mana, then they gain aggro.  Their theoretical DPS limit is irrelevant.  The DPS that they actually reach is based purely on the tank's aggro.  These wizards and necros know it whenever I switch to a lower aggro weapon, right away they can tell, because they're always walking the knife-edge of maximum DPS without stealing aggro.  And they always notice when I've somehow improved my aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tarvok if you are thinking about purchasing the SBoD and putting an anger aug in it I think you will be very happy.  Unless you are in an elemental guild, which in that case you would have alot better weapons anyways than a SBoD, then you will do your job just fine. In groups raids ect.  The CHoS and SotbS are a dime a dozen and are extremly cheap and everyone and there brothers has one.  On the other hand the SBoD is not cheap and hella alot rare.  So it comes down to personal preference.  My suggestion is if you have the extra cash and it is not an issue then get the SBoD, but other wise you may want to spend it elsewhere on equip or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here ya go, the real deal, no bullshit.  Splitblade of destruction is fucking ass.  You can't argue it.  14/19?  The 13/20 Copper Hammer with a 179 DD will outdamage it on any mob that's not resisting procs left and right.  The SoD will blow it the fuck out of the water.<br />
<br />
Oh, you augmented it with Anger 2?  You're a moron.  Augment any of the droga weapons, a BoC or a SoD and you've got a FAR superior weapon to anything the splitblade will ever be.  You wasted a fucking augment, and you're gonna be crying as soon as you pull your head outta the clouds long enough to figure it out.<br />
<br />
I never said it wouldn't. However, this thread is not about which weapons out agro others but instead about one specific weapon.  <br />
<br />
Weapons do not exist in a vacuum genius.  You have to compare the efficiency of weapons to other weapons.  To make a splitblade an effective weapon, you have to augment it.  If you are going to augment a weapon, you can augment an ALREADY effective weapon, and make a better weapon.  It doesn't matter if weapons are &quot;cookie cutter&quot; or not, if they outperform other weapons, they will ALWAYS outperform them.  I'm sorry this is a shock to you, but anyone who knows what they're doing will pick a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; warrior with a Copper Hammer and a sword of the bloodsworn over any idiot that walks up to the group with a splitblade of destruction, I don't care what fucking augments you put on it.</div></div><hr />

Now Ive been a warrior on EQ for 5 years now and I think I know my job and I know it well.Ok, here is a FACT for you. MY wizard that I have been playing for 5 years a whole truckload of Time gear, over 300 AA, and all the good toys a wizard could ask for. There is no way I can even come close to going all out on a mob with my warrior tanking, even with clicky concussion pants after every nuke. Here's another FACT for you, MY warrior that I have also been playing for almost 4 years has vastly superior weapon than SBoD, CHoS, and SotB and both are augmented. There is no way I have enough agro, not ever close. His agro is very good, in most settings it is more than adequate, but there is no way a wizard could go all out nuking without fear having the mob turn.<br />
<br />
Here is the original post -<br />
Anyone have any personal experience/thoughts they would care to share of this weapon? please hehe The stats are nice and the dmg/dly is very nice, but will it hold agro ( will add an anger 3 proc if I decide to get it ) better than say SotBS.The question was NOT would he be able to hold agro with SBoD+A3, the question is would it hold BETTER agro than SotB. The fact still remains that SotB will hold better agro than SBoD, hands down its not even close. Advising someone to spend 100k on a weapon that would absolutely be a downgrade from the current weapon set up he has is a disservice to the person asking the qiestion.<br />
<br />
A quick look at his magelo suggests that the 100k he would blow on an SBoD would be FAR better spent getting upgrades where he needs then - BP, neck, ear, helm, mask all come to mind right off the bat. He could also upgrade gloves+cloak to end up with more unbuffed haste, AC, and HP. All for the price of a downgraded weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zito, the only reason you're not seeing superior damage with WMBS/WB is because you have so few AA's. The various offensive AA's improve 2-hander DPS more than they improve 1-hander DPS. <br />
<br />
My results mirror his, and I have plenty of AA's. Sceptre of Destruction and Copper Hammer of Striking beat the windblade with just melee, not to mention procs.  If it beats it with 46aa's, and beats it with CF3, Flurry 2, Fero 3, and whatever the hell else I got on my toon that I can't remember, then it's likely going to be competitive with more AA's.<br />
<br />
I have also parsed Ferocity, and you would have to twist my arm REALLY hard to make me believe that PB would increase 2h dps enough to overcome the gap.  You might be able to make a case for a full offensive AA'd warrior being able to outdamage his DW combo with a Windblade or some such, but in reality there are next to zero warriors with full offensive AA's who are still using a windblade, so the point is moot.  For your average 65 warrior with 50-100 aa's, there are dual wield combos that will take down the DPS of the overrated 2h's around here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i completely agree haass.  <br />
<br />
lets just look at something though :D <br />
<br />
unless youre either really rich, or are a raiding warrior, chances are you keep only a very few weapons and such in your bag to pull out for various things.<br />
<br />
1. aggro<br />
2. dps<br />
3. utility (snare/slow/gate)<br />
<br />
a SoD and CHoS will outdamage a windblade pretty handily.  the droga weapons give the windblade a run for the money and they're about even.  the easiest and most cost efficient choice for dps is a cheap, strong 2hander.   a WMBS, for the whopping prices of 6k will put out comparable dps to a 30k droga weapon set.  the gap noticable for your average runofthemill poor warrior.  i have money, but i still wouldnt waste 20k or more for a dps setup to use when i'm not looking for aggro.   as is, with my duel wield setup, i will finding myself pulling aggro off the MT fairly quickly with a short string of procs, so i need some sort of 2hander in my bag.  sure, it's dps isnt AS GOOD as my GBoS and droga combo, but i wont be fucking with the raid by making the MT lose aggro.<br />
<br />
the moral:<br />
1. get some sweet innately procing weapons and add aggro procs to them for aggro (or a sweet 2hander with innate aggro proc).<br />
2. get a greatstaff of four winds or wmbs ... or anything comparable, for when you have to ditch your aggro setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sold my SoZ and now use SoBS and CHoS both with procs ( i did not put anger procs into them because I am saving the points for when I win GBoS, lol 0-4 my time has gotta be soon )<br />
<br />
I spent the money on Kizraks greaves because my guild will not get into SolRo anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I have noticed better agro contrl with the 4 procs, the stun I think is what gets them and it stops spell casting. I feel my money was better spent with the leg upgrade, much better AC and unbuffed HP still hanging around 6k. But that aside the goal is to keep agro so group can do the dps and cleric can heal me.<br />

I went back and looked at my post, and the one I responded to.  I missed that he had a BOC in mainhand, and thought he was talking about CHOS/SOTB.  I agree with you and Zito.  My own dual wield DPS passed windblade DPS once I got a GBOS (14/18), and I don't think any AA's would have changed that.</div></div><hr />

Price of a weapon you can single group, or hell, even duo for that matter, should not be a consideration.  I've seen literally, probably 100 Copper Hammers and Bloodsworn's drop, it's not like you can't get them yourself.

Hehe, I remember when I first started searching for 2HB weapons to skill up, before I started visiting these boards, and seeing the GSoT at 500pp and freaking out, thinking it was awesome and someone must have underpriced it.  Then I scrolled down and saw others had them for sale for 150pp, 100pp, etc.  Then I saw the required level of 55 and I was only level 40ish at the time.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me add a few insights from someone who has weilded one for about 12-13 levels.<br />
<br />
in my low 50s it held agro just fine. what ive been finding out though is the higher the level the worse my agro situation becomes. and this coincides with the observation that the higher the level the more desparately i NEED to keep agro.<br />
<br />
my current situation at level 65 in normal ldon is that i can hold agro with SOME pingponging of a slowed mob most of the time by squandering almost all my endurance on incite. my split blade and hsagra are both augmented with inexpensive ldon augs. there are 2 things i CANNOT do very often at all. i CANNOT pull a mob off a wall or out of a doorway simply by backing up. i lose prox agro attempting that. the second thing i CANNOT do is switch targets to aid a groupmate without losing agro on the first target within a few seconds. there is also one thing my groupmates CANNOT do. they cannot chain cast during battle.<br />
<br />
they have to walk the fine line between agro and not being able use all the manna on the mission. during overpulls where pets offtank (lets say no mezzer) they CANNOT burn their manna on nukes to save the cleric from excessive healing needs.<br />
<br />
on named mobs for assasinate missions i pull my hair out worrying about losing agro. usually i keep it but when i dont its often tragic.<br />
<br />
therefore ....<br />
<br />
heading toward CHoS and SotBS with 2 angerIII augs. and yes ill drop my AC by a ton by giving up my 2 stat weapons. but i like the idea of groupmates being able smack down that mob really quickly. ill post in a few weeks (if this thread is still active) and let you know how life as MT has changed :)</div></div><hr />

Use Sit to your advantage.  Back out of combat to where you want he mob, and sit down.  He'll come.</div></div><hr />

I think you'll find a vast improvement over your existing situation, and maybe no need to buy a second augment, or maybe only Anger II for the second.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me, but I cringe at the thought of 1150 point augments proccing 1/minute languishing in the offhand.</div></div><hr />

SBoD is nothing more than a slightly upgraded horn of hsagra.  <br />
In most cases, I think I'd rather have a Horn of Hsagra. 10 STA, 15 more raw AC (35 vs. 20), a few less HP's that will be taken  care of handily by the +STA, and better cold saves. The SBoD's STR and DEX are things that are likely maxxed out (so is STA, I guess, but not always, especially for smaller race warriors when they are unbuffed). Plus the horn can be used by all levels of not only warriors but rangers, rogues, and sk's, whereas the SBoD is warrior-only and has a rec level of 56. They both have a single type 4 augment slot, so that's a wash.<br />
<br />
Yes, the horn is piercing, and yes, piercing caps 10 skill points lower than 1HS, but I think the AC difference makes up for that, plus the fact that the horn is one-third the price and much more resellable/twinkable (I know, twinks suck, but we all do it :p).</div></div><hr />

I hear people talking about getting SoBS/ChoS OR GSoT for aggro. Can someone tell my which of these 2 would provide the best aggro. I'd also like to know WHY and by how much one combo would out aggro the other. I've done searchs, but haven't found the answeres to this questions, I would like to know why I would use one combo over the other and just not be told which is better. I'm level 48 atm, but assume im lvl 55. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WHY <br />
<br />
Because the 2 1handers will proc more then the 1 2hander.<br />
<br />
and more procs = more agro<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Secmet</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so why is GSoT good then? As I understand it riposte damage doesnt come into much play until much later in the game and by that time, better aggro 2h weapons will be available to me. Why bother with the GSoT? Why did people pay 30k+ forone when it came out? I have all 3 weapons, just want to know why/when I would use one combo over the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people will swear up and down that their GSoT holds aggro over anything, but when you're working with 2 aggro procs instead of one, the chances of you getting one of them early on (when it matters) is higher with dual wield than it will be with 2h.  <br />
<br />
I haven't seen anything that defeats that logic.  The only thing people can bring against it is &quot;Well, I can't explain it, but it just feels more solid with a Greatstaff of Thunder.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont ever recall them 30k+ .. but, there were no Droga weapons and that weapon was perfect for the non raiding warrior.  <br />
<br />
also, was the first real time that a non raiding warrior ever saw a 2hander with better then a 1:1 ration WITH a proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The procs on those weapons are stuns, or stuns plus direct damage.  These stuns are the warriors bread and butter if you cant get a pure hate procing weapon, or anger augments.  The stuns are nice for aggro in the same way stuns are nice for aggro on a pally.  Thats why these weapons are worth it.  And the GSoT is stupidly common, you could probably pick one up for 100plat nowadays.  (GSoT is damn fugly though. pooper scooper anyone?)<br />
<br />
Really the riposte damage is more evident in PoP boss mobs, or the elementals.  The dual wield setup CHoS and SotB are probably more prefered over the GSoT though, due to the 2 procs over 1 proc of the GSoT.  Youll have a higher chance of getting that magic-always-sought-after proc with dual wield.  Add a yak or anger proc to them doubles the pleasure.</div></div><hr />

I loved the graphic on this and was sad to sell it.... Now I have the BoC graphic, which is a lot worse but the weapon is a lot better for agro. <br />
<br />
I mainhand a OSoW with Anger3 and offhand the BoC with Anger3 and have WA5.... I proc a lot.<br />
<br />
Its to bad we can't really use this weapon but the only rational advise here is to sell it. I got 80K for mine, its a nice weapon, and the graphic is almost worth it to have for photo oppotunities...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I paid an ass load (25k) for mine because it was much better than the rest of my gear at the time.  I believe I was using a CHSD and a Braided Strand of Corrupted Mana...and yes, the GSoT was a huge ass upgrade.  But not too long later I got a GBoS and the selling price of the GSoT had plummeted!<br />

Damn you SoE! =P</div></div><hr />

I offered the seller 30k, but he was firm at 35k.  I decided to pass on it for the time then, and 2 days later got lucky and got my BoC.  I ended up getting a GSoT to drop a couple of weeks later anyways.</div></div><hr />
