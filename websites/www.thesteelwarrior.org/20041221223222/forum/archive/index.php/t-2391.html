I made $$$ selling off my EQ stuff, I mean to the tone of 2G's+! I am tired of getting the shaft from the group of low IQ monkeys at SOE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Rumblingtroll should be banned if he posts about how he sold his warrior for lots of money one more time. He obviously has nothing significant to add to these boards and wants us all to quit our warriors to make his sell out attempt seem to mean something.<br />
<br />
You quit moron, you're not getting the shaft anymore remember? Ofcourse you are probably lying about that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just think it's funny how often you talk about all the cash money you got for your warrior. The dollar amount has actually gone up over time, even! You're like that little kid who keeps adding embellishments to his lies when no one cares or believes him. It's sad, really.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, stop trolling and stop talking about selling your warrior on PA or you'll be banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's pretty clear that nobody would miss Rumblingdeth if he was gone :p.  Seriously, shut up about the Ebay crap.</div></div><hr />

I bet you can get a good chunk of change by E-Baying your TSW account.... you should try it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you could make bajillions of dollars spamming you sold your account on EBAY!</div></div><hr />

He was so cool. He had blue eyes, long blonde hair and was a little more /cough equipted than any warrior before. he was at least 4 feet taller than anyother toon and could tri weild. He could use a flying kick and at times was known to pul an AK 47 out of his left leg armor and blow dragons away. <br />
