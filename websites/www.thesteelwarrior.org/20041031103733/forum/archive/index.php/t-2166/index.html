<br />
I'm trying to find some armor upgrades that give either Vengence or Aura of Battle.  I've been hunting the net, but haven't been very successful in locating a list of these items.  Can anyone link a website that can give me this list please?<br />
<br />
I have already tried EQlizer &amp; Allakazam's<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aratus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lucy's (http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?searchtext=aura+of+battle). Just hit the Vengeance/AoB type and it'll give you a full listing of items with that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do not buy them. Whatever you do. People overcharge for anything with Veng or aura effects by a ridiculous amount. Brittlebone Armguards (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=61206) were like 40-50k this week when I looked. Similar/better stat arms with no effect were 3-12k. So yer paying 30-40 THOUSAND plat for 5atk. It's retarded. That one Veng1 mask is the same way. 20-35k when similar stat masks can be had to 2k.<br />
<br />
 Cheapest AoB item you'll find is Lodi belt..uhh..Belt of the Great Turtle. Which is in the 20k range anyways generally. Other than that, quest for Chardok mantle thing is yer best bet. Personally I'd say not to worry about it too much, yer a warrior. Unless you pick up 100+ atk of items it's not gonna make a real significant impact on your performance.</div></div><hr />
