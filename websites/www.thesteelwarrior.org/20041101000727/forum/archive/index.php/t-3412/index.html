<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all-<br />
<br />
Something occured to me that might be interesting to test... follow the train of thought here-<br />
<br />
Situation: multiple weapons &quot;share&quot; the same proc, say enraging blow, like the BoC and the BF.<br />
Observation: BF procs quantitatively more often than a BoC (or other non-mod'ed weapon, which are all about 2.1 procs/min).<br />
Conclusion: this strongly suggests that the proc modifier is on the weapon, not the proc used.  Nothing new here.<br />
<br />
BUT... what about added procs?  For instance, what happens if you put an AUGUMENT PROC on a &quot;high proc&quot; weapon?  Does it share the increased proc rate, or not?  Has anyone parsed an upgraded BF yet and compared it with a BoC perhaps?<br />
<br />
I'm planning on doing this test w/ my BF eventually, but it won't be for a while, as I'm still working on 10ac and 40hp augs for my old gear...  I suppose I could nab a mirror 1 proc for 30pts and give it a test tho, maybe I'll try that 2nite.  I can also check with call of sky (buff proc) pretty easily (orb of sky) too while I'm at it...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

Added force of ykesha to my BF, and I can tell you it shares the same rate as the EB.  At work at the moment, so unfortunately I dont have any logs/parses to share.  I also put IcicleStrike in my BoC to play around.  Visually I can tell that the proc rate of the BoC affects the rate at which IcicleStrike goes off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">O very nice...<br />

Kinda makes augument selection for the enhanced proc rate weapons much more interesting doesn't it, especially ones that don't really need much more hate added to em...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A cleric friend augmented his super-proccing hammer with one of the DD augs.  The hammer's proc went off like crazy, the aug proc went off 2x per minute, just like a normal proc (during a 10 minute or so test).  I would have to see a parse to believe that augmenting a BF makes the aug'd proc go off more than 2x a minute.<br />
<br />
edit: oops sorry, i think 2proc a minute is the 2h weapon proc rate.  I'm not sure what it is for 1h weapon.  (close to 1 proc a minute?)  I think if a weapon is 1h or 2h it would definately make a difference as to how much the aug procced, but at least on the cleric hammer (from VZ), the aug proc rate was not enhanced by the innate weapon's proc rate.</div></div><hr />

I read somewhere that the weapon get &quot;checked&quot; for a proc, which in this case is EB, if it fails then it checks the Ykesha proc.  Or did I misunderstand?  I'm sure I read that somewhere, and just by watching the proc rate of the ykesha is very impressive.  But perhaps its just the rate the aug is supposed to proc.  I think im confusing myself the more i think about it.</div></div><hr />
