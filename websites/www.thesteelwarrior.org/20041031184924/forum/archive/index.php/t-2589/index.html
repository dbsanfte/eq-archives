<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swamptoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, my name is Tzim I'm a level 61 ogre warrior I just came back out of retirement about a month ago, I quit about 2 and a half years at level 58 right when Velious first came out but now I have gotten back into the game and realized I missed a lot, and I'm so outdated. When I restarted I was still in mostly indicolite other than the easy to come by Cobolt pieces, and a Berzerker BP which I got pretty close to when I quit.. I was always pretty awesome back then but now I feel totally outdated and inadequate. I have gotten some nice things in the last month but I'm still hurting I think.. All of my good gear that was no drop I gave away (or was stolen from guildies ) (cobolt bracer, fungi, RBB) when I quit.. but the point is, now that I'm replaying, and have missed so much I was wondering for any advice on where to pick back up, I have a magelo profile it is<br />
<br />
www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=719892<br />
<br />
any advice would be good.. I have mainly spent my time in PoP trying to get leveled back up and get flagged for zones, other than an occasional Veksar camp.. so I am not the richest ogre. Also not in my profile I have gotten a Dismembowler and some Ice Pick thing thats 10/20 with a frost proc.. and the staff in there on my profile. it was a big step up from the jade mace and club of the ice ocean I had.. but anyways, any advice I would love<br />
<br />
<br />
thank you<br />
tzim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wow, thats an oldschool profile!<br />
<br />
upgrade the indi bracers with Fierce Heraldic. those are quite pricy, but upgrades that will last some time as well<br />
<br />
Are you guilded yet?<br />
once for sure, your armor etc is good enough to tank in HoT, that should get you upgrades</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Swamptoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I rejoined my old guild (Only 2 people left that I know in it) but my name is pretty well remembered so it was no problem being let back in, it isn't the most uber guild but there is 30+ 65s on a night, usually in BoT which I can't hang with yet but soon.. halls of testing, I have never heard of this zone, whats it all about? I am currently allied with the giants but from what I hear nobody kills in West wastes anymore so I will probably switch to dragon faction.. an old ogre friend of mine is taking up smithing too so hopefully if he ever get high enough he can make some rallos zek armor. I haven't seen any of its stats but I heard it was comparible to myrmidons armor.. what is heraldic armor? its smithied? cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fierce Heraldic armor is Grandmaster made Rallos Zek Warrior (and brd) armor, better than Myrmidon in some pieces. HoT is where the Dragon allied people kill in ToV. However, if your guild was already doing Westwing when you quit, they most likely completely moved out of ToV. Your best bet is Ornate Armor then from various BoT nameds</div></div><hr />

<br />
that works hopefully</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fierce Heraldic is made by human smiths and is wearable by warriors and bards of Rallos Zek. It has slightly less AC than the ogre made RZ armor, and more hps. You can see the stats on a full suit minus belt in my Magelo.</div></div><hr />

magelo link is broke  <br />

but it shows the number, wow some ppl are lazy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Once you get dragon-allied, do the bracer of benevolence bracer quest twice, and the draconic pauldrons. These will be pretty significant hp/stam upgrades, and wont cost you a penny. Only takes a few people to do each of them as well.<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic Greaves, Boots, arms, gloves are the best pieces for you, they'll set you back 4-8kpp or so each though. Valorium Rings of Gallantry are nice, with lots of stats, but again, they're 4-5k each.<br />
<br />
You can MQ an Earring of the Solstice for around 4k, and check the bazaar for another cheap earring with decent hp on it. Same deal with a mask, just look for anything with decent ac along with stam/hp that's not too expensive. It is very very easy to find cheap upgrades in the bazaar, just spend a few days there getting to know the market well, and grab any upgrades if you see them cheap.<br />
<br />
Those upgrades should hold you until you get some better ntov or PoP drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're hunting in PoV you can probably pick up a metallic liquid and a razorfiend tallon.  Can just find a GM JCer to combine somes Valorium Rings of Gallantry for you.<br />
<br />
Can pick up a Clattering Bone Necklace relatively cheap, probably about 1.5kish.<br />
<br />
Can also do the Cloak of the Wise or Cloak of Pernicity quest.  Draconic Pauldrons and Bracers of Benevolence was a good suggestion.<br />
<br />
Also, once you get grouping in BoT you'll pick up some ornate.  Ornate bracer drops like crazy off of Thangbrand, Guakr drops the greaves and Eindride Icestorm drops the BP.  Elif drops the vambraces I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Peddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Remember Droga? It's been revamped. There are now two very good one-handed weapons dropping down there, called Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn. I've got the hammer and it's awesome, and I heard the sword is too (I just haven't gotten around to get it yet) - Both can be had with a single group of 50ish people (closer to 60 is recommended though) - or can be soloed by a couple of well-equipped 65's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As you replace some of your Indi armor there is a fellow in plane of tranquility you can turn it into for gems &amp; exp...its a nice part of the upgrading process ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can you turn in any quest (champs) armor to the guy in Pot for gems &amp; exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I made it to 65 and still had some Cobalt on me so you'll be ok eventually.  The weapon drops in Droga are nice, but you are in good shape with a GoT.  Also the Go4W off Auliffe in BoT is a nice, nice dps weapon (holds aggro pretty well too).<br />
<br />
For armor, hope to get lucky on Ornate or get cultural.  Since you are an RZ worshipper you have access to human and ogre cultural which is good.  A Vindi BP would be a nice upgrade and is not hard to get.  The Va'Dyn in Akheva is real easy and should be well within 30 60+ people's range, he drops a 100hp neck.  Iron Scream earring off the Terror Matriarch in PoN and the earring off Hreidar (lower mini in west wing BoT) are good options, as is the Solstice.  I'd leave the 6/65 rings for now, Valorium is nice but you have bigger needs than that.  Upgrade your face if you can, there should be a few cheap masks in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
