<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shoulders to FH, belt to RBG or something like that, arms to FH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could camp a Soulscream Belt in Veksar (or buy one, ballpark price should be 25k+ depending on server), it's 32% (?) haste, sta and some raw hp.<br />
<br />
Ornate arms and helm would be nice upgrades.  I know arms drop in BoT, and I've seen helm drop off one of the named Diakus (1 groupable) in Tactics.<br />
<br />
You look a little low on STA, might consider doing some LDoNs for the 10 sta aug (EC camp I think) or hope that a few +6 ones drop along your way.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you go to Veksar, get not only the Soulscream, but also hit the Nobles just past it and get Kylong Gauntlets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well since i first posted I have looted new arms on a raid. Tell me what you think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think that if your STA is regularly capped with raid buffs, you'll be infinitely happier with Fierce Heraldic Vambraces with 60 HP, than with Ancient Wyvern Hide Sleeves with 15 STA.<br />
<br />
Considering how my poor agnostic warrior has suffered through not being able to wear cultural armor, I can't imagine why your first purchase wasn't a full suit.  :-)  <br />
<br />
The FH gauntlets also give you an extra 8 raw AC, the FH shoulders give you 5 raw AC and 60 HP, the belt gives you 16 raw AC and 80 HP if you can get a haste item in another slot (try a CoF, they're not that expensive anymore), even the collar gives you 2 AC and 5 HP more.  Cultural armor shines particularly in the non-visible armor slots (neck, shoulder, waist).  But it's worth abusing in any slot.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also I havent gotten them fully yet, but i did loot a keal gaunts blank which I will in the next few days be working up faction to turn in for keal gaunts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive updated to the gaunts finally, I've been thinkning about getting a tak cloak and auging with an mm haste(36%) . When i get that cloak made I have an fh belt to fill up the new slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been a while since my last update.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always suggest LDON's.  I personally am wearing a set of 125 hp legs because of it.  Get the 1492 legs from tak and drop a 40 hp aug in also from tak.  It is alot of work but I personally found the ability to upgrade myself in LDON very rewarding.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You might try Horn Spiked shoulders (31ac) and Loyalist Shield of Honor (50ac)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You might hit up Plane of Mischief after the patch the 24th and see if you can get the shoulders and arms I have. Same AC, lot more HP. Be sure and read up on where they come from, shoulders are an easy camp, arms are much harder, but nothing sees invis besides named.</div></div><hr />
