The feedback was for make the thugs stop running forever like they are little boys when Michael Jackson comes around.  Did not get an in game response since I logged out shortly after but when I arrived at work and checked hotmail I found three emails from NCSoft.<br />
<br />
<br />
One was a copy of my feedback,  other was a confirmation that they received my petition/feedback and other was a response and not a copy/paste response either.<br />
<br />
I am pleased with the CS so far I hope they keep this level of customer service up for a long time.</div></div><hr />

This is typical of what I've heard of CS in CoH (I've not had an issue myself, yet).  And they respond often on the user boards, I've noticed.</div></div><hr />
