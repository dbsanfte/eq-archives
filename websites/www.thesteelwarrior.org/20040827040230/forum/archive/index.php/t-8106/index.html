<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">does anyone know how to view this file on a linux machine ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure anyone has made a player with windows codec, my best guess is no since someone would have to license the codec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you try mplayer? It's got a ton of codecs built in, and can even do wm9 if you install the windows drivers and get 'em set up (i haven't done that part). http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/news.html<br />
<br />
Theres a 'doze version too, which works pretty dang good as a free dvd player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Damn, that does look good.  I love how scripted the events seem, more roleplayish, instead of the mindless monotony of either it's chasing you unrelentlessly or it's not aggroed at all.  How the dragon knocks the players down, then taunts them vocally while they get back up, instead of the current attack the highest person on the aggro list till he's dead form we have in EQ1 now.  Breathes life into the NPCs, instead of the obvious computer controlled nodes that we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The more I see, the more I understand just how much EQ lost by losing those developers. Just look at the zones, they breath life. You can tell the art isn't simply cut and paste, but a labor of love. I hope they can continue that sort of commitment when they go live. I'll aleast give the game a good long try when it comes out. heck I'll probably end up staying because my friends are planning on moving to it when it comes out. All my RL friends left EQ about a year ago, got burnt out. They moved to DAoC, I didn't, but we all agree it isn't the same. They would have come back to EQ, but its so horrible to casual players, which is why they quit. if they stay on EQ2, I'l probably end up moving over myself.<br />
<br />
I hope it better than SWG, but then again, SWG is nothing more than an early EQ2 engine failure they decided to brand for Lucas. i don't remember being quite as excited by the screenshots and art from the game either before it was released. I was mostly drawn by the staw wars theme, i thought i could be cool, but somehow the fun got lost. The game is pointless. The push PvP, but PvP blows on that game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I REALLY REALLY hope that SOE can pull through on this one and I think they can, they (the org devs) did it with org EQ, I think they can do it again.</div></div><hr />

Dang, that's purty.  It looks to me that the bump mapping on the skin is about right (was a pet peeve of mine), and I loved the formation marches and exercises.  As they boasted, it really brought the city to life.  The fighting looked reeeeaaaalllly good, too.<br />

Dam* them! :p</div></div><hr />
