What method is most often used on TRC and how?Was up for tank mezzing a council member the other day and did have a problem sveral minutes into it with the cleric being summoned a couple times, but was able to re-establish aggro after that and personally didnt have any trouble,but some others did.<br />
Dmg was pretty gimp on the hits, just not many misses etc.<br />
Is root tanking a better option or do warriors just need to get out there and take the hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No damage tanking is teh win. It also can't be done with a warrior. Knights are by far the best tanks for the nonmezzable councilmen due to them being able to keep solid agro while not doing any damage. They can keep a councilman right at 1% with ease.</div></div><hr />

since incite, wrong, just dont keep attacking ;p. <br />
<br />
But usally ppl take knights.</div></div><hr />

All about what resources you got. We dont have SK pullers or Necros, Dont have many knights or tanks or clerics for that fact so cant Tankmezz 5 like most. All 4 tanks were around 9k buffed and had 0 problems holding agro</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't have problems holding aggro with melee mezzing unless someone is dropping big heals and sitting, or goes low health from the DoT.<br />

Low damage, good aggro. I've tank mezzed council members for quite a while. Mabey even two gnoll whips. This was before incite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
before incite, gnoll lariots like the poster said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With DMG I was referring to what the councilman was hitting me for.As a coincidence I just happened to be running around SP with an alt and got one of those Gnoll lariats so Ill pop that in and give it a try.<br />
Yeah root tanking cant be done with a Warrior,was wondering if its used more often than sticking the superior meatshields up there</div></div><hr />

We use a mix of wars/pals/sks and haven't really had any problems with summoning for awhile, most of our kills were also before incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urgetakill da Ogur</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trick to warrior offtanking is to let your warrior tank him from the start. At around 8-10% have everyone get off him, and move on to the next rathe. And let the warrior melee it down to 1% then switch to aggro shield, and incite. Thats what ive done on all the Rathe's ive offtanked and ive never had a problem with aggro. Also if you have decent HP, around the mid to upper 9000's, use Evasive once your first Defensive runs out. It has lower reuse, and it is just effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can just like melee them to 1% and then attack off, melee only when evasive is up (to reduce your own DPS).  Also take off any haste items etc so you can get more procs per swing.  Not particularly difficult even without Incite as long as you don't have to tank one for 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montagor</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We always use warriors to tank mezz for that encounter.  I've never had an issue with agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We always let our knight get punished by thes uglies.  They damage the mob with DS or some hits .. but normally we have a second tank (warrior) for the worst case who is only there to keep the mob at 1 % and to build up enough aggro if shit happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tanked these before the incite/spell line thing was added with no problems too! :rolleyes:  Aggro isnt difficult with the right strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior tanked almost all our TRC. (didnt redo since Incite)<br />
<br />
1H+Shield + VoT  &amp; Cleric Camping = zero agro issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">like i said with incite done 2 times now every tank was barely 9khps, 1 had BoW rest had subpar weaps. 0 problems ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skycrasher</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've always used Warriors to Tank Mezz.<br />
<br />
I usually use BoW until about 2%, then switch over to Aegis of the Earth + random 1HS and take it to about 1%, use incite when needed, and /defensive when needed.<br />
<br />
I've only died once on the encounter, I've had the cleric summoned once though, but that was because when we first tried it, I tried running back out of his range, and letting him summon me to see if that'd be a viable way to avoid some of his DPS. Heh. :p</div></div><hr />
