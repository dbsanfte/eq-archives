<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I had some ideas on other new classes that could/should be coming down the pipeline in the next few years:<br />
<br />
1- The Green Knight. The first hybrid of a hybrid. This class will have all the stun capabilities of a paladin, as well as all the DoT, snare and pure hate casting capabilities of a shadowknight. They will also have Gawain Bane damage innate, and will be immune to decapitation. Unfortunately, they will also have to spend some time, once they achieve their class title, being a QUEST GIVER to a lower level Knight class.<br />
<br />
2- The Battle Mage. They will have all the nuking power of their wizard parent class, combined with all the sword-wielding ability of their ranger parent. They will have more effective heals than druids. They will cast effective self-only hp/mana regen spell. They will not have to eat. They will be able to snare, and will have &quot;rampage&quot; as an innate skill, from level 5 on. They can wear plate mail. They will receive bigger 2h weapon bonuses than all other classes. Their epic will be the first dual click weapon. It will have a 1 second cast time &quot;aggro&quot; generation spell/unresistable DD/Lifetap ... OR it will have an instant click gate spell. The Battle Mage chooses, by holding their shift key (or not) when clicking their mouse.<br />
<br />
3- Ninja. At the drop of a spoon, the ninja class will be able to flip out and cut peoples' heads off. All mammals will be able to become ninjas. Their epic will be the sepuku frisbee. And their newbie tunic will be able to be worn on the head as a ninja mask, with a slight adjustment.<br />
<br />
ALSO ... new upcoming races ...<br />
<br />
Undead<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Minotaurs!<br />
<br />
And of course, the new Beserker class' EPIC is already in production. I'm sure many of you prospective young beserkers out there will be thrilled to hear about the ongoing development of this wonderful weapon, called, SWORDCHUKS (yo!)<br />
<br />
That is all.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Damn, misspelled swordchuks. Stab me now black mage!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how bout a fighter that can heal..... wait a minute.... nm<br />
<br />
tell you this much, next race will have tits, it is a proven selling point :D<br />
<br />
and there WILL be a bug that makes everyone nude at first like they had with luclin ( i still beleave that was intentional to get the perv's to buy in)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want a fucking Dragoon sirs.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah yeah ... we want a Supermodel Class too, where you get innate Charm Abilities and Charisma scores. And there should be an &quot;inflate chest&quot; ability too, so one could really show off.<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and it should offcourse be able to Tank like a warrior, nuke like a wizard and heal like a Cleric, and wear skimpier armor than Halfelves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">new message in the patch<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">boobies !! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Boobs &gt; all.<br />
<br />
That having been said, I would like to flip out and cut some devs heads off.  Show them what realultimatepower is really like.  Honestly, balance the existing classes before you develop a new one guys. How damned hard is that to grasp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by Anker steadfast <br />
boobies !! :D <br />
I concur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would like to play an Undead as a class.  I think that would be pretty cool to play a undead SK and walk around all...dead like and stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OK, what'd make EQ worth coming back to....<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Dragoon <br />
2. Geomancer (Think Earth Magic)<br />
3. Sorcerer (Enchant Sword with elements)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I want to be an Akhevan (or whatever those 4 armed guys are called) warrior with quad weild.  I will use a Bloodfrenzy, a Hatebringer, a Blade of Carnage, and a Great Blade of Storms all at the same time.  I will put anger 3 on all of them of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i wanna be an evil_eye...just float around charming n00bs to kill their groupmates and just blink</div></div><hr />

*drum rolls*<br />
<br />

Get's everybody eventually and I have yet to see anyone get him.... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone remember Project M?<br />
<br />
What a fun day...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i do, wonder why they cut it so fast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Marglok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I want to see Orcs or Vampires.<br />
<br />
Turn Mistmoore into a city, and have Vampires in it.<br />
<br />
They'd look so cool in armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;Hello, Aten Ha Ra, what nice boobies you have!&quot;<br />

Aten Hoochie Ra!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;And then you got riposted and died !&quot;<br />
<br />
Naw, this isn't really a problem until you get into the elemental planes.  I use GBoS and CHoS in all the pre-elemental planes and riposts are really not an issue.  When my Akhevan got to elemental planes, I would just equip a BoW and an Anathema (with anger 3 on both of course).  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh ... BoW + Vanazir, both with augments - Now there would be a nice Damage / aggro combo. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rashnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">New race should be mushroom man with a city in inny swamp. :D <br />
