<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for Shoulder and a new back item i guess. Doing Nro LDoN's for that BP there, any other suggestions? Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm no help? I know it gets repititous, but i'd really like to get a few weakspots fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL, wish I was that well equiped at level 55 :).  The Tak BP is nice, when OoW comes out there should be some new LDoN pieces.  Might find a better Shoulder then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates or Strength of the Elements quest. Loyalist Shield quest. Ornate Gaunts for clickie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm. I think you're really well geared at the moment for level 55.<br />
I'd seriously consider surveying your guildmates/guildmate's alts and seeing if they need any help with their gear/quests.<br />
Short of that, level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe upgrade the fingers, steel ring of earthen resillance(sp?) would be beter then the valor. Ear symbol of the Veteran and  Tear of the Rainmaker would be slight upgrades. I personally would get a LDoN bracer and then get an ornate BP and then destroy the ornate bracer...or maybe get a crystalized acid bracer if you have the plat/resources for that.<br />
<br />
It depends on how much plat you have to play with and/or what resources are avaliable. Your gear is not hurting one bit. I'd worry more about getting to 65 ASAP then grab those AAs then I would I about gear.</div></div><hr />

Thanks all for the advice. I got two Steel Rings of earthen Resiliance. And have been doing as many North Ro LDoN's as i can to get that BP/Bracer's combo. I passed on getting the Tear and Symbol ear pieces only because what i have now has better stats all around other than HP on em. <br />
<br />
Picked up a BoC, and am now wondering what to offhand with it?<br />
<br />
I mean do i use my SoTB or my CHoS in my offhand? I usually switch out the SoTB for my CHoS when fighting caster mobs. I notice a slight increase in stuns when i do this, and keep the caster off balance a little more often than not. <br />
<br />
Well as always any info is good info.</div></div><hr />
