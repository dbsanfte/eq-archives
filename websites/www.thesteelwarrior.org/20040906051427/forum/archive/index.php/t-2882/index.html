<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slyson Dycson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there was a thread on the old board about what music people listen to when on raids to get pumped, but I am looking for some updated lists.  The music I have is nice, but once you listen to it for weeks on end, you need new stuff.  I an getting strapped for idea as to what else I can add to my collection and was wondering... what do YOU listen to?<br />
<br />
Am really just looking for ideas as I am slow to catch up on music news to find the good people.  So, list some raid music to get you going.  Currently I have on a short list, Godsmack, Powerman 5000, System of a Down, Slipnot, etc. all various songs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Arch Enemy, Nile, Slayer (Reign in Blood is probably the single angriest album ever produced.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slayer or Pantera works well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Led Zeppelin... Achilles Last Stand is a 10 minute song (or so), good for long raid encounters. I personally enjoy the guitar solo ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't listen to any CD that lasts less than 75 minutes when i'm playing EQ, getting up to change discs happens way too quickly when you're not paying attention to the music.<br />
<br />
I've been listening to Slayer for like 12 years now, and they're easily the best metal band in the world, but 30 minute CD's are just not the way to go for immersiveness in EQ.<br />
<br />
Rammstein's live album is 79 minutes long, as are basically all of Type O Negative's CD's.  What you lose in pure rage you gain in convenience :)</div></div><hr />

VT raids made me switch to louder stuff for a while, too easy to fall asleep in vt :p<br />

I usually slot in my industrial mp3 playlist, but it's not always aggressive. It's usually individual songs that get me really going, such as Kid Rock: Bawitaba... oh, just dawned on me that my Master of Puppets CD has been collecting dust! Great aggressive music on that one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I sometimes listen to music, but more often I will hook the laptop up and put in Gladiator, Lord of the rings, Spartagus, Braveheart, or some off the wall comedy flick :)<br />
<br />
But for music I am in to the older stuff, Metalica, Guns and Roses, Journey, whatever gets me feeling better really, not just the hard stuff maybe the sappy Barney song, it seems to always make me want to kill something :)</div></div><hr />

dubble bass, loud gutar, vocals you cant understand  <br />
<br />
launchcast owns for raids, no changing cd's or anything, just a comercial everyonce in a while, and some song they toss in to advertise it. my station (http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/station.asp?u=1278196706)  if you don't want to program your own station. i went on a rateing binge so some country or rap might sneak in that i accedently clicked over 70 on.<br />
<br />
also some carlin and foxworthy for entertainment.<br />
<br />
works best with broadband dialup might suck. as far as i know dont need to be a yahoo member to listen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On many ships we have sailed<br />
Far beyond the north waves<br />
On the high northern seas<br />
We have found our way<br />
The shadowing voices of our gods<br />
Singing on the calling winds...<br />
Where the cold waves and the longboats brought us far<br />
The saga of the warriors from northland<br />
Speaks of greatness and strength<br />
The saga of the warriors from northland<br />
Are the saga of many great a man<br />
<br />
On seas against the open<br />
We travelled on and on<br />
Through the raging winds<br />
And storms we arrived<br />
The shadowing voices of our gods<br />
Singing on the calling wind...<br />
Where the cold waves and the longboats brought us far<br />
With sword in hand I now stand<br />
On my enemies land<br />
With a northern heart<br />
I will fight until the day I die<br />
<br />
My time will be remembered my time it will be known<br />
By my sons by my tribe and by the sun the sea and moon<br />
<br />
For the who battle for his land his pride and for his men<br />
Shall be remembered and stand eternally named<br />
In the legends of our land<br />
<br />
Breathing in winds...<br />
From the essence of a roaring horizon<br />
Breathing in winds...<br />
From the cold sea call the shores of the north<br />
<br />
Immortal- Beyond the North Waves<br />

a must have for any barb warrior. heck any warrior</div></div><hr />

We come from the land of the ice and snow,<br />
<br />
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.<br />
<br />
The hammer of the gods<br />
<br />
Will drive our ships to new lands,<br />
<br />
To fight the horde, singing and cry:<br />
<br />
Valhalla, I am coming!<br />
<br />
On we sweep with threshing oar,<br />
<br />
Our only goal will be the western shore.<br />
<br />
Ah, ah,<br />
<br />
We come from the land of the ice and snow,<br />
<br />
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.<br />
<br />
How soft your fields so green,<br />
<br />
Can whisper tales of gore,<br />
<br />
Of how we calmed the tides of war.<br />
<br />
We are your overlords.<br />
<br />
On we sweep with threshing oar,<br />
<br />
Our only goal will be the western shore.<br />
<br />
All Barbarians gotta listen to that before a raid starts...kinda like the national anthem or sumthin....<br />

To me, you can't spell crap without rap.....just imo. Mainstream rap, yes. But some rap is good. The Roots, Talib Kweli, Tribe Called Quest,Jurassic 5, etc.<br />
<br />
And I forgot to include GWAR, what the hell is wrong with me. Nothing better than listening to Have You Seen Me right before the pull, then right as you engage, you hear the &quot;Have... you.. seen........ *high pitched wail* MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Great times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gumdaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">A little bit of everything, but mostly sound-tracks from movies and games.  I dont like my concentration to be broken having to listen to people talking.<br />
<br />
Aint nothing like breakin out the old Final Fantasy 1 tunes for busting your way into some place.  Gurugu Volcano, and the ever faithful battle theme.  =D</div></div><hr />
