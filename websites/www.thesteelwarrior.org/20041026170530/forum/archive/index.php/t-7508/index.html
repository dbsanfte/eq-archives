<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild seems to be confused about planar projection spawn times.  So does anyone know for sure how long these stay up?  Part of the guild thinks that once a projection is hailed, it starts a timer giving you just a few minutes to finish all hails before it despawns.  So after we take down a boss, the shouts go out of &quot;Don't hail the projection yet!&quot;  The problem is that if it's not hailed for a few minutes, we've seen it despawn and NO ONE gets flagged.  <br />
<br />
So what's the real behavior of the projection?  How long do you have once it's hailed?  How long do you have if you don't hail it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
  This is incorrect. The timer starts from when it spawns. I don't know how long they last, though I'd guess from 5-10 minutes as an estimate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For all PP I have seen they have lasted 10 min max. However, the gnome in PoI seems to hang around for at least 30 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anybody have some logs or other documentation to back this up? the open raiding chumps on my server have recently taken up the battle cry that the timer starts on first hail and gotten really pissy about it. I'd rather not got into a shouting match over it without solid documentation behind me.<br />
<br />
They're also convinced that double hailing &quot;wastes&quot; flags.<br />
<br />
Intuitively I'm 99% sure both of these are fable, but it IS eq...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two very different issues.<br />
<br />
I do believe that, if you hail and get a yellow &quot;you have received a flag&quot; line, then a flag is indeed consumed -- whether you needed it or not.<br />
<br />
The fact that planar projections can poof after a typical duration, whether anyone hailed or not, seems to refute the idea that there is a timer which begins at the first hail.<br />
<br />
Planar projection durations simply seem to be unpredictable.  It is never, ever safe to assume that the projection will last more than 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Double hailing doesn't waste them afaik, except on the carprin cycle.<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
<br />
Why does the carprin cycle only spit out 36 flags? Makes no sense at all. Every other PP in the game gives 72 minimum.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Because they want some noob to die on Enrage to the 2nd Boss so you can wipe from thousands of Skeletons  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got screenshots of the most mobs I've ever seen in one place from that one.  :D  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.  I wonder where this idea that the first hail starts a timer is coming from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Double hailing doesn't waste them afaik, except on the carprin cycle.<br />
<br />
  Actually, I'm 99% sure double hailing ALWAYS wastes flags. The key is that most PPs have a 72+ flag limit, so you have to have a full raid or a full raid+ doing a new mob to ever notice.<br />
<br />
  The very fact that PPs can despawn without ANYONE getting flagged should show that you don't need to hail it to start the timer. If you wipe while finishing a mob, the PP doesn't stay up indefinitely; it despawns, normally before you can get CR'd.</div></div><hr />

I'm missing something here. Does it allow you to get the &quot;you received a character flag&quot; text multiple times? At what point would it STOP allowing you to get it, if it allows you to hail more than once and get it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Yes and as far as I know, never. This means, in theory, someone could hail again and again and use up a PP fully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It varies from projection to projection.  Some stay up a long time, others (RZ for example) are relatlively short.  Some definately have a limit to the number of flags (EarthB flag for example) and some others don't seem to.<br />
<br />
General rule of thumb should be: Kill the boss mob, kill any remaining adds, start rezzes, go hail while rezzes are happening.  This ensures the adds actually get killed, people aren't as stir crazy and don't double hail, and the dead don't bitch about people getting flags while they're dead and no one is rezzing.<br />
<br />
The first hail does NOT start some sort of count down timer.</div></div><hr />
