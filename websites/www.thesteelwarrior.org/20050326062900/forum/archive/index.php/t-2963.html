<br />
My guild just attempted Agnarr and we wiped to Skyfury.  I was wondering if someone who has done this mob before could help me out with some advice?<br />
<br />
We tried to have someone tank him away from everyone else but his AE was still hitting everyone even far away from him...<br />
<br />
What do you guys do to control his AE's?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bractos</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">His AE is directional.  Hits his front arch,  keep him turned away.<br />
<br />
Charm as many of the comets as you can and use them against him.   Otherwise kill all the adds first while he is kept MT'd.  You will need someone to chain greater remove curse on your MT to keep him cured of the slow that skyfury proc with his AE.<br />
<br />
Killing all the adds first is pretty much the strategy for the entire Agnarr encounter, otherwise you have bad problems with low health aggro by the adds on your MT's or heal aggro on your chain and they will get smashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no directional AEs in the game. This has been discussed endlessly. Do a little research.<br />
<br />
His AE is 20 range, targetted. Meaning it radiates from the MT and is fairly short range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karthunk</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your people were getting hit with the AE then they were not &quot;far away&quot;. Here is a basic guide line to killing him.<br />
<br />
- Only use one MT, and no one else attacks in melee range (ie ranged and spell attacks).<br />
<br />
- Charm ALL of the adds and put them on him. They do great dmg, transfer aggression to the MT, and are super easy to hold.<br />
<br />
- His curse AE is on a 30 second or so timer, have a caster cast greater remove curse on the MT when he gets slowed.<br />
<br />
That's basically it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RGC on  MT for his proc which roots you, secondly u can either have smart peeps attack max range from back, or just have people use arrows. Once you RGC and have melee on back hes real weak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have PBAE (radiate from the mobs base) and you have targeted AE (radiate from the person with agro, i.e. being cast on). No frontal Aes in game that I know of. If there are show me the spell data please.<br />
<br />
Now.. Skyfury is a royal pain in the butt however if you think about it and fight him smart he becomes rather trivial.<br />
<br />
He has 2 AEs. ONE AE is storm comet (targeted AE 30 range, 90 slow and 3,000 damage, 36 curse last an hour, cure it fast). This is the Raid wiper AE and the one you MUST control if you hope to win. Basically keep Skyfury far away (can pin on wall since you can't fall off his platform) Keep tank out in front of Mob and healers at max range from tank and you will never see that 3k ae on anyone other than tank. Keep RGC chain casted on your tank or he looses agro and you all die.<br />
<br />
The other AE has a larger range and hits for 1500 points (name escapes me) so that is what you are being hit with from far away and even that AEs range is smaller than heal range so you can avoid it.<br />
<br />
Keep everyone away from the MT anyway you can. Either melee from sides and back or range him down using single tank. Both work, up to you<br />
<br />
Good luck and there is nothing I said here that you wouldn't learn after 2 runs at him so nothing super secret.</div></div><hr />
