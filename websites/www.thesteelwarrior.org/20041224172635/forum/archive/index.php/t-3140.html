<br />
It appears to me to be a very good place to get feedback to the dev'son warrior balance issues, among others.<br />
<br />
Figured i'd share the link.</div></div><hr />

I'll be visiting that link when I get home so that I can once again let them know just how I feel about the direction the devs have taken in the past several months.</div></div><hr />

Greetings! The Entire Melee Community would appreacite an ETA on the Melee Balance Issues. Or an ETA on the ETA. On an ETA on the ETA on the ETA. Or anything other then a &quot;we are looking at it&quot; and a cut and paste of the old message with a new date.<br />
<br />
Issue- Warriors tank almost as well as Paladins/Shadowknights. This needs to be fixed! Paladins and Shadowknights need a massive Mitigation and Advoidance Upgrade!<br />
<br />
Issue- Some high end rogues can nearly match a slightly lower wizards DPS, assuming the wizard doesn't have a full spell set. Wizards need an inherent Improved Damage 4 that stacks with item effects.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time!<br />

Couldn't think of a smart ass comment for monks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I agree on the wizards needing some sort of innate impoved damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what we need is an organized letter of complaint outlining what we think is wrong, what we want done to fix it, and when we expect to begin to see changes.  <br />
<br />
It would be nice to sticky it at the top of the rants forum and the war room. Someone in here started a short list of things, thats a good starting point. <br />
<br />
here is an outline for such a letter:<br />
----------<br />
Dear EQ Dev Team,<br />
&lt;A paragraph outlining the last 2 years and how we have been slowly becomming more and more unbalanced.&gt;<br />
<br />
Specifically we have these problems:<br />
&lt;yada yada yada, list them here and describe  just why they are a problem&gt;<br />
<br />
We would like to see those problems resolved as well as these upgrades:<br />
&lt;list just what it is that we want&gt;<br />
<br />
We would like to see these issues resolved before the end of 2003. Many in the warrior community are dissatisfied with EverQuest as it is, so much so that they are considering other gamming options and have vowed not to play any further SOE produced games, specifically EQ2. &lt;Insert personal message on how you will move on, cancel your account, blow up soe headquarters, what ever&gt;<br />
<br />
Unhappily,<br />
Joe Warrior<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
Of course that is just an example but a few hundred of those with the exact same description of the problems and solutions and we might become a priority for them.<br />
<br />
Likely not, I'm not gonna try to fool anyone, cause really they don't give a rats ass so long as you pay your money to them.</div></div><hr />
