EoE is better than Fleshbiter (better proc and better hate from dps, but lesser dps).<br />
JOS is better than Fleshbiter (a bit less proc hate but better hate from dps, and better dps).<br />
a BBotE as better swing-hate production and better proc hate generation (lesser hate per proc but much better proc number), even if it has much less dps.<br />
a BoC, a Hategiver, a BF are all better than the Fleshbiter on long fight but have lower swing-hate production for short fight, and of course much less dps.<br />
a DBotW has lower swing-hate per minute than a Fleshbiter but blow it on proc hate, and lesser dps.<br />
but a FB is better than a GBoS.<br />
<br />
Remember than the hate generated from weapon swings is close to it's min domage so (DM+DB)/DL create a grid to class weapon by their swing-hate generation (but it doesn't give the exact hate production so it can't be compared to proc's hate nor 2Her swing hate because there is a bigger impact of the DB, but as it's constant for all 1Her the formulla is correct for them only!!!).</div></div><hr />

from my experience the dbow and fleshbiter aggro are very similar with a short advantage to dbow, they often compete for aggro on trash mob and it happens that they have very similar aggro. The fleshbiter look really sux imo but thats another story ^^<br />

i would add that fleshbiter auged with anger overaggro my BoW without too much prob, no way that a boc overaggro a fleshbiter</div></div><hr />

<br />
any aggro weapon when auged with A3 become a very strong and powerfull aggro generator.<br />
the swing-hate generation is biger on the Fleshbiter than on the DBoW so it's better for short fight as trash.<br />
all of this was already in my post on easy to get, more over the JOS is better swing-hate generator than the two above so sure for trash it helps alot.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : hooo, and about the BoC/Fleshbiter, FB proc is 38%  less aggro and FB swing-hate is 10% better than a BoC, so it's just a question of time before the BoC out aggro the FB. As I said, they are better on long fight, not in short one (trash).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are mis informed on a lot of things Yoda.  <br />
<br />
Fleshbiter &gt; Eoe, Substantially interms of aggro and dps.<br />
Fleshbiter &gt; Jos in dps and aggro <br />
FB &gt; Bbote , boc , hg , bf by a big margin as well.  <br />
<br />
People dont give Fb enough credit in terms of the amount of agro it generates.  I find its very close to DB in terms of agro.  It's an amazing weapon.  If you can get a Dbotw by all means go for it.  If not . you seriously wont be disappointed with a Fleshbiter.</div></div><hr />

At the high end, everybody maintains swing aggro &gt;&gt; all but the &quot;formula's&quot; aren't consistent with that.<br />
<br />
Most high-end peeps seem to think fleshbiter is a viable alternative to a DB and isn't entirely outclassed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in which circonstence? as I said FB is better for short fight, but after 3+minutes I doubt the FB to be close to the DB. If not then this means that there is an aggro mod by weapon that is not listed on Lucy. because FB's proc is close to CHoS's proc (not that great compared to DBotW), so the question is &quot;is the swing-hate&quot; diff big enougth for mke up this behaviour on long fight (not multiple short).<br />
<br />
you seriously wont be disappointed with a Fleshbiter.<br />
<br />
of course, but have you meet anybody that went from JOS/EoE to FB/JOS and feel an improvement ?</div></div><hr />

In any circumstance, Fleshbiter will have no problems.  Long fights or short.  Fb's proc is not really close to ChoS. There is no agro mod on FB, it produces alot of dps coupled in with its proc, is huge agro.  I personally upgraded from EoE to Fb.  It was a night and day difference when i started using it.  EoE and JoS are along the same lines of agro, FB owns them both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are contering yourself on this post.<br />
1. proc<br />
FB proc = stun(3.00 sec/65) + 125DD<br />
CHoS proc = stun(0.00 sec/55) + 175DD<br />
EoE proc = stun(0.00 sec/68) + 150DD<br />
so if stun hate is constant no matter its power (lvl max and duration) then FB proc is less aggro tha EoE proc is less aggro than CHoS proc.<br />
but perhaps that, since the last parse, dev changed the hate generated by stun to take into account their power.<br />
<br />
2. DPS<br />
FB vs EoE vs JOS ratios (pick the one you want I don't care they give all the same result)<br />
20/20 &lt; 34/30 &lt; 29/25<br />
20/20 &lt; (1+34)/30 &lt; (1+29)/25<br />
(34+13)/30 &lt; (20+13)/20 &lt; (29+13)/25<br />
(1+34+13)/30 &lt; (20+13)/20 &lt; (1+29+13)/25<br />
(x*20+13)/20 &lt; (1+x*34+13)/30 &lt; (1+x*29+13)/25 with x an integer biger than 1<br />
....<br />
JOS is better dps than FB.<br />
<br />
2. swing hate<br />
the formula that has been parsed by diferent class is :<br />
swing_hate = Total_none_ban_domage + Domage_bonus * Mod<br />
with mod being class dependent.<br />
but since you don't trust the parses on swing_hate you don't accept that 10*swing_hate/Hasted_DL give the minimum swing_hate by second (not counting DA, TA, Flurry, Ripost,...) <br />
so you refuse to see that even if FB is great DPS it isn't Theoritically great swing hate.<br />
<br />
3. conclusion<br />
all the math give you wrong, but if you want to keep the last word you have to say that the swing_hate formula is wrong (and you did). and even so, whatever it is, the dps section shows that JOS is better than FB in any ratio, formula, etc... but you keep that FB owns EoE and is equivalent to DB. The only way to give you right is to add a weapon dependent mod to artificially pump up FB hate, but you said there isn't so you kill your own proposition. or to say that the difference between BF and JOS is within the proc difference but you can't pump up stun hate because it would just help EoE, so you have to gimp the debuff hate but doing so you gimp  Obsidian Scimetar of War, Which is said to be equivalent or better than a GBoS. But this later statment can be achieve only by a little diff of proc or a weapon mod hate in the swing_hate formula. Again you kill yourself.<br />
<br />
so you end up to be obliged to use a different formula for the swing_hate from weapon tto weapon, thus using a weapon mod in it. But you said it doen't exist, thus your post is incoherent.<br />
<br />
<br />
CQFD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note : your only backup now, that I have destroy all your positions, is a infield proof, ie a parse that can proove that FB is equivalent to DBotW and thus far better than EoE and JOS. <br />
<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : I agree that the swing_hate formula isn't accurate in the form of DM + DB*Mod with Mod being between 1.2 and 1.4 (without any EoA or VoT mod) because if it's true than at mod 1.2 we end up (at 130% haste and WA5) and FB hate being between the one of CHoS and SotB, and at Mod=1.4 we have FB being under both of them. but as I prooved, whatever the formula is, as long as there is no weapon mod, the FB can't win vs JOS or EoE.</div></div><hr />

SUMMARY<br />
Darkblade absolutely wipes the floor with it in terms of agro. On blue con, low resistance mobs the Fleshbiter will result in 10-15% less incoming damage due to the stuns.<br />
<br />
I'd go with the Darkblade every single time if you have the choice. If you don't have an option to get a DB, the FB is a reasonable substitute, but there's a clear difference in terms of agro, and the stats are too close to diffferentiate between.<br />
<br />
GO DARKBLADE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing you do have to remember is that although the difference look large, they're also only one part of the equation.<br />
<br />
Darkblade: TOTAL AGRO=1838 melee + 2366 raw + 364 DD + 3.64 stuns<br />
Fleshbiter: TOTAL AGRO: 2004 melee + 350 DD + 2.8 stuns<br />
EoE: TOTAL AGRO: ( 2136 melee , 420 DD , 2.8 stuns )<br />
JoS: TOTAL AGRO: ( 2188 melee , 168 DD , 2.8 debuff )<br />
<br />
Add in 2 procs of Anger3 per minute and you have 1200 more hate on any weapon from primary hand. Then you also have a 0.6 modifier (approx) from offhand dps/proc to add to the total. This brings down the generated agro gap to a much smaller percentage of the whole. Add in a few incites, and the gap's even smaller. ( eg: If I've got a pie and you've got half a pie, I've got twice as much as you. If we're both given 9 more whole pies, I've only got 5% more than you. Mmmm pie...) Also, noone's sure exactly WHAT the Echo of Anger effects - everything, just procs, just melee?<br />
<br />
Noone wants to think they've bought a lemon, and Fleshbiter is certainly not that. It's a solid mainhand tanking weapon in the same ballpark as Darkblade, but it's definitely behind it. JoS is most definitely ahead of EoE too.<br />

 Im curious if you have had any personal expierence with Any of the weaps mentioned?  You seem pretty steadfast on claiming EoE &gt; FB.  I have both, parsed both, Non aug'd , Aug'd , What type of info are you looking for?  Currently have hundreds of hours of logs for both of these.  EoE, boc , hg , bf may look good on paper. If you have ever played with these in game and seriously think they will out agro FB i feel sorry for you..</div></div><hr />

playing is somthing, calculating is somthing else.<br />
read this and this and this (follow the links) to get what a hate calculation is. then you may understand the difference between the bunker and the battlefield. if both of you have long experience and parses of numerous weapon, why don't you compute them to get the formulas, or give the work to somelse if you don't like doing it.</div></div><hr />

If by that you mean:<br />
Anger3 auged Darkblade + Y_auged X_Offhander = 10<br />
Anger3 auged Fleshbiter + Y_auged X_Offhander = 9.5<br />
then I agree entirely</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. I have a fleshbiter/eoe both auged with anger 3.  I would say it's less than Darkblade, but it's extremely close, I almost always steal agro from the other warriors (a3Darkblade/a3eoe, a3Darkblade/a3bf) unless I actively try not to.  I'm perfectly happy with it, and wouldn't roll on a darkblade given the chance unless it was rotting.  It really seems to have a lot of dps agro, if that makes any sense. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

JOS is better than Fleshbiter (a bit less proc hate but better hate from dps, and better dps).<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you on crack?  I just went from a JoS + EoE combo, both with anger3 to DB + JoS combo, both with anger3.  My aggro is much, MUCH better.  People that have had both DB and FB have posted and said they are very comparable in terms of aggro.  FB owns JoS and EoE sideways dude.</div></div><hr />

Your maths prolly apply when comparing a yak, a wurmslayer and a lamentation but just wielding all the weapons you listed and a bit of common sense tell you, roughly, how good the weapon is.<br />
<br />
What about moving this thread to the overlords sanctuary?<br />
<br />
On-topic comment: We just got our fist flesbiter yesterday night and we have 2 dbotw right now but i would say in terms of aggro FB is the second weapon right after dbotw (Better aggro trough potential dps, worse proc, worse procrate mod VS worse ratio, better hate proc, proc mod bonus) and its even the better non raiding weapon (Dps, very neat lure 3 sek / 65 stun for the exp / ldon grind.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still got to swing them for awhile beside other people and at the end of the day we  get a &quot;feel&quot; not an absolute qualifible ratio.In some cases the &quot;feel&quot; is strong enough to make a clear judgement between 2 weapons in aggro value and often it is not without extensive practice.</div></div><hr />

We had a warrior offhanding EoE who 'felt' he had as good agro as an auged JoS. I had an unauged JoS and 'felt' I had more agro than an auged EoE. We both 'felt' we were fine - and we were. Darkblade is fine, Fleshbiter is fine. They both hold agro. I've never known anyone to upgrade a Darkblade to a Fleshbiter for tanking though.</div></div><hr />

When u do U know how good FB is. How about posting ur magelo? I 3box my warrior with cleric and wiz. When First swing procs (static blow) my wizzie can nuke her first nuke without getting aggro, however when first swing procs (EB) my wizzie's nuke (first nuke) will get her in trouble. For my experience FB proc alone generates huge aggro and I strongly believe its proc is better than EB.</div></div><hr />

Until than, while most guilds have a DB drop every 10th RZ or even less, DB and FB will go to the Warriors that want them, respecting DKP or distribution.<br />
<br />
Arguing that FB *might* be the better Trash Weapon (hi Yoda), but that any other weapon will own it (even a BoC) on a 3 Minute fight, is pbar'ed (pointless beyond any recognition), because in a 3 Minute Plus Fight you could hold agro with a Primal Brawlstick once it's locked down purely due to Proximity Agro. And yes, you may quote me on that.<br />
<br />
If you can get a DB soon, wait for it (another 10 RZ kills?).<br />
If you can get a FB, take it.<br />
If you want to wait for one or the other, the next Warrior in line will be happy enough.</div></div><hr />

Its plain and simple awesome aggro.  I steal aggro from dbow warrior on trash all the time and often on long fights have to switch and put my EoE in primary slot to keep from over-aggro big named and killing myself.  Also have WA5 and Echo of Anger as most wars have that is doing the same kind of content.  I can also hold aggro just fine on long fights tanking with Fleshbiter Anger 3 agument and Blackstone Buckler.  There is a diffrence between dbow and fleshbiter but its minimal...</div></div><hr />

This means exactly jack. Stop bothering to post this junk if you want to really find out which weapon has superior aggro. So far this post is just a bunch of people with DB claiming its better even though they don't have FB, and a bunch of people with FB claiming its better or the same even though they don't have DB. If you want to find out which is actually better, get both, or find someone with both who is willing to blow a few hours and parse it !<br />
<br />
And to the guy that claimed he had hundreds of hours of parses with various weapons, man if you haven't posted it do it... even if you don't want to slog through the work someone else will, and it is useful information.</div></div><hr />

My point was simply that Fleshbiter is great aggro and is a great alternative to dbow...</div></div><hr />
