What is the best aug for the blue.... damage, HP, or more hate?  I would think that the stacking from the red and an A3 would be enough hate.</div></div><hr />

you can never have anougth hate. as wandor says &quot;when my wiz nukes hard for more than 500DPS, no tank can keep his aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
so the more you have the best it is ... going that way A3 on red epic and A3 on CHoS (best prize / aggro ratio).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear ya, but if the A3 stacks with the red's hate (it does doesn't it?); shouldn't that be enough hate for any encounter, when you add in incite and taunt?  If on a raid and you really want to be sure, you could add spirit of rage and area taunt.</div></div><hr />

You will never have so much aggro that your casters are unable to catch up.<br />
<br />
So, you should give them as much breathing room as possible.</div></div><hr />

hmm i 2box a wiz and war and i never have trouble with that and he nukes for 2.5k to 4.6k and i still keep agro, i am using a chos and dagnar's tail from ToV, does the wizzy wait till 80%?</div></div><hr />

hmm i 2box a wiz and war and i never have trouble with that and he nukes for 2.5k to 4.6k and i still keep agro, i am using a chos and dagnar's tail from ToV, does the wizzy wait till 80%? Ok, every time a wizard wait til 80% to nuke a puppy dies. Waiting to nuke is by far the lamest strat ever and should have long been replace by better agro weapons.<br />
<br />
My wizard is usually nuking behind warriors with WA5, EoA, and DB+A3/EoE+A3 or better and I can pretty much guarantee that if the MT dies, I will get summoned and splattered. If it's not me, then it's another wizard. This is with spamming concussion legs between nukes. Top geared tanks can usually hold agro well enough, but they are using far better than epics. Any wizard can pick up a copy of Strike of Solusek in the bazaar and be nuking damn near as hard as a decked wizard in GoD gear, only they won't have the advantage of having clicky concussion legs.<br />
<br />
The best agro you could possible get with epics would be to bag them and use SotB+A3 and CHoS+A3. If you can do the BoT towers, replace one of those with GBoS+A3. The difference in agro will save your DPS classes a lot of deaths, and increase your overall raid DPS by a significant margin.<br />
<br />
Epics are a status symbol and should be treated as such. Wear them around to show off, but put them away where they won't get scratched when you actually have to fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not quite sure of your question, we got some like this sometime, but can vary dependently on what you wanted to say. so my answer will be :<br />
No proc never 'stack', in the way thay don't fuse in one bigger proc. but they 'stack' in the way that they both are able to fire alternatively (they can't fire at the same swing, but can within the same round via double attack, etc ...).<br />
so the red epic, in main hand, with WA0 and 305 DEX will proc around 2 times per minute, if you put A3 on it, you will add 2 more proc (of A3) per minute.<br />
currently you have SBoD+A3 (600hate 2ppm)  /  BoS (566hate 1ppm)  :  1766hate per minute from proc only.<br />
if you sawp the A3 on the red epic and put it MH you end ep : BoS+A3 (566hate 2ppm &amp; 600hate 2ppm)  /  SBoD (0ppm) : 2322 hate per minute from proc only.<br />
so with the red epic / copper hammer of striking combo (both A3 auged), you end up with 3390 hate per minute from proc only (alomst twice as much as your current state).<br />
and if Wandor suggest you to replace the red epic by the SotB it is because both CHoS and SotB have much better dps aggro than the red epic, with a comparable proc hate, so even if you decrease a little bit your proc aggro, you will still end up with a far better hate generation. So yes the CHoS+A3 MH with the SotB+A3 OH will make you uber compared to your current state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I'm happy with using my red blade, I'd suggest the 125pt Ykesha aug.<br />
<br />
If you have an A3 aug, stick it (A3) on your better mainhand weapon.</div></div><hr />

If you're really trying to equip yourself as well as possible, dump the red one while you're at it.</div></div><hr />
