I 2 boxed just about the entire quest other than the ashes (bought those for 10k in the bazaar) with 63 War and 65 Shaman.  I had a friend bring his 65 BST for the last fight against the shades.  I found out, this was totally unneeded.  The named shade pops in the middle of the hall, the others in the outside corners of the room, I just killed them one by one.  <br />
<br />
A couple of notes from my experiences:  A RZ worshipping ogre is dubious to KC, and will need to use illusions to get the quests done.  I went through 5 or 6 potions to do it all.   The vamp kitty will wander all the way to the castle and stand there till you wack him.  The shades are easily single fights.<br />
<br />
When it was all said and done, I took off my Cloak of Flames and Heavy Rubicite Belt and put on Shield of Loyalty and Broken Drive Belt.  <br />
 My final tally was a loss of 30hp and a gain of 39AC.  I think that was an overall pretty good trade.  I am allready maxed on stam and str.  Raw stats are now 4999 hp and 1365AC unbuffed at level 63</div></div><hr />

Yesterday musta been a good day for this quest...I got mine too!  I got real lucky on the ashe's...they dropped on the second cycle.  By the way, for those that are doing the quest, if you don't have bane weapons, make sure you've got a good dot class to help cause that vamp has a ton of hp.  We had a 65 mage and GoD equiped BL the first time and we got owned...but we called in a druid and cleric and were able to take him down before he despawned.</div></div><hr />
