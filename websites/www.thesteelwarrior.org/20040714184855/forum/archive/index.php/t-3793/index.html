<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Parsered BoW proc without Anger 3 in LDoN normal Adventure (kill boss)<br />
Mobs killed : 33<br />
Time : 24 mins<br />
BoW proc : 31 times<br />
<br />
Then after augmented the BoW with Anger 3, in Everfrost Normal Adventure (kill 60)<br />
Mobs killed : 60<br />
Time : 41 mins<br />
EB (BoW + Anger 3) : 137 times<br />
<br />
Since EB and Anger 3 proc are same message, there's no way for me to know how many time just Anger 3 proc.<br />
<br />
Both times all melee stats capped and all my offensive/defense AA maxed. Fight is almost non-stop since we just rush. no pull. no med. time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Does the Anger level of have any thing to do with how much it procs..I am really considering putting Anger 2 on my Sews instead of waiting for anger3...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why put 400hate when you can get 600 ?<br />
You can never have too much aggro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Controlling for time, that looks like anger 3 is proccing at about the same rate as the regular proc, which is to be expected.<br />
<br />
31/24 = 1.3 ppm<br />
137/41 = 3.3 ppm / 2 procs = 1.67 ppm average for each proc<br />
<br />
That's a difference of about .37 ppm, which is probably within simple random variance given the sample size.<br />
<br />
Both numbers seem a little low, really, especially the unaugmented one, but I guess that's because the time number is adventure time, not just melee time, so the period between pulls is included and watering down the rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This parse is not non-stop attacking. Its based on an adventure where he has to swap targets and whatever downtime there was.<br />
<br />
Its good info, but really, its hard to compare proc rates on anything other than a constant non-stop parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, so I said &quot;Fight is  almost  non-stop&quot; only, just for reference only tho.<br />
<br />
For a constant non-stop parse, just did FRO before BoW augmented.<br />
Fight : 11 mins<br />
BoW Proc : 17 times<br />
<br />
Time is not long enough tho., so just another reference.<br />
<br />
btw, anyone did a BoW proc with parse time &gt; 1 hour ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is like 10 parses of that in this exact same forum, look harder imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Magumas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have Anger II Slammer and it procs like crazy.. Never have a prob with agro (I love it).. However, if you want to save up for Anger III Im sure its even better... So really a choice of whether you want to spend the extra time and points..  Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pretty impressive.  Basically with the mod you are getting close to 2x normal EB procs per given time period (same rate but now you have 2)...I suppose this will warrant &quot;fixing warrs agro&quot; in SoE's eye.<br />
<br />
For folks who have had enough pts to do this: can you buy 2 Anger 3's; 1 for a 1 hander and another for a 2 hander (provided they are never equipped at the same time)?  Or did the patch eliminate this possibility?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anger 3 is not a lore proc.  You can put it on every weapon you own if you like.</div></div><hr />

Is there a difference between the Anger III listed in Guk and the one from EF? I know the one in EF supposedly fits on the BoW, but not sure if the Guk one does too  <br />
<br />
The one in Guk is for Plane of Time weapons (flagged type 8) like Vanazir or Darkblade of the Warlord. All PoTime weapons and equipment are type 8 so you need special type 8 augs (they wanted to spread the augments around rather than lumping them all together in the same place).<br />
<br />
On the topic of Anger 3, it may be redundant in saying so, but I have Anger 3 on my SEWS and it simply owns...</div></div><hr />
