<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinuvas</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone give me a reasonable guess on how long it takes a 5-man group to make it through Scholomance, LBRS, or Stratholme?  Assumptions being that they're all 60, work well together, and are reasonably geared.  Not taking into account learning the instances (will always add lots of time), how long would be a reasonable guess for a run-through?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not terribly interested in time tables for raid groups, as I prefer the 5-man route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LBRS - several hours, assuming no wipes. 3-4 is a reasonable goal. 2 is very good.<br />
<br />
I love that instance a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miron</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming no wipes and a good group I can see LBRS (Omokk, Voone, Wyrmthalak) being done in 3-4 hours. If you skip Omokk and Voone 2 hours if you're pretty darn good.<br />
<br />
I don't have as much experience with Stratholme and Scholomance. Now I don't know if my server sucks or if these zones are just that hard but the dead side of Stratholme will take you a whole evening. Especially so if you need to kill the Baroness and the crystals don't bug and let you past by killing two. Right now the respawn is so retardedly fast one wipe means you're done without a soulstone and you'll probaly need to reclear the same area multiple times just so you can kill all three crystals. The live side can probaly be done in a couple hours.<br />
<br />
As to Scholomance I've only seen it once on a &quot;raid&quot; so I couldn't say how long it would take.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scholo takes about 4-6 hours one grouping, about 3-4 with a ten man. Strath is probably 4 hours with a group of level 60s, can be raided in about 45 mins. I've never five manned LBRS, so not quite sure on that one.</div></div><hr />
