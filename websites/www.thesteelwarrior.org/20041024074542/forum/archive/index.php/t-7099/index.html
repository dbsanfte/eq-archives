Is there any quests for gear that i can use? or her? she is pretty much set at 39 she has 220 wis .   I would really like to quest on some stuff I can use lol. <br />
<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

basically; keep levellin and ty to organize/join some kael raids for thurg gear; or find some friends and hit up LDoN  any of them ) for augments/gear.<br />
<br />
pretty much questing for gear ( solo/duo ) sucks. not much in the sub-50 range to bother with...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could start working on the coldian ring and shawl quests. That's about all worth doing that you could probably get anywhere on at this point.</div></div><hr />

Hehe thanks you guys , I was lookign around and had just come to that same conclusion.  I am not sure that i will be doing the coldain quests since I hate tradeskills in EQ.  It would cost me alot more money to raise up skills to complete it than to just buy a good ring elsewhere.  Im a stupid warrior what do I know of crafting.  Well be safe and hunt well<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The ring isn't bad on tradeskills. You just need a little tailoring and smithing. The shawls are VERY tradeskill intense. The smithing combine for the ring is tradeable so you'd really only have to do the tailoring which is needed for the 1st ring the trivial on it is relativly low, I think 30ish, and I know people that have made the combine with 0 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To make sure you don't fail the tailoring combine, you should get to the mid-40's. You might still have some trouble getting the 8th ring without at least a group, though.<br />
<br />
But it's a fun item to have! I love mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can also have someone else do the tailoring and MQ in the ring quest.  The smithing can be done with pretty much no skill but you may fail once or twice.  I got my Dain ring with pretty much zero tradeskills.  Not sure how far you will be able to get at your levels. <br />
<br />
You could start working on the eyepatch of plunder quest.  A lot of times people kill Lodizal and don't want the map piece.  Painful quest though.<br />
<br />
In a couple levels you will definitely want to head to Ykesha and work on the Stoicism quest for your shaman.  Very important spell for the 40s since shaman healing leaves something to be desired in that range if you're trying to duo and Stoicism will help quite a bit.</div></div><hr />
