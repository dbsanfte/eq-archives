<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy all.<br />
<br />
I seem to be having a lot of comp problems lately. It's kind of good timing, as I'm almost finished building a new pc. But in any case, I'd still like to have this old one running for a while yet.<br />
<br />
The comp is a P4 1.4ghz, with 512 megs of ram, a GeForce2 vid card (yeah I know that's ancient, and I'll be upgrading it just as soon as I figure out if this box is worth saving), running in Windows 98.<br />
<br />
It started out a while back, by just running slower and slower. I've gone from being able to run 2 EQ accounts at once, both with or without EQWindows, to only being able to run 1 account now, and that one can even be quite laggy at times.  I've had to turn all settings to minimum, just to be able to raid, and that's with only 1 account running.  I've run several different virus scans, and they all come up clean. A couple of people told me to get a program that boosts RAM efficiency, so I scouted around on the net, and got FreeRam Pro. When I run this program, with nothing else running on the PC, it shows me as only having 230-ish or so megs of RAM available. This is out of 512 installed. When I reboot the comp, it goes through and does a RAM check, and supposedly that comes up fine.<br />
<br />
When I do alt-ctrl-del, this is all that comes up;<br />
<br />
Explorer<br />
FreeRam XP Pro 1<br />
Qttask<br />
Rundll32<br />
Wzqpick<br />
Loadqm<br />
Systray<br />
Vi_grm<br />
<br />
With just that stuff running, I only have 230 megs available out of 512? Can anyone give me any pointers here, to what might be causing this problem, and any possible fixes? Would be very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd love to hear an answer to this one as well.  I'm running about the same specs as zito except I have Win2k and a GeForce FX5200.  I've tried just about everything and have almost given up on ever being able to play the game normally again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">remove loadqm from your startup, and close down the process, you don't need it and it has a bad habit of slowing down some computers tremendously.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
<br />
In the future, you can help yourself troubleshoot by doing a google search on any processes that you aren't very familiar with. That can help a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go into your start menu and click run. From there type msconfig. This will bring up a new window. Click selective startup and uncheck load startup items then reboot. The only thing you need to have running in Windows98 is explorer. The rest are just eating resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">won't that also kill your firewall, anti viris, ect... speaking of that were are your firewall and av?<br />
<br />
and freeram can kill responce time on win 98. especialy if you fill up the ram alot.<br />
<br />
looks like alot of hidden stuff eating up your ram. run a spyware thing if you dont regularly and your av after you update it.<br />
<br />
then upgrade to xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Win98 really sucks for freeing up RAM. It's the main reason win2k/xp  is much better. win98 pretty much caps at 512 ram and anything passed that, win 98 won't recognize or use effeciently.<br />
<br />
anyhow, i did a quick google on your loadqm and i'm assuming you use MSN to connect to the internet. Apparently, according to Microsoft, this will take alot of resources for it's autoupdate feature. You can read about it from the knowledge base HERE (http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=309418) <br />
<br />
also, get rid of the qtask. it's just quicktime manager and it's not needed and just takes up ram that could be used elsewhere<br />
<br />
and as usual, download spybot search and destroy, update it and scan for spyware. they have a nasty habit of slowing down your system. Run a defrag if you haven't in a while either. It will definately help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the responses.  I ended up taking Daemonwynd, Steenky, and Thalzaar's advice, and deleting pretty much everything that was running in the background.  That pretty much cleared it up.  I'll be upgrading the vid card, and that should help some as well.  <br />
<br />
As for FreeRam; it rocks.  I currently have both accounts running with trader mules in the bazaar.  With FreeRam not running, the comp runs noticeably slower overall.  The only thing I don't like about FreeRam is that the comp will gradually start slowing down to the point where it runs at without FreeRam, and then it will speed up again as FreeRam does it's thing, repeating this cycle over and over.  This leads to a &quot;peaks and valleys&quot; profile of comp performance, but I can live with that.  I could also adjust the settings for the FreeRam program, to have it kick in sooner, before performance drops further down the &quot;valley&quot;; but that's just something I'm going to have to play around with to get the best setting.<br />
<br />
-edit- Just edited to add a couple of things I forgot.  First, I'm waiting to get Win XP for the comp I'm building now.  It's one of the last things I need to purchase; it was budgeted for, but ya know how budgets never seem to work out just as planned :p.  So, once I've picked it up for the new comp, I'm going to upgrade the old one with it as well.  Also, I currently run both spybot and Macafee AV.  The AV was disabled while I was trying to figure out what was wrong with the comp.  I wasn't too worried, as it had been up full time previously.  As well, I run spybot every other day, and defrag once a week or so, so I didn't really think that would be the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The new version of McAfee anti-virus has issues with some software. I know that at work on Win2k it wants to scan all the time, and our network genius can't figure out how to make it stop. For the time being we're manually disabling it upon log-in, but that means no anti-virus all day. <br />
<br />
At home I don't run any anti-virus software, but that's just me. I run a very clean comp and haven't gotten a virus to date(96-04) though I can't really advise this to everyone. If you are running a router they usually have built-in firewalls so as not to use system resources, but once again I have this disabled. I back-up my comp every once in a while, and since there isn't any pr0n to get noone would want my stuff anyways.<br />
<br />
So, once I've picked it up for the new comp, I'm going to upgrade the old one with it as well. <br />
<br />
Just so you know, XP will only run on 1 computer at a time. Unless somebody knows a way to trick it you'll need another copy for your second comp.</div></div><hr />
