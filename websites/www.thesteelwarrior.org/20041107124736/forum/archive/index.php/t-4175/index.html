<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Who claim to have it tough, who claim that we aren't &quot;that over powered&quot; or claim that warriors only need a &quot;slight increase, but we're balanced&quot;...<br />
<br />
...stop it already.  You're regurgitating an arguement that you heard a higher end paladin say in the hopes that maybe the person will agree with you, simply because someone high up said it once.<br />
<br />
Come up with your own arguements and use them, don't say what someone in AO said, or CD said, or what AL said.  Say what you think and stop trying to be impressive by going &quot;Oh well if you look at the true way the game has taken then it's only logical by saying that there are now three tank classes instead of one and therefore paladins deserve to be where they're at.  I assure you warriors need a boost, but not to a degree to outmatch paladins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shut up with that horse crap already.  No one is buying it.  As well don't go &quot;Oh you disagree with me?  @!#$ you then you baby you just don't know what class balance is.  Paladins are very balanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Balanced to what?  What are you balanced against?  One thing cannot be balanced against nothing, it's physically impossible.  Balance, when not referring to the noun that is on a scale, is the measure of equality overall between two or more given things.<br />
<br />
Three lardasses get into a van with three skinnies.  The three lardasses can't sit on one side while the three skinnies sit on the other side, the van's weight will be thrown to the wrong side and it will begin to tip.<br />
<br />
The three lardasses have to distribute their weight amongst the van so that it is balanced.<br />
<br />
Each part of the car gets its own amount of lardasses and skinnies, balancing out the weight of the car.<br />
<br />
And yet paladins want the three lardasses on one side, the skinnies on the other, and the car to be moving at the same rate as it normally would.<br />
<br />
But wait!  Recently paladins have been willing to give one lardass to the other side of the car, as long as their lardass abilities aren't detrimented in any way.<br />
<br />
I don't care if paladins believe the game has changed over the years.  You're right, it has, the roles have changed slightly, and the game dynamics have certainly evolved, but that doesn't give you any excuse to detriment a warrior in any way, period.<br />
<br />
Let me show you why people picked the warrior class and what they agreed to when they did so:<br />
<br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle. <br />
<br />
They made these characters under the promise that they would be the best tanks and defensive armsmen, not the ones who have to bow down to paladins or others with a spell book.<br />
<br />
They made up for their inability to solo by being absolutely important on raids and in groups.<br />
<br />
That isn't there any more.  Paladins can solo, I do so all the time.  There's no question that shadow knights can solo.  And yet they're more desireable in a group AND do the job of tanking better now.<br />
<br />
And none of you see a problem with this?  You can honestly go &quot;Well it's not that big a deal, just increase taunt&quot;.?<br />
<br />
The thing is this isn't your honest opinions.  You know that you're overpowered, you just don't want to let go of that and you seem to feel some kind of vendetta against warriors because of a month in Kunark.<br />
<br />
Paladins have crossed the line now, they are no longer just supports.  And yet they have the audacity to say &quot;Well I want to still be able to do this, but make warriors just a bit better&quot;.<br />
<br />
We need a nerf not as a punishment, but as a necessity for this game.<br />
<br />
So why do you concoct these weird stories and allegations in order to preserve this?  WHY is the game and the enjoyment of others so...offensive to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Amen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like this thread left alone by warriors to see what the knights think if they disagree...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense,<br />
<br />
They are. They have the highest caps in all weapons, the highest offensive skills, innate crits, the ability to berserk, class specific AAs that increase their attack, and disciplines for attack and defense.<br />
<br />
taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. <br />
<br />
They still do. The most dangerous creatures are your raid targets, not your exp group targets. I understand that paladins, shadowknights, and even rangers, monks, and beastlords have tanked some of the highest (and in reference to knights THE highest) mobs in the game, but I don't see anything in this description that says warriors hold that right exclusively. I also have yet to see where anything but a warrior has tanked these mobs until the mob has either reached the farm stage or the guild involved simply wanted to see if they could do it.<br />
<br />
Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
I doubt anyone debates this.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. <br />
<br />
They get the best STA to HP ratio. The level they build STR and STA is up to the warrior though.<br />
<br />
When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. <br />
<br />
I believe this still holds true given the annecdotal evidence from how often my wife CHeals me vs. a warrior. Also, they have higher avoidance and, depending on who you ask, have higher mitigation. I don't know if the mitigation is true or not, but I know I took hits noticably better with my warrior than with my paladin.<br />
<br />
Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. <br />
<br />
Again true. Highest skill caps, solid offensive and defensive AAs and disciplines.<br />
<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
They get taunt and on success it does what it is supposed to. I would say this is an idealic paragraph at best though.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. <br />
<br />
True at least comparing paladins to warriors. A warrior will out damage me and will take a punch better. Since I have never played an SK, I don't know if the comparison holds up there or not.<br />
<br />
Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle. <br />
<br />
True, it is a pain to solo with a warrior. They are best suited for groups as a front line damage sponge.<br />
<br />
So, I would say that the description is fairly close to the reality. The fact is that a warrior does tank better than any other class. The issue is with aggro and the group being knowledgable enough to keep aggro where it is supposed to be. There are many different ways to do that, but it takes people wanting to do it.<br />
<br />
I liken the warrior/paladin/shadowknight debate to the shaman/enchanter/beastlord/bard debate when it comes to slowers for an exp group. All of the classes can do the job, it is just a matter of what particular strength you need. If you want someone to slow and do CC, pick an enchater or a bard. If you want damage, buffs, and slows, pick a shaman or beastlord. The same goes with tanks. If you want a solid tank that takes a hit the best and can still deal a semi-respectable DPS, pick a warrior. If you want someone to let you go crazy and forget group dynamics, pick a paladin or SK.<br />
<br />
I will close with saying something I have said in almost all of my posts. I understand that warriors need a boost, but it isn't as far out of line as some people make it seem. By the same token, it isn't as idealic as others make it out to be. I would love to see aggro management increased a bit for warriors and I think the idea of converting mana to HPs on equipment is a great idea. However, nerfing knights will not and realistically cannot &quot;fix&quot; warriors. If someone truly believes that warriors are useless and that knights should be worse off than them, then who will be the tank in exp groups? Rangers, beastlords, and monks can already do it in tier 2 and below.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree<br />
<br />
     At the end level of the game (although I still consider BoT high level, since you either need to be flagged or level 62 to get in)  the difference between Warriors and Paladins/SK's exists, but is negligible overall.<br />
<br />
     The only thing I find humorous about a lot of these posts is that we're all beating a dead horse, and if my calculations are correct, for as much as it's been beaten, there isn't much left other than a pile of goo on the ground.<br />
<br />
     It's true that there needs to be a fix, but all of us sitting here and arguing about who needs what is pointless.  I used to be one of the people who told warriors to shut up and deal with it,  but after sitting down and looking at the situation I can see that I was wrong.  However, reversing the situation so that Sk's and Paladins in their present state are useless to the role they have become accustomed to won't solve the problem either.  I say &quot;accustomed&quot; because it was not the intended initial role for them to be so.  However, as the game progressed Pally's and SK's seemed to be a good class to use as a tank, so it was done as such.<br />
<br />
     If you're looking for someone's honest opinion that isn't controlled by a higher level person saying it's so and others agreeing, this is the best I can do for you.  Take it as you may :)</div></div><hr />

The small gap between warriors, paladins, and shadowknights I think is the design of Sony. Perhaps that is the ignorant newb's opinion, but here are the designations for paladins and shadowknights. I think they match their descriptions and the intention.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins are holy warriors who use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath. Paladins are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Paladins are able fighters and battlefield healers whose combat spells focus on stunning enemies and smiting undead. They also have several spells that increase the health and armor of their allies. Every so often, paladins can lay hands on themselves or their friends to instantly grant a powerful heal.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the greatest force against undead. At higher levels they gain special abilities to smite these foes. Paladins also gain a limited ability to resurrect their fallen friends with lessened penalties for death.<br />
<br />
Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal. Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are unholy warriors who use fear, pain and disease to attack all that is good in the world. Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. When needed, shadowknights use their powerful harm touch ability to greatly damage their opponents.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them. Combined with spells that degrade an enemy's ability to fight, a shadowknight becomes a fearsome foe.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. The shadowknight's lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight.</div></div><hr />

Warrior<br />
<br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles  and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics.

<br />

<br />
*<br />
<br />
That's a whole lot of emphasis on unparalleled toughness, leading from the front, keeping the mobs attention off the less durable group members.<br />
<br />
The small gap between warriors, paladins, and shadowknights I think is the design of Sony.<br />
The fact that the gap exists at all probably means that in Sony's design it was supposed to matter. The fact that ability to gain a mobs attention was specifically mentioned for a warrior probably means that they were not supposed be worst at it. Barring monks :) So aggro and 'far hardier than any other class in the description. <br />
<br />
Whereas aggro isn't mentioned in either knightly description. and from the Paladin 'occasionally falling back to heal' and in the SK's we get 'Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them.<br />
<br />
In both cases, within the descriptions, knights are actively seeking to opt out of the tanking position to do other things. They are described as 'able fighters' but that's about as specific as it gets. Paladins are described as being specialised as 'the greatest force against undead' specifically.<br />
<br />
hehe i know it's balance issues lite but it's fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You are correct, I forgot about piercing, archery, and hand to hand. I should have said most weapons or the ability to master all since I believe warriors can hit the master rank in all of them.<br />
<br />
***EDIT TO ADD***<br />
but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal <br />
Going head to head with a mob I took as tanking and I don't take falling back occassionally to heal as ditching aggro. If they wanted paladins to ditch aggro they would have given us something to get rid of it (jolt/fd/blur).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How can you fall back from combat without loosing aggro? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've managed to ditch aggro a time or two when another warrior or SK with better gear wanted to tank, or when heals were not available should i have jolt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nobody suggested that knights shouldn't be 'able' tanks anyway, however, there is a lot of evidence in the descriptions (and i would certainly expect it as a new player reading them) that a warrior was expected to be, not the only choice,  but the best choice if all you want is a combat monster.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I could be wrong about the initial &quot;descriptions&quot;, but later ones were written by players.  They are always overly nice regarding their topic.  They are not written in stone.  This was something that both rogues and mages contended with awhile ago during caster balance.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, now you are going into a different area.  Either the description is untrue OR it does not mean much.   Just because better agro came out to be preferred over better tanking does not mean that warriors were gipped according to the description.  For the most part, they got what they thought they were...it just didn't pan out as they hoped.  <br />
<br />
I am all for balance.  I am for my class being nerfed if needed.  I am for content being rebalanced in the wake of player improvements.  I am for warriors getting boosted in some way to make them feel better.  However, I am for balance, first and foremost.  If most of you looked at what you asked to have happen, you would know that you often go way too far.  Be fair when you make these calls for balance.  Balance is not warriors being the best at all aspects of being the tank, hands down.  Balance is not making it so that groups can/will only function with warriors as their tanks.  <br />
<br />
I would also like to point out, that the descriptions that were fled to clearly state that paladins are *mostly* melee.  A concept many of you like to ignore.  We are tanks that use our spells to make up for the inferiority that our gear *should* present us with, in relation to warriors.  This would achieve parity between the classes.  However, itemization messed that up...that is probably the biggest problem.  Though, you seem to feel that agro&gt;&gt;&gt;damage absorption.  So, even if they fixed that I doubt you'd be happy.  Nothing about your class suggests you should be the best at agro.  Even this description doesn't lend itself to that, however you should be the best at absorbing damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I could be wrong about the initial &quot;descriptions&quot;, but later ones were written by players.<br />
<br />
The descriptions were &quot;recently changed&quot;...in that the tasks involved weren't adjusted, SoE just decided to put it's level of crappy writing in there to try to make it seem Sony authentic and &quot;more up to date&quot;.<br />
<br />
The tasks weren't changed.<br />
<br />
 They are always overly nice regarding their topic. They are not written in stone.<br />
<br />
The tasks therein are, as that is a signed agreement the person is making when he makes his character that that is the job he is undertaking, anything less is deception.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now moving on down here is where you begin to contradict yourself:<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, now you are going into a different area. Either the description is untrue OR it does not mean much. Just because better agro came out to be preferred over better tanking does not mean that warriors were gipped according to the description. <br />
<br />
When aggro is a necessity and stuns weren't even meant to have aggro upon design...yes, warriors were jipped.<br />
<br />
They are not the best and most desireable tanks and are not the cornerstone as they put it for groups, they are a detriment compared to a knight.  They are too much utility for too little reward.<br />
<br />
For the most part, they got what they thought they were...it just didn't pan out as they hoped. <br />
<br />
It's possible to deceive people with the truth.<br />
<br />
It's possible for someone to go &quot;Hey if you work at this job, I'll DEFINITELY pay you more than Larry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then come paycheck time you get twenty cents more than Larry.  That was truthful deception.<br />
<br />
The only difference is, with a warrior you aren't given the opportunity to see beforehand how much you're going to get jipped.  You can't go &quot;Well do these differences really make a matter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors' bonuses aren't large enough to justify the paladins' bonuses.  The paladins gain far too much for far little cost, while the warriors gain far too little for far too great a cost.<br />
<br />
If you deny that then you're feeding us all BS.<br />
<br />
I am all for balance. I am for my class being nerfed if needed. I am for content being rebalanced in the wake of player improvements. I am for warriors getting boosted in some way to make them feel better. However, I am for balance, first and foremost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is balance...the idea that a paladin gets to tank as well as a warrior and have &quot;useless&quot; (which I've recently translated from paladinish to mean &quot;wonderful&quot;, an adjective in turn used to hide its power from superior forces) utilities?  And that warriors have 200 more hit points?<br />
<br />
 If most of you looked at what you asked to have happen, you would know that you often go way too far.<br />
<br />
What have I said that went too far?  Quote what I said, and tell me exactly and precisely that goes too far.<br />
<br />
What is unfair about different mitigation, zero aggro on stuns that don't effect the mob[/i], and uping warrior HPs/AC?  But please, dig up what I say needs to happen precisely and tell me what I said was wrong and going overboard.<br />
<br />
 Be fair when you make these calls for balance. Balance is not warriors being the best at all aspects of being the tank, hands down.<br />
<br />
Yes, it really is.  When that is the only task they have, they should be the best, otherwise their one trick is a crappy one.<br />
<br />
 Balance is not making it so that groups can/will only function with warriors as their tanks. <br />
<br />
Did anyone ever say that warriors should be essential?  No, they said they should be the best tanks and have an equal opportunity in groups.  YOU are the one assuming that that means that they are essential, I am under the impression that that simply means [b]we don't tank as well.<br />
<br />
Is this an inherint problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also like to point out, that the descriptions that were fled to clearly state that paladins are *mostly* melee.<br />
<br />
But with spells as well, therefore their melee should not be anywhere near as strong as a warriors'.<br />
<br />
Besides, our caster side is pretty damn powerful.  We have zero drawbacks for picking this class, we have the melee of a warrior (tankability at least, not raw offensive and slightly less defensive) and the powers of a cleric without CH and nine levels below.<br />
<br />
That's a pretty damn powerful person.<br />
<br />
We're NOT paladins, we're warriors with spellbooks.<br />
<br />
 A concept many of you like to ignore. We are tanks that use our spells to make up for the inferiority that our gear *should* present us with, in relation to warriors.<br />
<br />
Okay you just admitted that the itemization is throwing things off of a balance, and that we should be inferior tanks that need our spells to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Where does this idea go astray?  That because itemization is screwed up &quot;Oh well, sorry about that old chaps&quot;?  How about this...since they aren't going to fix itemization, theyn eed to fix another set of abilities to balance paladins with the enhanced itemization. <br />
<br />
I.E. since our melee and caster sides were boosted up so much by these items that won't get fixed...nerf our melee and/or caster sides.  Is that so illogical, especially by your OWN arguement that we should be relying on our spells to make us better tanks?<br />
<br />
 This would achieve parity between the classes. However, itemization messed that up...that is probably the biggest problem. Though, you seem to feel that agro&gt;&gt;&gt;damage absorption.<br />
<br />
I donno, it is the paladin arguement that &quot;if you nerf a paladin, a ranger will tank or a beastlord&quot;...wait a second, I thought aggro wasn't &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damage absorption?<br />
<br />
Then why would they tank?<br />
<br />
 So, even if they fixed that I doubt you'd be happy.<br />
<br />
You're right...they wouldn't be.  They need some difference between the HP/AC/mitigation/DPS that is quite significant.<br />
<br />
 Nothing about your class suggests you should be the best at agro.<br />
<br />
Taunting a monster so that he stays on you and not others does.<br />
<br />
The fact is though...taunt doesn't work.  Sometimes, it works, but it's not reliable, and when it does land all it does is send you to the top for a moment, that is easily overwritten by one nuke.<br />
<br />
That's not what the description says.  The description says it would keep the monster on him, not &quot;temporarily distract him&quot;...that's what stuns should do.<br />
<br />
As well, don't take one of the proposed fixes at a time and say &quot;Well if you implement this it won't make you happy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Look at ALL the fixes combined together, not one at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;I donno, it is the paladin arguement that &quot;if you nerf a paladin, a ranger will tank or a beastlord&quot;...wait a second, I thought aggro wasn't &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damage absorption?&quot;<br />
<br />
I never fell back to a &quot;if you nerfed paladins, rangers will tank&quot; argument.  My point was, if you get the bonuses you want, you still won't be happy because the player base still seems to feel that agro is better then tanking.  And when it comes to getting a group, it often is.  That is player perspective though, not real inbalance between the classes.  You banked on being the best at damage aborption to get you the prized seat and it fell through.  Sorry about that.  Now, many warriors want it so that you absolutely NEED the damage absorption or you *can't* tank.  That is ridiculous because you rarely NEED the agro to be able to tank.  Warriors can tank fine now, they just aren't preferred.  That is not a very legitimate balance complaint.<br />
<br />
I have already admitted that, perhaps, the warrior hp/ac/damage bonus is not necessarily enough to makeup for a knights agro.  I feel that the idea that &quot;knights should be able to pull agro, but, essentially, die the instant they do&quot; is horrible when you are trying to balance *three* tank classes.  You seem to prefer the idea of one tank class and 2....who knows what classes.  <br />
<br />
I did contradict myself a bit when I brought up the whole description thing.  I thought it was clear what I was doing though... Ie-The descriptions were worthless, but even if they weren't you still don't have all the grounds for what you demand.  <br />
<br />
I haven't been posting here long, but anyone who has seen any of my other posts should know I have never, ever claimed my spellbook was &quot;useless&quot;.  It is a very good thing to have around.  That does not mean that you people do not sometimes overexaggerate what that spellbook means in real terms.  Yet, you seem to *perfectly* understand that having an edge in damage absorption means little in real terms, because agro is more desirable by the lazy playerbase.  Warriors constantly downplay things like defensive, even though they are undeniably powerful, BECAUSE they lack everyday, real world value (Ie-in xp grouping), yet you refuse to understand that the samething can be applied to a good portion of the paladin spellbook.  <br />
<br />
I would love for Warriors, Paladins and Shadowknights to have an absolute equal chance at any given group spot.  I would love for high end content to be designed around having 3 tanks with different strengths and weaknesses.  I would love for all three to have equal value to both a single group and a raid.  Many warriors seem to like the idea of knights being worthless (no, I am not saying they are now or would even be after some of these ideas are put into place).  <br />
<br />
I wonder how many of you advocated helping knights at your own expense when kunark was the rule of the day.  I'm willing to bet very few, though I imagine some.  Its interesting to see the reverse demanded...by both you and monks/rogues.  I don't know how your community was acting during caster balance, but I almost hope rogues and monks take it in the ass forever for how retarded they were at that time.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, if either of us get our wish, it would destroy class balance.  Warriors must be the best tank.  The fact that this needs to be explained is either a sign of a very very shallow part of the human gene pool, or of the apocalypse.  One or the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, you are either saying (a) it is impossible or that you refuse for knights and warriors to both have an equal chance at a group spot or (b)  that both warriors and knights having an equal chance at a group spot is somehow game breaking?<br />
<br />
Neither of those make sense.  I would really like you to explain how a group having an equal likelyhood of choosing a warrior, a paladin, or a shadowknight on any given day is gamebreaking.  Even your fellow warriors fail to make that claim.  But by all means, compare it to a warrior having ch and backstab, I suppose that will prove your theory that there is a gene pool problem.<br />
<br />
Furthermore what exactly does this mean to you, since you are obviously the person to ask: &quot;Warriors must be the best tank.&quot;  Does it mean have the best mitigation, the best agro, or both? If you say both, how do you defend that in the name of &quot;balance&quot;?  So far, the only argument that has been used for warriors having both is almost a strict rpp one: &quot;Well, the guide said...&quot; Seriously, defend the point that warriors should have both, fully.  I'd like to hear all the good backup for it.  If you meant that warriors should have the best mitigation, go for it.  Few people disagree with you.  In case that isn't clear, I am one of the people agree with it.  You do not have to explain that to anyone, condescending as you are (do you really wonder why you get so little sympathy as a class?), you do have to explain why you should be unquestionably the best at both mitigation and agro.  No other class in the game dominates their field like you are suggesting warriors should.  Rogues, Mages, Wizards, Necros all have different strengths and weaknesses inherent in how they fill their job, yet you suggest that warriors shouldn't?  And, I am not suggesting that knights shouldn't also pay this price.</div></div><hr />

Read some of the other threads here and on the class balance part of the board....look for:<br />
<br />
1. The lack of role a warrior has if not tanking (mentioned in at least 10+ threads) as second tier dps <br />
<br />
2. The &quot;utility&quot; measure of a Paladin in certain types of group compositions (specifically mentioned are Druid/Shaman based healing groups).<br />
<br />
3. The argument (articulated by others rather eloquently) that if a warrior is not tanking they have no real purpose in any group (or least of marginal value compared to being replaced with any other class)<br />
<br />
Just because you haven't read the content of this board doesn't mean its not here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  The same is true of knights in terms of dps.<br />
<br />
2.  The &quot;utility&quot; in those groups is not &quot;real world&quot; utility.  Most tanks will have virtue regardless of who their healer is.  And even if they didn't, people advocate knights getting nerfs to their buffs, so how can you say both?<br />
<br />
3. The same is true of knights, for the most part.  How often do you see mulitple tanks of any class in the same group?  Not very, why?  Because outside of tanking they offer little else.  I have never, nor have any of the other tanks (including warriors)  I know, been asked to join a group that already had a tank, unless it was a group of friends..in which case all balance arguments go out the window anyways (because friends don't care if you are not contributing 100%).  In real world experience, the only buffs that matter are AotC (should never have been given to paladins) and Brell's.  In real world experience heals are for the knight themselves (not other group members, though obvoiusly occasionally for them too).  <br />
<br />
Melee have never, ever understood what &quot;utility&quot; meant to casters.  I'm not talking warrior/knight problems now.  This goes back to every battle ground between casters and pure melee ever had in eq.  Its been a sore point since day one because melee throw &quot;utility&quot; in casters faces and never understand how little real world value any of it has.  I remember when melee tried to use eb/levi/ports as reasons why casters should do little damage (none of those were self only btw....).<br />
<br />
You want to focus on &quot;utility&quot; as why knights should be universally worse then warriors.  Lets ignore real world importance and go strictly to paper.  Defensive is very, very nice.  Undeniably so, so lets add that in as a super important reason why warriors should *not* get what they want.  Oh, lets not forget evasive or any of the other discs too.  What?  These don't pan out to be that important in the real world?  Oh, wait, I forgot shield.  That is helpful to other people, not just yourself.  In fact, being able to draw a certain ammount of damage away from another person is about as good as healing for a paultry ammount.  Lets not forget about weapons that can snare and slow.  Sure they are unreliable and not as good as the real spells, but real world application doesn't matter here, were going strictly to paper.  <br />

<br />
WRONG!  Knights do exactly what you are describing.  You are on THE SAME MITIGATION TABLE AS A WARRIOR, and YOU OWN AGGRO LOCK.  Matter of fact, parses have recently shown that a similarly geared paladin took less damage from Quarm than a nondefensive warrior. YOU are unquestionably the best at both mitigation and aggro right now.  Explain to me why it's ok for knights to have this advantage when warriors do not.  How is that balanced?<br />
<br />
Oh, and in response to your &quot;defensive is nice and is a very important factor&quot; bullshit, no actually defensive is one of the biggest detriments to the warrior class. Defensive lasts 3 minutes, during which my DPS drops to nothing.  If that's what I got in exchange for group heals, LoH, Harm Touch, feign, buffs, self haste, lifetaps, pacify, stun, snare and a long list of other neat &quot;utility&quot; abillities, I got fucked. Hard.  Oh, and those weapons that snare and slow, point me to the vendor that sells those in shadowhaven, because it damned well better be the same guy that sells the cease and desist spells pallys can still lock aggro with at level 65 for next to no mana.   Warriors have been getting shafted for a really long time, and anyone with at least half a brain can see that.  So either you're a complete idiot that just cant see the problem, or you're terrified that someone at SOE is finally going to wake up and realize that knights are overpowered and do something about it.  Which is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, no knight has all those abilities, you just lumped everything that two entirely seperate classes get into one sentence.<br />
<br />
As for your statement that knights are currently the best at both mitigation and agro, the solution is that warriors need a boost in mitigation and/or hp.</div></div><hr />

Mitigation and hp are fine, I have no problem giving those to warriors.  It needs to come in the form of a warrior boost as opposed to a knight nerf though so that knights can still tank better than monks, rangers, shaman, etc.<br />
<br />
Aggro I have to disagree with.  If you take away mitigation and hp, aggro is really the only thing that SKs are best in.  &quot;Utility&quot; and being 2nd or 3rd best in each tanking skill means that we're never the top choice for any group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You're right Noctix, I did.  I was pretty angry at the injustice of someone who really does own both aggro and mitigation telling me that owning both was wrong and wanting to know what entitled warriors to such godliness.  But if you break them down and just attribute paladin abilities to paladins, and sk abilities to sk's, then compare them to /disc defensive, there's still no comparison.  Defensive just plain sucks compared to what knights get from thier spellbooks.  Again, that has been demonstrated repeatedly on these boards, so seeing it in that post sorta pushed my buttons a little.  And I'm not sure that I agree that beefing us up any more is the way to go.  Basically, it doesn't matter if I have a billion hps if I can't get the mobs to hit me.  If your  answer is jack up warrior aggro to something at least approaching knight aggro, and give us enough HP and AC to make a noticeable difference, then I might agree with you.  My reason being, once a tank has enough hp to survive a fight given the healing power available in his group, any more hp is just a margin for healer error, which is trivialized if one tank can lock aggro and the other can't even come close to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jynn Tlespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'm not even going to respond to some of the rants and insults regarding paladins, but I would like to post just one more opinion.  I chose a paladin as my main character when I started because the idea of being a fighter and yet also being able to support my companions appealed to me.  I didn't want to be mt because I didn't want that responsibility most of the time even though the third character I created was a warrior.  I didn't want the responsibilty of being a cleric and knowing people would die if I made a mistake even though I made a cleric as my fourth character.  I want to be the knight templar.  The one who does battle against evil and particularly the evil undead and serves the needs of her companions.  <br />
<br />
I don't cast better buffs than others although Brells is nice if there isn't a beast buff.  I was not created to replace casters, but rather augment them occasionally.  <br />
<br />
I don't heal better although I can group heal to take the pressure off the healer.  I can lay hands on the mt, cleric or chanter if there is an emergency.  I can step back and cast a quick heal or a spot heal if needed.  I am supporting my healer, not replacing them. <br />
<br />
I can't nuke a mob although I have a very few spells that do direct damage they are basically not worth casting.  That's fine.  I didn't create a caster, I created a fighter.<br />
<br />
My utility, in my opinion, lies in the fact that I have some versatility.  I can help spam heal the mt in a raid.  I can step back and keep someone alive with healing for a short period of time if needed or, as stated before, I can help with group heals.<br />
<br />
I can cast cease and draw immediate aggro when the puller is bringing a group in and OT until the MT is ready for my mob.  I can stun a mob distracting it long enough for ch to land on the tank or until tank can get aggro off caster.  In the absence of a slower I could stun enough to keep the tank from getting pounded to dirt.  Or, big if here, if we have a tank who has confidence in his abilities and my timing is right, I can cast a stun peridically during the fight that simply slows the mob's dps without stealing aggro.  I can spin stun to reposition a mob that might be in a wall or too close to the edge.  It's part of the joy of being a knight to me to be able to use stuns, root, heals creatively to make the group work more efficiently.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the call to nerf the stuns is going to solve this dilemna.  It will make the paladin less desired and therefore open up more spots in groups I suppose, but it will also make the groups work much harder.  If putting more challenge back in the game is the desired result then that might work.<br />
<br />
It seems to me, the biggest problem is aggro control.  I have seen a total of one post mentioning a warrior and a paladin working together with the paladin getting the snap aggro and then passing off to the warrior.  Perhaps this isn't the perfect solution, but I do know it works.  The beauty of this to me is that it shows characters who have figured out how to work together to utilize both of their classes to the utmost.  I do hope Sony does something soon to improve the warrior's aggro ability and possibly add some other things to increase their inate warrior abilities.<br />
<br />
I noticed on another thread a paladin said he joined a group as the last member and they made him mt over the better equipped warrior.  I would have had to find some excuse to not mt.  I have done that before and it just means I have to pay a little closer attention to aggro and either divine favor someone or distract the mob.  If I wanted to be a mt all the time I would play my warrior.<br />
<br />
I guess the point I am making is that not all knights want to be warriors.  Many of us enjoy the support role, but part of that support is being able to tank when called upon.  Many guilds don't have the luxury of having a collection of high end warriors and so the beastlords, paladins, shadowknights and rangers become our tanks when the warriors aren't available.   The solution is not nerfing one class to make the warrior more desireable because then you will just have to go down the list nerfing the rest of the classes to level the playing field.  Paladins are not the enemies, they are your brothers and sisters in arms and should be there to fill in the gaps in the lines and even step up to the front if the gap is there.  The solution is to adjust the warrior up so he is the front line tank of choice and the classes all work together to complement each other.  When all the parts, like fingers on a hand, work together to do something great things can be accomplished. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, it's still nice when we all have a job and we are all needed and not just needed when the groups are scraping the bottom of the barrel and you are the last possible option.</div></div><hr />
