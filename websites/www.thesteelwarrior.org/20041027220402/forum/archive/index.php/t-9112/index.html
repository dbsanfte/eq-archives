Weaponry when we parced requires 2.8 million dmg in 15 minutes w/ 6 people.  If you use the correct weapons you get a bonus but it doesn't seem to offset the large amount of dmg required. <br />
<br />
I have a pretty solid group I hang around with taciv and inktu'ta weapons and we still failed and had to dump our back up healer, shaman and caster for 5 melee and 1 cleric to complete this one.<br />
<br />
What have your experiances been with this trial?  Has anyone been able to finish it with less than 4 or 5 melee?  It's possible it's tuned for upgrades we will see in oow,  we found a 24/20 weapon and some other things off simple 1 group stuff in oow so maybe raid items will be a signifcant dps boost for melee.</div></div><hr />

Wow great, another set of trials requiring a totally set group in order to have any success...  Wow, that's pretty retarded.  Thanks for the great information Brutall though.<br />

Out of curiosity, do pets wielding 'blunt' 'slashing' weapons and such get bonuses?</div></div><hr />

 First it was whining about how tanks / melee couldn't get this and that in GoD because they only needed one tank for a trial blah blah, now that they give melee a chance to do something with the &quot;useless&quot; skills, bitch about it? Bravo! :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did this with four melee (warrior, rogue, ranger, SK) and two casters (cleric, shaman).

Brutall, i noticed there are a lot of weapon drops from the mini-named in RS.  not the best weapons in the world, but decent weapons, 16 19 1hb, 48 32 2hs type stuff, no drop weapons.  they aren't too hard to farm either for a well equipped qvic+ group of 70's - especially if you have new spells - and a decent selection of modest ratioed weapons can really help on that trial.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, what good is a 16/19 for a group of Qvic people though?<br />
<br />
Unless perhaps what you mean is that most Qvic grouped people don't have all the required weapon types?</div></div><hr />

bingo.  not necessarily everyone has a 1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs, and piercing weapon with strong ratios.  I know if i needed a piercing weapon, the old willsapper would be coming out &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">gemmed velium weapons from GoD are decent ratios that most guilds should beable to make at that level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frax, if they are 'only' requried for progression, and do not drop any interim nice rewards (ala Glyphed Prayer Rings) and only one is required per guild I agree with you.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand they drop excellent farmable loot, or are required for progression this is a joke that needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe they drop 220+ HP items from there (maybe higher?) and they also increase your resist cap.  I don't think they're required for progression but certainly any raider would want the increase resist cap part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">heh I've done body 3 times now.  Today we had the Hulking Bazu first (needed slashers), we had a group of monk, ranger, warrior(me), cleric, shaman, mage.<br />
<br />
I used 1hs'ers bloodfrenzy/jos for awhile, then swapped to plankton... was hitting for 7k with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2nd mob (Steelshock I think the name is) for some reason didn't have any immunities (or atleast none that we figured out) it wasn't hand to hand, not piercing, not 2hand piercing, not hand to hand, not 1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs...Sooo we just beat the shit out of it as the timer ticked down, had 3minutes left after he died and couldn't get to the dragorn. But this seems really bugged imo, the first time we did the trial I used ifir / wicked shank and Steelshock was goin down fast as hell, since then its seemed like he's had/has no weaknesses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I've only tried it once but I could have sworn Steelshock was the guy we got first and blunt was his weakness.  I was averaging over 700 DPS with Cranial Bludgeoner.  Unfortunately the next mob we got was piercing weakness and only the shaman had a piercer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">pretty sure the order changes every time in this trial, the order of the mobs you get and the order of weapons you need to use on each mob change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Steelshock for us the other day had no weaknesses and was mitigating the hell out of melee.  I went through my entire range of weapons (1HB, 2HB, 1HS, 2HS, Piericing) and nothing changed... I would score critical hits and you see what the hit would have been, but he was only taking 30% or so of the damage.  Hes also immune to archery and throwing.  The only thing he didn't mitigate were my kicks, which sadly, as a ranger, caps at about 60 damage non-crit.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe this was the &quot;caster&quot; weak mob, but my Fire and Cold nukes, while hitting easily, weren't gaining any bonuses like melee does on the weak ones.  Shaman and ENchanter were using their nukes, covering the other resists.<br />
<br />
Steelshock just takes forever to kill and eats a large chunk of your time.  Hopefully we will have better succcess tonight with some new weapons to replace our weaker ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Let me repharse.<br />
<br />
I am totally OK with some content that favours some classes over others, that's balance.<br />
<br />
What is NOT balance, is having some content that is so skewed, that it is absolutely not winnable if you have certain classes in your group.<br />
<br />
I am fine with not being the best DPS, but I feel that no content should be skewed in such a way that certain classes are precluded slots out of necessity.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense?</div></div><hr />

have u tried arrows or throwing on that mob ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Tried everything...nukes were being resisted including the new OoW level 66+ ones, Kicks and Bashes were hitting for full but thats about it, and it still wasnt any huge bonus just normal damage. Think next time I try this we'll dispell him first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Did another weaponry last night, and had the dragorn take 6 minutes to kill despite being vulnerable to 1hs, which 4 melee in the group had time+ quality of.<br />
That's fucked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We did another Weaponry last night as well....<br />
<br />
Steekshock = 3:03 minutes of fighting to kill<br />
Hemkai = 6:00 minutes of fighting to kill<br />
Granite Guardian = 5:17 minutes when we ran out of time, he was at 4%<br />
<br />
Group was Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Enchanter, Druid and Cleric.... quick question... do you have to kill all 4 in the 15 minutes? or just 3?  We found some adjustments we can make to easily kill 3 in 15 minutes, but 4 will be outside the reach of that group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">have to kill all 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Then unless there are some rally dramatic changes in weapons available in OoW, the event in my opinion needs to be tuned by cutting the HP of the 3 that are weak to specific melee types down to 70-80% of their current levels.  Otherwise, its going to be impossible for some classe to participate and have a hope of winning.<br />
<br />
I figure it would have taken us 5:30 minutes to finish off the Granite Guardian, and for the 5:17 minutes we did get on him, I did 1020 DPS (984 of it was crush damage only) using Demerix and Timeweaver.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>stehle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">One thing to note, Pets (MAG / BST) do not suffer the same limitations that PCs do when it comes to weapon type.  So if a mob requires blunt weapons to hit, a pet with piercing will still damage it normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You guys have the weaknesses of the mobs wrong:<br />
<br />
Dragorn - weak to pierce.<br />
Golem - weak to blunt.<br />
Bazu - weak to slash.<br />
Steelshock - weak to uh nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Edit: And on a side note, the trials are still broken as of the latest patch.   You will still lose your Trial win and the resistance bonus gained if you train a new AA after a win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I thought the mobs have so much HP that if you don't have the right weapon they might as well be immune to other damages just because they've so much HPs?<br />
<br />
Would a pet using the right weapon types get elevated damage?  That'd actually put a pet's DPS to be about the same as anyone who can't use all 3 types of primary weapon damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well it is beatable, but not without a pretty handpicked group and buffers on the side. Did this with me + 2 rangers + 1 rogue + wizard + cleric. Rangers slowed the mobs with their earthcallers and then switched to DPS, and we botted a shaman for champion(group FA+10% increased damage mod) outside the trial. We won it with 1 min to spare.<br />
<br />
Oh and they have fixed the trial AAs now. Just hail a projection and you get them all back if they were lost.</div></div><hr />

Pre NERF DD was a lot easier with cleric/cleric/warrior, though it was doable with cleric + a supremely aa'd other healer, if the warrior was seriously geared up and you got lucky on crit heals/damage.<br />

I don't mind hard content.  I think that's great.  What pisses me off is content where you are forced into a certain very restrictive group make up.</div></div><hr />

Just confirming that, it's true. At last count this trial had only been beaten a handful of times, while the others were being beaten regularly. The devs are aware of that disparity, and it may be changed or it may not -- but it's being looked into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Some talk about trying 1hb and 2hb on the same mob.  Are there mobs that are vulnerable to 1hb and not to 2hb or 1hs and not to 2hs?  I'm guessing no but don't know for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">One thing I love about the 1 group trials and they nailed this one so nicely it deserves mentioning.  Regardless of what group you have their is a trial for you.  <br />
<br />
No slower&gt;&gt;ingenuity, <br />
No CC heavy melee&gt;&gt;weaponry,  <br />
Necro and no cc  &gt;&gt; fear <br />
ect ect   their is even one you can do without a priest<br />
<br />
It is a hell of a nice job, I'm not sure if this was intended or not but if you have somone in your group who knows what they are doing they can find a beatable trial for nearly any group.<br />
<br />
Now if they only would realize that they forgot to put in slow midigation on some instances and wizards are tanking bosses for 200 hp loot, we would have something.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea what weapons everyone was using for each but I know each of us had at least one set that was not all that hot...for example I was using two Velium Gemmed Daggers for the piercing mob, although most of us did have Time/Qvic or above for the other weapons.  The only outside buff we had was a DS from a level 66 Druid, and the cleric/enchanter both had 9/sym instead of Conv.  As stated in the last post the DoT damage from the bard is not shown.<br />

Trial is definately doable in the current state, just not easy.  Took us 8 tries before we won and on the 6th and 7th try the 4th mob was at 0% when we failed.</div></div><hr />
