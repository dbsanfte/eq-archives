<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What exactly is this?  Why is it used?  I've heard of people using it for things like vindi?  or maybe it was AoW.  Also heard that there is a problem with larger races doing this while shrunk because &quot;geometry&quot;?  I'd just like to know if someone can expand on what it is?  and what the problems are.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By backing yourself into a corner with the mob facing you it stabilizes the mob so there is no push.. makes it so the entire rest of the raid party has the back 180 degrees so no riposte/dodge/parry from the mob.<br />
<br />
I dont know about problems with large race warriors and geometry because my warrior is a halfling, but I do know you have to be fully shrunk so that you can continue to hit the mob when it is that close to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having played with some corner tanking since the last patch it does seem that the large races (barb, ogre, troll) can not corner most mobs even when double shrunk like they used to be able to.  Being a barbarian myself I had zero luck on any of the mobs in VT and had to resort to the old rainbow pin position.  Guild went back to do AoW tonight so I grabbed illusion halfling just to test if all cornering was kind of off or just the large races.  I had absolutely no problem keeping AoW cornered while in halfling form.  <br />
<br />
Must say it kind of aggravates me that large races can no longer corner mobs like this, hopefully it is just a bug that will be corrected next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macbrother</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an ogre, I haven't really had a problem yet with very large mobs like AoW since patch.  However, in VT, especially on the 4arms, I have to struggle to get them cornered whereas the smaller races have less of a problem.  Also, it seems to depend somewhat on the corner as well.<br />
<br />
Other then never taking the mobs defenses, the other benefit is you never once get any out of range errors or can't see the mob errors.  Everyone's hits are nearly perfectly landing, it makes a huge difference to dps if you can get it cornered successfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 biggest advantages:<br />
<br />
1) exposed back of the mob for all<br />
2) No movement by raid force due to push.  This simplifies things for healers, nukers, and those dodging AE.<br />
<br />
Biggest disadvantage:  breaks archery for the rangers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We actually use our ranjah brigade to to make up for a relative lack of caster DPS, so we often try to avoid cornering the mob.<br />
<br />
However, cornering is the safest and most effective strategy for many many encounters, archers be damned :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaos13</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it makes most fights so much easier, you lose DPS from ranger arrows but you still keep rogue DPS w/o the mob running around in and out of range from everyone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the problem with Rangers?  Is it some sort of &quot;you can't see your target&quot; message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I am an ogre.  Seems that some corners may give me trouble even double shrunk from what I hear.  But, if I get a crown of deciet eff illusion wood elf then double shrunk?  Should I not be fine?<br />
<br />
P.S.  on that same line of thinking.. if I use illusion wood elf.. don't I loose my frontal stun immunity and no shield bash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macbrother</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will not lose your frontal stun immunity.  You will however lose the ability to slam.<br />
<br />
As for archery, any time a mob is touching a wall the arrows simply won't hit it, they will just poof.</div></div><hr />
