<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, the fact that you are a frog will make things harder than they would be if you chose a race that could worship rallos zek.  Being a froggy woshipping Mithaniel Marr, you will probably be working toward ornate on your chest, head, arms, wrists, hands, legs, and feet (or, if you have plenty of time on your hands, get the LDoN Tak armors) as you approach 65.  Up until the mid 50s, you could get by well with some MM cultured armor I suppose (I don't know the stats, but I'm pretty sure it exists).  Work for a soulscream belt (drops in veksar, 31% haste).  For weapons, work for a Great Staff of Thunder or the Copper Hamme of Striking/Sword of the Bloodsworn combo.  For earrings, get a couple with more than 50 HPs on then.  For rings, get some Valorium Rings of Gallantry.  In your range, get a bow with HPs on it.  Face, mask, shoulders, and back are pretty much up to you.  Go AC or HPs.  I know you aren't high enough level to wear alot of this stuff, but it is what you should be working for.  There is better dropable than these, but they cost losts and you say you are getting pp as you level, so they aren't an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>castigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the feedback on armour and weps ill work twords some cultural and as i get into my 20s ill try to hit some ldon groups hopefully ill luck into some good stuff but now i have an idea what im goin for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LDoN plate armor is being used as a skill-up path by a lot of smiths on Stromm server. You can get pieces for 90 - 150pp per slot. It's cheap, has good resists, and can be worn into your 40's. (I have a guildmate who was wearing it in her high-50's.)</div></div><hr />
