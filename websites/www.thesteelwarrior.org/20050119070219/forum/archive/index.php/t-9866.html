<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah construct drops it my bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ichkabibel2</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you need 5 items to spawn the horror construct<br />
<br />
1) crude bone altar -- drops off thulian high ritualist, 3 day spawn, easy mob, he spawns on top floor of the 4c pyramid with the amygdalans<br />
<br />
2) black ooze filled phylactery -- random drop off any black ooze that spawns after any caster or protector Thul tae ew lizard (browns)<br />
<br />
3) flesh bound tome -- drops only off Thul Tae ew Lifestealers... <br />
<br />
4) Black Powdered incense -- drops only off Thul Tae ew Judicators...  3 and 4 are definately the hardest pieces to get, but there are several good spots in zone to farm them.  1 is the top level of 4c pyramid.  if you're on the side opposite the amygdalans its totally safe, the first lizard you'll see on the next floor down will either be a bloodcaller or lifestealer, always 50/50 chance, if you go around the left corner, there will be a justicar or Judicator, again 50/50 chance... the drop rate is probably around 1 in 5 so you might have to be up here for a while... but you can camp enraged amygdalan while doing so for some decent masks.  facing the amygdalans, enraged is the furthest left of the 4.  <br />
<br />
Another place to get these two pieces is the blue flame temple, or mud temple, depending on server (might have other names). Its accessed by going north through the double doors in the courtyard and along a long hallway, through an arena filled with raptors.  this area is fairly dangerous so you'll probably want a pacifier or harmonyer.  on the left side of the room theres a campfire with 2 bloodcallers/lifestealers, again about a 50/50 chance each.  judicators can spawn in any of the brown lizard spots at the base and top of the pyramid, theres like 8 total so bring a full group to clear them all and the pieces should drop pretty well.  this place is alot better than the spot at 4c but its also a bit tougher.<br />
<br />
5) Tear Encrusted Obsidian Quill -- drops off any mini brown lizard in the maze.  the minis spawn at the dead-end pyramid with a miniature avatar of fear (non targetable) standing on top of it.  from the wizard portal, go south and east as much as possible and its a short distance away.  again about a 1 in 5 drop rate, maybe a little worse.  this camp can be either really fast or painfully long, i usually kill the 5 minis, then invis down to sewers and kill the PH for ft3 boots while waiting on respawn.<br />
<br />
once you have all 5, combine the phylactery / incense / tome / quill inside the crude bone altar and you get the Phobonomicon of Thul Tae Ew.. you can either turn this into an erudite NPC in the feerott for a 10ac FT3 51recommended lvl necklace (no other stats).  Or you can turn the tome into the living void at the very top of 4c and spawn the Horror Construct..  i've fought this guy several times and he's really not too difficult, however you're going to want 350 MR or so (so bring a bard most likely) so that you can resist his AE and knockback.    The AE is just a small gravity flux, iirc you dont even take damage if you have lev, but since its a bone dragon and their hitboxes are EXTREMELY small, getting knocked around is just a huge pain in the ass.   his single target knockback on the other hand is potentially a raid wiper, if you're knocked down to the bottom of the pyramid and agro anything before getting summoned back, you're going to have one hell of a train on your hands.  <br />
the guy himself is really easy, quad 400 or 450ish unslowable.  drops 2-4 loot, mask seems to be fairly common (3 in 5 kills) and some of his other loot isn't too bad either.  hope my guide was helpful, and enjoy the wonders of CT farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the above post is kinda wrong... the tome/Powder dont only drop off those said mobs, they can drop off any of the gold lizzards that spawn a black ooze on death.. I have did this quest well over 30 times.... yes 30 times, normally stop at the neck and sell it, but have killed construct 3-4 times, and he only droped one mask, and its still the only one to have ever droped on Druzzil Ro.<br />
<br />
The best place to camp is hands down the top of the temple in 4c, its a safe spot, and any ranger/cleric/ench/druid can single pull mobs all day from up there.  <br />
<br />
Getting there can be a pita if u duo, there is ALOT of pats in 4c, normally i used my ranger and innate camo and used harmony to harmony the see invis at the bottom of the temple, and just ran around until i got on the piramid and cleared from there, its pretty simple once your on the piramid, all single pulls easy if you have harmony.  <br />
<br />
The first spawn on the pyramid is the placeholder for spirtcaller, he is kinda rare, but always drops 2 loots, and can drop some 15 sta 65 hp shoulders that sell for a decent amount on most servers, its a ok place to camp, but it does have repops, unlike the top of the temple.<br />
<br />
Above post is right for the quill, and the combine..<br />
<br />
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br />
<br />
After you have made the combine, u can hand it to a mob in Ferrott, right across the river toward fear from CT and get a 10 ac ft3 neck, or you can hand it to the ooze on top of the temple in 4c.  And by on top, he is really ONTOP, you hae to run up the middle wall by the enraged tae ew lizzards.  He isnt to bad, but can be anoying, your dps will be cut greatly since he gfluxes every 20-30 seconds, and has the melee box of a gnome even tho he is huge =(.<br />
<br />
Everyone gets lev, clear the mobs around him, spawn him, he is perma rooted, have your tank put his back outwards towards one of the 4 pillars on each side, this way if u get unlucky and a weird knockback he wont fly off the pyramid... then just beat him down, and collect your loot.  If you have low dps you might get a repop or 2 during the fight, just mes them and keep fighting... His loot is random, but normally 2 or 3 items, have seen him drop 4 once, never seen him drop 1.  and Goodluck to ya, if you just want a good mask this is more of a pain in the arse then its worth, camp your bot near vxed, or near MPG and just exp to farm them one of the random drop masks, its alot easier to obtain.</div></div><hr />

Both posts could be right, because Aatma farms CT hardcore, or did!</div></div><hr />

100% possitive</div></div><hr />

It is superior in every way and MUCH more likely to drop.</div></div><hr />
