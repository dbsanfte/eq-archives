However, I can't really find anything that looks beneficial for a warrior.  Any suggestions on what I could purchase or is there something I should save up for that will be helpful down the road?</div></div><hr />

10 AC, Face/Neck/Back/Waist/Shoulders<br />

Its one of the better buyable aug, but you might be better off sitting on the points unless you are using something in one of those slots that you are unlikely to upgrade for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Miraguls has decent armor at 760pts / pc while takish has tops for 1492 pts / pc. Arms / boots / helm from either camp would last a long time imo, ornate bp / legs can be basically the same or better so I wouldn't waste pts on them (LDoN bp / legs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree on the 10 AC aug, I have 4 of them and if I had a decent face item I'd have all 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not reccomend Tak 1492 armor.  It's far too many points for the minor upgrade from Mir 760 armor.  You'd be better off spending the extra points on augments.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm going for Tak, but I play a ton and I'm on the leaderboard so it makes sense for someone like me who already has more than 15,000 LDoN points.  For most warriors, Everfrost is the place for armor and Anger3 augs.  Once you unlock Everfrost, you can then use the points you earned in Butcherblock or wherever else.<br />
<br />
10ac augs are sure nice though and, if you can predict your next haste item, it's probably safe to aug the cloak or the belt you're wearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I respectfully disagree with your analysis of the Tak armor vs. the Mir armor.  If you compare the items, you're generally gaining 3 or 4 AC and 15 hit points for your extra 732 points. <br />
<br />
Now, consider.  If one of the camps had a 3 or 4 AC, 15 hit point augment, that went in all visible armor locations, and *did not consume an augment slot*...wouldn't people be really excited about it?  My guess is that it would be the second most purchased augment, after the +40 HP aug.<br />
<br />
Compare it to the 20 hp/20 mana aug, for 1150 AP, which people are (reluctantly) buying for armor locations that don't allow the 40 hp aug.  Wouldn't you rather have a 4 AC/15 hp aug for 732?<br />
<br />
Especially if it didn't occupy an augment slot?<br />
<br />
Yes, it's painful to save up the whole 1492 rather than getting two pieces of Miragul's armor.  But if you buy the Tak armor, and you aug it properly, you won't find anything better outside EP/VT.  Given that you'll most likely be investing 2000+ AP in auging the base gear, doesn't it make sense to spend the points for the base gear as optimally as possible?<br />
<br />
Or, to put it another way; I can get droppable armor in the bazaar for most armor slots that is halfway decent.  I'd rather have halfway decent armor most locations, and a small but increasing number of locations with armor I'll never, ever need to upgrade, than have slightly-better-than-halfway-decent armor in most locations, and have to eventually replace it all if I want to be at the top of the game.<br />
<br />
But I digress.  My main point is this: don't think of it as costing twice as much as Miragul's armor.  Think of it as having a fourth aug slot, which takes an AC 3/15 HP aug that costs 732 AP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think tak armor is the way to go if you are a casual player that is going to wear the armor for a long time.  If you're on your way to the elementals and just want to fill in some gaps in your gear until you get there then Miragul all the way.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be one of the ones eager for a 732 point aug that only gave me 3 or 4 AC and 15 HP.   Your analysis looks reasonable to me, but there's a space remaining at the bottom for a *YMMV* clause.  <br />
<br />
To me, it's like the recent kitchen renovations the missus and I did - the solid oak cabinetry was better than the oak veneer stuff we bought.  It looked better, it was easier to install, and a little more solid.  But it wasn't twice as good and at twice the price, the only way we could have gotten it is to wait through another year of saving to finish the kitchen - instead of fixing up the living room.  But at the same time, there were some elements of the kitchen we did NOT skimp on - we could have saved money  installing ceramic tile ourselves, but for slightly over double the cost we got the floor re-levelled and professionally installed slate.<br />
<br />
In other words - take all these general considerations to heart, but take the time to understand the specific natures of what is available, and what you need.  And don't forget that you can spend those MMC points at any camp, once you have unlocked the items there.  And peruse the searchable database at http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I were on my way to the elemental planes (and oh, if only I had the time to be!), I wouldn't buy either the Miragul's or the Tak armor.  I'd be saving my points to put +40 HP augs on the lovely Raex's armor I'd be getting soon, and figure that whatever I could get for cheap DKP's on the way would be good enough.<br />
<br />
The LDoN armor only really becomes interesting when aug'ed.  If you're not going to aug it, Ornate is generally a better option than un-aug'ed Mir's, and nearly as good as un-aug'ed Tak.  And if you're only buying the LDoN armor to hold you until the elemental planes, you're sure hell not gonna be blowing another 2k per piece to aug it up.<br />
<br />
Which is why it only makes sense to me to hold out for the Tak armor.  If you're going to replace the armor, don't get LDoN armor at all; buy ornate or take the unwanted drops from the things your guild is killing now.  If you're not going to replace it, then you'll already be spending 2700ish points to get fully aug'ed Mir's armor; or you could spend 3400ish points and get armor with +4 AC and +15 HP.<br />
<br />
I just don't see the Miragul's armor as being that big a win.  Even with only two pieces of Tak armor, and with no access to the high-end crafted (I worship Lord Agnos), I'm more than capable of tanking mobs up through Luclin.  It seems to me that waiting to buy armor until you can afford the best is a small cost for a big gain.<br />
<br />
Then again, I plan to aug my BP and legs with the +40 HP aug, before I buy my arms or boots.  Just to minimize the number of slots where I might end up wasting points if something better came along (in another expansion, or via a lucky drop of ornate arms or what have you).<br />
<br />
Maybe I just take the long view a bit much.<br />

Not in my opinion.  But from every perspective the long view is unique.</div></div><hr />
