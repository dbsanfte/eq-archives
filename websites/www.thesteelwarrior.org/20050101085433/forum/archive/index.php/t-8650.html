Recently received my starter CD set that allows me to create my new toon.  Here's where the problem is.  I'm running a GeForce 4 MX420 64 MB video card.  Side of the box said all its needed for minimum req's is 64MB.  Yet for some dumbass reason on install I am told its not good enough.<br />
<br />
Now I don't know if I am doing something wrong, something I need to check in my bios or whatever, yet am a bit preturbed with SoE on that.<br />
<br />
Yes I know I can go out and get a better Vid card for a rather inexpensive price.  Just wasn't planning on getting that until closer of actual release date.<br />
<br />
Anywho if someone else is having this problem and knows of a work around ~not involving buying a new card~ lemme know please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
edit: yea &quot;-Video Card: DirectX 9 compatible. Pixel shader and vertex shader compatible hardware with 64 MB of texture memory &quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you see MX on the box of a GeForce card, it's probably not worth your time if you're wanting to play games.  MX is the tag for &quot;cheap version&quot; in NVidia.  GF4MX is probably the greatest offender in marketing I've seen, because people think it's a GF4 and it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">either way, the GF4's arent advanced enough to handle any of the latest games anymore.  Although, my bro's GeForce 4 MX 440 agp card out performs my FX 5200...and then he got an FX 5900XT...the lower end FX's reeeally suck, you dont really get good quality cards for the price unless you get a 5900XT or 5950 ultra.  But now the 6800 series blows everything else out of the water.<br />
<br />
PS IMO radeon sucks too, ive never used a radeon and i never will.  though that might also have something to do with the fact that my uncle designs the nvidia chipsets...</div></div><hr />

Obviously it sucks because you don't use it, right?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Radeon cards are actually pretty good, and until these last couple batches of new cards, it used to be if you were a serious gamer, you went with ATI. Nvidia finally caught up, and now that they're on par, its more of a personal preference based on card features and such.<br />
<br />
Nvidia has pretty much guarenteed compatibility with all games, and last I heard the latest and greatest card(s) from them will feature DirectX 9.0c hardware features, which means more pretty effects or more effecient renderings of existing ones.<br />
<br />
ATI was always about the raw power, and if you turned on AA/AF (Anti-Aliasing/Anisotropic Filtering), you'd get a minimal drop in FPS. ATI has always handled high resolutions and advanced effects better, but such performance comes at the cost of some stability. The drivers aren't the best around either, but they're improving. Nvidia cards start to choke when you up the resolution, or turn on stuff like AA/AF, which is another advantage that ATI cards have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have a tendency to think that whatever i dont use sucks...ati's...pentiums...but that doesnt mean that they actually DO suck.  i mean, id rather have a pentium 4 with an ati card than a MAC &lt;---*evil*<br />
<br />
i guess i just developed a 'product loyalty' or something, plus i pay my uncle a little bit every time i get an nvidia :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything in my puter is the same.  <br />

<br />
<br />
well, like I said no problems, just gfx lag at times with the lappy.<br />
<br />
<br />
great game and cant wait to see more warriors in it.<br />
<br />
for a while everyone went fighters due to a thing called HO, but because it was overpowered (and allowed fighters to solo as well as a caster)  they nerfed it asap.<br />
<br />
b ut other than that, this game is eqoa on crack, pretty much.</div></div><hr />

( better then the 5200, 5500, and 5700) and its pretty decent priced as well <br />

She's getting this http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/98476/rpem/ccd/productDetailReview.do#tabs<br />
for 80.<br />
I'm getting http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=2667356/search=9600%20radeon<br />
for 75 from a friend. <br />
<br />
Are these good for their prices? Are they good enough to handle EQ2?</div></div><hr />
