However they don't drop off the same mob and certainly don't drop every time, so I'll be taking whichever one I see first. It is true that the augmented BoWar WILL give you a bit more agro, but an unauged BoWar is already a fantastic weapon, and a SEWS with Anger3 would be on another level above that. Add in a Call of Sky/Fire or Symbol of the Planemasters proc and you're good to go.</div></div><hr />

Having mobs youre not attacking or taunting turn from clercs etc.. on to you and gaining hate on mezzed mobs around you is very nice, the rune definitely isnt worthless either. I assume BoW is slightly better single target agro, I'm not really sure what the multiplier is for runes hate calculation but I'm guessing between 2 - 2.5 (I would bet on 2.5 or even higher if I had to)  making the SEWS 460 - 575 ae hate compared to the 700 single target hate of EB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rune aggro from the sews is never, ever that much hate.  It's probably barely 200 if you are lucky.  The rune aggro doesn't compare at all to anger or EB.  Just imagine for a sec what kind of aggro number a 1k rune would get an enchanter casting that near a raid target assuming a pitifull rune was 500-600 aggro?  Rune would mean instant-summon and insta death all the time.<br />
<br />
Anger 3 on a sews will give greater benefit and make it very close to a BoW.  To a point where now it really doesn't matter which one you get, try to get the first 1 you see.<br />
<br />
I will personnaly keep force of ykesha on my bow since 1) I don't like wasting points and 2) Aggro is already pretty good with that weapon and that the added dps (however small) is more important to me then the small added hate.<br />
<br />
And for pure aggro, nothing gonna beat a Dark Blade/Whatever combo with 2 anger 3 augments anyway.  The reason you use a BoW/sews over that combo is because it's a 2-hander and you get half the riposte and because both are in theory much easier to get then a Dark Blade + Edge for example.<br />

And well SEWS has 'ae aggro' feature, rune proc that mitigate some dmg and has a slightly higher dps. BoW is slightly better for raid, SEWS slightly better for XP grp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
shrug Ive been using it for 6 months, I have a boc in my bag I used before I got it, I have a 65 enchanter as my alt and Ive ofcourse played with BoW wielding warriors in every setting. IMO runes are atleast a 2.5 multiplier, It could possibly be a 2x multiplier sure, I havent ran extensive testing and I likely never will. But its definitley not a direct 1-1 hate value or even a fraction making it 200. <br />
<br />
If I'm right then a hypothetical 1k rune would be 2k-2500 hate and rune of zeb would be 1700-2150 hate which also sounds right to me, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have extensively been using a BBB, and I have to say rune 3 is NOT snap aggro, or even good aggro. There is no way rune 3 (230 hp rune) is even 400 aggro, let alone more. I can hold aggro decently well with it on multiple mobs, but I have to proc a whole lot of times to grab aggro from anyone or even keep aggro over heals on slowed mobs. I'd guess rune 3 as a proc is no more than 1:1 for hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a small test, will probably do some more some other time when I can get another SK or info to one.<br />
<br />
Two test mobs, each consisted of me pulling haven guards in netherbia with a succesful taunt, SK then casted terror of thule (+600 direct hate) 2x to gain agro from me (so initial agro bonus is between 601-1199?) then I would cast runes on my enchanter until I got agro and he would taunt with the taunt key at that point making us within 1 point of each other on the hate list and negating any initial agro bonus. At this point we had the following results both times<br />
<br />
2x thule (1201 hate) took 1 rune of zeb (850pt rune) to snap the guard to enchanter, SK then succesfully taunted<br />
<br />
2x thule (1201 hate) took 1 rune V (700pt rune) to snap the guard to enchanter, Sk then succesfully taunted<br />
<br />
1x thule (601 hate) took 2 rune 3 (230pt rune) to snap the guard to enchanter<br />
<br />
While this doesnt prove what the multiplier is, it does suggest there is definitely a multiplier and its higher than 1.7 and less than 2.6. Wish we had more time for the tests, hopefully we can do it again and find out the exact multiplier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the insight, i never thought of Rune proc as an AE taunt but that makes sence, and would be much better for lots of stiuations i'm in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, maybe 300 hate for a 230 rune could be about it or something like that.  It's probably very similar to heals.  But not saying your test was meaningless, but it's a bit more complicated then that, even thought it can indicate a few things.<br />
<br />
But 300, or around 300, is &quot;ok&quot;, but nowhere near 750 which basically translate to the non augmented sews versus bow, it's &quot;ok&quot; aggro, but not &quot;great&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want snappy agro, go for the BoW.  SEWS buys you extra survivability and some damage smoothing over snap agro.  That's the way I view the tradeoff.<br />
<br />
I have a SEWS and I don't rely on procs to gain agro.  I have other tools/methods for that (initial agro, proximity, slamming/kicking from an oblique angle, taunt, /shield, other warriors bagging thier agro weaps when I am MA, etc.)  SEWS holds agro fine once you have it.  I may snap in an Anger aug to lock it in some more, but I need a better DPS weapon/setup first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the proc on the BBB is no more than 200-300 aggro, it definitely doesn't stack up at all to a single EB proc. This is going from personal experience. However there is a  benefit of a rune proc, and that its aggro has a small AE affect. Not a big one, but a small one.</div></div><hr />

I cant use it, if I aint tanking. Well I can but then I have to turn off attack alot. I am thinking to switch to SEWS with Anger3, thats like BoW, just with rune proc, but I dont know. Ykesha proc is pretty good agro too.<br />
<br />
I think BoW is a little better, but it aint much. That rune proc has saved me more than 3 times when tanking a god.<br />

And imo, SEWS look &gt;&gt;&gt; BoW look, but thats me :D</div></div><hr />

oh, and for raid situation, BoW&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SEWS for individual aggro<br />
I guess you can argue that SEWS is better for exp groups if your puller is retarded and gets 2-3 a pull.<br />
<br />
Warriors need to wait for BoW unless 2 things occur:<br />
1. Your guild decides not to do RZ anymore (/suicide?)<br />
2. SEWS are rotting.<br />

go get bow</div></div><hr />

BoW should be warrior only and have the graphic of RZtW's wep, maybe w/o flames<br />

BoW: Awesome aggro. Gets it fast, keeps solidly.<br />

<br />
Like BoW seem to have a good agro without an augment, any of you tried to put this guard IV ( i think) augment on it yet?<br />
<br />
If yes, anyone know if like rune, those &quot;semi-rune&quot; spells could give some aggro too?<br />
<br />
Cause well, getting good single target aggro + saving up some melee dmg could be cool + if guard give some aggro it would be cool~<br />

/shrug, just a though<br />

Yes SEWS DPS a bit &gt; BoW, but if we want DPS, we shouldn't play a warrior, many classes DPS &gt; Warrior's. Warrior is to Tank mainly.<br />

BoWar is great agro already and although some say you can never have too much, I think anger3 might be wasted on it and you'd do better to have the DPS/agro combo of Ykesha. SEWS however would really do better to have the Anger3 proc because the hate generated by it's innate proc is only about half that of Enraging Blow (and possibly less).<br />
<br />
I have Anger3 on my SEWS and that combined with Call of Fire (like a mini-Ykesha proc buff), I held agro without even trying on a little cursed raid over a warrior with a Ykesha aug'd Blade of War.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy with the results :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Increased hit attempts helps the sews agro, I think it is more constant.  Paen is right, I did similar testing.  I came to the conclusion the agro was 400 or so.  I liked how Paen tested it better.   I also checked rune 2, which seemed to have a much lower modifier.<br />
<br />
Frankly the big test is holding agro on boss mobs in time.  It has been without fail.  I compete directly with other warriors using BoW without issues.  I have max aa pts. I have the yakesh proc, choice made prior to the anger change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only people that seem to hold agro without issue are the bow wielding warriors and me.Granted the guys that have Van just got it and have yet to mod it with anger,that might help them a little.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pre Anger I could hold aggro comfortably however moving the mob around proved difficult,I had to sty in range and hitting it to keep the aggro.Once I threw anger on it,originally only anger II, I was able to move mobs around without issue and it went from being a good aggro weapon to a fantastic aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
For someone like me who spends a lot of time offtnaking adds more than MTing it is the best possible choice.In Phase 1 Trials in time in either the fire or rock ring,I sometimes find myself offtanking the initial spawns for up to 10 minutes,With prolly close to 50 procs on average in that time I am saving myself quite chunk of damage over someone without a rune weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I had the choice between a bow and a sews knowing what I do about the weapon as an owner I would take the sews iover the bow anyday.Pre Ldon a non augmented Bow served all a warriors needs and while a ugmented bow now will make him even more of an aggro machine,it also helps out Sews above the aggro of a non auged BoW in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

As much as he proced yak or stun, agro would ping pong from him to me and back to him depending on who really had the last proc. He held consistant agro over me, but every time i had anger 3 or rune 3 proc, it would turn on me, and then after a second if he procced, back to him...

our ma has bloodfrenzy auged w/anger3 and boc/aegis of earth as offhand, and i have sews auged w/anger3<br />
also, a newer warrior in the guild has bow auged w/guard3<br />
all 3 have all offensive aa's<br />
<br />
i've made the following observations:<br />
when clearing, ma uses bf/boc and will have thule, and i'll steal agro from him 9/10 fights<br />
bow auged w/guard3 has similar ae agro effect to rune, and overall is a noticeable improvement over sews w/anger3<br />
<br />
we just got into time, so no comparisons to dbotw or vanazir<br />
but from what i've gathered it seems clear that bow &gt; sews &gt; bf/boc, although i'm still very happy w/ sews and proud to have it $$ <br />
<br />
on a side note: it saddens me to hear that sews is rare and bow is common, since there are 2 bow's from 25~ kills vs. about 12 sews from 20~ mud rings</div></div><hr />

It can be a great aggro weapon for you today, and a great dps/low-aggro weapon for you tomorrow.  Augs make it all the more temporarily customizable for either role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love my SEWS and wouldn't trade it back for a Blade of War. I feel the rune proc is a big positive tradeoff for EB when coupled with Anger3 in experience groups (saves my arse quite a bit and helps in damage reduction). Although some will chalk it up to luck, I steal agro quite a bit with it over augmented BoWar warriors. I also hold agro without any problems when tanking. I rarely use taunt in experience groups unless the silly shaman slows a few times in quick succession at the begining. And no, I don't have any issues grouping with Paladins or SKs. If they steal agro (rarely they do), I don't care, and usually get it back before the mob dies. Really you can't go wrong with it. OK, I'm done preaching about the SEWS!</div></div><hr />

I burned through a few hard EF missions the night I got it so I could aug it with Anger 3 and the combo simply rocks for xp groups.  Haven't tested it enough on raids yet to tell how often I'll pull aggro off the MT (he has BOW + Anger III).  Combined with CoF proc I'm VERY happy with the aggro on it.<br />
<br />
I'm also pretty happy with the 50% DPS boost it gave me over my 1h combo.</div></div><hr />

BoW + Anger3 + Saryn Range<br />

While i absolutely love the sews, the agro it generates is<br />
really small compared to the BoW (thats not a surprise).<br />
<br />
Overall sews+anger3 would be a great combo.</div></div><hr />

Think its more a side-effect of Rune3 than anything..  Much like enchanters getting aggro when they RuneZ or Rune5 themselves though much much less.<br />
<br />
If it is there its hardly worth noting though...</div></div><hr />

just that in situations like ldon where bards are mezzing, the mez can fade and i'll have agro on mobs that i've never engaged</div></div><hr />

Sews / aug vs bow / aug is two diff types of hate output. One targete and mini ae, other soley targeted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The comparison between a bow and a sews auged the same really would come down to a fight to fight basis dependant on proc rate.I have had aggro pulled off me by guild wars with a3 bows and on other occasions I have pulled aggro off them or they could not pull it off me even while trying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both weapons really come down to DPS for aggro,The procs more or less smooth it out over the long run and get you through some moments when your dps maybe dives or your getting stunned alot ...<br />
<br />
As far as DPS goes,they are almost identical......<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My opinion is,if you raid almost full time with little xping or farming or whatever go bow,for sure.If your the type that lieks to XP alot or farm or to try and solo various things while stil being able to hold aggro when you need to grab a a3 sews....</div></div><hr />

Runes ain't that much aggro.</div></div><hr />
