<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually buff to 9651 on raids (virtue, brells and focus as the main HP buffs) but tonight I could only hit 9616 for some reason. I triple checked all my gear etc and couldn't come up with any conclusion unless they nerfed tribute to not stack with ND3 and the like but there hasn't been a patch since my last raid. Anyone know if they can stealth nerf something like that without a patch?<br />
<br />
I know it's only 35 hp but it just bugs me when something changes like that for no apparent reason.</div></div><hr />

Doh, it was food, I'm retarded  :o</div></div><hr />

possibly because clerics will scream bloody murder if you ask them for those buffs.  As it is they get pissed off at casters for demanding symbol all the time.</div></div><hr />

I had a cleric the other day absolutly freak when I dropped Virtue for Pot9 and asked for symbol. I explained why I did so and they still were bent out of shape about it.</div></div><hr />

 Hehe, that sounds familiar.  The answer is to 2-box a cleric and symbol yourself :cool: I find that most druids don't mind casting 9 but ask a cleric for kazad and be prepared for h8.  Don't even think about asking them to WoG you.</div></div><hr />

I thought warriors were supposed to be the tough ones.  Any cleric that got pissy with me wouldn't do it twice.</div></div><hr />

The guild leader freaks out bloody murder if you're ever caught with Virtue on.  That is, unless you're a paladin, of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have always used 9/kaz/wog. Virtue is for sissy paladins :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always use 9/symbol/wog, in raids or in exp groups assuming there is a druid and a cleric present... Only times we ever use virtue is on select few mobs where either buff slots are needed badly or some mobs' AE's strip pot9.<br />
<br />
If your clerics refuse to use different buffs to make you a better tank, you need to find some new clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer Virtue, it's one slot and lasts longer than the others ( I hate having to stop mid-raid to rebuff), one cleric can MGB and be done with it rather than 2 clerics and a druid having to MGB the other way. Virtue is just more convenient and the tradeoff isn't that big a deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that attitude would make you one dead warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let the clerics bitch, an extra 100+hp is more than worth it.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We MGB both virtue and Pot9/Kazaad on raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer virtue, it lasts a shitload longer, only takes one buffslot instead of 3 and I really don't care about the extra hp's.  I'll probably change my mind if we encounter mobs that need it, but sofar we haven't. :)</div></div><hr />
