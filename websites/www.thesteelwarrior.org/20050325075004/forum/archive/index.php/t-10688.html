<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked Tommy, the Green Ranger, and I saw that Emerald Gear was pretty awesome for lv55 stuff. Figure this will be my last &quot;bought&quot; set since the lv60 gear is all ridiculously gouged on Hellscream (10-15g for lv55 emerald chestplate of the bear, 50-75g for lv58 commander's armor of the bear with it's massive +1 stat). So, over the last few days, I made it my quest to buy every piece of &quot;of the Bear&quot; Emerald equipment just for the sake of matching.<br />
<br />
And here it is:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the set as a whole looks pretty good, only two complaints.  First off that extreme colored gear requires you to have the whole set or look like a tard.  Secondly that looks just like a Green Iron Helm . . . bothers me even if it shouldn't.  <br />
<br />
Finally am I the only one that had to pop those into an imaging program and up the brightness/contrast to really see them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, for some reason, I can hardly see the pictures myself even though I was in a fairly clear area. I guess it's something to do with my desktop resolution and running in window mode.<br />
<br />
It was terrible trying to level to 45 just to equip the final piece (chestplate). I had a green suite, samurai chest (Warforged Breastplate), and bright red tabard covering it all up.<br />
<br />
Even worse when I had green shoulders/gloves with black pants, yellow boots, and red tabard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireiina</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have pretty much all but the boots and gloves. It does looks decent when the armor actually matches. I'm still sort of amazed at how it changes for a female character though. The BP looks like a strapless bustier, but of course the helm still looks like a big iron bucket. A very strange combination.</div></div><hr />
