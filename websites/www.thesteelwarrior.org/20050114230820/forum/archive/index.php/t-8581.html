I was wondering how the warriors here feel about it. I have played with AC and Atk Tribute, and at my level (51) they are not very costly point wise and extra AC at least is always welcome. <br />
<br />
<br />
Who here runs what if any Tribute?<br />
<br />
Critique(sp) my gear while you are at it I will post my Magelo.<br />
<br />
Last question, getting a few out of the way here so as not to clutter the board, Should I start work now on my LDoN anger augs, or wait a bit. I waited till 60's with Necro to get per aug and Horror, but it was a little easier getting solo experience with the Necromancer. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies, and input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Anyway, I usually use(d) haste, hp, ac (situational), and resists (situational again.)</div></div><hr />

Check out the 10000 threads on this board about why it sucks, then sell it to some other caster making a warrior twink and buy a Sword of the Bloodsworn. Use the plat to buy Fierce Heraldic armor for any slot you don't already have .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rarely use tribute--raiding, hard LDoNs (if I can ever find a group) and GoD. With close to 1400 AC and at least 6k HP walking into an easy LDoN I have no need of extra.<br />
<br />
When I do run them I grab HP (max) and AC (max)--and I should get smart and add resists (considering the raid type focus I have on my trib).<br />
<br />
THen again I am a poor warrior.<br />
<br />
I would have to agree that the SBoD is probably not worth the premium it commands as an agro weapon--I have no problems hold agro with the droga pair. <br />
<br />
Considering that the Anger 3 augs are 1150 points, I would hold off as long as possible on starting to grind them. Its only 23 missions *cough* to unlock them at 65. Really the best guide to when you should start looking to grind the anger augs is when you start to have problems holding agro. <br />
<br />
If you are really having agro problems pick up a Great Staff of Thunder. 50 plat, usable in BoT for agro in most groups. Grind the levels first then the LDoN points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kegbelly</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not having aggro problems. I didn't buy the SBoD I won it on a roll with my main. I didn't buy anything he is wearing. I used Nurga quest items I had in bank, and traded a SBoZ for the FH pieces I have, farmed the helmet, CHoS, belt, no idea where the cloak came from, but was in bank, and I have a Flowing Argil in bank waiting, none of that was bought. I just had left overs. I have a Droga sword in bank somewhere, but when I did the Magelo syncronize I had been soloing and I use the Split Blade when doing so as aggro control is not an issue, and the extra ac is nice. Sorry if I upset anyone. Figuered the pic of Ms. Jolie would distract most folks anyway.<br />
<br />
Well, earrings are from my retired ranger, and he bought those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC and  HP here. I run em all the time while playing, just because it isn't terribly expensive. While the items are getting ninja nerfed, it isn't all too bad if you can front the plat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the anger augs, just whenever you get a ldon you are technically working on them   ;) .  Just try and get people to do everfrost and you'll be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octawan</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use tribute for raid mobs only, and use AC, HP, ATK, FR, and CR normally....resists depending on what we are going after...otherwise tribute stays off.  I tried using it all the time, eats up to much plat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only use AC/HP when i'm fighting lets say a group named, or on raid named(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use HP and AC all the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i run max HP and max AC situationally. if everything's going fine i leave it off. toggle it on as needed. mostly cause i STILL can't find an affordable means of bulking up points that doesn't take FOREVER.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alrean</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could someone point me in the right direction where i can find information about how tribute works.. what it costs and what you get.. in effect how much it costs to get x amout of AC/HP/.. etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">go to your starting city and use the 'find' menu to track down the tribute master. right click him and it brings up the window where you can donate tribute and set what you want to use in the field. play around with the menu and look around. most tributes have an accurate discription of their teirs/benifits. i was clueless about trib till i screwed around with it a bit.<br />
<br />
one thing that's not listed in the menu is the AC value per teir. at 65 i get 47ac for max ac trib. dunno if that value varies based on class, lvl, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">max ac/hp here as well, i keep it up all the time. There are still several items in the bazaar that you can buy for ~3k pp and turn in for 10k points, or cheaper items for 50pp worth 500-1000 points.<br />
<br />
As for gear, if you are looking to buy some stuff, or sell the SBoD, grab a new bracer to replace the quickness one, and a new neck, as well as possibly new gloves. Those 3 items you have now have no hp, and no stam. Fix that. It's worth losing a few ac to pick up stamina and 20+ hp.</div></div><hr />

Just have not got it back from her yet. Having a hard time deciding on gloves and have pretty much decided to just wait and get the Ornate. Bracer I have no idea on yet.</div></div><hr />
