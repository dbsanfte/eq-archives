<br />
My guild has been in time for only 3 weeks or so, but sadly due to the nature of my server and guild, the largest force we've ever been able to muster for Plane of Time is 55 or so.  We've gotten through the first three stages easily enough, and we've downed Saryrn and started trying the others in stage 4, although I am rapidly starting to believe that like the Rathe encounter, Sony decided you needed a ton of people to do these encounters.<br />
<br />
You've talked before about doing low numbers (50-55) for Time regularly.  How far have you guys gotten, and do you see yourselves being able to progress at a reasonable rate with those numbers?</div></div><hr />

Our numbers average 45 these days for PoTime. We actually hadn't gone back to Time for 2 weeks because, believe it or not, we were backflagging. Anyways, at this time, the only two mobs that are accessible to us with our numbers are Saryrn and TZ. TT is doable with some sploitage and from our initial tests with VZ, probably not doable at all. I've heard that VZ is being downgraded (rightfully so) and that TT's AE was SUPPOSED to get retuned a week ago, albeit the chimps at Sony are enjoying watching 72 people zerg down their encounters and tack on the 'we did this with skill' tag, so who knows when if ever those tunings will happen. I suspect when the anonymous marginalized masses of the current uberguilds settle down and disappear (it will happen) and those guild's numbers start falling below 60, Sony will step in and make some changes. As it is now the guilds that are having success in Time not only have 72 people for raids, they have people WAITING to get into the raids. Sickening.<br />
<br />
The flip side to this is, with 72 people, most of these mobs would fall over if we blew on them... It's hard to garner support for a cause in which I really don't give a shit about anymore... We play with what we have and deal with it until WoW goes beta/release.</div></div><hr />

For instance, a program that alter the difficulty of a mob. Hence, 72 people difficulty with a mob would be the same as having 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kildace</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that Time encounters seem very straight forward.<br />
And if today you tune a fight for 65 average people, or 55 skilled ones, tomorow when mudflation will have kicked in, this fight will have become a 40 people farm fest.<br />
<br />
If you bring 72 people to Xegony you're not going to have a much easier time than if you bring 60, it's the same for coirnav, encounters in time should have been designed this way too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The encounters just need minor tweakage, and then they are doable by a regular 50-55 man raid force.<br />
<br />
Examples: <br />
Swap the recast and the stun duration on Vallons ability.<br />
Remove Planeshift from Tallon.<br />
Knock another 30-50 off TT's mana drain resist adjust.<br />
Saryrn is perfect. No adjustment needed.<br />
<br />
We've killed Saryrn and TZ with zero deaths, with a 55 man raid force or so. Killed TT by throwing any semblance of strategy out of the window, and just going balls out with a prayer or two. We're very close on Vallon. . . but shit, there is no way he is tuned without a 65+ raid force in mind.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure adjustments to the encounters will be made... the encounters are being killed still. It seems in their infinite wisdom, they planned the encounters around a 72 man raid force.<br />
<br />
Like most other Time enabled guilds, we're being forced into recruiting... sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many clerics are you guys using to get TZ with 55ish people? <br />
<br />
We are having the same problem. We normally field 50-55 people for raids and we have been stuck on TZ for a couple of weeks. Its annoying when all yuor clerics can do is pound the cheal button and pray. It's bad for morale and really just bad game design. There should never be an encounter where you have to have more than 6 or 8 of any class, any more is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />
