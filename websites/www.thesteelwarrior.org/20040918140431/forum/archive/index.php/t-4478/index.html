Don't Expect it to be there until after the chat on the 24th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just logged onto test to take a look.  Yup, stamina bar starting out low, slowly regens (okay, honestly it's slow but not painfully slow).  Goes up faster when sitting probably 2x rate.  It's based off all your melee stats, as my bar moved around as I removed and put on the test gear that had str, sta, dex, agi...seems at 25, it had more impact if I put on gear that had stat increases of 4 or more, couldn't see the bar move at all with increases 3 or lower.<br />
<br />
On my /testbuffed warrior there, standing took 2-3 ticks to go up 1%, but then only 2 ticks for another, and then repeat.  Sitting took 2 ticks to go up 1%, then 1 tick, then 2 ticks again, then 1 tick and 1 tick...it's a bit faster than caster mana, apparently, but they get meditate, I don't know if melee will get.<br />
<br />
Checked a SK and a Paladin, and they have it too...but it went up much faster than on the warrior, so hybrids probably have much less Endurance pool than pure melee (since they're mainly supposed to be there for the disciplines, it's a bit more understandable).  The get 1% almost guaranteed per tick at 25 while sitting, and at least 1% every 2 ticks standing.  Tried using Invigor (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=222&amp;source=Live) on the paladin, but that did nothing.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it all depends on just how much Endurance it takes to use the skills.  Jumping still takes half a bubble out of it.  Death refills the bar completely just like a normal caster mana bar.<br />
<br />
All characters have the new stamina, but it goes up much much faster on non-melee/hybrids, like 2% per tick sitting.  Looks like they fixed stamina from going up 10%/tick to going up depending on your stats, and pure melee getting a much larger amount due to their abilities.<br />
<br />
Also, confirmed the Taunt message.  When you fail, it gives an additional line &quot;You have failed to taunt your target&quot; in red.  Does it for Warrior, SK, and Paladin.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I have no idea how to open and close the Combat ability window.  Also, this new window is on all characters, not just melee...so it looks like melee might be getting some group abilities to give to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is a pretty bad way to go about it.<br />
<br />
You use stamina up when NORMALLY ATTACKING.<br />
<br />
So you're gonna waste a good chunk of &quot;endurance&quot; not even USING the freakin bar to do anything.<br />
<br />
Great idea SOE!<br />
<br />
/golfclaps<br />
<br />
Consider how USELESS this bar is going to be on a Luclin boss mob fight, like the two named blobs, or something excessively stupid like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">super that effect may have been reduced, or changed, also you may get STA from being hit.... who knows its new dont think anything is stone solid untill ya try it for awhile.... personaly im gona go play on test for a bit so i can get a jump on attack scrolls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Screenshot from Test Tonight (http://home.comcast.net/~levi.forman/2003-11-20.jpg) <br />
<br />
Note the empty stamina bar, the inability to jump because of it, the failed taunt message, and the new window.<br />
<br />
Invigor, as others said, didn't seem to do anything.<br />
<br />
If they're going to use the regular STA bar for the new abilities I imagine they will have to disconnect the current effects on it of jumping and meleeing.  <br />
<br />
Test was down most of the night, and it's time for sleeping now, but I will try to run a test to see if the STA bar comes back faster or slower depending on your STA stat tomorrow night if nobody beats me to it.<br />
<br />
Something else to speculate on, there was a new class in the character creation window called a 'berzerker'.  So far it's greyed out for all races, so you can't make one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">berzerkers are(in lore) people that go in as lightly armored as possible(freedom of movement) with little regard for their own life and do as much damage as they can before they die, their strenght is great but it burns out fast, i think its a new class to rival rangers in death :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I think it's about d@mn time we got a success/fail message for taunt, but I just find it amusing to see how much it fails! <br />
<br />
All this time, it wasn't just in my head! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was me making sure the mob was indifferent before I taunted it. And no, not level 65. Probably about a 5 minute old /testbuff 25 character on test server. Hey, it's been a while since I was out killing bats in Gfay and forgot if they were indifferent! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Level 65's have little trouble taunting level 1 bats. Which, I suppose, could be looked at as a positive :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok so there are new ablities that are on test and Brutual noticed a new class.  hmmm I thinking these are not our abilities folks.  These are for the new guy on the block.  Only me thinking again I could be way off on this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Very cool to see, and definately worth going to test to check out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hopefully there will be some way to regen stamina other than sitting.  Also, I hope invigor does something, anything even small, for that endurance bar.  I have a couple of items with invigor on them and it would be nice if the effect was actually useful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I doubt the new spells are for the berzerker, they wouldnt test a new class on the banal Test server,<br />
unless... that is... they plan on bringing out the new Expansion before testing the melee changes on Test.....<br />
eew...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I was messing around on test, the sta bar regens about as slow as a mana bar with out kei, ft, etc. Swinging a sword did not seem to make me lose sta, like it does now, but jumping made me lose 10% at at time. This leads me to believe that soe is removing the current effects of the sta bar and replacing it with the new system.<br />
<br />
I also think that melee will be getting new endurance FT, focus effects and I hope new AA pts to make it regen as fast a mana does for casters. I also hope that they modify our existing items with these endurance mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Macbrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Has anyone checked to see if iksar regen faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Biggest News Yet:<br />
<br />
I don't know if I should even post this, since I haven't heard it confirmed anywhere else, but this is a post from one of our rogues on the guild board...<br />
<br />
I also believe I figured out why my damage seemed offf. For those who weren't online, my minimum backstab AND assassinate were both down by 5% exactly. However, I also saw some max backstabs, leading me to the conclusion that it wasn't actually my damage that was lower. In thinking about it, I was only seeing the lower damage on Warrior mobs. It looks like warriors, from level one on up now automatically mitigate 5% of melee damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly I don't know if SoE would do something so drastic.  I would like it though P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">IF thats true Brutul thats very nice to see. <br />
<br />
I guess the question is how it adds to our existing mitigation or if it is a flat 5% of any melee damage done of any type (special attacks).<br />
<br />
Hope that comment makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">obviously they added the stamina bar but they forgot to change the way jump is pumping this bar. and...<br />

ALL of the zone names were in a post that was going around thats been proven false. The supposed name that was given for the expansion was a anagram for houx you<br />
As well, chance of them adding like 4 more classes? get real, still having probs that BLs caused  <br />
<br />
Do you have a link to a post that says this info is bogus? and how did the berseker class, which is on test, turn into 4 classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">So what if there were hurdles...unless they nerfed Lev everywhere...or made lev cost sta as well :D<br />
I assume they will lessen the sta requirement for Jumping or remove it.<br />
Wonder which items will be deamed worthy of sta regen focus or whether the more STA you have due to items and aas the faster you will regen</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look closer, it says<br />
New Class name and titles<br />
------<br />
Berserker<br />
Berserker GM<br />
Brawler<br />
Vehement<br />
Rager<br />
Fury<br />
<br />
What youre probably looking at is the Berserker class, Brawler as the 51-54 class name, Vehement as the 55-59 and Rager as 60-64, Fury as 65.<br />
<br />
Edited cause spelling is hard</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a WINNER!<br />
<br />
Brawler, Rager, and Fury are all very cool names.  I sense a Barbarian Berzerker twink in my future.</div></div><hr />

And all the other stuff too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>nota</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Wow. Looks like some game changing melee stuff going in. I can only imagine if they put forth that much effort to design the whole system, they will address our aggro issues as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that might be because I'm playing on FFXI and Provoke is their version of taunt.  Except it works.  Always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">i wonder, what skills will be unique to what classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">All the raid feature things seem to be taken from Planet Side. <br />
<br />
Frickin nice! I wonder if the new graphic engine for EQ will be based from the Planet Side engine.  My system RARELY had any graphic lag on PS and the zones were 10X larger than EQ zones.<br />
<br />
The Waypoints(pillars of light that could be seen from anywhere in the zone), Visible NPC health, Battle plans on map, Location of party members its very much PS like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I quit my warrior and EQ a couple months ago because i was, both, fed up with the shit we were being shoveled and because i was coming to university. By the looks of this thread it'll be like a whole new game. The 5% mitigation, taunt messages, new interesting looking class, and brand new melee system is amazing. It almost makes me want to start playing again now. If there's going to really be all these changes then i guess they really were looking at the problems over the past months/year and a half. This isn't shit that was just thrown together to please the melee community, but a change that will affect everyone in more likely than not a positive way.<br />
<br />
The information regarding new zones, AAs, raid features, etc looks very interesting. If you could, please find a source proving it's false. And even if it is just a hoax i trust that SoE will come out with something decent for the expansion. To be honest the past expansions released to date were all pretty good, they just didn't all have content to please everyone. <br />
<br />
Kunark was amazing, as was velious, introducing new encounters and unforseen positive changes in the game. <br />
<br />
Luclin offered the same thing, although it was manufactured horribly and released way too early, in the end it was a great expansion. <br />
<br />
LoY...an expansion to please the masses whilst others were in production. Frogloks are ok just for messing around, not really anything essential, but the new zones that came with it were amazing, well thought out, and they gave me the feel that LGuk and SolB used to give when EQ first came out. They're great for crawling through with a good group, and you can usually get some great cash loots, cleaning up better than an afternoon in PoG sometimes. <br />
<br />
LDoN...i played the beta before i came to university and i was amazed by the new system. Many people never had faith in SoE for this...&quot;36 peepz raid encounterz!!!1!1 WTF!&quot; but they worked, and they worked great. Instanced dungeons are great and there's never been quite the feeling of crawling through a dungeon, leading your group to victory as a warrior in this game.<br />
<br />
I left PoP to last for a reason, I think it was the most game-changing expansion to date. High-End only zones (when they were released). Crazy hard hitting mobs and encounters on a never before seen scale. If it's your first time on a successful PoP encounter you get one of the most fulfilling feelings afterwards. &quot;I just killed a god...wow&quot; but at the same time it broke more than all 5 other expansions combined. While it was a great expansion when you look at it afterwards, pretty much everyone has the flag charm from PoK, Ornate, Elemental Armours, crazy ratios on cheap weapons, GSoT for 200pp anyone? i remember when it was 30k, hell i remember when the crafted BP was 10k+, lol<br />
<br />
If all, or even most of what's in this thread is true, we're getting another amazing, and as much as i hate to say it &quot;quality&quot; expansion from SoE. I think they've learned a great deal over the years, and they won't fuck up like they did with PoP again.<br />
<br />
Now i've got a problem  :mad:  my university has EVERYTHING firewalled, port 7000 for EQ and most other online games, 1214 for mirc, kazaa, any other p2p software....and it's driving me crazy. If anyone knows any tricks that would somehow let me play EQ i'd be forever in your debt, i want to see these changes, lol.<br />
<br />
/ale to all, on me<br />
Take care guys<br />
