<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klozz</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't had technical problems in months, and I played last night just fine.  Today, when I tried to patch, I got that message that I didn't have Direct X 8.1 or better.  I have been running 9.0B for like a year now, and I checked my Dxdiag to be sure that it's still there (which it is).  I don't see anyone else posting any troubles like this, so I'm thinking that I have somehow developed a bug that is causing EQ to think I have a lower version of DirectX.  Does anyone have any idea why this is happening or what I can do about it?</div></div><hr />

Still kinda curious why it would do that in the first place.  Oh well, at least I can still get my eq fix on.</div></div><hr />
