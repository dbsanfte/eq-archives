I am lvl 4 Planning on buying the whol Crustacean Set. This Set Kills ur CHA. I was wondering if CHA is a must until about 30ish?</div></div><hr />

Don't worry about the CHA on the Crusty armor - that set will do you well for a lot of levels.</div></div><hr />

I have about 98 CHA with gear now (ogre CHA blows) and DI works maybe 10-25% of the time for me even with a CHA buff unless I have a bard with me or the cleric has the AAs that modify the chance of success for DI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, from an earlier post (which I had posted over to our guild's warrior boards that was originally taken from some parsed work done and reported here on TSW), it is a bit better rate than that:<br />
<br />
Here are some stats on CHA and DI:<br />
<br />
50 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 20 <br />
Partial - 23 <br />
Fail - 57 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 43% <br />
<br />
<br />
125 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 38 <br />
Partial - 17 <br />
Fail - 45 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 55% <br />
<br />
<br />
200 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 33 <br />
Partial - 15 <br />
Fail - 23 <br />
Success/Partial (could not tell difference) - 29 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 77% <br />
<br />
<br />
280 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 46 <br />
Partial - 12 <br />
Fail - 3 <br />
Success/Partial - 39 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 97%</div></div><hr />

In practice these days though I doubt many guilds that find themselves needing DI will not have a cleric with UD3 to cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 67 cha unbuffed hehe.Buffed with bard singin it's alot higher and di usually fires  if theres time for me.I had a fight the other week di fired 4 times and I stayed up until the end weee. :) That was  record for me hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DI is a wonderfull thing :)<br />
<br />
My CHA sucks as well but buffs and a bard when MAing makes it less of an issue.<br />
<br />
My record on one fight is 3 times, back before many had AA for it. Was trying to kill Hailstorm with under 2 groups (This was loooooooooong ago, lol)<br />
<br />
Oh, and we still lost to him at about 10% :( Was one fun fight though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm definitely turning my augment attention toward +charisma for the near future.</div></div><hr />
