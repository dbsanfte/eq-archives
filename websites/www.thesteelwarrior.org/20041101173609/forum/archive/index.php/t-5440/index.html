<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deathdealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently dinged 60 and the weapon I use almost exclusively is the Greatstaff of Thunder. My question is - does this weapon lose its' usefulness as you level or can you continue to use the GSoT up to 65? I have SotBS and CHoS in my bag and rarely pull them out because this stick holds agro so well. I am in a pretty good guild and I do not plan on being the MT on raids (we already have 4 level 65 Warriors with who knows how many AAs in my guild) so my question is asked with experiencing groups in mind. I don't have it aug'ed with a hate procing stone yet, but that is in the near future. It still holds agro very well without it right now....but will it continue to do so? Will I have to upgrade eventually or is this still usable up to level 65?</div></div><hr />

Might want to add anger2 when you start doin exp with better equipped 65s.  But no you shouldnt have a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a Greatstaff of the Four Winds auged with 125dd Ykesha that I generally use over my Anger 3 auged Greatblade of Storms and Copper Hammer of Striking thanks to much better DPS, fewer ripostes, and *barely* sufficient agro.<br />
<br />
I am constantly tempted to go back and aug a GSoT with 100dd Ykesha for the increased agro it would provide over my GSo4W.<br />
<br />
Anger 2 is a waste when you could have Ykesha giving you about the same agro and a DPS upgrade for the same points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i've heard rumors of an upcoming nerf to the way stun aggro works.  atm ykesha is about 400 hate (anger 2) from what i've read, plus it adds to dps a bit.  i'm wondering, tho, if this stun nerf does happen, wouldnt an anger2 auged weapon be better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That rumor probably stems from the time before the melee upgrade part 1 and was just something some warriors suggested as a nerf to Paladin agro.<br />

It's just a baseless rumor that doesn't make sense in today's game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yup; at 65 i would bust out my GSoT and grab aggro off others with much better weapons. freak them out too :D<br />
<br />
GSoT is a godsend for the everyday average joe warrior. it will last to 65 easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Deathdealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So there I was last night, in a N Ro LDoN adventure. I was the 2nd highest in the group (60 Warrior). We had a 62 Druid as our healer. The rest in my group were high 50s. Anyways, right before we zone in to start our adventure, I get a tell from the group leader - a 58 Ranger - who tells me that I should switch my GSoT out for my CHoS and my SotBS (he had seen me equipped with these items before). I told him &quot;this thing (my GSoT) is fine, I will hold agro with no problem&quot;. His next comment was &quot;Famous last words&quot;...I was like - who the F is this F'ing Ranger to tell me what F'ing weapons I should F'ing use?!?! I sent a tell back to him saying - &quot;Don't worry about it, this is a GSoT, it is a great agro weapon - we'll be fine&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyways, we start getting to work in our adventure and doing just great. We had a monk pulling with a chanter pacifying. The Monk would pull the mob back to the group, he'd FD near me to lose agro, I'd get agro with my GSoT/bellow/taunt (Dex was at 255 btw so it was proc'ing very nicely), and we'd kill each mob rather quickly. At no point in any part of the adventure did anyone besides the monk (and me of course) did anyone in my group drop below 98% health. All of the Druids complete heals were for me. Occasionally, the Druid would have to heal the Monk on a long pull where he took some damage on the way back to our group, or if he accidently pulled more than 1 mob and they got a few good shots on him before he FD'ed. During fights, the Ranger would cast snare almost immediately (why? I have no F'ing idea), and a couple of times he took agro from me. I either got it back immediately with a stun proc from my GSoT or a taunt, or he'd cast jolt and I got it back that way. The Ranger himself was using a SotBS and some other weapon (not Swiftwind btw). Let me remind you that at no point did anyone in my group drop below 98% health...not even this bitch-ass Ranger. We had a Shammy casting slow and I don't think the Shammy ever took agro from me upon casting slow - not even once.<br />
<br />
...and the F'ing Ranger still complained!!! That's right, you heard me - he said the GSoT wasn't holding agro. He complained about the Monk having to FD on his pulls - I was like &quot;of course he's FD'ing - that's his friggin job&quot;...then he complained about having to cast jolt. My response - &quot;that's your friggin job as a Ranger &quot;(I myself played a Ranger up to 58 before putting his punk-ass in to retirement). And after it was all said and done, there I was, in the mobs' face, taking about 99.95% of the damage...I was doing my job and I was doing it with the GSoT. Occasionally the mob would show some interest in the Monk or Ranger and give them a couple of bitch-slaps, but never enough damage to drop them below 98% health and never for more than a few seconds - I'd always get the mob hitting on me. I asked him how he could complain and told him that the numbers speak for themselves and also - &quot;ask the Druid who was getting all of the complete heals&quot;. Anyways, after our SUCCESSFUL adventure (with no deaths), I left the group thinking to myself - WTF?<br />
<br />
Was I a victim of the perception of agro-lock? Does agro-lock exist? If so, what weapons can get me agro-lock. And I'm talking about agro-lock where absolutely NO-ONE besides me gets hit - EVER. Does this exist? Or are my assumptions correct that this F'ing Ranger was a total douchebag who doesn't understand EQ and that the GSoT is still and will continue to be an awesome weapon for us Warriors?...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You were the victim of someone who has outdated information.<br />
<br />
Back in the old days, two handers couldnt hold aggro for jack.  So if a warrior wanted aggro, he had no choice but to dual wield.<br />
<br />
The two handed weapon changes, itemization of nice aggro two handers, and the addition of the provoke line have all changed that.  Two handers can be viable for aggro now... the ranger was just clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To the original poster...I use GSoT for xp and raiding and I have no problem holding agro in either case (toughest raid mobs I've tanked are probably BoT tower bosses.)  I also use the WMBS for dps.  I have the droga wpns and pull em out in xp groups for a change, but when I'm serious about agro I use the GSoT.  (lvl 65 btw)</div></div><hr />

Thats what I did.  Worked out fine<br />
<br />
Anger 2 is a waste when you could have Ykesha giving you about the same agro and a DPS upgrade for the same points. <br />
<br />
/shrug we can argue about this til the cows come home.  Its not a black &amp; white issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What's not black and white about it?<br />
<br />
Anger 2 is 400 hate.<br />
<br />
Ykesha is 55 stun, knockback, and dd.  It is believed that stun is about 300 hate.  Add a 100 or 125 dd and you're looking at about the same amount of hate and a dps upgrade especially for people who would consider an Anger 2 proc.<br />
<br />
You can say the knockback is a problem since distance reduces agro, but then the knockback may have an agro component too and I find it very easy to take a step forward if need be.  It's a knockback, not a punt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Quote:-&quot;Rangers are usually(but obvoiusly not always) dumber than your average EQer.<br />

<br />
Fine.  I've had enough.<br />
<br />
1. You can't measure stun agro.  There is a long ass thread on this (you can go do the homework)<br />
<br />
2. If you are delusional enough to say you can...well I'd like to see how...alot of bright minds here have tried<br />
<br />
3. You can measure anger agro.  There is subjective evidence (you can go do the homework) that anger 2&gt;agro than stuns<br />
<br />
4. THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP ABOUT A BILLION TIMES BEFORE (thats right...you can go do your homework).  All times the conclusion has been &quot;unless we can measure stun agro then we can't definitively say&quot;<br />
<br />
That is the defintion of &quot;not a black and white issue&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Noone is buying blanket &quot;I'm right and you are wrong&quot; unless YOU CAN PROVE IT.  HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH AGRO STUN CAUSES VS ANGER 3?  Noone gives a crap about the extra dps...its marginal (again documented here you can go do your homework)<br />
<br />
It is believed that stun is about 300 hate <br />
<br />
Who said?<br />
When?<br />
How was this proven?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You number-obsessed people make me laugh.<br />
<br />
You want 5 hitpoints more than 5 Vengeance because you see yourself getting hit for a particular number and decide that if you only had 5 more hp you would have lived till the CH landed when if you had killed the enemy faster, he would never have even swung that last time and you'd have saved yourself 1,000hp!  You take hitpoint aa before avoidance aa not realizing that you can avoid procs by being missed.<br />
<br />
Anger says it's 200 hate but you don't even know what that is or what it does, or what it means, but it's a hard number so you fall in love with it even though we know for sure there are variables to agro we don't understand such as distance, type and other hidden variables that make the number meaningless.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's true the MT's DPS on a large raid is essentially meaningless, but what of the other warriors there that aren't the MT?  What of groups where you're one of 3 people actually doing damage while the cleric is busy healing and the monk is off pulling and the enchanter is busy mezzing adds?  What of the warrior putting out 50 dps who could add 3 dps via a weapon proc or 6% of his damage or more than he'd get by upgrading his haste item!  Yes, that's the guy who's considering Anger2, not uber raiding 65s.<br />
<br />
I can say this through my own testing: I have procced a stun while getting the message that I'm too far away from my target so I wasn't actually swinging and didn't damage the mob in any way, nor did I have initial agro, but the mob was slowed and it went for me instead of the slower and that is really all that matters.  Stun is more agro than slow and therefore all you really need.<br />
<br />
When that mob is fleeing with 50 hps left and about to get adds and you proc Anger on it just remember as you wipe and begin to CR that you could have had Ykesha instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The reason I'm not looking at the Ykesha augs is in case SoE does change how stun agro works.  I don't have any &quot;secret info&quot;, but I personally think there is a reasonable chance changes will be made to this in the future.  I also don't earn AP's very fast.  So, I'm going for the option that doesn't appear to be in any danger of the nerf bat and getting anger augs.  <br />
<br />
It's a game...do what works for you and have fun with it!:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You number-obsessed people make me laugh. <br />
<br />
Whatever...you come in here saying something is true and can't back it up.  <br />
<br />
I'm still waiting from you regarding stun agro:<br />
<br />
- who said it?<br />
- when was it said?<br />
- how was it proven?<br />
<br />
Otherwise admit that you only have &quot;your opinion&quot; and not facts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">At the risk of turning this into a stupid argument...<br />
<br />

<br />
Wrong.  I realized that a long time ago, before I ever hit 65.  Guess which AA I got first.  Guess which I got second.<br />
<br />
Anger says it's 200 hate but you don't even know what that is or what it does, or what it means, but it's a hard number so you fall in love with it even though we know for sure there are variables to agro we don't understand such as distance, type and other hidden variables that make the number meaningless.<br />
<br />
Wrong.  Anger 2 is 400 hate, anger 3 is 600 hate.  For reference, the initial hate from incite is 400 hate, as it taunting blow.  Red epic proc is 500 hate (if it's not resisted), and EB is 700 hate.  Anger (the proc on dbotw) is 750.  It's true that there are variables, but through testing and practical experience, those &quot;meaningless&quot; numbers are actually significant.<br />
<br />
What of the warrior putting out 50 dps who could add 3 dps via a weapon proc or 6% of his damage or more than he'd get by upgrading his haste item! Yes, that's the guy who's considering Anger2, not uber raiding 65s<br />
<br />
If he were asking about increasing his dps, I'd agree with you on the ykesha procs.  Since he's asking about aggro, I'm going to disagree and suggest waiting for anger 3.  Before you jump on me for saying a3 instead of a2, I know what he asked.  GSoT does well enough that he can afford to wait for the higher aggro proc.<br />
<br />
I can say this through my own testing: I have procced a stun while getting the message that I'm too far away from my target so I wasn't actually swinging and didn't damage the mob in any way, nor did I have initial agro, but the mob was slowed and it went for me instead of the slower and that is really all that matters. Stun is more agro than slow and therefore all you really need<br />
<br />
Prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Straythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yes, it's true the MT's DPS on a large raid is essentially meaningless, but what of the other warriors there that aren't the MT?

<br />
What's your point?  What's this have to do with aggro?  <br />
<br />
If someone is thinking about upping their DPS (especially for raids or non-tanking) they sure as hell better not use Ykesha to do it.  It does bring aggro, and it's got a knockback, both are no-no's on raids unless you're the MA/MT.<br />
<br />
That same person would be much better off with the vampire augs and get a life tap out of it instead.  I think (but not sure on this) that they are resisted less than ykesha anyways.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for these hard numbers, the argument would pointless anyways as there would be no way to prove anything.  Just people's opinions on the matter, which is all you've provided thus far.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the opinion.<br />
<br />
When that mob is fleeing with 50 hps left and about to get adds and you proc Anger on it just remember as you wipe and begin to CR that you could have had Ykesha instead.<br />
<br />
You're relying on a proc to save you from a running mob?  You'd be better off turning tail and running for zone than praying to the RNG for a proc to save you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">weren't they considering adding o.o stun to anger at one point. (some blip i rember prolly a dumb rumor)<br />
<br />
it real easy though if you have points at guk buy yak if you have points at mig buy anger. if you have points at both then worry about whats better. if your just starting to decide where to start building points go to migs and get anger because it has a known quantity of agro.</div></div><hr />

There is no stun on Anger 1, 2, or 3, which are buyable augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I recently dinged 60 and the weapon I use almost exclusively is the Greatstaff of Thunder.

<br />
Quoted the original post so as to refer to is, since this discussion has gone off onto a couple tangents.  I used a GSoT from 61 to 65 with about 50 aa's and loved it.  You will be fine.  SotBS/CHoS will do you fine as well, choose whatever works best for you, which in this caste sounds like GSoT.  Anger 2 or beter yet anger 3(and it is to my mind worht holding out for 3) will make it an even better agro weapon.  Eventually, I am sure you will upgrade it(GoD is due soon, and with it I am sure a whole heep of new weapons will be available for example), but it will certainly serve you well for some time.<br />
<br />
On the issue of stun agro, Flair is dead right.  While I would love to see a nice test that measures accuratly the agro on stuns, I have yet to see one.  I will submit that it is in fact possible ykesha is ~ = to anger 2, since anger 3 is available, that is far and away the best choice.<br />
<br />
Stun is more agro than slow and therefore all you really need. <br />
<br />
Stun is not  more agro than tash + slow, not is it more agro than resisted slow + slow, nor more agro than slow + cripple.  Simply put, you cannot have too much agro when tanking.<br />
<br />
You take hitpoint aa before avoidance aa not realizing that you can avoid procs by being missed <br />
<br />
Actually, I took hp AA's first because hp's keep me alive thru AE's, avoidance does not.  Hp's are usefull all the time, avoidance only when I specifically am tanking.  There is a very very good reason that most people here recommend doing hp AA's first(with a break for AE taunt).</div></div><hr />
