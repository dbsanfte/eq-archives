<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only one that comes to mind atm is the Gloves you get from turning King T's head into SS.  Nice gloves with 41% haste.  He is tough to find up most of the times though but GL getting yourself a 41% haste item :)</div></div><hr />

Off of Doomshade.  Been dropping frequently for us lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">with SoV though, you are max haste, even with RBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">POI Dragon, or Destroyer Belt from Ntov. Yeli's head is a good option too, but if yer faction is messed its a huge pain to fix it.<br />
<br />
Never had the earring drop in UP for us so I can't comment on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When doing yeli you can also give someone neck to use til rest of guild is ready for ST essentially knocking out 2 hastes for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">haste is rare always have been and hopefully always will be. There are options and you just look that stuff up in the library. There is no ez 40+ haste hell there is no ez 30+ haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Auron nailed it on the head. Yeli drops two haste items EVERYTIME you kill him ( Tali and Head ).  Tali has pretty decent stats and you don't have to do anything but put it on unlike the head which you have to have deceint faction with KT to turn it in.<br />
<br />
Gloves are superior to Tali though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by 1ludor.<br />

Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">41% haste is over rated. While many of the 41% haste items are pretty uber, there is no way I would ditch a 65hp 8sta earring for a UP 41% earring. So what if it's a 5% increase in haste over a CoF or a CoM. Once you max haste, it doesn't matter how much comes from your gear and how much comes from the spell.<br />

<br />
Speed of the Shissar (chanter epic): http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1939&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
If you are getting enchanter haste, then you are way over the cap since it take 32-34% haste to hit max.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't go out of my way to get a 41% haste item unless it is an item with exceptional stats as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">with SoV though, you are max haste, even with RBB.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this true? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
RBB = 31% haste<br />
SOV = Increase Attack Speed by 68%<br />
<br />
Total = 99% haste<br />
<br />
So , not exactly true but pretty darn close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hands down, PoI dragon is the easiest 41 haste item, yes it's no drop, but which aren't ?<br />
My guild has been farming Xana for 4 months at least.  Every warrior, even those down to lvl 55 have the CHSD, and we have at least 20-25 Woven shim Chokers.  If you know the encounter, 18 people, easy.  Respawn, 2 hours.  If you know the encounter WELL, our record is 36 min to complete it.<br />
If you are ~60, maybe up to 36 would be best for first couple tries, after that lower.  ~65 players with not bad gear, I like ~20-24 people.<br />
Go do it every night, hell, 2x a night.  2 items drop everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My advice, dont break your neck over looking for 41% Haste ... hell, i went through most of  VT wearing nothing but an RBG.<br />
<br />
You dont NEED the haste, certainly dont need 1% more haste, which when it comes down to it, is all your really adding.  Unless you find one with stats above and beyond what your wearing in that slot as it is, then sure, snag it up.  But for raids, is 99% really that much diff than 100%.  <br />
<br />
Wait it out, the &quot;Easy&quot; to get 41% hastes, are typically the first peices of gear to be replaced.  Wait around for something a lil better than the 2 or so you can get ahold of now.</div></div><hr />
