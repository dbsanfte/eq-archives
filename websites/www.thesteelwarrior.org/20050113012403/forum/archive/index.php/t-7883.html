<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">budtron</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what you gotta do is look for weapons that are a good deal, with good stats and ratio that is good at your current level,  not getting what other people tell you is good, or you think is good because you see everyone with. your two weapons are total crap right now, and wont start improving until around 40, maybe 45 when it starts to proc.  at your level you kinda need better current lvl weapons because at lower lvls, the warrior does a good part of the damage in a group. if you can find one on your server, you can get a dagarns tail, 19/12 str +10, hp+75 with a 48-51 fire based dd, procs at lvl one with no rec. lvl, very nice weapon, got mine for 30k, that was on FV though so it may be nodrop on other servers.<br />

here is it : http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31338<br />
yes it is no drop, but what an uber weapon for a twink on FV it's incredible powerfull for a war bellow 40.</div></div><hr />

I would pick up a swiftblade of zek and a Horn of Hsagra or some other good weapons without a rec. level if you're gonna take a while to level up.<br />
<br />
You need a haste item too, look for a cloak of flames or a cowl of mortality.  Get a bloodmetal earring (or iron scream if that's too expensive for your other ear).</div></div><hr />

That is his &quot;shopping list&quot; and not what he is wearing.  He was looking for purchasing tips.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lower level characters cannot buy higher level haste through tribute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks good at the moment, but you might want to get non rec level items until 50 or so, maybe a lammy and frostbringer? Decent damage, old school, and cheap!  And for earring, if you an find a Earring of the Solstice kit for cheap, buy it.... 55 hp and 5 sta for3-4k(would be cheap on my server) is really nice<br />
<br />
You also need haste like others said, the higher the level, the more you want, so right now a FBSS or something is fine, but at 50 or so, you might want to check other options like a CoF or CoM, unless you can afford them now =P</div></div><hr />

Ok, can someone write me up a good gear set up for a level 25 or so Warrior that will last till his late 40s. Maybe somewere under... 30k?<br />
<br />
