<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">During the last couple of months I took an extended break off EQ due to RL work, but I'm thinking of slowly picking things up again. Last thing I remember doing was trying to get the whole of our guild through the bottleneck that was the Ikkinz trials and having a first shot at Uqua. <br />
<br />
Basically, I'd like to know where things have moved onto since there and wether it is realistic to think I could catch up on flags quickly to whereever the top guilds are at now.( just have Kod and 2 Ikkinz trials flags) Also, any gear I should look to upgrade if I get back into raiding again? (aside from the bp obviously) Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kenyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your gear overall looks fine.  Pulsing Emerald Hoop is probably your weakest slot other than the BP you mentioned, and maybe your haste bracer from EarthA.  <br />
<br />
If I were you, I would focus on getting your AA up(at least Ambidex, WA5, and Sturdy 5...MAYBE Sinister Strikes since you have good one-handers) and work on acquiring more/stronger augments.  40HP from LDoN, or some of the Kod Taz augs would improve your character significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your gear is fine, like the above poster mentioned, just grind some aa's.<br />
<br />
As far as catching up to your guild, if your guild was working on ikkinz trials and uqua when you were gone, all you need to catch up to them ( im going to assume they are in qvic and beyong now ) is an Ikkinz 4 raid and an Uqua raid.  If they are in Txevu, then you need the 2 previous mention raids and an Inktuta raid.<br />
<br />
It will take some work, but catching up is by no means impossible at all in your situation</div></div><hr />
