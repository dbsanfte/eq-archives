<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are two majors reasons players are expressing dissatisfaction with the game:<br />
<br />
1. Misdesign and bugs. Content more appropriate to level 70 players or content that is broken.<br />
<br />
2. SoE has not clearly stated tank class roles and insured all tanks have the capability of performing their roles.<br />
<br />
SoE has an obligation to make it very clear what you are getting when you create a character, to insure each class is desired in groups and has an established raid role, and sticks to it's guns once these discissions are made.<br />
<br />
Players have an obligation to read and comprehend what they are getting when they create a character, to call to SoE's attention if they are not desired in groups and are losing their established raid role, and not insist they are deserving of class changes inconsistant with what they were promised at character creation and what has been established in the game.<br />

I disagree.  I believe you're on the money with number 1, I don't believe number 2 is as signficant factor as you do.  I believe something else should be number 2:<br />
<br />
2. SoE has systematically increased the AA and gear requirements each expansion since PoP and has only allowed players who don't raid long, tedious, and frequently uninteresting paths to improve their character adequately to play in the new expansion.  The time sinks for level 65 non-raiders just to see marginal advancement have become prohibitively time consuming and many people are reaching a point where they'd rather quit than to continue to plod along a path that not only isn't fun, but only improves their character at a glacier pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, they need to relise non-raider doesnt = casual<br />
<br />
I bet we have just as many hours under our belts, and just as much hard work, we just work in a differnt job setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget that raiding guilds are disbanding as well. Raiding isn't all roses either... PoP back flagging is terribly boring and irritating. Raids often must be done perfectly, or completely restarted; raids are often blowable as well, which increases the irritation and time waste. Raids are also very &quot;zerg&quot; oriented. That is, having more people almost invariably makes success more likely. The individual rarely has significant impact.<br />
<br />
  Another problem is the lore. GoD lore sucks. Yes, it exists. Paraphrasing someone else, Morden Rasp and crew did everything and we're just following behind. Not very heroic, is it? Not even pseudo-epic.<br />
<br />
  Here's a major problem as I see it: There are few or no character defining abilities or items. Any warrior at the same level of play has very similar gear, with the exception of twinks. There is almost no variation beyond item names and small tweaks. For example, every warrior that asks for gear/AA advice gets the EXACT same responses as any other warrior at the same place in EQ. There are no choices made between two mutually exclusive abilities or role defining items.<br />
<br />
  I WANT to be a unique snowflake, and I don't mean by choosing not to follow an efficient path. No, I'm not going to run around pantless so everyone knows who Fitemore is. I dun want any ladies running their horses into trees, ya know? I want to have options! Say, choosing between adding 1 second to kick/slam stun or adding 100 aggro to them instead. Or choosing either an innate 30ac or 180hp bonus. Or choosing to specialize in one weapon type (2hs or 2hb or 1hs or 1hb) for extra damage/aggro/accuracy in that one type but decreased in the others. Force me to choose one thing to be the best at, making the choices important but equal in overall power. Also, make them refundable via a somewhat tedious quest so no person is ever permanently gimped.</div></div><hr />
