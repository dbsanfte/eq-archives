I like the excuse that anything that happens in game stays in game. <br />
<br />
OH FUCKING PLEASE! Online games have caused gang fights in real life in some countries and that is only over simple stats  and pixels. Allowing people to experience the &quot;THRILL&quot; of a rape will slowly inculcate the feeling of power and arrogance that most rapists feel after they are done. Who knows when you'll be tempted to do it in real life?<br />
<br />
Violence in competitive games such as Everquest and Doom does not detract from the fact that is merely competition. Rape, even if it was virtual, is done because you want to, because you get a sense of pleasure of KNOWING that your actions causes someone to get trashed emotionally. <br />
<br />
I hope these idiots fail big time, or there will be a serious rash of crap like this coming out to the general market. THEN us gamers will truely be portraying a shitty image to non-gamers.<br />
<br />
P.S. I am normally not an angry person but this kind of nonsense just plain burns me up.</div></div><hr />

Its a virtual dating game. I dont believe there is any nudity, and the choices arent astronomically huge so the replay value is kinda low. Basically, its literally as if you were going out to pick up some girl (or guy) and you decide how to act, (no raping) if you get a good date yay you win! Like an episode of blind date, you know why the camera isnt following them into the house and the game is over. Kinda stupid, would be better as a modern day leisure suit larry.</div></div><hr />

What a dumb ass game idea.<br />
<br />
 According to Lagny, rapes -- as with other in-game crimes like theft, murder and the like -- are quickly investigated. If the perpetrator is caught, he or she is sent to trial. There, a prosecutor, judge and jury -- all roles filled by players -- preside as the accused argues his or her case. Penalties for rape range from a week to two weeks in the game's jail, said Lagny. <br />
<br />
A Reality TV video game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaknaafein</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did any of you click on the link to the website from the news article?<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, the consequences for deviant behavior include being imprisoned for up to 2 weeks to being permanently killed. Taking games such as &quot; Grand Theft Auto&quot; into consideration, the simple fact that there are real conseqeunces for your actions argues that this game may have some social value.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you have an option to play a bad guy or a good guy .... judges are rp'd by characters, you can specialize in being a witness to crimes. The government and Head's of State are rp'd by in game characters who either win votes to gain office or succesfully execute a coup d'etat. You can be a prostitute, or join the local mafia to gain power. This is potentially a more real virtual world in which the decisions of the players decide the destiny of the world.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, the graphics based on the screenshots published on the site are worse than the games I used to play on Atari -- there does not seem to be graphic sexual content.<br />
<br />
My point? I doubt I'd ever play it, I don't have time in my life for 2 games. Yes, rape is a hideous crime, imo more devastating than murder. However I think maybe you are all jumping at headlines without reading the story. There is RP potential here which goes way beyond EQ. The choices available to your character seem to exceed what is being portrayed in this thread. I don't kow if I like it, but it is creative mentally ( as opposed to graphically), and may be worth a deeper look before judging it.</div></div><hr />

Due to real life, work, school, and therapy i can only log on long enough to rape my neighbors cat 4 or 5 times in one session. While this might not be seen as the same risk-vs-reward of doing the Tae-Bo Instructor Ring down at 24hr fitness i feel that i put in my time and should get equivalent gear to raiders. Should raiders really have twice as good of gear as i do?</div></div><hr />

there is always someone trying to defend everything isnt there? only good thing about this game i can think of is that all the deviants can get together on one game and torment each each other rather than bothering the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

You forget that the tae-bo instructors will almost certainly be literally cockblocked by said raiders.</div></div><hr />

Not all the gameplay is sick and twisted ... <br />
<br />
<br />
Or you become a scientist and try to find cures against the many diseases that roam the world and threaten to kill the unfortunate souls who become infected.<br />
<br />
I've played PnP sessions that had the same dark freedoms, I've seen films in wide, public release that were no different.  There are already games on the market with *worse* content, without a  role to play balanced against sociopathic.  This is the first MMORPG I've heard of so far, tho, and that's the significance.  Especially if, and I think this is a safe assumption, that there is a depiction of the rape.  Movies do that too, and the streets are not engulfed in flames yet.  The game looks to be explicit, and potentially brutal, but it appears to have more going for it than an appeal to the sickest fetishists.<br />
<br />
I've lost count of the number of times - across various games - I've seen a shout or post wishing for an *adults only* server, without enforced restrictions on behaviour.  Looks like someone is hoping to cash in on that market niche.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to defend anything, my point was simply to ask whether or not anyone had actually checked out the website. I seriously doubt the game has a graphic rape simulation or any other sexually graphic material for that matter. If you look at their screenshots, it appears to be nothing more than a chat room with very minimal graphic content. The majority of the game seems to exist in the players imagination, with limited graphic support.<br />
<br />
There are already plenty of games in which the player is rewarded for deviant social behavior. Once again, I am not defending the game, or any other game which makes play out of deviant behaviour which relates to real world experiances, however I do believe in learning about the subjects I discuss, and it seemed like everyone here read a headline and skipped the content. But whatever, that's how people explore social subjects, read a headline or introductory paragraph which tells you what you're supposed to think, and make an immediate moral platitude to stand on. Gogo instant gratification! :confused:<br />
<br />
From actually reading the website, this game seems to me to be of higher moral value than a game like &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;. That's not saying much, but it doesn't go lower than the crap that's already out there and available to children all over the country.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. As a barbarian and being so handicapped in this area, he probably recognizes it's pointless to try to improve. You know, accept your limitations and move on with your life...</div></div><hr />
