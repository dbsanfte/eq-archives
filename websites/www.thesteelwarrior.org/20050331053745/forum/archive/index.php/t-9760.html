<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felwin</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I would start a little more discussion on WoW and the warrior class.  If you don't know, the alchemy class profession can make alot more than just healing and mana potions.  Just in the first few levels of alchemy, alchemists can make ac, regen, str, and max hp boosting potions.  My wife is an alchemist so I carry a large stack of each type with me at all times.</div></div><hr />

I took up Mining/Blacksmithing so that I could make my own weapons/armor.  You can make pretty good stuff, much of it better than what you can kill/quest for solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alchemy is a godsend for all classes but really shines for melee characters in my opinion.  Indeed it isn't just healing potions (although they are lifesavers) but rage potions, general stats and resists are all there for the offering.  GM Alchemists also have access to an improved potion effect trinket that is pretty spiffy.<br />
<br />
Smithing has some lure certainly and engineering is a pretty solid choice but alchemy is my favorite in many ways.</div></div><hr />

dont people love run on sentences?<br />

I need to look into alchemy at this point since i did not look into it in the beta. On another note, I do like that blacksmithing is really nice since yes you can make your own weapons and armor, and even have the makers mark on them. You can make weapons and armor early on that are accually useful comepared to when making stuff in EQ. Such as, now you can buy better stuff in the bazaar early on that will stick with you till later levels instead of taking hours and hours to learn stuff that really has no use. Also you can send it off to guild mates that are not even on instead of trying to catch em on and also you can auction wears off even when your offline so it does help the dialupers.(which i am not)<br />
<br />
I have added in punctuation marks for those who do not like to see run on sentences. I know there are mistakes in it but i am half asleep.  :D <br />
<br />
Hope to see some of ya in WoW.</div></div><hr />
