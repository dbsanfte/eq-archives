<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are some guides I wrote internally for the guild I'm in, this is from a few different posts so the continuity might not be that great, I tried to clean up any guild specific parts of the posts and remove any cussing in the post.  I played a 55 warrior and multiple 30ish level warriors between Beta 2 and release.  This is all accurate as far as I know through the last patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rage Efficiency Guide<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE is all about rage efficiency, this guide is meant to help show which abilities are more efficient for solo and group play. Against tanks its useful info since the fights last long enough for efficiency to come into play. Against casters the higher damage the better in general so efficiency goes out the window. The skills that have their damage based off weapon damage have 4 data sets, this is to give you an idea on efficiency based on how much dmg you do per hit. One handed weapons will hit for 50's, high end 2hers closer to the 300 depending on mob AC and level etc. Also these numbers are based on lvl 60 skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bread and Butter - Every bread and butter ability of the warrior needs to be revamped at least slightly. All of them except Rend fight against the concept of rage in one way or another. <br />
<br />
Slam - weapon dmg + 87, 15 rage 1.5 cast. Slam has been changed so that the slam timer interrupts your current swing time so by using it you take at least 1.5 seconds longer to swing your weapon. This results in slowed down DPS from your normal attack and slowed down rage production making it MUCH weaker than these numbers indicate. The talent for this reduces cast time by 0.5 seconds for 5 pts and is pretty much a complete waste right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
50 dmg - 137/15= 9.1 DPR<br />
100 dmg - 187/15= 12.5 DPR<br />
200 dmg - 287/15= 19.1 DPR<br />
300 dmg - 387/15= 25.8 DPR<br />
<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike - 2 times weapon dmg, 30 rage, 6 sec cooldown, reduces healing effectiveness by 50% for 10 seconds. One item of note with MS is that if you miss it takes all 30 rage, other warrior abilities only take 2 rage when missed.<br />
<br />
<br />
50 dmg - 100/30= 3.3 DPR<br />
100 dmg - 200/30= 6.7 DPR<br />
200 dmg - 400/30= 13.3 DPR<br />
300 dmg - 600/30= 20 DPR<br />
<br />
<br />
Rend - 196 - 10 rage, 21 sec, cannot crit and isn't modified by AC. Rend is one of our best abilities but it doesn't scale well at all at level 60. As you get raid weapons its damage is going to look worse and worse as it never goes up, sort of like mage spells without +damage gear, same problem.<br />
<br />
147/10=14.7 DPR<br />
196/10=19.6 DPR with talents<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike - 124, 15 rage next attack. HS makes your next attack generate no rage. The higher dmg the base attack does the more rage you lose out by using the ability. This makes it particularily weak with high damage weapons. With a raid level 2h weapon hamstring is more efficient than HS. When it crits it does do double bonus dmg but keep in mind a crit normally generates a lot of rage so its still not efficient. I gave 4 data sets to show the difference in rage cost based on weapon type, bigger dmg is more rage which is less efficiency.<br />
<br />
124/15= 8.3 DPR, 124/12= 10.3 DPR with talents<br />
124/20= 6.2 DPR, 124/17= 7.3 DPR with talents<br />
124/25= 5.0 DPR, 124/22= 5.6 DPR with talents<br />
124/30= 4.1 DPR, 124/28= 4.4 DPR with talents<br />
<br />
<br />
Area Effect - Warriors dont' do very good AE but its nice that we get the option.<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap - 62x4, 20 rage, Battle Stance only, slows mobs by 10%. Another reason why berserker stance is useless. This is probably worth using instead of HS when you have 2 targets.<br />
<br />
248/20= 12.4 DPR, 308/20=15.4 DPR with talents vs 4 targets<br />
124/20= 6.2 DPR, 154/20=7.2 DPR with talents vs 2 targets<br />
<br />
<br />
Whirlwind - weapon dmg x 4, 25 rage, 10 sec cooldown, Berserker stance only. Very short range. Notice this is weaker than sweeping strikes, thanks blizzard. No talent for this one.<br />
<br />
50 dmg - 200/25= 8 DPR<br />
100 dmg - 400/25= 16 DPR<br />
200 dmg - 800/25= 32 DPR<br />
300 dmg - 1200/25= 48 DPR<br />
<br />
<br />
Cleave - weapon+50 to 2 targets, 20 rage, next attack. This makes your next attack generate no rage just like HS make its DPR go way down. Usable in all stances though which is nice I guess.<br />
<br />
50 dmg - 200/20= 10 DPR<br />
100 dmg - 300/20= 15 DPR<br />
200 dmg - 500/20= 25 DPR<br />
300 dmg = 700/20= 35 DPR<br />
<br />
Sweeping Strike - 5 attacks, 30 rage, 30 sec cooldown. Generates rage with each attack. By far our strongest AE ability and truth be told probably overpowered. If you do a heroic strike with this ability the bonus dmg works on the extra attack as well. Battle stance only, yet another reason berserker stance sucks. <br />
<br />
50 dmg - 250/30= 8.3 DPR<br />
100 dmg - 500/30= 16.7 DPR<br />
200 dmg - 1000/30= 33.3 DPR<br />
300 dmg - 1500/30=50 DPR<br />
<br />
Situational Abilities - Situational abilities are generally used 1 or 2 times a fight only. The lack of a reactionary in berserker stance is just one of the myriad of issues with that stance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Revenge - 64-78, 5 rage, 5 sec cooldown. Must follow block, parry, dodge. Defensive stance only. Talent gives this 40% chance to stun for 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
64/5=12.8 DPR<br />
78/5=15.6 DPR<br />
<br />
12.8-15.6 DPR<br />
<br />
Overpower - 100%+35 - 5 rage, 5 sec cool down. Must follow dodge. Battle stance only. Talent increases chance to crit by 50% which makes its DPR incredibly high.<br />
<br />
50 dmg - 85/5= 17 DPR<br />
100 dmg - 135/5= 27 DPR<br />
200 dmg - 235/5= 47 DPR<br />
300 dmg - 335/5= 67 DPR<br />
<br />
<br />
Execute - 600+15 per rage, 15 rage. Only works on mobs 20% health or lower. Battle/Berserker stance only. This will drain all of your rage no matter what, even if it misses. Talent lowers rage cost by 5.<br />
<br />
600/15=40 DPR, 600/10=60 DPR with talent<br />
<br />
40 DPR plus 15 DPR per extra rage point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Utility - These aren't really meant to do damage but they are all instants so can add a little dmg here and there if you have rage to burn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hamstring - 45, 10 rage - Snares opponent. Talent increases snare amount.<br />
<br />
45/10 = 4.5 DPR<br />
<br />
<br />
Shield Bash - 45, 10 rage 12 sec cooldown. Interrupts casting, talent lets this silence casters<br />
<br />
45/10 = 4.5 DPR<br />
<br />
Concussion Blow - weapon dmg, 15 rage, 45 sec cooldown. This replaces your next attack and does not generate rage. This means its not instant anymore which sucks, it also means its DPR is actually a negative number, you will lose rage and not do extra damage with this.<br />
<br />
Intercept - 95, 15 rage, 30 sec cooldown<br />
<br />
95/15= 6.3 DPR<br />
<br />
<br />
Mocking Blow - 93, 10 rage, 2 minute cooldown. Makes mob attack you for a few seconds. Notice this actually does ok damage per rage, so not a bad ability to use while soloing since its not good for anything else solo.<br />
<br />
93/10 = 9.3 DPR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Largescale PvP - Warriors don't really shine at this for the same reason other melee don't, when its 40 on 40 you end up sniping at each other from range, when a warrior charges into the fringe they get wasted by all the people hanging back. They are decent for the final push of a fight but generally it makes sense to just protect your casters.<br />
<br />
<br />
1v1 PvP - Warriors dont' really shine here either. We have too few options for breaking root/snare, we don't have particularily good escapability and our burst DPS has been reduced a lot. We do good against other melee though Paladin can be rough and we are ok against fear classes since we have some fear removers but against anything with a root/snare its a frustrating battle. We also do ok against anyone we get the jump on though a well played mage is always a pain to deal with as a warrior.<br />
<br />
5v5 PvP - This is where warrior shines, small scale group on group stuff. The battle is small enough someone can keep us CC free and our extra durability makes enough of a difference that people don't try to focus on us early in a fight so we get to do some sustained dps and we offer some nice utility with shield bash etc as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior PvP Abilities <br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery - Talent in arms tree, lets you keep some of your rage when switching stances. I consider rank 3 in this a must have for a pvp warrior as you will need to switch stances depending on what you are fighting and being able to switch stance to intercept is incredibly important when you are jumped while fighting.<br />
<br />
Intercept - Zerk stance only, requires 15 rage, 30 sec cooldown charge that works in combat with a short stun to it. The big problem with this ability is you need 15 rage for it and you start with 0. That means either drinking a rage potion in which case you can't use any other potion during the fight or using blood rage which does 600 dmg and takes 10 seconds at level 60. I still use it but its not as strong as it would sound.<br />
<br />
Charge - battle stance, 1 sec stun, generates rage, 15 sec cooldown This no longer works in combat, that means if any caster hits you with an instant you can't use it and are stuck with intercept. Its still useful in that as long as you are within charge range nobody can run away from you without a speed enhancer.<br />
<br />
Berserker Rage - Zerk stance only, makes you immune to fear for 10 seconds, with 30 second cooldown. This is one of those abilities that make us decent vs fear classes.<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike - 30 rage, 6 second cooldown. This is still our big burst DPS ability, since the majority of our other damage abilities need to be reworked its still your best bet for the damage warrior. Nice burst DPS but the 30 rage cost is VERY expensive. This also cuts down all heals on target by 50% for 10 seconds which is very useful in pvp.<br />
<br />
Execute - 15+ rage. This is a finisher move that only works on people under 20% health, does very good damage though it will drain all of your rage.<br />
<br />
Shield Bash - 10 rage, 12 second cooldown. Interrupts casting and prevents spells in that school from being cast for 6 seconds. With the imp shield bash talent this also silences for 3 seconds. You can macro a weapon swap in order to use this.<br />
<br />
Overpower - 5 rage, does weapon dmg + small amount to target usable after they dodge. This is a rogue killer, especially if you have the talents to improve it. You can macro a weapon swap to a 2h in order to use this.<br />
<br />
Disarm - 20 rage, 1 minute cool down. Disarm opponent for 10 seconds. This is nice as well, most people don't do weapon chains and this will cut a melees dmg down significantly for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Intimidating Shout - 25 rage, 3 minute cooldown. AE fear for 8 seconds. Breaks when target is hit. This is the warriors best getaway ability and is useful in group on group as well. Using it does not turn off autoattack though, so turn that off before using it.<br />
<br />
Hamstring - 10 rage, snare target for 15 seconds, maxes at 40% snare, 50% with talents. One of weaker snares in game but it gets the job done.<br />
<br />
Piercing howl - 10 rage, talent in fury tree, AE snare for 6 seconds, not directional and longer range than hamstring which is nice.<br />
<br />
Demorializing Shout - 10 rage, AE atk debuff, useful against melee classes.<br />
<br />
Rend - 10 rage, relatively weak DOT but its still one of our most rage efficient abilities so I always use it. Will stop rogues from stealthing and stops anyone from doing a full bandage which is nice.<br />
<br />
Retaliation, Recklessness, Shield wall - These are all 30 minute cooldown abilities that are great when you have them up to use it. Shield wall makes you take 75% less dmg from all attacks, recklessness makes you immune to fear and makes your attacks crit and retaliation makes you do a free attack back every time someone hits you in melee. They all share the same timer, so use one and they are all down for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Sweeping Strike - 30 rage, 30 second cooldown. Talent in arms tree. This is our most rage efficient AE ability. It hits one extra target for each of your next 5 attacks.<br />
<br />
Whirlwind - 25 rage, 10 second cooldown. This is the 2nd best AE ability, it hits 4 targets for weapon dmg which does decent AE dmg. Its pretty small range though and only usable in zerk stance which makes you take 20% extra dmg.<br />
<br />
Concussion Blow - 15 rage, 45 second cooldown. Talent in defensive tree. 5 second stun, makes your next attack generate no rage so in reality it costs more than 15 rage. <br />
<br />
Deathwish - 10 rage, 3 minute cooldown. Talent in fury tree. increase your dmg 20% and become immune to fear for 30 seconds, you also take 20% more dmg from attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items - You no longer can swap armor in combat so some of these aren't as useful as before. <br />
<br />
Ornate Mithril Boots - Right click to remove an existing root and make you immune to root for 5 seconds, 1 minute cooldown I think.<br />
<br />
Glimmering Mithril Insignia - 10 minute cooldown. Requires 225 blacksmithing. 30 second fear immunity.<br />
<br />
Nifty Stopwatch - 30 minute cooldown. Increase movement speed by 40% for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Free Action Potion - 2 minute cooldown, makes you immune to root/snare/stun for 30 seconds<br />
<br />
Net-o-Matic - 210 Engineering req. 10 second root with 10 minute cooldown. Sometimes ends up rooting yourself instead. Still a nice item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is pretty easy for a warrior. Protection is a waste of time until high level, just ignore that tree until you are tanking BRD and higher dungeons then you can switch if you want. The must have talents are tactical mastery 3 and cruelty in my opinion and I can't imagine not getting piercing howl.<br />
<br />
The most common build is 31 arms, 20 fury. This build utilizes Mortal Strike to do heavy burst damage. Its not quite as good against fear classes since you do not get death wish and you have to pick a primary weapon type which can be kind of annoying in the long run. <br />

Gives you a 32% melee damage bonus for 4 swings any time you are the victim of a critical strike. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The other build is 31 fury, 20 arms. This is more about passive damage and rage generation. Its nice in that it gives you death wish which is a nice anti-fear and improved intercept which lets you use that ability more often. The money talent for this build is flurry which raises your DPS by about 12-17% depending on your crit rate. A variant on this one is 30 fury, 21 arms as sweeping strike in arms is probably better than the top tier fury talent Blood Thirst. This build will require you to use heroic strike as your bread and butter move which is kind of a weak ability, it would tend to favor dual wield with you switching to a 2h weapon for overpowers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is my experience by class including who I think holds the edge. - means the warrior holds edge, + means the class has the edge,++ means I think that class wins even if the warrior gets the jump on them and = means the fight is pretty even.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid++ <br />
<br />
Warrior just does not have the tools to kill a druid. If we get a snare they can change to travel form and outrun us, if we use a root stopper they do the same. They can kite us ad nausium. We just do not do the burst damage to be able to kill a well geared druid.<br />
<br />
Mage++<br />
<br />
Blink is greater than any of our abilities now. If I get the jump on a mage I stand a small chance as I can charge, they blink then I can intercept, they root and I use root breaker and I have 15ish seconds to kill them assuming they don't get a poly off on me, which they usually do. However that all leaves 0 rage for special moves and honestly a mage with shield up can last that long vs a warrior with 0 rage. If mage gets the jump on me I'm pretty much a sitting duck.<br />
<br />
Paladin++<br />
<br />
They do as much dmg as we do, they take hits as well as we do, they have 3 lives. Warrior does not have the burst dmg to take a paladin down anymore so we have to run them out of mana by always keeping MS on them so their heals are innefficient. It generally doesn't work though unless you have a gear advantage.<br />
<br />
Shaman+<br />
<br />
If I get charge off on shaman I stand a chance against them. Without charge I have to use intercept and their survivability and DPS is high enough that I'll end up losing the fight. They control the tempo of the fight with their movement abilities and instant snare.<br />
<br />
Hunter=<br />
<br />
I haven't done this fight enough to judge hunters but I think if I can get to melee range with them I stand a good shot at winning.<br />
<br />
Priest=<br />
<br />
We get a lot of anti fear tools which are nice but the priest can dispel most or maybe even all of them. MS makes his heals inefficient and we do have enough burst DPS to take down a priest so this is a fight that can go either way.<br />
<br />
Rogue-<br />
<br />
Warrior have a decent advantage against rogues but we can still lose this one, especially if they get the jump on us. A lot of it comes down to who gets more crits and how often the rogue dodges(the more the better for the warrior for overpower).<br />
<br />
Warlock-<br />
<br />
Anti-fear4thewin. Seduction is the one thing I really fear about with a warlock. I haven't fought vs the new pets so maybe its different now, don't know. If a warlock gets the jump on me they can still keep me chain feared and kill me.<br />
<br />
So there you have it, 3 classes destroy warrior, 1 has an advantage, 2 are even and 2 have a disadvantage. To me they still fall at the bottem end of balance, most classes have an equal number of advantages and disadvantages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have to disagree about the uselessness of Berserker Stance.  I found that it works just as well as Battle Stance in PvE, just a bit differently.<br />

I agree about getting Tactical Mastery.  Easily the best warrior talent.  Any time you can go into a new stance and have up to 25 rage immediately usable is good.</div></div><hr />

Here is the tradeoff for zerk after last patch.  You take 20% more damage, you attack 10% faster.  You can use whirlwind instead of sweeping strike but SS is a LOT stronger than whirlwind.  You don't get thunderclap(not a huge loss).  You can't charge but you can intercept(for pve charge wins).  You don't get overpower.  Overall Berserk stance does lower DPS than battle stance now, you take 20% dmg to do lower damage.  The one real bonus to zerk is berserkers rage and it doesn't come anywhere near offsetting the dmg bonus (which you will be taking dmg to use zerk rage).  I just don't see how its useful anymore.  I loved it pre-patch, but now it has no use anymore.</div></div><hr />

Kill speed was equivalent to battle stance, as was downtime.  It certainly isn't useless, at least to me.  We can disagree and that is ok.  Mostly I just wanted to put out a dissenting opinion since I think people should at least give the stance a shot to try it for themselves.<br />

I would say that the main disappointment about berserker stance for me is that there is just not enough of a difference between that and battle stance.  Both stances are good for pouring out dps.  Just seems that instead of 3 distinct stances, warriors really only have 2.</div></div><hr />

Would it still be worth going down the arms/fury path or head straight for the defensive skills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If all you care about is tanking for groups I'd go protection and Fury.  Probably 31 protection, 15 fury and 5 arms for the parry talent.  You don't NEED defensive talents until end game though, so you if want to level faster in duo's and solo you can go the arms method and then switch to defensive when you hit around lvl 45 and start doing more complicated instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does berserker rage overwrite fear or only make you immune to it?  In other words, if I am feared, can I use berserker rage to become unfeared?<br />

<br />
If not, is there any way (item, talent or other) to break fear?</div></div><hr />
