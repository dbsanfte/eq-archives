<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ompa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was pointed here from thecasters realm forum, looking for upgrade suggestions...<br />
<br />
Currently saving for a CoCW for haste (it's in my price range if I save for a bit &amp; I don't want to give up my current belt unless need be) so mainly looking for armor upgrades...<br />
<br />
funding level: I can usually generate about 1k a week if need be so not that wealthy (unless I'm missing some great way warriors can make mega plat)<br />
<br />
Guild level: moderate, we have a solid group of 65 that's almost always on &amp; a group of 55 that are hit &amp; miss, but as a whole a compitant bunch... even if I can't spell it.<br />
<br />

thanks in advance for any input...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kozakou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i would think that you should first get that haste item, CoCW isnt too bad, but no hp on it =/<br />
<br />
i sold my CoCW and bought a SBC + 2 valarioum rings... might not be worth the lost of haste, but im usually grouped with a chanter so i would rather get the 100'ish hp upgrade than the haste lost.<br />
<br />
also if your on CoV faction, try get draconic pauldrons (15ac 12sta 12 to something else i think) in WW... nice and easy quest i did it with me (57 at the time) 51 druid and 55 cleric.<br />
<br />
thats all i can really say... aside from that, try work on getting some hp gear =o)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, check allakhazam's site on bracer of benevolence, 2 of those would help your hp alot.  Then, Cloak of Greater Pernecity would be nice upgrade too.  For your boots, barbed dragonscale boots(i think that is name) would get you alot of hp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tempur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would do hierophants cloak over the pernicity one.  Raw HP is worth more IMO as its getting easier and easier to max sta out.  <br />
<br />
Axgoreth's belt is very nice AC but kinda sucks in that it has exactly 0 HP/STA on it.  I'd look for that new haste belt from Veksar.  Soulscream is its name IIRC.  Its 31% haste and has some HP, STA and a few other stats.  Another option is to take a few friends and go camp a Heavy Rubicite Girdle in CT.  You might get lucky with a Mosquito Leg Earring drop while you are there.<br />
<br />
If you are ally to CoV, do the draconic pauldrons and bracer of benevolence quests.  They are both very worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice is a damn fine earring for the price.  For about 5k you get 5ac, 5sta, 55hp, and some saves.<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes would be a decent upgrade for your mask.  8ac and 35hp iirc.</div></div><hr />
