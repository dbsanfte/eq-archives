I don't think anyone is arguing that it DOES effectively mitigate damage, just that the efficiency of it, compared to avoidance or armor mitigation, is lacking.<br />
<br />
That's what I taking from this thread, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only have a few items I'm after left to get, once I get those maybe i'll put together a set of valor, get my hands on a parser and compare the valor to my self-constructed set.<br />
<br />
Parsing is going to be needed at some point just to see if there arent hard-coded caps in place.<br />
<br />
For example, a mob could have a minimum hit percentage of 70%.   Making any +parry/dodge above 30 combo worthless.<br />
<br />
If everquest taught MMORPH players anything, it was the need to parse to proove/disproove hidden caps.</div></div><hr />

Ok, i thought it was clear enough, but for the not so bright minds:<br />
<br />
Do you prefer a good parry chance or a good amount of stamina against a fire attack?<br />
<br />
So when comparing these things, do not forget that stamina works against ALL types of damage.</div></div><hr />

Regurgitating facts everyone already knows with ADDED CAPITALIZATION does not make your point any more valid.<br />
<br />
Yes, stamina effectively mitigates spell damage.  This has already been pointed out several times.  You are not adding anything to the conversation.  My point was that on all types of damage OTHER THAN SPELL damage, avoidance may be more efficient, and that is what is being discussed.<br />
<br />
Context, it does a body good.  Read the whole thread next time.</div></div><hr />

I would prefer a good amount of stamina and a good parry chance vs. a huge amount of stamina.<br />
<br />
Sta may work against all types of damage, but your mitigation and avoidance (and in some cases resistance) is the only thing in the game extending your healers mana effeciency.  I would go even further in this and include your damage as a factor as well, for dead mobs tell no tales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WackenOpenAir</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All bullshit.<br />
I read this thread, only once this is mentioned by a guy. Seems mostly ignored by others. <br />
The guy i quoted in my last post obiously did not understand the meaning of my post so yes, if people are too stupid, i need to post it twice. <br />
<br />
Yes it is a very simple fact, everyone could know, should know and maybe does know. Fact remains this whole thread (except for that 1 post) people are reasoning if mellee combat is the only thing in the game. <br />
<br />
I wanted to pay some attention to the fact that there is also spell damage in one simple scentence. But got a stupid reply. Yes, then i get rude when i reply again.<br />
<br />
So now, some mod, delete this whole second page so that you guys can discuss onwards, i don't mean to interupt anything, but i do reply to rude or stupid posts with even more rude posts.<br />
<br />
PS, on the topic: i am not saying stamina is better, i do not know for i do not know all the formulas. I am very interested in the formulas and good logic reasoning. I would just like to see included the fact that stamina also works against spell damage where other things do not. I would also like to see resistance taken into account.</div></div><hr />

If I lost a good chunk of stamina I'd value it more agin, but right now I'd rather have another 1% dodge than 200hp. My outlook always adjusts depending on need I guess. If mobs start being able to dish out 6k a round in spike damage, then i'll adjust that...<br />

Wicked: Problem with that is stamina -doesn't- mitigate against all types of damage, it just provides buffer. There's mitigating melee damage and mitigating spell damage, so I keep/work on a set for each resistance type so that buffed I reach 200 (resistances get a real boost right at about 200). You can swap in different sets on the go for cases where resistance are more important, etc. However for standard casters in most situations they aren't going to get to cast very much anyway, so there's no need to switch. Resistance gears are more useful for things like Baron's aura, etc.<br />
<br />
In reality its just not practical to try and work resistances in to your normal gear. Resistances below 150 don't do jack, and you really need 200+ to resist decently.</div></div><hr />

Well, for me PvP is what i am concerned about. I don't know if i will run into a mage or a paladin. And in group pvp, i can recieve all kinds of damage. I sure will use a macro to swich a few pieces of equipment for when i meet a mage in 1v1 pvp (will when i have some good resist equip, wich i have not yet), but i must have some sort of build that works against all classes.<br />
Also can i not count on buffs from other players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granite, where are you finding this data? I can only find the mitigation % when I mouse over AC.  Am I not looking in the right place for the others or are they derived somehow?<br />
<br />
Currently I keep a set of &quot;of the Tiger&quot; plate for soloing and a mix of heavy mithril and ornate mithril for tanking (which isn't often at level 42).<br />
<br />
Great thread though. Thanks!<br />

<br />
Stamina is nearly useless in non raid situations<br />
<br />
I'm curious why you mentioned raids in this sentance.  You are claiming that STA is a great deal more useful in raids, but I'm curious to what degree.  I myself am debating STA vs avoidance in gear choices and am gearing myself up solely for raids.  I'm sure I will have some gear to swap in and out but my first choice gear I will intend to have the most effecient raid tanking gear.</div></div><hr />
