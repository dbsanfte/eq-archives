<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NAVCOK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 36 war, looking to get my weapon skills up ie...  2hs, etc.  However when I am in a group my DPS drops greatly and and I can not seem to hold agro when I switch to my 2hs.  When I solo I get my arse handed to me when I try to use my 2hs.  I am using a War Marshall's Bladed Staff.  What is the best way to get this skill up with out risking my groups life?  Are there any stats I should concider raising to help me with this?  I have heared a high Dex will be helpfull, but I thought I should still ask.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes dex helps to raise combat skills, but it isn't so important (just try to be above 75).<br />
a good way to raise a combat skill is to find a short delay weapon in that skill (so WMBS is good for 2HS) and find a full group a lvl above you and ask them if they care to let you swing at the mob a little bit to raise your skills, usually they will accept cause it add a little bit of DPS but without relying on it. If they accept, wait that their melee engage the mob, and then get a bit inside (watch for your health, you should ask for a heal cause you aren't inside the exp group) make some pause sometimes try to not bother them (don't get behind if there is no place for you and tother melee, don't ask for help/health/...).<br />
It's usually better to do so with a bow (archery) or a knife (throwing) because you can stay away from the mob and that your DPS is so lam that you will never get aggro. So with your 2HS it might be a little harder, but as soon as you get closer to your lvl skill cap you will be able to hold aggro better and thus you will be able to improve your 2HS while tanking.<br />
<br />
Note : it's a long time since I was a young warrior, so I might be wrong, but I thought that weapon skills were just for better domage (ie bigger max and max more often), and since we found that DPS hate is not linked to DPS but to the weapon (domage, delay, classes, lvl) and the number of swings (no matter if miss or hit), you may not improve your aggro control by raising your 2HS skill. But we never parsed non-lvl-65 hate formula so it may work perhaps, so it would be great if you give us feedback of your aggro control before and after maxing 2HS.<br />

Have fun,<br />
