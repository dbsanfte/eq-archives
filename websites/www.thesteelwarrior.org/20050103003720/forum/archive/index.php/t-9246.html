<br />
Listen to Wulfran...AET is one of the best AA's (if not the best) we can get.  I can't count the number of times this has saved groups and raids I've been in.<br />
<br />
After that I'd finish CS3, then LR5, then Sturd 2, then Planar Power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have a couple hints for equipment, but nothing along the lines of what you may get in VT.  If you're looking for some quick and easy upgrades until you get into VT more for items, I'd suggest getting a couple 1group items outside of raiding for shoulder/face.  Since you're getting in VT, and looking at your Magelo, I think you can easily one-group them outside of raiding.<br />
<br />
Face - Get a decent group and go to Siren's Grotto.  Take a right after entering, under the water to the area beyond the wall.  Go to the Sirens tower (up the ramp and across the bridge to the right) and find Mistress Latazura.  Kill her as often as she spawns (2-3 days, I think).  She drops a 20ac 55hp mask (Flawless Steel Mask) with nice stats all around, don't know on rarity.  Very nice, IMO, until you get a raid drop better.  You're certainly not hurting for hp (could be wrong), and I think all-around it's better than the Amygdalan Chain Mask even with the 30 less hp...has 12 more AC.  (Not better than the Thulian Visage of Horror though)<br />
<br />
Shoulder - I'd consider going to kill Vahksis the Shade in PoNightmare for the Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates.  Much better than that Mantle of Ill Omen, should be groupable for you with a decent group.  Looks good until a raid drop will replace it, and it's droppable.<br />
<br />
I didn't see any augments in your so you may have these.  In your off-time, get the 10ac augs (Brilliant Blood Ruby of Prowess, BB adv camp for 510 each) and stick them into your Shoulder/Face/Neck/Waist/Back items (one each).  They can go in all types of slots, and a good easy AC upgrade (50 raw AC, ~80 modified I think, and can remove and move them to any new items you get).  These are good even with VT gear...they just make the items better.</div></div><hr />

After that I would recommend finishing CS, doing ID, then finish PD, then sturdyness to probably level 3...that should keep you busy for awhile.  On the subject of Ambidexterous, I would hold off on that quite awhile...get the AA's that increase swings no matter what you have equipped, 1 hander or 2 hander, ie Ferocity and Flurry.<br />
<br />
Edit:  On the subject of gear(I forgot to comment on this):  Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates as mentioned above will last you a long time(I only just replaced them myself), and if you can afford it, you might replace your rings with Steel Rings of Earthen Resilience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree this shoulder is a good replacement, but I don't think it's one-groupable by 99% of the population.  We needed 3 solid groups of 65s (non-elemental) to take this guy out.  I can see 2 grouping it at lvl 70, but if his friends are at the same gear level as he is, 1 group will get slaughtered.  (btw, I'm about 700 hp, 100 ac over his magelo)</div></div><hr />

I've nearly taken this guy out before with one group, before we even were able to handle LDoN hards, with a Paladin tank (two healers including me, and was iffy though)  Just take the quick way to his plateau, can even charm a horse for added dps.<br />

Or you could just take the easy route and buy from bazaar.</div></div><hr />

How does one non-EP group handle 6 mobs at once walking to the platform?  Or, do you just let the platform fill up and kite everything around and pick them off one by one?  We used 1 group per spawn point (hence the 3 grps.)  I'd be interested to hear details of your strategy on this guy...sounds like it must be very different from what we did.  (seriously...if you know an easier way to do this guy I'd really like to hear it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Wandor said...you're thinking of Mujaki. (Although that does explain a lot)  Although I believe there is a method you could actually use to do Mujaki with one group (Bard kiting the multiple mobs and using a Knight with Fearless AA for tanking), my old guild usually took the full amount of possible people (4 groups) to do.  Vahksis stands on a plateau you usually have to go through the Hobgoblin caves to get to, surounded by nothing but nightmare horses.  Diving off the plateau allows you to escape him if you mess up.</div></div><hr />

Disagree.<br />
<br />
500 extra hp that have nothing to do with equipment is worth taking the time to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is somewhat accurate in the context of this player, but not overall.<br />
<br />
Planar power is very useful... but only if you are pushing the caps on your stats.  Planar Power ups the caps on your stamina- yielding more hp, as well as all your other caps.  It is definitely worth spending the AA. <br />
<br />
Yes, you are better off with other defensive skills first up to the point where the stamina yielding ones lift you over your caps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, well, you think that AE taunt is useless, so we all know what your opinion is worth.<br />
<br />
Sturdiness is overpriced bullshit.  Weapon affinity is pure aggro, something that most warriors have issues with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't recall how much Planar Power costs (2 per level?) but if it's even 2/level that'd put its return to about the same as level 3 Sturdiness.<br />
<br />
So you could at least get Sturdiness 1 and 2 before Planar Power.  There's also much better use, defensive or otherwise, for the measly effect you get out of PP.<br />
<br />
As for Sturdiness, it's not worth it unless you have at least all the defensive AAs done.  I'm not really sure if it's worth it over OoW mitigation/avoidance AAs seeing you could get both mitigation and avoidance maxed out and still have some left over instead of getting Sturdiness.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the frank reply Haas.  <br />

I'll be equally frank in reply.  Aggro is only worthwhlile if you can take the hits.  Judging from your Magelo, you could use some more HP yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here, let me enlighten you. <br />
<br />
You have a strong like for AA's like Sturdiness and Planar Power, and you ignore AA's that are actually important to every day life of a tank.  You're more interested in your l33t mangelo and EQrankings number than how well you know how to play the game.  Sturdiness and Planar Power are the top 2 indicators of this condition, as you'll find people who are primarily concerned with their stats compared to everyone else (Hi &quot;Judging from your Magelo, you could use some more HP yourself.&quot;).  The AA's are in effect, fairly useless for their overall benefit.<br />
<br />
I have a strong suspiscion that you don't actually play this game.  I think you have some kind of pen and paper game going on based upon Magelo and Allakazam.  You and your buddies sit around and talk about slaying the dragon and what phat loots you got on your latest expedition, and haven't actually played the game to see what is the single most important thing to a warrior -- aggro.<br />
<br />
You'll notice this when you called AE taunt useless in the sticky in this forum, and you were promptly pounded into submission.  You'll also notice this in the several threads in and around here about Weapon Affinity parses, Anger vs Ykesha hate generation, 2h vs 1h aggro, and the like.  The intelligent people know what's important, and that's aggro.  You won't find a more fiercely debated subject on this board.  Your AC and HP don't mean fucking shit if you can't get the mob to beat on you rather than the rogue using a 1:1 ratio dagger.<br />
<br />
So, you got any more blind stabs at things you know nothing about, or are you gonna sit down and listen and maybe learn something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Testosterone aside, I'd recommend balancing Sturdi and WA.  With some yak or anger aug'd weapons, you shouldn't need the full WA5 before moving on to get some hitpoint-focused AA, like Sturdi.  Alternatively, I think its a waste of your time to finish up, say, Sturdi 4 and 5 until you have most everything else you want - they just cost way too damn much.  The first three Sturdi are way worth the AA, though.  Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
It is also my opinion that you should mix in some offensive AA, not because it'll make you incredibly l33t or anything, but because you will pass out and die of boredom merely focusing on 200 straight defensive AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already know how that feels lol, grinding throughCA and CS 3 without seeing any benefit, holding out for the end benefit without getting trigger happy, so to speak, and spending the aa`s on something not as useful but giving immediate effect, PD or PP for instance. Studi 4 and 5 will be hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not surprised.<br />
<br />
I NEVER said aggro wasn't important.  I merely said that if you were going to take aggro, you'd damn well better be able to survive it.   That means defensive and HP AAs are very important.  500 HP to any warrior floating around the 8K mark buffed out is a big deal.   Is it worth the 60 AA you have to throw at it.  Well it seems like it now.  Didn't while I was doing it.  If you wanna complain about how much sturdiness costs, I'm there with you.  If you wanna say its worthless, I'm sorry but you are full of it.<br />
<br />
And yes, your magelo is weak.  Jackass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you want a break from defensive AA's, try out Stalwart Endurance (anti-stun AA)...if you're like me and hate getting stunned, this is a great AA to get.  Don't expect much for the first level, but the second level is noticeable and I hear the 3rd is great (I have 2 lvls atm.)</div></div><hr />

But once you have WA and the defensive ones then yeah, what else are you gonna spend the points on.  However, I think Warriors need to max WA very early.  I totally disagree with the point that you need to be able to take the beating before you can hold agro.  A warrior needs to ALWAYS be able to hold agro, then play in zones that fit they're hp/ac.  I don't mean to be rude, you must have a BoW in a bag I missed or something, because your Time and KT flagged and I'm in a little family guild with next to no flags and there's no way in hell you could ever get agro from me with that setup, ever.  Maybe it's different for us, I mean we do some hard ldons and such and the cloth simply cannot take agro in our groups or everyone dies.  I guess when everyone's time flagged it doesn't matter so much if the mob bounces around the group for a little while, or the players are better so the mob is always under control, etc.  That's just my 2cp, who knows I may even be wrong, someone said it happened once but I don't believe them /wink.</div></div><hr />

It may not be the most efficient use of your time, but we've always been able to take an ass whooping in shitty gear provided you could survive until the heals landed.<br />
<br />
Sturdiness is nice, but if your aggro blows its not very cost effective to spend AA on hp's that dont get used /chuckle.  Let the healers worry about keeping you alive (it is their job after all) and you worry about keeping the mobs attention.</div></div><hr />

Being in a raid guild I would stop now and get AE taunt,although ,I don't know where you stand in the order.Still if you're going to tank it is too useful an aa to be without when raiding.Then I would finish your POP and earlier defensive aa.Mitigation &amp; Avoidance AA is &gt; HP aa for similiar cost.Warriors do get their ego's wound up in their hp.Imo Beeafraid has it all wrong.Iwould finish all your pre GOD/OOW defensive aa before thinking about offensive aa or sturdiness.I would then do WA  and after that sturdiness.By that time you may be into OOW defensive aa and find it best to stall the last few levels of sturdiness.<br />

Note : with really really big mob, warrior can be single rounded, their first thought is then 'I don't have enougth HP', but actually they first need more AC then more HP. this way of thinking comes from the old AC cap that was preventing us to actually increase our AC above a given limit. thus it was just a question of HP at this time. <br />
EQ is a living game, at every single patch the game change. and if SoE decide to, they can completly change the way fights go. thus we have to keep our eyes open and adapt ourself quickly for the survavibility of the intire group/raid. Beeafraid is making this mistake but it isn't his fault. it's all other classes' fault when they choose tank order by their HP, doing so they let poeple that scrapped the first two part of our role to focus only on HP so that they have a chance to be the one.<br />
<br />
So it's up to you to either choose to do your job right when you can do it, or to do your job at any price and cross-finger for nobody mesure your job's quality.</div></div><hr />

Mask and clicky gloves are kewl.I would try and save all my visable slot upgrades for EP's if you feel comfortable waiting and can do your job atm.<br />

<br />
Finally finished CS3, last night, already have LR5 and WA2 which seems OK for agro at the mo.  Raid wise im about 4th or so in our guild tanks.  About 5 easy adv away from an anger 3 aug, but holding off them so I can up my aa's so I can do them in Hard(less time spent).<br />
<br />
Assume you are talking about the AHR mask and the clicky proc gloves?, not too worried about glove atm as got the new OOW one not great but decent enough over the kylong darkmail for 6k paid.  More ineterested in upgrading neck waist shoudlers and jewellery - possibly with more OOW gear money permitting, but also Cord of Midnight or Gorget of Superiority from VT.</div></div><hr />

It may not be the most efficient use of your time, but we've always been able to take an ass whooping in shitty gear provided you could survive until the heals landed.<br />
<br />
Sturdiness is nice, but if your aggro blows its not very cost effective to spend AA on hp's that dont get used /chuckle.  Let the healers worry about keeping you alive (it is their job after all) and you worry about keeping the mobs attention.<br />
<br />
This is true.  However, it won't help you tank in GoD trials 6 and 7 much.  And it sure won't help in Kod Taz.  And it won't help you in new zones like MPG either.  <br />
<br />
I guess I'm not making my point clear enough so I'll restate it more plainly...<br />
<br />
I find that I keep much better aggro when I'm not waiting on a rez.<br />
<br />
One thing I'm finding is that with Omens of War, since people can get to the zones without having flags, a lot of people are able to visit the zone who don't have any business playing there.   As a result, clerics have taken to finding out tanks stats before inviting them to groups, kinda like it was in pre-elemental POP zones.<br />
<br />
So far, I have been asked by several groups what my HP/AC were before being invited.  Not one of them have asked whether I had the right aggro buffs.<br />
<br />
The reason they ask this question is very simple.  In most of these groups, the mobs hit hard enough that if the tank goes down, the group wipes.  Not may wipe, will wipe.  Most enchanters don't have the right spell to mezz mobs in MPG yet.  Even for the ones that do, its dicey.<br />
<br />
Now I will add, that in most of the groups that I've had that went south, the reason was healers that weren't really ready for the zone.  But that's another story.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I was wrong when I said what I did about AE taunt.  I admitted that and my opinion has changed.<br />
<br />
You, yourself had to admit something similar on another recent post about lvls vs AA if I recall correctly.  I could have just as easily said that you had no right to an opinion because you were wrong about that.  Because that is exactly what you did to me.<br />
<br />
If you want to use the penis size analogy, then my point had nothing to do with the size of my own.  Rather it had to do with how loud and abusive you are of anyone with a dissenting opnion, which I can only assume is intended to mask the fact that yours is so small.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't disagree there.  The only reason I put in the 20 aa for sturdiness 5 is frankly because I was so far in, that I wanted to see it through.  <br />
<br />
I normally try to finish one AA chain before moving on to the next one.  Don't have any good reason.  I just don't like leaving them hanging.  I guess its partly from the guild requirements that I was trying to meet had max on all the ones that were required.  It wasn't easy to blow 20 on sturdiness 5. <br />
<br />
Though 100 hp isn't going to buy much on eqrankings ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look, another guy understands.<br />
<br />
Sturdiness is shit.  Is it a nice AA?  Sure, I guess 100hp a tier is a pretty cool AA.  But when you compare the costs of that AA, to all other AA's, it FALLS SHORT.  There is no reason to have Sturdiness 3-5 done if you're under AT LEAST 200AA's, and probably closer to 250.<br />
<br />
That is not what I'd call a good AA.  Furthermore, you did exactly what I said you'd do, which is start comparing magelos once it was explained to you why sturdiness doesn't even hold a candle to WA.  There is no opinion involved, it's either worth the points, or it's not.  The only way it's worth the points is if you have over 200, or you're only concerned about your E-penix.  You clearly fall into one of those categories with your comments, and I can think of a lot better way to spend 36 points in your AA profile than on 200 hit points.</div></div><hr />

Just asking advice what would be the next aa's to work on, Innate Defence, Planar Durability, Planar Power, Ambidexterity or Sturdiness.<br />
I'd get PD3 then ID5, then mix and match between PP and Sturdiness 1 &amp; 2 to get your best bang for your buck.</div></div><hr />

Right...because I'm never going to be waiting on a rez if my aggro sucks ass and my cleric gets smoked.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Your HPs (and other factors of course) give you an indication of what content you should be doing.  Someone is not going to be doing Vxed trials if they are 7k buffed but if they are smart about their aggro, you can be sure that they'll be holding it well at WW in PoV.  If you are putting more emphasis on HP gear vs. making sure you have the best possible aggro thats available to you, then you are sadly mislead in my opinion.<br />
<br />
This has been said elsewhere too...if people are asking you what your AC/HPs are rather than what AAs you have, they aren't asking the right questions.  An 8k HP/1400 AC tank with the right AAs and smarts can out-tank a dumbass 10k HP/1800 AC tank with the wrong ones ANY day of the week.</div></div><hr />

Haass, yer over-stating it and specifically overstating what Brutul and I have both posted now.  Sturdi is a fine AA ... at lower tiers.  The first couple tiers in Sturdi are worth the AA expenditure in my opinion.  The last few are not until you have way more AA than any sane person should.  <br />
<br />
I'd still recommend balancing Sturdi and WA (once you have other foundational defensive AA).  IMO, unless you have severe aggro issues, WA5 is just about as &quot;worth it&quot; as Sturdi 5.  I mean, it would take one helluva shitty weapon setup to require  WA5.  You can't go wrong with more aggro so you might as well max WA eventually, but I'd think most folks would agree that after about WA3 you'll find diminishing returns and not a ton of need for continuing down that path....which means its time to focus on another needed AA path and return at a later time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh I see. So tell me, how long are you waiting on that rez when it's the cleric doing the CR? If you can agro, maybe you can be a speedbump, the mob gets slowed, and some weaker melee has a chance of tanking. Don't have the agro? That mob isn't looking at you. He chews up the chanter that tashed him, then turns on the cleric. Oh, now that he isn't slowed and no heals are moving, maybe he'll look at you. Try that again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think I'm overstating anything.<br />
<br />
I have sturdiness 1.  I *might* get sturdiness 2 when I'm done with WA5, I haven't decided yet.  I won't touch 3-5 until after :<br />
<br />
Flurry 3-6<br />
CF 4-6<br />
Finishing blow 2-6<br />
Double Riposte 0-6<br />
and probably extended shielding and hastened instigation.<br />
<br />
Here's my point.  Sturdiness, as a whole, is a shitty AA.  There are levels of it that are better than others.  25hp per AA point isn't bad.  16 and 2/3 is really starting to cut it close, but EIGHT, count them, a massive EIGHT Hit points per AA when it's maxed is a good skill?  Complete crap.<br />
<br />
Then, you sound like you think I'm overstating WA5.  Well, I see everyone running around with Augments that took them 10-20 adventures to acquire, and those are apparantly worth it, but spending the XP you earned on those adventures to globally increase your aggro/dps/utility/etc isn't?  I don't see the logic there either.  Weapon affinity isn't there to increase your aggro from 2000 per minute (or whatever) to 3000, it's there to make it so you can get your procs earlier on average, and lock down the mob earlier, so that your shaman can slow earlier, so that you save your cleric mana, and so that your entire group can be more efficient.  <br />
<br />
And that's FAR more useful than making that CH land for 7500 instead of 7250.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we can never generate enougth hate when we have strong dps in the group (remember that a wiz don't need much outside help to generate they best dps, their only limit is you).<br />
balacing WA and Sturdi is dumb because :<br />
<br />
1. given Antero stats and weapons, his aggro from proc should be around 22% of the total (31% haste counted). thus  WA benefit :<br />
WA1: +7.83% proc rate/ 2 AA = +3.92% per AA ~ +0.89%aggro/AA<br />
WA2: +14.47% proc rate from base = 6.64% more / 4 AA = +1.66% per AA ~ +0.38%aggro/AA<br />
WA3: +26.27% proc rate from base = 11.8% more / 6 AA = +1.97% per AA ~ +0.45%aggro/AA<br />
WA4: +40.95% proc rate from base = 14.68% more / 8 AA = +1.84% per AA ~ +0.42%aggro/AA<br />
WA5: +52.04% proc rate from base = 11.09% more / 10 AA = +1.109% per AA ~ +0.25%aggro/AA<br />
would be better with 305DEX and worse with better haste (it balances each other when buffed at 305dex and 91% haste). BWT, it would blows up if both 1Her were auged !!<br />
<br />
2. Surdi benefit for Antero (5636 HP unbuffed):<br />
Sturdiness 1 : 100HP increase : 4 AA = 25HP/AA ~ +0.44%/AA<br />
Sturdiness 2 : 100HP increase : 8 AA = 12.5HP/AA ~ +0.22%/AA<br />
Sturdiness 3 : 100HP increase : 12 AA = 8.33HP/AA ~ +0.15%/AA<br />
Sturdiness 4 : 100HP increase : 16 AA = 6.25HP/AA ~ +0.11%/AA<br />
Sturdiness 5 : 100HP increase : 20 AA = 5HP/AA ~ +0.09%/AA<br />
and it gets worse with bigger HP (think of buffed HP for real situation) ...<br />
<br />
3. if you multiple the aggro increase by the number of DPS classes in the group, you get the fight time reduction. multiple it by the Mob's DPS and you get the HP saved per fight.<br />
<br />
4. your HP increase means either bigger time step between  constant heal or  the amount of mana saved for the complete heal (beter HP/mana ratio).<br />
<br />
=&gt; do you really think that you will save more mana with sturdi or with WA ?<br />
actually, the best bang for AA is first def AA (mit/avoid) then WA then Sturd (at that point you have much more HP so the benefit decrease even more).</div></div><hr />
