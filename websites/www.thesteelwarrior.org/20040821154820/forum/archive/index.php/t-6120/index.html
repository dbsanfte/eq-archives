<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>exeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're here because we love warriors - despite the fact they are tough to level and incurr some humiliating comparisons to other classes when it comes to our core competency in tanking.<br />
<br />
But in talking about our plight - we might consider discussing the cleric's plight in the same breath.<br />
<br />
Clerics used to be the best healers in the game bar none.  In addition to being the unquestioned healers - they had qualitatively different abilities such as rez (Knights was poor by comparison) and soul binding (before NPC's served this role).<br />
<br />
Of course they lost of all this:  shamans and druids have comparable healing once they reach the 50's; NPC soulbinders; and other classes that rez to a comparable % at the high end of the game (Pally's, Necros).  Clerics have lost out to hybrid classes the same way that tanks have - probably worse.<br />
<br />
To compound matters, while the sheer ability of the cleric to heal in a single shot may still be superior to other classes - his partner - the warrior - does not display a clear hit point advantage beyond hybrid classes to really illustrate this fact (correct me - but warrior hp's about 5-10% higher than Knights  or SKs at high end of the game).<br />
<br />
The height of humiliation is that with the addition of new zones (PoP) the cleric - warrior alliance no longer works.  They can no longer duo.  No slow.  No kiting.<br />
<br />
If we want to talk about &quot;stand-down&quot; and other expressions of dissatisfaction - we might do so by joining forces with what used to be our perfect class fit - the cleric.<br />
<br />
We might go so far has to say pure classes are dying in EQ.<br />

<br />
99.5% of all of the game's known content can be MT'd by non-Warriors. However, in GoD *The Heavy Tank* is actually prefered when fighting a double-handful of named hard-hitting high DI mobs. The need for Clerics in these battle is sooo obvious that the majority of players won't be silly enough to suggest that Druids or Shaman should be able to do the job.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately these are flag mobs. True many of the flag trials aren't mandatory, but it does provide an excuse for &quot;Tank Parity&quot;.<br />
<br />
I rather like Frodlin's idea for Advancement and Adventure versions of these zones. Flagging can remain hard and strong preferance can remain. Those merely farming drops or getting experiance can face easier named mobs.<br />
<br />
There are those that don't want Warriors to be *The Heavy Tank*. They reject suggestions like Frodlin's out of hand.<br />

<br />
Yup that is a good point and I have heard that (at level 61 I doubt I can tank yet in GoD - so I have not seen this yet for myself).  This is a nice change - but I wonder if the need for warriors &amp; clerics in GoD - relative to toher classes - will quickly disappear.<br />
<br />
For fresh high end zones I admit there seems to be a case for these classes - until the gear / levels or aa ramp on the server - and thing seems to return to status quo again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&lt;&lt;Of course they lost of all this: shamans and druids have comparable healing once they reach the 50's&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
sounds like what you need to do is find a good cleric friend to sit down and teach you how to use your different heal spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Clerics were in a really bad spot in Luclin.  Needed for raids and worthless for xp groups.  PoP (although I hated it as an expansion) pretty much fixed that and I haven't really had trouble getting a group since.  There are nights that I log in and go several hours lfg but they are very few and far between.  I don't think clerics really need much help in this way.<br />
<br />
Clerics in the 50s still have some problems and maybe that is what the poster is seeing?  But 65 clerics at least seem to me to be fine as far as desirability for groups.  Some clerics are scared that if druids/shaman get what they want (which is improved healing) that we'll go back to Luclin.  I don't expect that but it is possible if they are improved too much too fast.  I really want to see them get better heals.  Most of them don't want my job.  Most of them want to be backup healers with primary other functions and I'd like to see them able to backup heal better.  Will it take my spot in some groups?  Probably.  But I think it would also be good for the game to have more options for people looking to fill spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>exeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">rysingsun1,<br />
<br />
As a warrior I don't find myself healing others too often.  But in talking to clerics - yes - that is the feedback I have received (e.g. my 65 cleric friend / with epic).<br />
<br />
Druids and shammies received complete heal, greatly changing the advantage in healing clerics brought to the game.  With the current exception of GoD - and while I have not raided high end mobs in a year - what I saw was shammies and druids subsitituting for clerics easily on healing.<br />
<br />
If the argument is that clerics have maintained their place in healing (as warriors used to in tanking) - outside of Gates I am not aware of any raid targets/zones/expansions where clerics cannot be substituted by other &quot;healing&quot; classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snoedog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I duel box a 65 cleric and warrior.  I think what exeter is talking about is normal experiencing.  I was able to duo with my characters until bot, where you pretty much had to slow the mob if you were going to tank it.<br />
<br />
neither the cleric nor the warrior can snare reliably, so agro kitting, like so many other classes use to solo in PoP, is impossible.  In this way the cleric/warrior combo is less powerfull than a solo class when it comes to gaining experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Better yet is a charming class in PoP, park that warrior and let a mob do it! Druids are great for this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Druids and shammies received complete heal<br />
You do realize that the Shaman &quot;complete heal&quot; is a 10 second cast, 1950hp heal, right?  No self respecting shaman I know even mems it.  Okay, maybe for the few levels between it and Tnarg's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Seriously... Druid CH can do 5k or so. CLeric CH tops out at 9K. Shammy CH isn't even 3k with all the focus thrown in.<br />
<br />
Even with only EP gear, Druids almost never CH me for full, and a Shammy spending 10s on a 3K heal for me would be kinda laughable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>exeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kamidari,<br />
<br />
No I didn't.  Yet shammies heal on raids - is it CH or another healing spell they rely on for this purpose?<br />
<br />
Ariene - you make some interesting points.  Responding for my cleric mate - he has no problems finding groups - but his value in raids situations has been reduced (bartering power for gear) given the increased healing of druids &amp; shammies.<br />
<br />
Daramin - &quot;Seriously... Druid CH can do 5k or so. CLeric CH tops out at 9K. Shammy CH isn't even 3k with all the focus thrown in.&quot;  You make a good point - but I think a stronger one for the high end of the game.  Below level 60 how many warriors have 5K hps unless they have been working on aa?  The cleric benefit - like the warrior benefit in tanking - really seems to matter in the extreme situations.<br />
<br />
I dunno - maybe I am wrong here - maybe clerics are satisfied with how their class has been treated over the past 2 years.  For my friend - who's 65 cleric is his main - and he does not bot (just as a warrior for many of us is our main and not botted) he feels disatisfaction with the treatment of his class and I thought his experiences paralleled that of the warrior expressed on these boards.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Usually on raids, shamans use Tnarg's Mending, which is 1300hp for 450 mana, with a 3.75 second cast time.  It's affected by most focus (more healing, faster casting, less mana), so while it's still pretty hard on the mana to chain cast, it's a workable spot-heal on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">did you have your friend proof read your post before you began crusading on his behalf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shaman mini ch is basically just shit.  Not even worth talking about.<br />
<br />
Druid 5k heal is a lvl 64 spell, it also has a max of 75% of the persons hps, so even if your tank is 4k hps, it still won't heal for full, only for 3k.  The 58 mini ch is 3k, and max of 75% also.<br />
<br />
Seriously, clerics are in a very nice spot post 60.  Post Luclin (excluding LDoN normal / ykesha), shamans don't have much of a chance to do much main healing.  If slow is resisted and they get behind on healing, they can't catch up (unless you have a pretty good tank for the content).  Druids do decently with a slower, but without a slower they don't have the power clerics do.  For GoD, most people will find clerics needed for fast heals.  If any class other than a cleric can heal ya mountains+, then you can be deeper in at a nicer spot if you did have a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not to mention the other cleric abilitys like heals over time that provide more leeway for high DPS mobs, a half second cast AA that takes HP from higher hp group members and adds em to hurt group members, a fast cast heal that casts at about 3 seconds for around 3k hp, divine intervention, the single best HP / AC buffs in the game, 1.8 second cast heal for close to 1750hp, effictive stuns, hammer and pet that adds considerable DPS, a pac that works in doors and many other things.<br />
<br />
Druid CH is 4600hp or so for 600 mana = 7.66 hp/mana and heal at most only 66% as fast.<br />
Cleric CH 7500 for 400 = 18.75 hp/mana point<br />
<br />
Clerics have it way better for healing than any other class, druids have a very hard time keeping up with heals in relevant content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Clerics had problems during luclin?  Funny I don't recall them having problems what were they?  If anything they seem like they were the only choice.</div></div><hr />

Clerics had problems during luclin?  Funny I don't recall them having problems what were they?  If anything they seem like they were the only choice.  <br />
<br />
The only choice for raids.  <br />
<br />
But the highest level was 60 then and the best xp was soloing and killing low dark blues as fast as you could (if your class could solo) or grouping and still taking in the lowest level mobs that were still dark blue and kill lots of them fast.  Nothing in luclin hits really hard so a druid or shaman could keep up healing just fine for the most part and add some dps on the side.  Best duo in the game back then was shaman and monk and it seemed like almost every melee had a bot healer of some sort.  <br />
<br />
If you were in a raid guild, they needed a lot of clerics for those long long chains (remember when mod rods were dropped on the floor and clerics could click them like crazy and fights were forever?) but then when xp time came there were more clerics then groups to support them.  <br />
<br />
If we did get a group, it was usually a pitty group.  We didn't contribute any dps (we didn't even have our hammers back then (30-40 dps on a good day) and our best nuke did under 1k damage) and if only a little healing was needed... shaman or druid could heal and add dps.  I got groups when my friends were on and I tradeskilled when they weren't unless I got really lucky and someone needed a cleric in CT (which was HARD back then!).  <br />
<br />
Any longtime cleric remembers how this felt and it is why some of us get so touchy when shaman/druids want better heals.  Personally I think they need better heals but even though I think that there is a little tiny part of me that fears going back to being useless except when it is time to count 1 2 3 CH 1 2 3 CH 1 2 3 CH.<br />
<br />
So... in this yes I can say that there is a similarity between the clerics situation and the warriors before the addition of incite and other ways to help with agro.  Its just that clerics haven't been there in a long time.  And I don't think since the melee changes and GoD, warriors are there anymore either.  I don't think the devs have it perfect yet but things are a lot better then they used to be for both classes.  I'm expecting things to swing back the other way which I think is a good thing - I think GoD went too far toward cleric/warrior necessity - but I just hope and cross my fingers that the pendulum doesn't swing too far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Clerics were complete dead weight for exp groups in Luclin.  I remember some of them even went to the grey and kited skeletons for exp hehe.  A paladin or a bard was enough of a healer to keep up with the pitiful amount of damage Luclin exp mobs are capable of producing.  I used to duo with a shaman and tanking slowed mushrooms in FG a fungi was enough to keep me healed.  Only time the shaman would cast a heal was after Cann V.    Clerics brought nothing to the group except a drain on exp.  Of course PoP fixed that in a big way hehe.</div></div><hr />

Yep, that was the state of Clerics then. Of course my Druid would charm wolves in ME and I would park my Warrior while the wolf tore stuff apart, or RoT 8 blues at once. Warriors had it no better almost, and just syphoned exp off.</div></div><hr />

exping in PoV, or tier 1, think tank is going to have ALOT more then 2925 HPs, so druid will use alot more mana, and group will have alot more downtime then using a cleric.<br />
<br />
But then again I have never felt 2nd or 3rd best tank in an exp group.</div></div><hr />

This was somewhat true.  Although I could get exp faster soloing than I could in a group during Luclin so it didn't matter too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>exeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the general consensus is that most folks would disagree with me.  My 65 cleric buddy just reviewed this thread - so I have clipped out a comment of his email to me about this topic:<br />
<br />
&quot; The point that one person [in this thread] seemed to get: up to 60/65 Clerics have a hard time. At 60/65 and IN GOD ONLY are they needed. But what they fail to realize is that this was the same situation with PoP when it first came out. In three months, it will be status quo again... ie once gear gets disseminated and new aa's get implemented to the tanks and alternative healers. &quot;<br />
<br />
His conclusion:<br />
 <br />
&quot; Clerics and Warriors are tried and true especially when dealing with the unknown. Once strategies are formed, they are tossed to the side for characters that have more strategic options to go with the new strategies etc. &quot;<br />
<br />
As a level 61 warrior this has been my observation as well.  I cannot comment on GoD - since I have not grouped there generally - but as my friend attempts to illustrate the benefit bestowed on clerics / tanks with GoD is illusionary and will pass soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tynne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">But no heal spells in god can counter the dps of certain mobs much less what druids and shaman already have from pop.  The only way clerics are able to heal that much dps is aa and foci.  Unless mudflation and hp of the tank is such that druids and shaman have only to slow the hp loss of the tank till the mob is dead they will not be main healing these encounters.<br />
<br />
There is no ch to fall back on in god because your tank is already dead by then and soe decided that was the way to take ch out of the game and nothing druids or shaman have can compare.  Druids/shaman would have needed a 2600+ 3 sec heal to think about healing in those encounters but that was how they were designed.<br />
<br />
It all goes back to why is 1 class needed to by far outnumber all others up to this point in raids?  Fix that and you can rebalance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">CH wheels were never intended, they are the consquence of the total lack of play testing by SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">reason i say druid doesnt heal like a cleric is based on two things. first is that theirs heals are less manna efficient. second is that their heals generate more agro per amount of healing done. notably they have no heal over time spells. its a common complaint among druids that like to be healers that they have to watch their agro generation so closely. consider in an exp group for example where the puller comes back with 3 or 4 mobs. a heal has to be cast within 10 seconds of the pull and probably less. a cleric will often dump in a heal over time so as not to get 2 mobs on himself before they get mezzed or rooted or slowed. but a druid is stuck with an ordinary heal and then he gets the adds. then he whines on the druid boards about why his heals have to draw so much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>exeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">rysingsun1,<br />
<br />
Okay Druids generate more aggro in principle since they cannot rely on heal over time spells if I understand you correctly.  And add to that clerics have good AC to boot to deal with close encounters.<br />
<br />
The example you give may not illustrate your view very well though.  First - that is just a lousy pull.  What kind of puller returns to a group with 3 or 4 mobs?  That's a train in my books, unless this is a trash mob clearing for a raid or you're just farming.<br />
<br />
But let's take that example.  You're druid could pull those mobs instead - snare them and kite them while waiting for the tank to get aggro.  In the hybrid dominated world - your tank (SK or Pally) won't take too long to get aggro off your kiting capable healer with their ranged abilities (snare, stun, dot, healing).<br />
<br />
The point my friend and I are making is the opposite to yours I think mate.  In an exp group - dump the warrior and cleric.  Get your hybrid tank (SK, Pally) and your hybrid healer (Shammy, Druid). <br />
<br />
Druids have it tough I know.  He might even get frustrated with that &quot;puller&quot; you describe and solo :D<br />
<br />
I realize for the flavour of the quarter expansion tanks and clerics are needed again (provided your high enough level with the aa's to be a participant).  But the fresh challenge of an expansion does not last too long and only re-stimulates the need for pure classes at the very high end of the game.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">my post was not to complain about druid heals. my post was to reassure clerics that they have not been made obsolete by the fact that other classes can heal &quot;pretty well&quot; too. yes they can heal but they are not as good when the going gets rough because of agro and they are not as good for the role anytime because of their lower manna efficiency.<br />
<br />
but just like ill take a necro to mez if i cant get an enchanter or a beastlord to slow if i cant get a shaman ill also take a druid to heal if i cant get a cleric. the fact other classes can fill in when necessary is good because it keeps us from having to put our exp group on the shelf every time a member leaves. and remember too the necro beastlord or druid has other strengths that make up for the aforementioned weakness. in some circumstances the other strengths are just what the doctor ordered.... like the dps of the necro the offtanking of the beastlord or the dps cc and evac of the druid (and charming?).<br />
<br />
pull of 3 or 4 .. yes i was talking about exp groups and yard trash. as for it being a bad train pull .... well ... it happens. one reason it happens is because the natives get restless when too much pacifying is done and the pullers get careless in an attempt to keep the action going. i think most of us have pulled at least a few of those unnecessary trains :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you have an enchanter in the group if you aren't:<br />
1. Having him charm mobs for DPS.<br />
2. Having them mez adds.<br />
Their fantastic nukes right?! I have had Enchanters bitch about multiples being pulled on LDoNs, they go right to ignore after we are finished with the LDoN! They are NOT there for DPS via nukes.<br />
<br />
The whole Paladin whine is about the &quot;holy trinity&quot;, they don't understand the concept, or don't want to understand the concept: they gained utility, so we are better when specialization is required and PROPERLY used, and they are better when their utility is PROPERLY used. The continual whine &quot;my spellbook is worthless&quot; doesn't sit well with any Warrior, when we can think of MANY instances to exploit said book. But I guess many of the Paladins are just the greedy little shits inhabiting EQ now, and they want Warrior+Spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm very happy you love your abilities, except how do you get Paladins through these things then?  Waving &quot;specialization&quot; around as a justification for leaving other classes skills crippled is somewhat dubious.  Either a class does a role or it should stop trying.   Either Paladins and SKs can tank in these start to finish or they need something else to do.  I would like the events tuned so they don't rely so heavily on obscene DPS.  There are other ways of making monsters hard to beat that don't involve avoiding thousands of DPS of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Aeka, the solution by SOE's trained monkeys has always been, mobs hit for obscene damage. Even kiting was responded to this way (not that it made one whit of difference). The combat engine is not sophisticated enough to do anything else with. If the OUTRAGEOUS equipment was never placed in the game to start with, this wouldn't be happening. Mudflation is totally out of control in EQ, and the game has suffered for it. Casters do not do enough damage compared to Time equiped melee, but mess with them to balance it, then at the lower end the casters are to powerful. There are 3500hp 65th Warriors and 10000+hp ones! Why is there such a disparity? The equipment should not be so outrageously different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman: Shaman has a number of jobs, Few being resist debuffing slowing, Buffs etc,  But with all due respect they were never ment to have 5k hp ch's or 2500 fast heals . instead they get a nice ultility (quint) , and Kamidari is right, i dont know a single fing shaman who bothers loading there CH, there fast heal + quint just makes it less mana useage and Faster.<br />

Priest classes other than clr were good in PoP , But GoD is a whole new Era, Cleric is a Req ;p</div></div><hr />

&quot;Waving &quot;specialization&quot; around as a justification for leaving other classes skills crippled is somewhat dubious. Either a class does a role or it should stop trying. Either Paladins and SKs can tank in these start to finish or they need something else to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very well put.  We can say the same I argue for clerics too vs. hybrids.<br />
<br />
Pallies might excel in protecting group members - e.g. by having a more effective /shield ability than warriors.  This is consistent with the roleplay angle of the class.<br />
<br />
SK's might excel in gathering aggro from multiple mobs quickly, so while they may not be great for tanking a big high level mob - they can quickly attract uncontrolled aggro in groups.  Enhance this abilty.<br />
<br />
I think Druids are in pretty good shape - they have more abilities than anyone else - and often are healers in groups.  They are the ultimate farmers and their ability to solo is perhaps only bested by the Necro.<br />
<br />
Shamans ... slow .. Nuff said :)  Great rounded class with many roles they can assume with some basic solo abilities.<br />
<br />
Doomflayer makes the point about the rampant gear effects on characters... gear is becoming too important.  I agree.  The difference between a good warrior and a bad warrior is really the gear.  Skills and race seem to mean nothing (e.g. in contrast to shadowbane).  I hate the fact there are no skill trees in EQ and every warrior really is the same with different gear on.<br />
<br />
My conclusion here:  yes redefine the roles for hybrid classes - give them other options in grouping they can excel at performing.  However, many hybrids among &quot;healers&quot; and &quot;tanks&quot; are in pretty good shape I think - but a few can be adjusted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Of course they lost of all this: shamans and druids have comparable healing once they reach the 50's; NPC soulbinders; and other classes that rez to a comparable % at the high end of the game (Pally's, Necros). Clerics have lost out to hybrid classes the same way that tanks have - probably worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exeter, essentially everything you have written is wrong.  <br />
<br />
Clerics, shaman and druids begin with essentially the same healing spells at the same levels.  This basically continues to level 34.  At level 39 clerics create a gap with Complete Heal, although it really isn't used much at those levels.  <br />
<br />
The power of rez begins to manifest more and more, and by the 50s, clerics start creating a gap.  Now, clerics have always dominated healing like no other class has dominated anything.  <br />
<br />
After Kunark, clerics dominated healing so badly there was essentially a rebellion, and chloroblast got introduced, and superior healing was moved to 51.  Then Kraggs and Renewal were introduced.  I have ZERO sympathy for cleric whining because they were so dominate it was stupid.  <br />
<br />
Now we're back to the same unhealthy reliance on clerics.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who talks about a cleric &quot;plight&quot; is babbling like an idiot.<br />
<br />
In addition to unchecked and excessive dominance as a healing class, clerics got pacification and a more powerful array of nukes along with melee and mana regen.  <br />
<br />
Cleric whining is flat out retarded.  <br />
<br />
What the game NEEDS is more dispersed healing power.  So you couldn't be more wrong.  Do us all a favor and don't post your game balance views.</div></div><hr />

I thought your comment:<br />
<br />
&quot;What the game NEEDS is more dispersed healing power&quot;<br />
<br />
If we endorsed this as a community - and that may be the case - why not say the same for tanking?  If we removed the power a pure healing class like a healer by allowing hybrid classes to heal well - why not allow Knights / Sks to tanking to remain as it is?<br />
<br />
I think you're point is a good one.  But it may underscore a double standard in our thinking.  If healing needs to be decentralized from a given class (Cleric) then the same should (remain) true of tanks (warriors).<br />
<br />
We can't argue against the threat of hybrid classes to dedicated tanks (warriors) while permitting that same threat to dedicated healers (cleric).<br />
<br />
I know most here don't agree with my view on this.  And I have learned a few things in the process.<br />

While the &quot;poor&quot; Dr00d can quad and the Shaman is soloing yellows late in levels (and don't bother to say they can't, I have one, and if you can't I just pown you in playing ability I guess). The Cleric is &quot;lfg&quot; because they can't do the solo gig. Same with Warrior, while my friend made 600k+ in pp, I made the same amount but was FORCED to box. Oh, yea, my Dr00d actually made the pp, while my Warrior finished off the runners when his DoTs, AEs, or worse charmed animal, had already hammered the mob.<br />
Whaaaaa, I used to get phat exp for 50+ days (while to make the same level many non-solo classes took 90+ days) and now I can't. Lets find a way to make groups FORCED to accept me in their group. Thats why I call em Dr00ds!<br />
Thats all it is a cheap attempt to keep exp pouring in at the same rate it did at earlier levels, and now the babies are upset they can't do it solo. <br />

<br />
There you have the answer, when it is really HARD, the specializtion classes stacked in a group are best. Hybrids have utility, but that fails when the encounter is sufficiently hard enough to require healing OR tanking. It is not fair to Warriors to have Knights have EVERY ability plus a spellbook. There are many cases when Utility and the Knight superior aggro generation is superior. Like everytime your tank is puller SK&gt;Paladin&gt;Warrior. When your healer is a Druid or God forbid Shaman, Paladin&gt;SK&gt;Warrior. When the monster has an outrageous DI Warrior&gt;Paladin&gt;SK. Soloing for fun or plat (which has a place in the game) SK&gt;Paladin&gt;Warrior. <br />
There are trade offs to every class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comparing the difference between tank classes - SK, Pally, Warrior - each class has definite strengths and weaknesses and each can tank successfully in hard encounters given the right gear and supporting cast.<br />
<br />
I don't think the same balance exists for healing classes.  If you are stretching the limits of what your group can do, you pretty much have to have a cleric or multiples of the other healing classes (i.e.: 2 grp slots taken up for healing) - which costs you on dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doomflayer, the point I was making earlier was that the difference in healing between a cleric (the healing specialist) and any other class that can perform healing duties is greater than the difference between warriors (the tanking specialist) and any other class that can tank.   <br />
<br />
That's why I think healing is currently unbalanced.  The result of this imbalance is clerics (a single class) are more required for higher end content than any other single class.  A raid can have a knight tank a challenging target and win (it's been done plenty of times), but how many raids have you heard of that were successful without a cleric?<br />
<br />
Note:  This does not mean I think the cleric class as a whole is unbalanced.  I don't know this class well enough to make a statement either way on it's overall balance - but I do know enough about the healing side to know it fits my definition of unbalanced.  This is also why I feel comments about other abilities of classes that can heal are not germaine to the discussion of whether or not the healing abilities of clerics is unbalanced.  (i.e.:  quad kiting and and canni do not matter when discussing the healing equation - although they are very relevant and must be considered if changes are made to make healing more balanced across classes.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I was a little harsh on poor Exeter, that's true.  <br />
<br />
Fundamentally trying to say a class should perform within XX% of another class is a bad idea anyway - although the developers appear to approach things that way.  I don't like game design by statistical increments.  There's no flavor, color or variation that way.<br />
<br />
You can't say shaman are 47% as good at healing as clerics because those numbers in application are meaningless.  How many shaman would take to run a CHeal chain against any meaningful boss?  It's not doable, the percentage within cleric ability is 0% at that point.  <br />
<br />
Obviously classes are balanced in other areas, such as slowing for shaman - which is strictly a mechanizism to make healing easier.  Well, slows don't land instantly, or always, or have full impact.  It's part of the color of EQ, and those variations, which some bemoan as a terrible idea because they create complications, are a good thing.  <br />
<br />
The bottom line is EQ is totally reliant on clerics.  This can't really change now, but the degree of this reliance can and should be adjusted.  <br />
<br />
If other classes could heal more, my view is that cleric gameplay will actually improve and they get to explore other, neglected aspects of their character.  I am willing to bet constant stress to HEAL HEAL HEAL is what burns clerics out the most.  The fundamentals won't change, but things can be improved.</div></div><hr />

Tynne, I completely agree with you that if only healing is changed it would be bad for clerics.  However, only changing healing is not what I advocated.  What I said was SoE needs to look at the classes as a whole when discussing possible changes related to healing.  (i.e.:  if other classes get better at healing either those other classes need to lose other abilities or clerics need to gain something.)  <br />
<br />
Also, I'm sorry (well, not really) if some clerics get upset because they want to be the completely undisputed gods of healing, because this type of game design is bad for the rest of us.  There are plenty of places I'd like to explore but I constantly get limited because I can't find a reliable (or any) cleric for the group.  This problem does not exist with any other class in the game.</div></div><hr />

I fully agree that it would be good for the game if all priests could heal all encounters and it would be good if all priests could rez 96% + also, rezzing has always been an albatross around clerics necks.<br />
<br />
But the end of Luclin taught clerics that promises don't always come true.  The only way to get all clerics behind the other priests healer upgrades is if druids and shaman first got the developers to upgrade clerics in ways other then healing and the pallys did not get it nerfed a week later.  <br />
<br />
These boons of clerics everywhere hammers are a joke.  A time cleric can expect to average 35 dps with them(same dps as the 63 summoned hammer 5-10 in melee 20-25 proc).  A pure caster can with the effect time lapse do the same dps melee but it would be a joke for any of them to melee.</div></div><hr />

A few stellar clerics stand out as those guys who help on CC with roots, get right up there with stuns, are smart when working with the pull team, pacify, time nukes, use Mark, do a myriad of OTHER things than just blast out the big Heal Bomb.  <br />
<br />
They would like a change.  They can have more variety, and they can stand out.  <br />
<br />
However, a lot of clerics suck frankly.  The domination of the class encourages misfits who know merely being a cleric punches their ticket into guilds, onto raids and getting loots.  It is amazing how much you can suck as a cleric and yet still advance in this game.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, clerics can do a heck of a lot more than just cast one spell.  <br />
<br />
That said, I totally would be in favor of non-healing enhancements for clerics.  Up the DPS on the hammer, and yes the paladins will whine because that's what they do.  Up standing mana regen through Yaulp or whatever.  Up the nukes.  Go for it.</div></div><hr />

I think raiding and single group content should have classes balanced seperately.  Like you said just cause you are a cleric mean you get into guilds evan if you suck cause while skill may make a difference in groups as long as that cleric changed to the new tank 2 heals up in the line you are fine just botting.  Make all priests viable raid healers and evan reduce the main heal cast time(not amount healed) and you reduce the number of 1 class you need.</div></div><hr />

2. Yes we have a hybrid active/passive mana regen that at 65 is about 4-5.5 mana per tick more then druids standing but shaman can also canni which is also active.  Sitting a druid will gain 4 mana a tick more then clerics and shaman with druid buff will gain the same mana as a cleric.<br />
<br />
3. Shaman have a 6:1 base hot clerics get 5:1. hp:mana<br />
<br />
4. We get a 10% rune that has to be recast.  It is much like a preheal.  It is also only slightly larger then Arcane Rune but it does the rune over time so you still need to heal(useing ch mostly) meaning that 10% is largely irrelivent.  If you are on a mob that requires 10% less dammage to save the tanks life then that mob will be doing more then 16000 dammage over the course of the fight meaning you have to recast the &quot;mitigation&quot; buff except your cleric is busy healing.  If you are on a mob that will not kill the tank if you don't Bulwark of Vie him then ch makes the rune useless.  This is mostly a soloing or raid tool situational at best.  10% sounds good on paper but unless it lasted the full 30 min duration or had a 10k hp limit it requires recasts or is not needed and is more inefficiant then our direct heals.<br />
<br />
If you just gave the other 2 priests ch right now the problem clerics see is that they will still be the best healer is places requiring a multi k heal in under 10 seconds but in all other areas the other 2 priests would be perfered because of more utility as well as more dps.  Take a pally tank and you have rez and buffs that are more hp then clerics as well as your quick group and patch heals.</div></div><hr />

Depends where you are in the game, Gaylon.  I don't mean to be insulting when I say that I don't think progressing through the GoD trials yet, are you?<br />
<br />
If you're chugging through PoV and BoT and maybe trying your first few LDoN Hard adventures, then I don't doubt that to you, cleric looks like a pretty powerful class within their specialized role.<br />
<br />
But in GoD, there comes a point where a cleric can't keep her group healed.  You reach a moment where you can't progress without two healers - and many people are doing GoD trials not just with two healers, but with two clerics because of the insane healing output requirements.<br />
<br />
Why should a single cleric be sufficient healer for an equivalently-geared group?  Because clerics give up almost every other possible advantage in order to be able to do that.  A cleric can only do one thing well:  Protect, nurture, heal, and when necessary rez the group on which she's totally dependent.  If you ever ask a cleric to interact with the actual game environment - tank something, kill something, move from place to place, whatever - you'll see how weak and helpless the class is outside that specialist role.<br />
<br />
The situation's analagous to warriors.  Warrior is the class which gives up massive amounts of utility and flexibility in order to be able to do one thing really well:  Tank the big hitters.<br />
<br />
Look for a moment at the disadvantages of being a cleric.  It's the only class which has the drawbacks of both casters and melee... unlike a caster, a cleric lacks the basic utility (invis, see invis, eb, levitate, etc.) to move from place to place without help - but she still gets the defensive skills and hp of a caster rather than a melee.  My 65 cleric's got 1300hp naked and a dodge cap of 75.<br />
<br />
A question you could ask, both of clerics and of warriors, is:  Why on earth would anyone want to play a class which is totally dependent on others in order to do anything meaningful, and is valueless compared to other classes anyway unless you're fighting the really big hitters?<br />
<br />
The only reason you'd play a class which is that limited, is to be clearly the best option (and in places, the only option) for the job.<br />
<br />
But a single cleric can't DO that job any more.<br />
<br />
Now, I know I'm talking to an audience of warriors.  Raiding warriors - which includes most of the warriors who're progressing through GoD - tend to be accustomed to having a vast harem of clerics trailing round after them when they're tanking.  Most of these warriors don't see anything unusual about having four, five, or six clerics who're doing nothing else apart from keeping them, personally, standing up.  So they don't see a two-healer group in quite the same light that clerics do.<br />
<br />
But the fact is that when you have six group slots - and one of those slots has to be a warrior, and another has to be slower/CC with a strong preference for chanter, and two of the others have to be healers - then it really sucks trying to get a large number of people through a large number of trials.  And the bottleneck for guilds is always either warriors or clerics - but the difference is that one warrior is enough.  One cleric is not.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid that the idea of single-group mobs that are REQUIRED for progression but also need more healing than one Time-geared cleric can put out is simply retarded.<br />
<br />
There are two possible answers.  The first is to relieve the pressure on the clerics by making druids and shamans a better alternative as healers - and that entails making some fairly large upgrades to clerics so they can do things which aren't healing, hp buffing, or rezzing - and the second is to up the cleric's healing output so that one cleric is enough to do the job.<br />
<br />
But in GoD - the CURRENT expansion - it's certainly true to say that all the healing classes are underpowered when compared to the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The problem for Warriors and Clerics is that since they are tightly focused on a specific task. Allowing other classes to approch their capability too closely it will inevitably devalue them in smaller 54 person GoD raids.<br />
<br />
Why add a 5th or 6th Cleric to a raid if adding another Shaman or Druid would allow that job to be covered while gaining nuke, DoT, slow, etc.?<br />
<br />
Why have a 4th or 5th Warrior in a raid if adding another Knight would allow that job to be covered while gaining spot heal (Paladin) or more situational DPS (Shadow Knight)?<br />
<br />
I think some adjustment to Knights to allow them to be effective add tanks/off tanks is is order. But at the same time, replacing Warriors should NOT be the goal of Knight improvement.<br />
<br />
There is a healing problem in GoD. So, in addition to improving Cleric, Druid, and Shaman healing, improve Paladin healing - this could improve Paladin effectiveness as add tanks/off tanks and high difficulty group tanks if done right without disturbing normal experiance group preferance.<br />
<br />
There is a raid melee DPS issue IMO too. So improve SK HT and lifetaps. Improving lifetaps could make SK's more effective add tanks/off tanks and high difficulty group tanks if done right without disturbing normal experiance group preferance.<br />
<br />
Clerics are in worse shape. They are not needed in normal experiance groups at all. Improve Druid, Shaman, and Paladin healing and it gets much worse. It would not be a bad thing IMO to give Clerics a seriously big finishing blow nuke and the ability to melee for much more DPS. They really can't tank effectively (unless SoE is foolish enough to give them pets) and Cleric melee DPS would give them more needed value in normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors and Clerics - two classes indispensable for killing high level mobs and under pressure from some members of classes that would dearly like them to disappear.<br />

<br />
This must be a joke?  Not sure and I'm in too much shock to think.<br />
<br />
I love my class and I wouldn't play anything else but that is the most... optimistic view of clerics I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
5th best dotter??? There are five spots in the entire GAME that I can dot solo.  The best experience I can get is an AA per 5 hours although I've only tried four of the spots - I hear the fifth is better if you can survive it.  If we are the fifth best dotter that must be because there are only five classes with dots???  Saying granted that is only vs undead is like saying... I can't even think of an analogy there... do people even realize how few undead there are in the game?<br />
<br />
5th best at nukes?  This is possibly true (although I doubt it unless you are counting undead nukes which are good however limited) except that I'm not sure you realize that unlike most classes, the cleric nukes have a very long recast time and are only MR based so that there are a lot of places they aren't worth memming because of resists.  <br />
<br />
Tied for second on pulling?  I'd put us fourth... bard, monk, enchanter, cleric.... at best I would say tied for third.<br />
<br />
Melee dps of a bard? No clue what bard dps is like but the best cleric hammer with best haste and maxed stats has been parsed at 40dps.  So most clerics are doing less then that.  <br />
<br />
Again I love my class.  This is not a complaint.  But I don't want that much inacurate information getting circulated.</div></div><hr />

1.  Regular Experience Grouping.<br />

<br />
When you make arguments about whether clerics have suffered in the same way the warrior has - I suggest you speak to whether you believe your argument holds to both scenarios #1 and #2.<br />
<br />
A lot of posters so far are talking about #1 or #2 or it is not clear that what they say is intended to hold true for both grouping scenarios.</div></div><hr />

My opinion - no.  Mobs hit so hard now clerics are almost required.  If anything, GoD has increased the desirability of clerics.<br />

<br />
I'm not in the high end of raiding, but I do raid (tier 3 pop and below), and clerics are still the ONLY class that is mandatory on a raid.  <br />
<br />
In summary, I do not think clerics have lost anything in terms of desirability although other classes have the same types of abilities because clerics handle healing so much better than any other class.  It's not even close to the same situation as warriors and knights, or dps class competition.</div></div><hr />
