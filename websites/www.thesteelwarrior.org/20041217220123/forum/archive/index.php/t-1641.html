but we gotta be able to avoid that dmg when sitting infront of that mob hitting for 600+ :/</div></div><hr />

Combat Stability 2(reduces damage done to me by 5%)<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Physical Enhancement(adds 2% to my CS2 so 7% in damage reduction)<br />
<br />
My cleric sitting gets hit for 992 by a mob in a hard LDON last night. I also am being hit for 992s(not always but sometimes) while tanking same mob should it not be less? I know sitting basicly gives the mob max damage. I would assume standing in combat would remove 7% of that damage because of my AAs? I only have Stalwart Endurance at 2 so maybe I was stun and turned abit to the side does that make a differeance?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it lowers the average hit.  Max hit is still the same.  You won't be able to see a difference by looking at the min and max hit, but if you parse dps taken vs a mob before and after, you SHOULD take 10% less dps from the same mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that CS works like that.  Unlike Defensive which cuts down on the max hit that a mob does to you, CS cuts down on the averages in between.  So you will still see Max, and Min, hits, but on average, the damage you will take will be less.  At least that was my understanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Combat stability works exactly like having higher AC.  The more combat Stability AAs you have, the lower your average hit will be, but any single hit can still be for mnimum or maximum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roshinbertson</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't think it works the way some people think<br />
<br />
<br />
my understanding is it DOES NOT cut your damage taken by 5%(just a number) the whole time<br />
<br />
its a check like avoidance....<br />
<br />
if it check good then you get the reduced damage<br />
<br />
<br />
thats how i understand it anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AC example is correct.  Combat Stability lowers your average damage taken just like adding more AC does, but also just like AC is doesnt change the monsters Max or Minimum hits against you.  You can think of Combat Stability as increasing the chance that monsters will hit you for lower numbers and decreasing the chance that they will hit you for higher numbers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CS and associates (PE, ...) is not pure mitigation, but increased chances to mitigate<br />
<br />
if u have CS2 (5% i think ?) and u where usually able to mitigate 40% of the incoming blows (number taken out of nowhere), then u now will be able to mitigate 40%*1.05 = 42% of the blows.<br />
<br />
as the chances to mitigate are depending on AC (more specificaly mitigation AC ) and on class, more AC increase CS efficiency (ex : instead of going from 40% to 50%, mitigation chance goes from 42% to 52.5%), and at same AC, CS efficiency is dependant on class. <br />
It prolly doesn't mean RealMitigationAC=MitigationAC*CS_mod, but this formula at least explain the way CS is working.<br />
<br />
as a bonus, CA is working exactly the same than CS , but for avoidance AC instead of mitigation AC.<br />
<br />
I know it is prolly innacurate, but I like to compare mitigation AC and avoidance AC for a given char to know if he will get greater benefits from CS AAs or from CA AAs ...<br />
<br />
some more Datas for you :<br />
AC formula (thanks to Sylphan): <br />
Avoidance = (T from table) + trunc(Defense * 16/9), but never less than 0 <br />
Caster Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/3) + trunc(Defense/2) + (Equipment + 1) <br />
Anyone else's Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/4) + trunc(Defense/3) + trunc(Equipment * 4/3) <br />
Displayed AC = trunc( (Avoidance + Mitigation) * 1000 / 847 ) <br />
<br />
(table can be found at http://www.magelo.com/forum_flat.html?mess_num=16087&amp;page_num=3)<br />
<br />
if u want numbers for your char, magelo do the maths for you : add &amp;debug=true at the end of your magelo profile : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=XXXXX&amp;debug=true</div></div><hr />
