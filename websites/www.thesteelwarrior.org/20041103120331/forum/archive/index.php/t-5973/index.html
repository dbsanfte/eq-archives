<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is more of a warning and tips for how to cr if the warning isn't heeded.  There is a new mob in Fear.  It is a large imp that has 9 imps surrounding it.  The main imp has a dr based stun memblur that is very hard to resist and can wipe out a guild that doesn't have high dr or bards.  Here is the kicker.  The imp is located on the west wall everyone used for breaking in.  <br />
<br />
Now for how to cr<br />
<br />
I was asked by a friend in a family type guild to help recover his corpse.  I ran in with a small raid of casual gamers and my cleric friend (we are both somewhat elemental geered)  While he and i managed to survive by sheer dumbluck 9this was the only time sheer dumbluck worked as we took a few deaths trying out strategies) and my wizard bot's fast evac trigger finger,  the rest of the raid wiped with no way of retrieving the corpses as any attempt to move from the hill triggered the imp and its 9 mobs.  After about 2 hours of trying different things i decided to use the NE corner of the hill near where the long thin tree is and kill wanderers there.  It is best to use a rogue with sos as he can melee stuff and if your recovery party dies you can go trigger the imp's ae and hid while you're stunned and memblurred.   <br />
<br />
In all it took about 1 hour to recover 40 or so corpses in this manner but three to come up with a decent strategy that worked.  It would have been better if i had a full group of equipped people but it was late at night (3ish mtn time) and the 6 deaths i took came from the fact my cleric had no gear we had 0 dps except for myself and scarlings suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a berserker epic mob.<br />
<br />
Went there with 2 groups knowing nothing other than that it hit for 200ish.  The fight lasted about 20mins and we had 2 deaths, me and a wizard.<br />
<br />
Most of us were cursing it after the first 5 mins, but it is a fun fight with quite a few very interesting twists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just send in a bard crew and let em solo the whole damn zone......LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess someone beat us to the punch and cleared the zone the night before.<br />
<br />
Still remember the Dracholiche corpse camping our whole raid force about 8 months ago... (and that doesnt even factor in the server going down and getting my corpse 2 days later)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a clarification... it doesn't spawn on the west wall... it spawns randomly when you kill scarelings.  So... if you kill scarelings ont he west wall, it can pop there.  If you kill them somewhere else, it can pop somewhere else :)</div></div><hr />

What about the new player who wants to gear up from Fear? Did loot get upgraded when the mob was added, no! This is another reason EQ will die, SOE is eliminating fun old zones for new people, and making content for those who have to much time on their hands (the ones playing EQ 8-12 hours a day).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">about the new ppl who &quot;omg we dont have a working guide to deal with every situation anymore!&quot; learn this shit themselves. As far as I understand its an epic mob and not that hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoFear used to be a decent zone because in the early days the gear that dropped there was the best you could get.  Nowadays you can get far superior gear in Velious with much less risk and much greater rewards.  The only purpose for PoFear now is CT and epic mobs.  So yeah, now PoFear pretty much sucks and isn't a very worthwhile zone.  Some revamping of a lot of old zones is definitely in order...  but it's much easier to release expansions and that's where the $$$ is.<br />
<br />
However, I think there is plenty of content for players 1-60.  Most people eventually hit 65 and are there longer than they are at 1-60.  So a large percentage of the content should be geared for the level 65 player.  I personally think there is a lack of content for the level 65 casual player, it's like SoE assumes that once you hit 65 you will be in a raiding guild and want to raid.  The only real exception to this is LDoN.  I want some normal content for casual players at 65 besides LDoN.  PoP is mostly raid oriented, and now so is GoD.  Of course there are those who have time to beat all the raid content and want more, but to those people I say, find something else to do with some of your free time besides play EQ.  Go see the sunshine.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when was Fear fun?.....Ive always hated this zone after going in there and having a 5 hour corpse run with multiple deaths and a few corpses that could not be rezzed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fear was *never* a fun zone....   BUT back in the day, it was worth it because the gear that dropped there was actually really really good, the best you could get for a long long time.  In other words, the sucky break ins and crs were worth it because the gear was great.  Now, for the most part, the SAME gear drops, and that gear is now pretty much crap.  Re-itemizing Fear and making the drops worth the risk would be great.  But...  as I said before, it's easier to let the old zones wither and die and get $$$ from new expansions.<br />
<br />
Even when I do go outside, I don't get to see much sunshine.  Seattle.  :(<br />
<br />
At least I get to see lots of trees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Plane of fear was fun only when my shammy bud of mine and i were racing to see who could kill them eyeball things faster. ( we were late to raid and him and i were crashing through the zone soloing stuff for laughs )<br />
<br />
i beat him due to the fact that every dot he put on it was dispelled and i just plowed through them.<br />
<br />
except for that; the only zone(s) that cost me a night's sleep to CR was naggy/vox back in the old days. <br />
<br />
Plane of Fear=sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">While frustrating, the break in of fear/hate is what made those zones exciting. I wish more were like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This just proves that EQ players are sadists.  No wonder they put in torturous things such as VT keying and PoP flagging.  I'm truly surprised they put in graveyards because some of those old days CR's were truly torturous.<br />
<br />
Naggy and Fear were the two worst CR's I've experienced.  There were a few attempted long ass CR's in Chardok that usually ended up in summonings that kind of sucked also.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No wonder they put in torturous things such as VT keying and PoP flagging. <br />

I said exciting, not boring :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shabba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There is an easy way to overcome that mob using potions...the one with the &quot;Reckles Strength&quot;...crimson something?  It is an AE mez btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Old time Fear breaks were a blast... after the break was done, it was pretty much ho-hum. And when CT used to DT randomly...sitting there clearing trash and someone gets the big call... was a trifle unfair but it added excitement. It added some randomness and unpredictability.<br />
<br />
It is kind of sad that there are no real reasons to go there anymore. aside from the odd twink epic kill. They should look at doing to Fear what was done to Hate: scale up CT, add some new quests and new mobs. Make it at least a challenging exp zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heyas-<br />
<br />
Those weren't random DTs, they were aggro transfer from pulls that &quot;got away&quot; and shared their hate w/ their friends.  And so on until one of the roamers got into social range w/ Cazic.  It'd chain too, if someone buffed/healed someone who'd buffed/healed the puller that aggroed the escapee... once enough heals/hate built up for CT to &quot;aggro&quot;, BANG dead.  Probably why bards ate it so often, their old beneficial songs (pre level 50) generated way more aggro over time than anyone else's beneficial spells did, cept for the short period when they diddled with heal hate and CH turned into a cleric death sentence...<br />
<br />
I kinda liked PoF, explored and mapped most of it before it was level limited with a level 3 ogre warrior, who's actually still camped out in there...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yep, we thought they were random because we didn't understand the mechanics of aggro transfer at the time.<br />
<br />
However, I believe the rules about death touches were changed at some point.  As far as I know, mobs no longer DT on secondary aggro.  You can pull a deathtoucher by dragging a trash mob past him.  This would not be possible if simple aggro transfer could cause deathtouches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Uh in PoFear if you pull a trash mob past one of the demi's you WILL get DT from chain agro :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yiktin Voxbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hate fear.<br />
<br />
Though worst CR was in PoG abt 2-3 months after it went live. we somehow aggroed Tunare which in turn aggroed some HUGE red will'o'wisp model... enraged forrest . . something.<br />
<br />
3 days that CR took, bonded our guild like no other event. Even wiped one of the leading guilds on CT that tried to help us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I dunno, I think the Golems still snipe somewhat.  Fright sniped a Warrior who hadn't even come in contact with a mob yet on one of our recent Fear raids.  We had just cleared WW all the way past the ZI and had more guildies coming in.  The Warrior zoned in, ran to WW, stood there for about 3 or 4 minutes while we were buffing up (after killing TTs), then just dropped.  We couldn't figure out how he could possibly be on any aggro lists, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The golems do DT on secondary aggro. A month ago we found CT up in a partially cleared Fear with no Golems around. <br />
<br />
Puller pulled, and the moment I fired my arrow to tag CT off her, Fright spawned and DT'd me. There is no way I could've been on any aggro list apart from CTs at that point, since the plane was clear when we pulled. Took me a while to realize what the hell happened, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As far as I understand its an epic mob and not that hard<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't think this epic mob was a problem, although he was annoying as shit.  My chanter doesn't have fantastic gear, but she's pretty decently EP geared and I didn't resist a single AE mez.  The mez lasts just long enough to get hit by the NEXT AE mez.  I basically stood there the entire fight (interestingly, I could still mem spells while mezzed). <br />
<br />
Like I said, it isn't the epic mob that is the problem.  Its all the rest of the fear trash that is normally laughable ganging up on people while others are mezzed.<br />
<br />
Dotting yourself is a good idea. <br />
<br />
We ended up just having our warrior kite literally the whole fear zone while we killed this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hehe, I got asked to help with a CR in fear a couple weeks ago and when I got there I saw 30 naked people I thought &quot;how in the hell can you wipe 30 people in fear these days?&quot;  but it turned out it was this suprise AE mez mob 8).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm truly surprised they put in graveyards because some of those old days CR's were truly torturous.<br />
<br />
You obviously haven't been reading this message board much.  There are loads of people here that are REALLY happy about the lack of GYs in GoD and how nightmare CRs are a possibility if you don't have a pocket necro/sk.  Maybe they all have pocket necro/sks.  :p  Ok, actually I think it's because it's yet another thing to further the distance between ubers and non-ubers.  Sure that distance is already huge, but people want an even bigger spread so they can feel bigger.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
And yes, some EQ players are masochists.  <br />
<br />
Oh, for the good ol' days of spending all night trying to CR your corpse from PoF!  Oh please, Sony!  Bring them baaaaaack!  /sarc off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i agree, graveyards cheapen the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">...there has got to be a cheap woman/cheap game joke in here somewhere...:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shizentai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Entering a raid knowing if it fails you will lose only 20 minutes of your time isn't very stressful.  &quot;I'll just read a book while I wait for the corpse to pop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Get it?  Pop?  Ha ha.<br />
<br />
:\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">For the AE Mez mob in Fear, you can't quaff the Reckless Strength potions when hit by its mez. I used a Thunder Runed Great Sword (the AoE-DoT sword that drops in Kael), and kept from being mezzed by keeping the mobs attention. Only catch is not getting any heals because all the healers were mezzed. It's a DoT fight for sure. <br />
<br />
Quite a lot of fun actually. I highly recommend it. Even if you aren't looking for the zerk epic drop, it's certainly different. <br />
<br />
The fight requires some thinking and preparation. And if you just run in and try to do it, you'll get owned.</div></div><hr />
