<br />
Warriors have some legitimate concerns about how SoE might choose to resolve Knight issues in the Gates of Discord expansion.<br />
<br />
Many Warriors are concerned that their major class defining ability, Defensive (and related disciplines like Evasive, Stonewall, etc.), may be &quot;shared&quot; with other classes, either as a discipline or a spell equivilant. Some of us believe that while a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability like Weapon Shield might be appropriate, Defensive in sufficient amount and duration to reliably tank the most brutal battles, particularly boss mobs, is not.<br />
<br />
Some of us are concerned that in repairing any difficulties SoE will forget that they are dealing with three different classes:<br />
<br />
Warriors who are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles and focusing their opponents on them rather than more fragile party members.<br />
<br />
Paladins, Holy Warriors who are primarily tanks, but who's other defining characteristic is casting priestly spells to assist in their and their group's survival.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights, Necromantic Knights who are primarily tanks, but who's other defining characteristic is weakening their opponent and assaulting it's abiltiy to survive with sword and spell.<br />
<br />
Warriors are also somewhat concerned that their survivability advantages will end up applying only to raids and we will find ourselves to be Knights without Spellbooks in most content.<br />
<br />
While we believe the game must be fair and fun to all classes that play it, we are understandably concerned that the unique identity of classes and content where their unique capabilities can be applied is preserved.<br />
<br />
Warriors too would like to be aware of changes that SoE is contemplating.<br />

<br />
 I have clarified with the team that they are looking at all of the later Gates encounters not just the single group trials and re-evaluating the difficulty.  So, rather than scale the encounters to a specific group type, they are looking to adjust the encounters overall.<br />
<br />
We should probably simmer down a bit now and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

Having read a well thought out non-Warrior viewpoint, I felt a reasoned flame-free summation of what Warriors generally think about these issues (from what I've read) was in order. Not intended as &quot;grandstanding&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, having selected an approach - SoE will get on with it and players will assume its going to be a reasonable solution.<br />

Also, at fan faire rytan said that they will NOT give knights any form of defensive or evasive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we simmer down, the foaming Knights will be the only ones talking.  That would be as bad as if we agreed with the knights position.  I don't agree we should go back to the dark ages where no one every wanted a Warrior except on a MT task for a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't understand... they have laid out a framework of how they're going to be addressing this.    They said they're going to review and potentially adjust upper GoD content.   Knights are going to be able to tank this stuff.    They're having a devchat on Thursdayish, and this will likely be one of the topics.   <br />
<br />
Once a framework has been laid out and announced, all the yapping in the world isn't going to change things.    If it's a content based fix, then we just need to wait and see how it pans out.</div></div><hr />

I cannot imagine any guild that can beat any of the 3 Ikkinz raids not able to field a 6 man elite team that can get through the trials.  The trials are not THAT hard as long as you have a Warrior.<br />
<br />
The general problem of GoD so far is that some stuff just hits way too hard.  When you're looking at a mob that can one round a Warrior with ease, it is simply not possible for any other class to have a prayer of tanking the said mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That will probaby be the result, instead of the trials being the gatekeeper to the raids, the raids will be the gatekeeper to the trials or at least the gatekeeper to further raids.  And there isn't anything really wrong with that as a concept.  Make the trials hard but doable by well geared and reasonably well played players and make the raids eat the guilds who aren't ready for them.<br />

<br />
Exactly.  It's like they set up raid calibre mobs as some of the &quot;trash&quot;.  I know that flurry drakes, as an example, used to be like that.  But that was an unusual situation where you really had to rely on the Warriors to clear to the boss mobs.  That approach might make some sense in some zones on the way to some boss mobs, but not for trials and not for other content intended to be for a single group.</div></div><hr />

Simma down nah!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also How is Donna Summers name listed in the phonebook?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad to see they are fixing the actual area or looking at it atleast. Wonder what the next request will be if defensive isn't given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;You don't understand... they have laid out a framework of how they're going to be addressing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
They had a framework for melee rebalancing, and still needed quite a bit of feedback. There's nothing wrong with continuing to feedback, discuss, and basically detail how warriors feel about the topic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also How is Donna Summers name listed in the phonebook?&quot;<br />
<br />
hahahahahahah. I love those skits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm is that how the whole problem started in the first place?  We had more NDA BS leading up to this release than any other than EQ...you'd think with a little more feedback they might have gotten better results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally would like to see an AA ability added, one for warriors that adds 5-15% efectiness to def, eva, and sw. Also give paladins and shadowknights an aa ability that grants a lesser defensive disc, maybe 25-35%, but would need to be a very heavy mana drain and endurance drain. Maybe even provide only 2 minute duration.<br />
<br />
Anyway the point is, i wouldn't mind knights getting a lesser form of defensive as an aa ability (channeling the avatar of their gods or sumthin), aslong as warriors get an aa ability that improves the already existing discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Improving on defensive will never happen, defensive is already powerful enough as it is, probably too powerful, making it stronger will open the floodgates at every lvl of the mid to high end game, every encounter will be made to easy. Imagin how crowded the already overcrowded elementals will be with guilds riding on teh back of a 60% defensive. It would be chaos. There are already enough complaints from knights about defensive, no need to add more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to say I thought they might could give Paly's a .....<br />
<br />
Then I came to my senses and thought wtf am I thinking. They can already tank everything in the game NP except for these 3 mobs. Tweak the mobs or move them somewhere other than trials and be done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give warriors better defensive, and then every mob would just hit 15% harder to compensate.  You don't get a free lunch in this game.<br />
<br />
I mean do people really think if next patch says 'warriors now have 90% innate mitigation to everything' they really don't expect mobs to suddenly hit 10 times harder to make up for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey maybe nothing will get done, just like melee balancing part 2!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pffft. We're talking Paladins here.<br />
<br />
When Warriors are marginalized this time, it will make years of Knightimization and RNG aggro contol look subtle rather than the outright efforts to create god-mode for Paladins that they were.<br />
<br />
The Arch Overseers proved that ultimately anyone could perform the Warrior role in the then hardest content in the game - PoTime.<br />
<br />
For a few months in GoD, just &quot;anyone&quot; couldn't perform the Warrior role - the unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles. I hope we all enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Naturally, instead of keeping these brutal mobs in appropriate locations, they were put in manditory flag trials. Ya got to show how unfair Warrior unmatched survivability is before you can take it away, share it, or modify the environment so that it no longer has an effect.<br />
<br />
S'ok. Once we've had unmatched survivability removed and there are 3 &quot;equal&quot; tanks, maybe they'll brush off Dancing Star Power Ups so the game is &quot;fair and fun&quot; for everybody.<br />
