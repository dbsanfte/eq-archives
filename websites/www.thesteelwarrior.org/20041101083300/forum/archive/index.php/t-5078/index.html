<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What weapons of these should I use when tanking:<br />
<br />
Crook of the cursed (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23207) <br />
<br />
Horn of Hsagra (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6093) <br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009) <br />
<br />
Copper hammer of Striking (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010) <br />
<br />
Should I go with ChoS and SotBS for agro procs or should I go for CHoS and Horn of Hsagra for the ac from the horn or some other combination?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aggro is the most important thing you need when tanking. Use the Sword of the Bloodsworn and CHOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azunias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm using a CoIO (primary) and a CLS. Reason being is that I haven't aquired the SotB and CHOS yet. I snag some pretty good aggro with them though.  :) <br />
<br />
I have a GSoT as well but I can't use it yet.<br />

(manditory level 55)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd gp chos/sotbs for sure when you are tanking, aggro is all-important. Also, contrary to what others say, mainhand the CHoS. It does more dps than SotBS, and proc generates more aggro as well, because of the high DD, so you want more CHoS procs than SotBS procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Umpha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What about if you put a lifetap/anger aug on the Horn of Hsagra and putting it in your offhand with the SotBS in your primary hand?  That should generate good agro and you still get the AC and other bonus from the HoH right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ggak - Copper Hammer is better than the Horn.  It produces more aggro, more DPS and looks better. Placing anger on a non-aggro weapon when you have an aggro weapon already is silly. Put the anger on the Hammer.<br />
<br />
CHoS &gt; HoH<br />
CHoS + anger &gt; HoH + anger <br />
<br />
Neksnappa - I put SoBS in pri when I am fighting 56-65 mobs that include many casters, like some LDoN.  Occasionally I will interupt a spell with the proc. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You have 18 slots + charm to build up AC, HP and stats.  You have 2 slots to deal damage and build agro.<br />
<br />
If you are worried about AC buy an armour upgrade, but until you have a Bloodfrenzy or DBotW+ anger3 to main hand its not worth trading in agro for stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ggak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Main hand is CHoS which sits there very nicely. Its offhand I am thinking off and there are 2 choices: the horn or SotBS. I have spoken to many and ther exists 2 ways of thinking.<br />
<br />
The horn will give me a boost of about 45 raw ac and some hp over the SotBS which is really really nice.<br />
<br />
SotBS will on the other hand inicrease aggro, but as many in the game has pointed out the offhand proc rate is not that high. I have used the horn now for a few days and have no real problem holding agro with it. The crucial first seconds could be small problem if the slower slows to quickly but that will be the same if I off hand SotBS and it doesnt proc in the first 5-10 seconds which it usually doesnt.<br />
<br />
I am at the point many warriros are: I can not see any upgrade available for me. Am in a small guild so cant go after big mobs and cant play LDoN to much as I cant find groups (libe in Europe, playing on american server).<br />
<br />
//Ggak<br />
If you have any suggestions on armour upgrades I cna get for less then 50k, please let me know of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not put an anger aug on the CHoS and have that much better aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I main hand the CHoS and off hand the SOtBS with a 50 DD fire based augment on the off hand for now simply because i can not imagine putting anything other than more anger or ykesha 3 on the CHoS. I have seen my off hand proc 4 fire procs and 3 regular procs in a single fight on level 53 mobs in PoN with CHoS procing conciderably more. I usually have max stats so that helps too but I would definatly not give up my agro set up after listening to the warrior community for long enough to know they know what they say.</div></div><hr />
