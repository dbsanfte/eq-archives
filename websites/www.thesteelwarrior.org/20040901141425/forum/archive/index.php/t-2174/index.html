i hope the USA gov doesnt follow suit, i dont think anyone from SoE has connections with bush</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I highly doubt that it'll pass, and if they try it in America, that'll probably be the last chance I ever listen to George Dubya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is a parent's responsibility to ensure that their children get enough sleep and time to study.  It is not a job for the government..<br />

My oldest daughter (11) plays EQ.  I don't need big brother to turn EQ off at 10 o' clock to make sure she gets in bed.  That's my job.<br />

A lot of Americans complain about our government for this, that, and the other thing.  But when you hear about things like this (and there are many censorship/control/monitoring issues with governments around the globe that are  much, much worse than the one in the linked story) it sure does make you appreciate all the personal freedoms you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think you have anything to worry about, that kinda shit would never happen here because people won't let it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And if it did pass, it wouldn't be long before someone would take it to court or something.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That would never happen here.  Parents responsibility is not the governments responsibility, and I think most people here realize that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe you cant spank your kids anymore, i think there is a reason to worry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spanking kids is about parents not being allowed to use what is considered a somewhat violent act on children.  Whereas this law is the government imposing rules on children that the parents should be enforcing.  And while I have no doubt that there are people here who would want a law like this in the US, I believe the majority would disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Jesus. This is so ridiculous.  If the government really wants to do something about the problem of childern becoming &quot;addicted&quot;, (and I use that term loosely), to online games, then they should charge parents of kids who dont sleep/flunk out/etc due to excessive gaming with negligence.  It is the responsibility of the parents to control what their kids are doing, not the government.  Blocking the games after a certain time is just asinine.  What about people who dont keep the same schedules as most of society?  Or adults who are capable of making thier own decisions?  I find this whole idea so overwhelmingly stupid that I'm having a difficult time formulating a coherent argument against it, stupidity just makes me that upset. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For those of you who believe the law would never pass because it is the parent's responsibility and not someone else's....you are ignoring the long history this nation now has with usurping parental rights and holding other's responsible for the failings of the parent.  <br />
<br />
Mostly I think that happens because as a culture we have &quot;learned helplessness.&quot;  I inhale smoke every hour for 50 years and then I sue a company when I come down with lung cancer.  I drive a motorcycle without a helmet, crash and become a vegetable and my family sues a company.  Four kids in Columbine build weapons for weeks in a parent's garage, go on a killing spree, and America goes on a War against Weapons and files lawsuits against gun manufacturers.  <br />
<br />
Is it any surprise that after all this non-responsibility mumbo-jumbo that the message we are sending to our government is that we can't be trusted to take care of things ourselves so we must be regulated?  I hope to hell this doesn't become a reality here, and I doubt it will, but I wouldn't be terribly surprised either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think its a stupid law, but as vigdis said our nation is known for its &quot;big brother&quot;ing the world and its citzins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thats how it is to live in a non democratic country?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i play late and i still get good grades. i also play on 4 baseball teams basketball and football so don't say well your not busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And people can sue McDonalds because they ate all those burgers and fries and it made them fat too.  The concept of personal accountability for one's actions is dead.<br />
Personally I like the idea that I'm responsible for my own actions, but sometimes I think I'm in the minority.</div></div><hr />
