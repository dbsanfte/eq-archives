<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been kicking a few ideas in my head for making guild/raid management easier for all people involved.<br />
<br />
 - In-game message board for guilds and communities.<br />
<br />
I've already stated my support for an in-game offline messaging system, perhaps that could be extended to include a severwide or guild message board in-game. I know many people I play with in my guild don't ever visit message boards, we have a guild website, but people rarely ever use it. Many guildees have stated they don't like having to go out of the game to conduct guild business. Not being one to force things upon others especially in a casual guild, you can see how this makes planning and coordination difficult.<br />
<br />
 - Loot master for raids<br />
<br />
An in-game system to designate certain individuals the ability to loot NO-DROP and multiple LORE items for later distribution. Combine this with...<br />
<br />
 - Guild bank or public storage<br />
<br />
This could be used to designate hold items to be later distributed to individuals at the guild or item owners discretion. Think of a public bank that you could use to give others items, usual drop rules apply, while they are offline to be picked up at a later date. It also can function as a guild bank to allow people to pickup merit/DKP awards at a later date.<br />
<br />
 - Guild and raid loot/attendance tracking system.<br />
<br />
Allows guilds to manage their awards system in-game, tracking both attendance and DKP awards. In conjunction with the Master looters, this allows better loot distribution without the time constrants of a corpse rotting during a raid or other event. You could make this public or viewable by officers/guildleaders at the GLs discretion.<br />
<br />
 - Auction system for handling loot distribution.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse integrated with the Loot master, guild bank, DKP/merit tracking systems.<br />
<br />
 - In-game &quot;email&quot; system<br />
<br />
I've already brought this up in another thread, but I'll include this again for completeness. The benefits to in-game communiation are obvious. Many other games have this feature. Including this will insure EQ isn't left behind in the &quot;feature wars&quot; that EQ has been facing. This will go a long way to keeping the game up-to-date with the newest MMOs on the market. The DX9 improvements are a testament to the devs dedication in making the game last.<br />
<br />
Lastly, to make the messaging systems complete, you would have to include a cut/copy/paste function. It'd be a same to not inclue such a feature with the previously mentioned messaging systems.<br />
<br />
So, I'm just wondering what you guys think. I'm not concerned if it is or isnt feasable, thats a given. I just want to know whether you guys would like to see these types of additionds to the game. I think a first-rate set of community tools would go a long way to helping EQ maintain it's edge in the MMO market. The idea is to give players more options for interaction and cooperation with their in-game communities and alleviate some of the game's design limitations inherent in many systems in EQ.</div></div><hr />

I dont think ppl who do not use guild boards will use in-game boards, but it wouldnt hurt anyone if you could check boards prior to log in or something.<br />
<br />
- Loot master for raids<br />
I dont want too ever see this in EQ since it will be abused<br />
<br />
- Guild bank or public storage<br />
Its plenty easy enough to have a mule. Plus the horror of assigning priveliges and tracking of who took out what and when and why.<br />
<br />
- Guild and raid loot/attendance tracking system.<br />
that would be nice<br />
<br />
- Auction system for handling loot distribution.<br />
for each his own. No point for SoE forcing on players specific loot distribution system. It would hurt more then help a lot of guilds.<br />
<br />
- In-game &quot;email&quot; system<br />
an offline message system would be nice.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps a not a mesage board, but event management would be a better statement. Say you need to fill a full group for a quest encounter, but it's hard getting the right people online at the same time to make it possible. Filling events could get you event points that could be viewed later by the guild leader or officer for later reward or whatever they want to do. The applies to raids and any other type of event where you could explain the requiremnts, propose an ideal timeframe and target/quest information.<br />
<br />
Master looter would be best linked to a viewable loot systems by the GL or guild as a whole. If anything it would be less open to abuse due to the open nature of the system.<br />
<br />
An actual guild bank system would always be preferable to another player having to bot an account to handle guild business. A simple system to assign items to be pickup by the awardee is very easy to use. Simply be awarded or ask for permision to withdraw an item.<br />
<br />
There's no need to force any system on anyone. Simply configure a clear awards system designed to fit the needs of your guild. I simple stated merit or DKP for example. It's easy enough to setup a rules system to handle the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So no comments huh? I figured you guys would be up for improving the tools in-game, instead of relying on exploitable/unreliable out-of-game solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a guild manager /rand function.  when you /raidrand 1000 the guildmanager proclaims the winner.</div></div><hr />
