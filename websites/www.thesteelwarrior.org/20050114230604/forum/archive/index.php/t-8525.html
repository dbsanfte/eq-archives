<br />
Can anybody give me a run down on what type of groups I'm gonna need for the three different essences camps. Been finding it difficult to get people interested in heading to any of these zones. Any tips to getting these essences greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
edit1: I did look in &quot;The Keep&quot; section of the forum, but didn't really see the info i was looking for there. Please move if you think its more appropriate in a different section of the forum.</div></div><hr />

He's easy, hits maybe like a hard ldon mob with a 1500pt ae dd. He's slowable, too. Wanders around in the lower part of OS, and is not KoS. A decent group of 65's should be able to do him easily. <br />
<br />
Rumour has it chardok is much harder due to the ae 5second stun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Echo of Chardok can pop in place of any trash mob, anywhere from the Bridge keeper spot to the King and Queen rooms (can pop inside).<br />
<br />
Echo of Sebilis can pop in place of ay trash mob, anywhere in lower seb.<br />
<br />
Echos pop in place of trash mobs, just kill everything you see and watch repops. They are not kos, dont assist other mobs, are yellow for 65's, and easy with basic 65 group. Echo of Sebilis AE DD 1k5, rarely. Echo of Chardok AE DD 2K + stun, rarely</div></div><hr />

Chardok and Seb you will need a group with a healer, tank, and a dps person or two.  Not going to be able to kill them with 3 warriors and a paladin healing or anything, but any 65 group with decent balance should be able to do them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thats good info all. Appreciate it. With any luck i'll get these knocked out in the next week or two. Really anxious to get moving on some of those quests.</div></div><hr />

If your friends don't want to hurt their Chardok faction, just point this out to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, that was a nice touch for the chardok faction people.  Although I can't imagine why anyone would care about chardok faction after they finish their SWC, many people seem to.</div></div><hr />

Since he doesnt assist, run down, tag his ass, and run to zone in. Fuck clearing. Killed this one with me (warrior+bard), cleric and a rogue.<br />
<br />
Echo of Sebilis took a bit of clearing (pull trains, cleric tanks with massive DS and keeps himself alive np) and popped down in the tunnels before Trak. Wussy though. Killed with me (bard+warrior) druid and cleric.<br />
<br />
Echo of Charisis drops by killing the hexbones. I did this with my bard and warrior. Just lev over to drusellas wing (east i think) and start clearing stuff. Kill her for the hell of it while your there to!<br />
<br />
They first two Echo nameds were both already up a few times I checked the zone. I got lucky I guess.</div></div><hr />
