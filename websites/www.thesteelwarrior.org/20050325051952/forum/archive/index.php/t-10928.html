<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How long is the lockout on Time after one guild has been in there before another  one can go in?   Assuming that the first guild doesn't make it to quarm, but gets to phase 4 or 5 and leaves, another guild can go in the next night or even a few hours later?  <br />
<br />
If anyone has a link that explains it in a relatively official way, that would be great, but just a number would help :D.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Look at it this way... <br />
<br />
Tier 1 - 1 hour<br />
Tier 2 - 1:15<br />
Tier 3 - 1:30? I forget<br />
Tier 4 - 4 hours<br />
Tier 5 - 4 hours<br />
<br />
My server (over a year ago when more than one guild broke in) worked out a really efficient rotation.  You should be able to do the same if people on test are congenial.</div></div><hr />

I don't know the exact timing on this, but since the patch that enabled this feature, we have never had to wait more than an hour for TimeB to reset.<br />

We used to do time during the night after a daytime raiding guild would finish.  Could always get in one hour after they were done.  If it is within 8 hours there will be no phase 1 loot, but all other phases will still drop loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8 hours for loot to reset in p1 (can still do it for no loot after an hour though). Other than that like other said it's about 30 minutes to an hour for the rest to reset for another guild.</div></div><hr />

Click slow going in these days ...cough. Spam clicking will cause some people to not get into the trial for awhile if you're going with 18. We always keep mounts and pets down till all are in too, just outa habit now probably.</div></div><hr />

Yeah we send tanks and healers in first and have everyone else click in after they get in safely, although last week even that didnt work and we had 1 cleric and 2 tanks as the only people in earth until they died then everyone else got in.</div></div><hr />
