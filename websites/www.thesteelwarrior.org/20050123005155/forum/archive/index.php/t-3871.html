<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild atm have reached a bit of a glass ceiling as there arent a lot of people playing on asian time on our server, so we have been offered a move to a Time enabled guild on another server.<br />
<br />
It will mean giving up a lot of stuff - and im also just a couple of steps away from my epic.<br />
<br />
I was wondering, would you guys make such a move?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on your current gear situation I would definately move if your being offered a guaranteed spot in a time enabled guild and will be flagged for it soon, the stuff your losing now will be easily replaced with far superior gear in a much shorter time.<br />
<br />
However there is also the fact that you will be missing out on a ton of content I assume in doing this, which in my opinion is important to experience as it helps you to develope as a warrior.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind missing out on that, by all means make the move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i dnot think we will miss that much, as the guild will still be doing ssra from time to tmie, so hopefully it means i will get to see VT.<br />
<br />
It will also mean i get to tsee the end game, which i never will if i stayed where i am, so thats the big pull i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i think the end game is overrated (not that i got beyond Rallos) but it's basically just the same game as prior with bigger toys, it's not gaming heaven. The initial wow factor of that new gear will wear off pretty quick. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mass guild recruiting that goes on after a guild has been in time, or ele's a while says alot about the allure and state of the &quot;end game&quot;.<br />
<br />
IE. It wears off quickly and the shit is even more boring then farms you did a year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm enjoying slogging through the PoP content, working our way through to Elementals, and possibly time in the future.  I wouldn't trade the fun I'm having with my guild for farming elementals and time.<br />
<br />
That's just my take, but if it's going to make you happy to hit up the elementals, more power to ya =)  You just got to do whats most fun for you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A time enabled guild that will go and do Ssra from time to time? that sounds a tad fishy to me. unless there are 4 other guilds in time i dont see why any time guild would go back to ssra. <br />
<br />
Time farming ssra is like an elemental flagged guild going to hate/fear to farm armor.<br />
<br />
oh I think you get to keep your epic if you transfer, or it might just be magicians that get to keep their epic since its a spell. not sure though. been a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been given a similar offer but the way I see it, I'm paying 50 dollars to have my character stripped and placed on a server where I don't know anyone.  All based on a promise that may or may not be kept...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">psst..<br />
<br />
Ssra still has Bloodfrenzy, which with that 15 percent riposte is still very nice...especially if all yer non-warriors are hogging all the EoEs =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Specifically targetting a Bloodfrenzy would be a pain in the arse timesink of a drop for a Time guild i'd think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know lots of people that have rangers parked in Ssra for tracking...doesn't seem like much of a pain to log on a ranger, check for both Rhzoth mobs to be up, log back on to your main and say &quot;Hey guys, Cursed is up let's go take 15 people and off him.&quot;<br />
<br />
He also has some pretty nice gear for off slots that some casters havent gotten gear for yet.<br />
<br />
All you need for Cursed is 3 clerics, 3 tank types(not necessarily warriors) and dps...he's not slowable but his dps is ass anyway if yer not in the AE. That and the glyphed and the exiled are just speed bumps(and also though the reason for 3 tanks, H8 death touching whores)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh I was thinking about a server transfer to find an Aussie guild ... but nah, not worth it.  *shrugs*  So I'll never see time, oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have considered them qris but EMJP dont take non japanese speakers and i dont meet DG's current requirements.<br />
<br />
I have decided to make the move. I know its not the pot of gold its made out to be and can be boring, but i would rather know that i have seen it through to the end than be farming vindi &amp; co for the rest of my EQ life.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that guild relationships on this server are also pretty cordial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merc</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently did a server transfer after acquiring epics and being in a guild 'on the verge of' NToV.  I did it after quitting EQ for almost 6 months and being disgusted with my guild/server situation.<br />
<br />
For me it was a good move.  I'm in a much better guild now, and enjoying playing the game again.  There are a few more things to think about when doing a server switch but I won't go into them.<br />
<br />
You will NOT get your epics back.  I sent an e-mail directly to my new server GM requesting epic return (because of the mage thing) and was denied.  Basically the mage epic is a spell that summons the item, hence their ability to get it returned.<br />
<br />
This is just another way Sony has pissed on pure melee's, especially the warrior.  Casters getting a full spellbook and warriors getting jackshit is in no way fair and balanced.  Pure melee's should be given either A. their weapons, or B. Their No Drop armor.  I could go on but I'll stop here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moving servers can be a gamble. Make sure you get to know the peeps in advance. Research the server board, ask lots of questions.<br />
<br />
few side comments<br />
<br />
elemental planes does burn people out. too much repitition, backflagging, farming, ad naesium. If your server is crowded getting shots at shield mobs, especially coirnav can elongate the march to time severely.<br />
<br />
I can tell you that we spent our first night in Time yesterday and the new content raised spirits. This will keep us engaged for a while im sure.<br />
<br />
as for Ssra, its still a great off-peak guild pickup raid for fun. pretty crowded on quellious so its a rarity that anything is up. Emp is still a good target even for elemental guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah make sure that have someplace to go when you get there. that time guild farming ssra still doesnt sit right with me. even for alts. serious alts in my guild are time flagged and have full orante or better, time warriors have Bow's or Sews minimum. new recruites that become members are given BoC handme downs till they get a bow or something<br />
<br />
NOW depending on the server they may go farm Ssra and VT on days they are not in time, to help you guys get equipment. that is a possibility.<br />
<br />
if you go through with it i wish you luck and hope it works out for you and your guild.</div></div><hr />
