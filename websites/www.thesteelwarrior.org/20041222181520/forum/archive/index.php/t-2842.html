<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, wont detail my test I did with the FB4 shield from BoT but suffice to say, that I was unable to keep agro off of my enchanter with it while she attacked with her staff with no haste (staff is 30/35 with no proc).<br />
<br />
I also bashed something 15 times (hitting with 8 of them) and then a druid healed me and I lost agro.<br />
<br />
In both cases, I was not attacking, only bashing.<br />
<br />
Question is, is the hate generated from FB completely useless, or is it due to my low bash skill of ~60 ?<br />
<br />
I really do not feel like working up my bash skill if the hate generated is far less than just using an off hand weapon.<br />

I've always been of the opinion that dps=aggro.  Procs are nice, and I know as warriors we need them, but you just can't rely on them.  I don't have an FB shield, but personally I wouldn't use one as I doubt that the dmg from bash, even with aggro from FB, would be enough to outset the loss in dps for not having a weapon in that second hand.  I have seen some warriors use a BoC, or other EB weapon, and an FB item.  Not sure how this works for them, maybe someone who has that combo can enlighten us.  I'd like to know how that holds aggro compared to DW or a good 2 hander.  If you were doing no dmg/dps with your main hand though, I can't see that you would hold aggro at all.  I'd try to test out the shield with a good one taunting one hander and see how that works for you.</div></div><hr />

Was playing around in fire before pulling Magmaton (Where I use BF/AoE for rampage tank) and kept aggro on yard trash the entire time vs 2-3 BoWs and a Vanazir all taunting.  Don't underestimate the power it has :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burol</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that I hold agro much better when I use my FB4 shield. I suggest that you look at other threads on this board for more info about using it. But basically, the shield itself does not generate agro. The proc increases the agro generated by other means (DPS, procs, etc).<br />
<br />
I swap my shield in and out as the bash key resets and I definately think I hold agro better doing so. I have even tested it with a 65 Shaman friend. He had to really work to pull agro from me. Several slows, debuffs, and his best dots before the mob would move to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ghetto bash with a Stormrider Carapace, but I don't think im generating that much more aggro over slam/kick.  As far as I can tell furious bash 4 gives 40 percent more aggro from bashing as per normal, which isn't too much.  Bashing with a shield seem to stun more successfully than slam though, noticed this years ago with a little troll warrrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mourningloree, don't underestimate the power of just being the first one to engage a mob as it arrives to your raid.  With even 1 or 2 rounds of initial aggro over other warriors, they're going to have to be lucky with procs to pull aggro off you in such short fights.  I easily hold aggro over BoW and BF/SoD warriors all the time in such fights if I'm the first one to intercept a mob comming into the raid.<br />
<br />
I've posted my feelings on FB shields in many threads, and my opinion hasn't changed.  It's good for being a rampage tank.  It's not going to be very useful for anything else.  I would say the previous poster's estimation that FB 4 gives 40% more hate to his bashes is about correct.  It's not very significant.</div></div><hr />

If that were true it might not be useless. But it is not true.<br />

In fact, on one Emperor run we were short on CC knights and I held aggro for an entire emperor fight with nothing but taunt and continuing to hit bash - that worked through heals and slows just fine.<br />
<br />
So while its not the holy grail for aggro - shields (especially FB shields) really do increase the durability of a tank, cut back on ripostes, and don't seem to hurt aggro.<br />
<br />
I use a shield almost every time I MT and look forward to upgrading to an elemental or time FB shield one day.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that using a shield for anything other than rampage or MT on a 2k hitter is a good idea - but at least it fights the ripostes and gives a nice AC boost.<br />
<br />
Wuold be nice if they added a reason to actually use shields on a regular basis - heck - would be nice if they added a reason to use dual wield on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find that using this combo i can hold aggro almost as well as with a BoC and dual wielding.<br />
<br />
The only problem is people are highly biased against the shield and even if you are not lossing aggro they keep whining dual wield, dual wield</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not highly biased =) I tried it out, and I could not hold agro against an unhasted enchanter meleeing with the shield alone.<br />
<br />
I assure you, had I put say, my GBoS in my off hand, and a torch in my main hand, I could easily hold agro in the same case.<br />

You swap it out till bash refreshes.  It's a bit of work but worth it.</div></div><hr />
