I was just wondering what abilities/disc's you guys used when MTing raids...Like how you do it and manage to keep aggro, so i dont look like a total reject on some raid if they ever ask me to MT.</div></div><hr />

If you joined a raiding guild then I assume they have a number of tanks allready that do the dirty work. Get used to raiding and ask questions to your fellow warrior guildmates while trying to get geared up for the big work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zekez</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For tanking i generally use Furious to get setup get mob debuffed. Start some Hot's and get clerics positioned. Than pop defensive once thats down. The rest like positioning etc you learn as you do it, so lift up your sleeves and get ready for some dirty work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As you just joined, you probably won't MT the bosses much.  But you may end up doing rampage tank or 2nd, 3rd etc. tank duty. For rampage tanking, fortitude then defensive. For tank switching when the previous tank dies, furious - AETaunt- incite - defensive in that order. Talk to the other tanks in your guild about how they prefer to do things like add splitting, setting rampage and tank mezzing.</div></div><hr />

I 2 box a 65 Shaman and 65 Warrior. When the new /disc timers came out I went out and did alot of testing to see what I could do, and which /disc I could chain. If you have a Shaman or Cleric friend that is willing to help you do this for about 4 hours you can find which ones work best for you and the order to use them.<br />
For Boss mobs I use AE Taunt Furious Incite and when Furious drops I either use Defensive or Evasive, depending on the mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garim</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ill second Bustauff here.   Furius then defensive or evasive.  Some times evasive can be important against mobs that have a big proc.  Dont get stuck on using the same defensive disc all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I use Fortitude nowadays before AETing. It's 360 degrees 100% melee evasion and can help when the mob you're AETing somehow gets behind you for some reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a tradeoff.  Furious lets you build some decent DPS aggro in the opening seconds of your engagement.  I guess if you've got a slow connection and are somehow being flanked by mobs that are more intelligent than I've ever seen, then there might be a use for Fortitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fortitude is safe,but, less aggro.I almost always use furious.Fortitude is good for RT of course and situationally better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS. Well usually furious is down ,but, when i had it I used it hehe.</div></div><hr />

If you are the only person on the aggro list then you will get the mobs full fury on rampage.  Two or 3 quick rampages while furious can kill on a badass mob.  Same with ae rampage.  Most of the time the RT is set quickly, but i've had a few poor experiences with a slow RT and me tanking for the both of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry? You're confusing me.You can't be saying what it sounds like....<br />
<br />
PS. Ap if you're tanking (highest on the aggro list) you don't eat ramp er...imagine even Bert hehe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are the only person on the aggro list (IE: there is no one else) then when the mob rampages you are the one that gets smacked.<br />
<br />
For example i rush bert from the safe side of the room and no one else follows.  If he rampages 2 times quickly before anyone heals me or the rampage tank fires arrows to get on aggro list, then i will take those 2 ramages ... as soon as i get a heal or anyone does anything to Bert or myself, the rampage is set and i will no longer take it.<br />
<br />
It has happened to me before on bert and a few other mobs.  (Bert killed me while furius the first time i ever tried him ... 2-3 quick rampages).<br />
<br />
Since fort/fur is used generally at the start of the fight then the first crucial seconds, melee round, and rampages are the only things applicable.  It sucks to die in under 4 secs to Bertox while furious because your RT wasnt paying attention ... your healers were still starting the chain ... and bert decided to rampage 2-3 times before you can blink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats ummm interesting hehe.I've tanked many ae and single target ramp mobs with people outa range.Never died to Ramp while tanking.In fact I've never died engaging with furious up.I tank everything we do 4 nights a week for the last year.I may be backing off a bit has gl now,but, erm I've never seen this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's true, rampage can hit the main target.  It's just rare to have nobody else on the rampage list or in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmm ,well being that I don't parse and check logs much cuz I'm too busy flailing away at keys it's possible I missed something sometime.Tho like I said I've never died engaging with furious up and I've done that a lot.Clerics always ask me what something hits for and I usually just cry like a little girl for heals.So what is gimp that I can get to solo and  live long enough to see it single target rampage hehe?I r curious now... :)<br />
<br />
PS.BTW...in so many encounters I can't begin to count furious has never failed me.If you're MT it's better IMO ...well up to p4 time anyhoos.Fortitude is great for the RT,or, if you think you'll be pulled/summoned outa position right away.Good for ae taunting multi hard hitters(like say coirnav's adds) and running away too!</div></div><hr />
