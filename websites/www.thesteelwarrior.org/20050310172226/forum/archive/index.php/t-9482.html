and it's a pretty decent alternative to ornate. (not multiquestable FYI)  <br />
<br />
But the effect requires 1.5 sec cast time and lasts 12 seconds.  This is the second type of item i've seen like this.  The 1.5 epic is the exact same situation.  Why put a cast time on items we are supposed to use while in combat when we have 0 channeling skill.  It makes this item's right click nearly worthless to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the effect is it -15% to all dmg or what exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">either increase the duration to be as long as defensive disc or make it an instaclick and i think it'll be okay.<br />
<br />

I use my ring of the crimson bull (1.0 cast time) as a junk buff on dispell mobs and even with having to target myself it's rarely interrupted if I hit immediately after a round.  <br />
<br />
To me the epic effect is most useful to hit when you lose aggro to a caster, but even while getting hit I doubt you will have much trouble getting it cast if you time it.</div></div><hr />

Usually best to wait until the mob is slowed though.</div></div><hr />

I tested on some mobs and it doesn't alter the min or max hit.  It is hard to get a parse sample large enough to have any meaning, but without altering mob hits we are probably looking at a buff that increases dodges,parrys,riptose,and misses.  In short i dunno.<br />

The quests I origionally posted has not been solved yet, but on page 2 KURIM posted all the information you need to do this quest.<br />
<br />
Solanthus once it's slowed I don't need the click effect.....</div></div><hr />
