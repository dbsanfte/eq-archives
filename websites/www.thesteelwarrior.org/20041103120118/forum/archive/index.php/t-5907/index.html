<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Havent posted, as i rarely do, looming in the shadows.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had all but retired kal,  working on int casters and such when we seemed to encounter a lack of warriors in guild, so i decided i needed to bite down and get some stuff done.<br />
<br />
Just dinged 64, gonna finish 65 in a few days,  i picked up ND2 for a hp boost, snagged the first ranks of Punishing blade, and that GoD proc increase thing cuz i was doing alot of kite groups.<br />
<br />
Recently i snagged anger 2 aug for my GBoS and i love it.<br />
<br />
So now things get complicated again and i come here for help.<br />
<br />
Im about to buy a 2nd anger2 aug and im not sure where to stick it yet.<br />
<br />
Ive been running a few ideas around that ill share.<br />
<br />
1) Throw the anger 2 aug on my CHoS and dual weild with 2 force shocks and 2 400hate procs<br />
<br />
2) Throw the anger 2 on my twisted steel bastard sword (see magelo) and have a slow steady procing taunt weapon with decent dps to hold me between procs, and keep my GSo4w for non-tank dps<br />
<br />
3) Vis-versa #2 and aug GSo4w for aggro,  twisted bastard sword for raid dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have also been hitting xanamech whenever something harder/more important isnt up, and i dont really have any competition for the hammer, im considering holding out and auging CHSD with GBoS.<br />
<br />
Im just not sure if 2hander will get me good enough aggro augged, and i dont know how big of a menance dual-weilding is to healers. I dual weild when tanking PoV or Bot mobs, and when SAing tower raids,  it hasnt killed me yet, but it scares me.<br />
<br />
Ill be crawling through forums for about a half hour, if i see anything that i missed that answers most of this, ill delete the post.<br />
