Man that's a great idea. Seeing as how I really, really, want the SEWS and Ornate Great Blade for their looks (and I guess the stats are OK) I could find something that looks like them, but that I can get without raiding.<br />
<br />
Or dying hopefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">longsword of vitality, a knights 1hs from HoH has the SEWS look<br />
<br />
ornate broadsword, pally 1hs from jiva has ornate greatblade look<br />
<br />
cant think of anything for warriors with those looks, although i think i remember there being a weapon with BoW graphic tradeable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they changed that weapon; if it was this weapon; Kel Xundrau xi Xauninae (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=32174) from Akheva Ruins..I have one in the bank and I heard it 'once' looked like a BoW ( it looks like a Centi Long Sword with a different handle now )...but it was never tradable that I knew of.<br />
<br />
There's also a Honorable Longsword (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22973) off Aerin'Dar that looks like a mini-sews as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not that weapon and there is a tradable sword that has the BoW graphic... but I'll be damned if I can remember the name right now. <br />
<br />
I was duoing reavers in CoM about 2 months back and saw the sword on like a level 52 warrior, so I inspected him just out of curiousity and had him link me the weapon.<br />
<br />
I think it's a tradeskill weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Blackened Acrylia Greatsword or something like  that, but it doesn't have the BoW graphic anymore either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">that's the one kogur saw i bet....that rings a bell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thats what it sounds like to me, knew it had some tradeskill metal/ore in its name. only ever saw 1 person with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Plankton Laced Greatsword has BoW look also.</div></div><hr />
