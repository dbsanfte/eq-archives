<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />
<br />
I recently started playing again after a 2 year break. So much has changed, that I basically have to start all over again. <br />
<br />
I am currently level 36 (will do a magelo after the weekend) with some pretty wimpy gear. (wurmslayer/ssoy etc....)<br />
I had a question about the DPS and which weapons to use in primary and offhand slots.  I have searched through the messages here, but couldn't seem to find an end-all answer to my question.<br />
<br />
Is it better to have a faster weapon in the primary and a slower in the offhand?<br />
Or does it also depend on the proc(s) involved with the weapons?<br />
<br />
I can get my hands on some pp so what would you all recommend for my level armor wise, as well as weapon wise that I would be able to survive duoing with a 37 wizard (my wife). Without too many deaths...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
