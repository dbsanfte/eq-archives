One of the things I wanted to do before I retired is see plane of time( Yea, I know it's retarded, but meh). Is that possible on a cleric twink? I heard population is pretty damn low now. I'm guessing I would need OoW? Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-29-2005, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clerics are always welcome, and time guilds shouldn't be too picky about having tons of AA or anything.  You will definitely want OoW.  It is the place to be for exp and loot these days, and you will definitely want to level to 70 right away.  As far as is it &quot;worth it&quot; well I guess that's up to you.  EQ is certainly not closing down in the near future, you remember what the game is like so I guess it's you're call on &quot;worth it&quot; hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-29-2005, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.  From the way you word your post I suspect you are hearing aboutthe desperate low numbers some people are claiming.  While some servers have been really beaten down numberwise, most are actually in pretty good shape.  Numbers are definatly down, but not to that severe a level.  The exceptions mostly seem to be the euro servers, test, and the zek servers, who are all suffering badly.  But on most servers, most raid guilds are doing fine, and some guilds that paniced and mass recruited/merged when numbers bottomed out during the holidays now have too many people(80 people showing up for a 54 person event is a little bit of a problem a friend in one such guild tells me).<br />
<br />
Clerics are always welcome, and as populations are down somewhat across the board, your main would most likely be welcome as well.  OoW is probably going to be needed, and any guild raiding Time, or even EP's, is probably also dropping at least a few raid mobs in Oow for runes.  It's worth it tho, as OoW is to me one of the more fun expansions to come out in awhile.<br />
<br />
Like Brutul said(he so smart), whether or not it is worth it is a very personal thing.  If getting to Time is a goal for you, then there is no reason why you could not do just that if you choose to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">01-29-2005, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, no, it's not worth it, not to the folks you'd be playing with. <br />
<br />
If you want to see Time, then log on and guest with someone on a raid, enjoy it, then go back to whatever you're having fun with now. <br />
<br />
Besides, if you've seen Earth, Fire, Air, Water and Drunder, you've seen 90% of the zone, from the architecture to the mobs to the ecology.  Saryn and TT aren't that different from what they looked like in the PoP progression and they're too tall to see them easily anyway.  Quarm's proportions are badly artistically rendered and he's WAY too big to see effectively.  If fact, if you're a cleric you'll never see him anyway except on the pull, perhaps for a second or two.<br />
<br />
Getting a cleric &quot;twink&quot; apped, guilded, geared, flagged, and expecting to have that person around long enough to justify the time and effort invested in him only to have  him go &quot;ok, I got to Time and I'm bored again, bye&quot; is debilitating to folks, both the resources mentioned and their morale.<br />
<br />
People need to raid because they enjoy the process as much as the goals.  People who are too &quot;goal-oriented&quot; in games like EQ burn out.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day, <br />

Chances are if I got to time I wouldn't stop = p. I use the word retire very lightly. If I was in a guild that actually had some people I respected then I would gladly stay.</div></div><hr />
