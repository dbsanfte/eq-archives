while many equipment threads exsist I was looking for information on items a casual player should save up, beg or borrow money for when they hit 60 +<br />
 <br />
My main concern is when to spend and look for bargains or when to save up for the expensive upgrades when you hit 60 + I am in a family guild so dont do much uber raiding and currently have around 20 K to spend or save.<br />
<br />
Here is my latest maglo..... <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1114834<br />
<br />
Any urgent upgrades i need to consider ? What are some of the best bang for buck items it is worth saving for and passing on smaller upgrades ... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd wait another month or so for OoW to get all mudflated so PoP and GoD items drop down in prices more...but unless you see something that is an obvious steal ( like my thistlepoint which is a 12/21 piercer that i purchased for 100 plat ) .... i try to wait for prices to drop more when a new expansion is released...<br />
<br />
but on your magelo, no idea...no can look here at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'd second Shik's advice. Obviously, your cultural bracer is better than the other one; cultural boots (which are pretty good anyway) would also be an upgrade.<br />
But I think you're really looking pretty darn good at lvl 52 -- you have good haste for a few levels, your weapons are good, as is your armor, and I think you could level for a bit and see how prices move around.<br />
You'd be safe buying some stat food &amp; drink, though.<br />
Plan enough LDoNs to get some hate augs at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks pretty good, you can't really go wrong with Fierce heraldic. The slots you need to upgrade asap would be boots (get anything with hp),  helm (more hp would be good), and probably a new offhander. 13/19 isn't bad, but it has no aggro on it. a SotBS is 12/19 with a stun/dd, so not only will it do comparable damage, it will also be much better aggro. Also, I'm not sure why, but I hate pern cloaks. Crinose is same ac with 30 more hp, and much much cheaper.<br />
<br />
If you can manage with what you have though, and you should be able to, taking Shik's advice and waiting to make any major purchases for a few days or weeks would be a good idea. <br />
<br />
doh just checked your magelo and you have a sotbs. oh well. Not sure if any of the newer oow weaps are usable below level 60 or so, or how much they cost, but some of them are pretty nice, and are probably options to consider if you dont like the chos/sotbs cookie cutter look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally agree with what has been said here. Look for some new boots, either Fierce Heraldic, Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer or Boots of Slaughter. Those should all be good for their prices. Save the rest of your money till you are higher level, but log into the bazaar for a minute before you start playing each night and just take a quick look for some good deals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bokbok</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info... in saving mode now  :) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bokbok</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Is the ornate breastplate mold worth the expense ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends, I think, on your capacity to earn plat vs. you and your friends' capacity to loot other upgrades vs. your capacity to grind LDoNs. Also I'd guess it depends on the particular slot you're talking about.<br />
Some guys around here can tell you the relative value of a given ornate slot off the top of their (pointy) heads.<br />
I'd still do some leveling and just keep your eyes out. Your gear is good for several levels, and I really don't know how prices will be influenced by OoW. And &quot;doable&quot; at lvl 60 might look different from &quot;doable&quot; at lvl 52. I would think things will go down in price that are still upgrades for you, but I've been somewhat surprised on my server that worn haste items didn't fall as much as I thought they would with LDoN and tribute sources becoming available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kizrak's BP is much better then Vindi's BP or a BP of eradication.  It'll last you until you get enough points for a Royal Attendant BP.  In the meantime, a velious BP isn't a bad choice. <br />
<br />
As for getting it for the clickie, that's just a perk.  It doesn't stack with focus, but I find times where I use it anyway just for the AC and MR boost.<br />
<br />
I'd say ornate gauntlets first.  Clicky haste is a HUGE bonus.  You will NEVER have to worry about trudging out to Iceclad and looking for Stormfeather.  :)<br />
<br />
Other ornate pieces I'd say is a matter of preference.  I found fierce heraldic bracers to be superior to Kizrak's, but I wasn't concerned about the ATK.  I wanted AC, HP, saves, and dex.  Similar with the boots.  There are better, tradeable things, that you can pick up cheaper instead of ornate boots.<br />
<br />
Blindeye makes a nice bow slot item too.  It's a decent pre-EP bow, and permanent see-invis is handy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go for the biggest bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The clicky has evolved to more than a perk for me.  I have a shaman on my 2nd comp, constantly with my warrior, and I never use focus anymore.  I'll take 36ac and 30MR over 244hp these days for 99% of all situations.<br />
<br />
It's already extremely close to the accepted 6hp = 1ac formula, and add in the 30 MR and the fact that it doesn't cost my shaman mana, and we have a winner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not the only one that belives this i am sure .... but ...... part of the fun in playing a warrior is being able to participate and learn from this amazing site !!!!<br />

<br />
I would not get ornate then the Royal Attendant BP.  That is the one of the biggest wastes of LDoN points I have ever seen.  You trade off 9 ac for 15 hps.  Horrible trade off for 1492 points.  The LDoN bracers are actually quite nice.  Ornate bracers are very light on HPs, and the Tak bracers can be upgraded to 110 hps iirc, might be 115, I forget how many hps are on them to begin with.<br />
