<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to this post here (http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=43499.topic) on Monkly Business, the Opening System as it appeared on Test will not likely appear in the game in that form.<br />
<br />
I wasn't in favor of this change. SoE intended it to provide pure melee classes with more complex gameplay and to enhance their groupability. I felt that the random utility it provided wouldn't be much more benefit than weilding a weapon with the proc you actually needed and the dancing star power-up aspect would be tough to deal with (playing a Warrior has a fair amount of complexity already).<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my suggestion - provide a limited number of weapon buff disciplines that overwrite any existing weapon buff with a short duration (1 minute?) buff sharing the same refresh timer (3 minutes?). I'm thinking a 0 sec. stun for interrupting casters, a modest (30%) slow, Tash, Ensnare, +1 DMG etc.<br />
<br />
Most of these things are on weapons already and many warriors swap them in or out as needed. Selecting a Weapon Buff Discipline is less messy than the Openings System and the right 4 or 5 weapon buffs could give Warriors a LOT of flexability in raids and enhance their experiance groupability without being unbalancing.<br />

<br />
the problem with adding more on demand skills is that the ones tehy already have don't work right.  My hotkey box is set up with 1: Taunt, 2: Bash/Kick 3: Assist 4:Inc message 5: incite 6: range attack.  thos are the ones I use A Lot.  7-10 are things like Rampage and Defensive that don't see much use and aren't that big a deal really.  As it is right now, in my combat abilities box I can have up to 4 Abilities in the 8 slots provided.  Why? because when i hit 1 to taunt it also activates the ability in combat ability slot 1.  If I have combat abilities in the combat abilities boxes they get wasted because i tried to assist the puller and used a hotkey.  It does me no good what so ever to have more abilities available if I can't put the ones I already have and would like to use in the slots provided for them.<br />
<br />
this is my only gripe about the new abilities...</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO, while the Discipline System is an improvement for all pure melee, the chance to fully &quot;tune&quot; the pure melee classes with the Phase 1 changes was predicated on the Designers'/Developers' assumption that the Opening System would happen.<br />
<br />
Hopefully after the GoD release, SoE will complete our revisions, unless of course GoD contains changes based on SoE's foreknowledge that the Opening System wasn't going live anytime soon.<br />

They're messing with the idea of no riposte from frontal attacks on monks if not tanking, stuff like that is what i'd rather see happen (unique abilities). As to what it could be for warriors, not sure really. If anything i'd like to see a type of permanent shield ability to lock onto someone, ala protect @ daoc but not as profound as our current obviously.</div></div><hr />

It sounds like your hotkeys are messed up.  I don't have the problem you are describing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, I know what your problem is.  You use the numberpad on the right side of your keyboard for your hotkeys, don't you?  On mine, I use the numberpad for my spells (1-8 for the corresponding spell gems).  When I first got my discs on my beastlord, I was attempting to activate the disciplines when I hit the first 4 numbers (for Slow, debuff, haste and heal).<br />
<br />
If you look up the keyboard assignments in the Options window, you'll notice they assigned numberpad 1-8 for the combat abilities in addition to CTRL 1-8.  Just go in and remove the numberpad associations (should be as the alternate hotkey) and you shouldn't have any more problems.<br />
<br />
If nothing else you should check to see what the combat window hotkeys are being activated from, that should help.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure you always use CTRL to strafe with arrow keys, I always do this.<br />
<br />
but in option menu abilities shortcuts are CTRL + 1, CTRL +2, etc... just erase those or replace them with something you could use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The opening system as it was on Test will probably not return. The goal was to make combat more interesting and add some reactiveness, but the attention required and randomness of it didn't do much to help with the class balance aspect. We'd rather use skills like the Phantom and Incite line, disciplines, and innate abilities to define and refine the class' role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats really the way to go (the fucking opening system was/is shit big big big big SHIT  ,.. first it was just a offensive opening then defensive error fumbling negative stumblin error headache failure came :) i mean wtf ..25 different triggers gives just headache and isnt fun or helping at all if the skill you trigger with is a) only aviable at random and b) not doing much overall ) <br />
<br />
thats like giving sks/pallys the chance to cast theyre spells if the npc gives a spell casting opening ... but he has like 10 other openin types who can trigger first,... Stun opening Heal opening Root opening Buff opening Sit opening Attack opening Bash opening LoH opening ... well i guess i do not need to continue and SoE might see it ... :) ghaaa<br />
<br />
... i just miss flowing endurance items / endurance regen spells / and focus items ...to give us the same Knightemizations options like they have ...but i guess this will take SoE another 2 years and 4expansions to see .... :)</div></div><hr />

You might be onto something here.  I've been carefull to watch for doing exactly what your talking about but it all so happens if I mouse click on the button for a skill.  I could however, be something with my keyboard mapping.  I'll have to look into that in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i cant say i was looking forward to &quot;twitch&quot; fighting so im not fussed they are ditching it.<br />
<br />
if they are going to be adding endurance to items as they say they will, what i would like to see is more disciplines or abilities that we can choose when to activate and maybe with faster refresh times. that way we have more choice and will be limited by endurance. as it stands now with plus endurance tems i dont see myself ever running out.</div></div><hr />

I did not want the openings/twitch fest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see:<br />
- added mitigation<br />
- gave us ranged agro<br />
- gave us un-linked dics<br />
<br />
AND NOW (maybe)<br />
<br />
- Endurance on existing items &quot;similiar to mana for hybrids&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow...SoE is on a roll!<br />

You know this first round of buff is (if we are to believe SOE) is from that looking at things back in June. They have always maintained they were looking at it (I think we just made them look a LOT harder).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heafstaag</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Endurance on items is something that is planned from what I can tell. Open up a bazaar window and Endurance is now a stat you can restrict on for your searches.</div></div><hr />

On the one hand, I don't feel that enough has been done to adress melee class balancing. Ok so we warriors now have a 400 hate proc that we can activate when we want, it does little to adress many of our other problems like dps vs casters, poor itemization, margionaliztion of hps and ac. <br />
<br />
I didn't like the openings system the way it was, but it something to look forward to. It would not have fixed our issues, but then now that nothing is comming our issues just wont get fixed. We waited nearly two years for something, we got a crumb, now must we wait another two years?<br />
<br />
Fuck you VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that they scrapped the opening system is GOOD news.  They said right in that announcement that they're going to be giving us a mix of passive and/or on demand skills instead.  That's EXACTLY what we've been asking for.  Obviously that will take some development time so we can't expect those skills to go in right away because they don't exist yet.  I suspect that they will take many of the effects that were going in as opening moves and just make those on demand.</div></div><hr />
