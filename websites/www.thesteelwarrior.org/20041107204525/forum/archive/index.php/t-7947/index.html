<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to start another thread on this but i think the old one has died and is being ignored some as i would be if it did not interest me somewhat.<br />
<br />
I have read and reread the thread about the AC VS SHIELD. I have seen a lot there that I understand and a lot that I do not understand. There is some that I have theories about and some I can just speculate on.  <br />
<br />
My opinion: <br />
Each mob has a soft cap for the damage per AC range. This may be grouped according to the era/expansion as a group VS each mob having their own for each trash mob out there and the big named mobs, they have their own formula.<br />
<br />
My opinion: <br />
There is a hard cap in the game. Why do I say this? I say this because there is always an end to a formula in one shape or form. If they did not place a cap on the formula then the computer would spend forever calculating this formula and the game would never get played as the processor would be to busy calculating the formulas than running anything else. As there are a lot of formulas than just your attack from the mobs AC. One is the collision formula keeping you from falling thru to the center of the earth and that keeps you and the mob with in the confines of the walls. We know of this one easy as we seen it broke. If you place a cap on the formula then the computer will run short bursts from the min to the max of the formula then start over every so often. Not start a formula and run it for ever. I say this because you, the parcelers, have already found one in the AC.<br />
<br />
Try this, Go to Magelo and take your current level 65 char and max all his AA's. Now go to the search area and look for the best items you can get in game and then augment them out the best you can get in game and place them on him. Now unless your a computer that can take all the variables and search for the correct/best ones and match up them to the right pieces this would take you forever. Now there is already a computer that can do this and it has every one of the proper and exact variables. It is the computers running the game at Sony's server farms. This in essence is a hard cap as you can get no better. Why? It is because your already at the current max for the tables/game and probally have either trivialed all the mobs tables or are atleast at their top end of their positive side. So in essence this a hard cap as you can get no better untill the next expanshion comes out and the tables grow and change.<br />
<br />
My speculation: <br />
When they first came out with this game they probably never envisioned 100+ac breastplates and other armor around the 100 AC mark. (Did you?) So for simple sakes their formulas stopped above the current max ubber level by say 1K. The formula was created at the original start of the game. Once Luclin came out and you all parceled and found the hard cap the formula became outdated, as the game had evolved to the max of its original created formulas. The Dervs had to go back and look at the original formulas and modify them to match the next few expansions. <br />
Hence the following quote: <br />
  <br />
AC functions the same way in all zones. Some old NPCs may have lower attack than new ones, but the formulas for combat do not change.<br />
<br />
The AC formulas were changed a short while before PoP shipped.  Perhaps that was confused as a content change in PoP. However, the Avatar of War does less damage to a warrior with 1800 AC than one with 1300 AC just the way that Bertox does. It doesn't matter that he's &quot;old content&quot; - his attack is still fairly high.<br />
<br />
- Kavhok, SOE  <br />
With the quote above it leads me to the speculation: <br />
The formula that I have thought up: <br />
The Mobs attack - your AC = A number M, place M in the formula table and it gives you the % of a positive or negative bonus the mob gets for hitting you as long as it is between the min cap A and max cap Z.<br />
Now lets see if I can show this in action. <br />
Your AC is 1200 <br />
Mobs attack is 1350 <br />
Difference of 150 <br />
Place that difference on the table that this mob falls into and you get a bonus %, for this example we will say 15% <br />
Now the mobs damage is a range from 30-100. So the game runs a random number generator and places a range of 30-100 on it. (Kind of like the /ran 100 command for deciding loot a lot of people use (/ran 30-100)), we will say that number was 55.<br />
The mob gets a melee bonus per their level. The mob is level 48. Lets say the bonus if 33. <br />
So on a successful hit this round the hit is:<br />
(55 + 15%) = 63.25 + 33 = 96.25 damage to you.<br />
(Random swing damage + % of that added to it) = damage before the bonus + bonus = damage you take.<br />
<br />
Now that is a theory and I know there is a lot more that comes into play but for the simplicity of it we can use this. Now the different eras/expansions haves different damage ranges and tables for each mob and named that you encounter. Kind of like AD&amp;D, each mob there had its own special stats. Same here<br />
SO <br />
If you apply this in the extreme here. I.E. Your AC is in the 2K area attacking a Kunark named you will be at the extreme top of his chart and the damage bonuses for you will be always in the upper half of the positive side and the ones for him will be at the bottom of half of the negatives. Now for this to happen you only need to have 1600 AC so the 400 more you have does you no good as the mob does not care about that extra 400 AC as that places you off his table and the returns are just not there (cannot be seen or parceled). But you step up into the PoP zone and your back on even ground as your on a different table for a different era/expansion mob. The formula is the same but the modifiers are different.<br />
Going back to what the Derv said:<br />
 the formulas for combat do not change.<br />
No the Formula did not change but the modifiers and tables that the formula pulls from DID CHANGE.!! So making the next era/expansion harder.<br />
<br />
Now for the shield raising the soft cap??<br />
Your table that you build for your char has several modifiers and ranges. So your char is the most complex mob out there as you have several modifiers for your table and it is a large set of tables. Keeping this in mind for your AC your table is set up for 21 total modifiers. I would say 18 of them are built into a set base formula. These are your 18 prime slots:<br />
Ear left, ear right, neck, face, head, finger left, finger right, wrist left, wrist right, arm, hands, shoulders, chest, back, waist, legs, feet and charm. <br />
These slots are stable slots as only one type of item can be placed in them, ARMOR<br />
 Now you have 3 slots that are, for this cause, called unstable slots and one non existent slot. The non existent slot is the Ammo slot as you do not get any bonus off this slot other than for a place to put ammo that you have readily available to you for use. <br />
Your unstable slots which are your prim, secondary, and range are slots that can house items like your stable slots or they can build another table called your damage table for this cause. Now you make multiple tables with these 3 slots. One is the range table that works off the range variable off your ammo and your range slot item variable and yet another based on the damage variable in them slots. <br />
The Prim and secondary slots build yet another table called melee damage. If you have a weapons in both hands then your melee damage table is worked into two parts Prim damage and off hand damage. You all have seen this in the parcels you have done that you’re off hand procs less and does less damage compared to that same weapon in your primary slot. <br />
If you add a shield to your secondary slot you remove it totally from your melee tables and add it to your stable slot table as another variable and since your adding another slot to this table it grows a little and hence changing/modifying your stable table that is used for your AC variable. Which in turn raises your soft cap, as it changes/modifies the formula and table you use for your AC variable. <br />
So the formula is the same as it has all these variables and if you choose not to use them then the variable is marked 0 or NA (not applicable). If you’re a caster then your secondary slot is always in your primary slots and the variable for the melee is NA as it is not applicable for a caster as it would be for a melee. If you equip a 2hander then your secondary is marked not applicable.<br />
I think you all see what I am getting at here. I would also be safe to say if you have a shield on your back it counts like a regular primary slot and you get no bonus off it as the secondary slot, which is where the formula looks for its variable, not your back, is not marked shield for the variable in the formulas to consider it. It is marked with what ever you have in there, be it a weapon or mug or shield or NA because you are using a 2hander.<br />
<br />
The question? Does this make any since or am I just rambling off at the mouth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">when you hit a mobs softcap just about every hit it lands will be adjusted to min. more ac at this point has verry little effect (in dnd terms no matter what the dm can roll a natural 20 somtimes)<br />
<br />
the shield is supposed to raise this softcap letting more then normal hits be pushed in the min hit (in dnd terms even a natural 20 won't help the dm but the dm is still useing a 21 sided die dirty dm's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foradan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And if I got a weapon with AC on it, is it counted in the total AC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if your weapon has AC on it then it will be counted like normal AC in the formula. It will not be placed under the AC rule for the shield so you will not get any cap boost off it..<br />
<br />
If your looking for the cap to be boosted then you will need to place a shield in the secondary slot as that is the only place it can be counted for the boost of the cap.</div></div><hr />
