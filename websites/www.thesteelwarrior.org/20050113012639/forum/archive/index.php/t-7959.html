<br />
As my first post on these forums i would like to pose a question to the high end warriors out there.<br />
<br />
Blade of War, how does it stand up to comparision when it comes to other GoD/Time/Elemental weapons.<br />
<br />
How long do you judge it will last me before i need to upgrade it?<br />
<br />
What should i save DKP for?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An anger3 BoW is hard to dismiss even at the Fleshbiter/EoE stage frankly.  It is much like any big 2-hander augmented (eg VDD etc) in non-raid fights, it gets nice snap aggro from damage (or damage potential if you prefer) and accrues decent aggro over the course of a fight.  Naturally the DW setup will gain over the first-proc onwards stage and will actually catch up even without procs fairly quickly I imagine.  <br />
<br />
Still, I wouldn't ever consider a BoW a bad aggro weapon, especially for single-group fights.  In environments that require severe aggro (such as exp content that requires chain debuffs to maintain efficiency) then the DW setup shines more but the 2handers still have a good following for a reason.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if you've got a BoW, I wouldn't trade it in for anything else until PoT.  Even then I'd be thinking other slots until you saw a DBotW to go for.  As a Rogue I am always happy with a BoW tank I can tell you.</div></div><hr />

For being pre elemental, it's an extremely solid weapon.<br />

See my sig =(</div></div><hr />

Yet, FB is inferior to darkblade. Your initial statement implies that one should only upgrade to Darkblade or better. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;do u undrsnd were i m comin frm??????&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />
