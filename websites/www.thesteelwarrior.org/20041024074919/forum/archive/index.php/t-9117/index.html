<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to start an official thread about just this topic so the warriors who are bugged can actually be seen by a browsing dev.  I'm not sure if this can be stickied or anything but those of us who were unfortunate to have this happen to us deserve acknowledgement at least by someone that this has been noticed by now.  <br />
<br />
So far we've come to the conclusion for some that Krekk's script in Draniks City will not activate upon handing him the items;<br />
<br />
Hilt of eternal power<br />
Potion of the Blackfall spirit<br />
Blackfall blade<br />
<br />
He merely responds to us in the terms of &quot;I will do nothing for you!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the problem is, but i've got a feeling its something to do with our actual character files being altered in some way, of the warriors who's epics are bugged and cannot be completed, how many of us participated in omens beta?  Was there some sort of script in beta that may have superceeded and not been overwritten when a newer version of live activation script took place when Omens went active?  Someone whos more gifted in programming could be helpful in telling us if this is possible, two conflicting orders resulting in the default order (older one) being taken resulting in an error because its told to look for a newer one by the server, resulting in our NPC just not responding to the script.<br />
<br />
If any dev's read this please shed some light onto the problem, i've posted on EQlive under tech support as its the only appropriate forum i'm allowed to post under involving this. Thanks :p  <br />
<br />
People who 1.5 is bugged for please keep this up to date and post your results, I've been reimbursed once already and heard of someone having the script fail twice for them and having to be reimbursed twice.  Thus my conclusion that we are bugged internally in some way or the npc just isnt accepting our coding for some reason or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GM said there was something wrong with the flags of the quest, but really I have no idea.  Got my pieces back and I'm waiting to turn them in until I hear some sort of official word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaikachi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can anyone who's had this problem send me their character name and server in a PM?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that it's one of two issues:<br />
<br />
- Krekk has a faction issue whereby his threshold isn't low enough. This would mean that certain races may be lower than the minimum required. The simple fix to this would be to widen the threshold so that's no longer an issue.<br />
<br />
- Those who have had this problem skipped a step somewhere and don't have the appropriate flags on their character to progress. This could be an issue where a flag isn't being set correctly at some point in the quest, or it could just be that the players who had this problem didn't do the step right before. In either case, this should be a fairly quick and easy fix, assuming I can see a character that has had this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys, and sorry for the issues with this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the timely response Jason, it helps a ton to be recognized and know that something is being done to ensure our questability.  I've sent you the info you've requested and hopefully it assists you in something being done to correct the issue, keep us posted please!! :p<br />
<br />
And if the PM didnt go through you can use my name -- Celestias-- from --Tunare--<br />
<br />
It could be a problem with an inproper flag value, I'm very sure I've done every flag required but maybe part of its jumbled up or not clearly working on my character and maybe others as well?  Im not sure about the faction issue, I made myself an Ogre and it didnt change my faction at all, I was still KOS.  A Shaman from my guild who is also an Ogre was not KoS somehow and was met kindly by Krekk.  So i'm not exactly sure... where the faction lay, but it could be a combination of the two or a script not registering error to do with flag being somehow not up to date.</div></div><hr />

I'm a Human myself, and the turnin worked for me, but I know for sure another human who it didn't work on (Tholuxe.Aclylosprada) - I think it might be from the transition where you couldn't loot stuff untill you were at that part of epic - And some people had that stuff already, maybe bugging it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is interesting.  This is what I did , explaining my epic run if this helps.  When pages were bugged I picked up the 4 stones for the hilt first(since Draniksscars groundspawns were bugged), Upon killing the champion I looted him and popped a treasure box for my 3rd stone, my last stone was in proving grounds.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Now  AFTER the patch that fix'd monks stuff, I went to draniksscars, picked up my 3 pages and cover, got the official quest and my blackfall blade smithed in Nedaria's Landing<br />
<br />
Next step-- Same Day-- I journey'd to Vxed and got my Borer stuff done, right after this I went and got the Decaying Lord part in Veksar.  After this I did my everfrost stuff and got my potion of the blackfall spirits<br />
<br />
Next day-- I killed Girplan Devourer obtaining my hilt-- Did a MAJOR run around doing hand ins, doing the high elf in Firiona vie part and the jeweled mask and Bone tome of Daluk Drek, and dealing with the Dwarf in butcherblock and lady dwarf in shadowhaven to turn my hilt into the &quot;Gleaming hilt&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Same day-- Upon establishing all of the items, Blackfall blade, Potion of Blackfall Spirits, Gleaming hilt-- I had only to turn my hilt into the &quot;Hilt of Eternal Power&quot;.  This required more run arounds, turning in to Korbuk than being told to go find someone skilled in gem placing.  <br />
<br />
Same night--I found Gridbar in BBM handed him the 4 gems for him to speak with me, bought a gemming mold in Sanctus Seru, combined it with 1 flask of water, 2 high quality metal bits and the mold producing the Gemming tool.  Handed this gemming tool in, handed my hilt in and he gave me a stamp.  Went to the dwarf in Shadowhaven and got the stamp turned in for the Vial, went back to Gridbar gave him the vial and obtained my &quot;Hilt of Eternal Power&quot;.<br />
<br />
I now had the 3 items required to engage in the final battle, I collected the Eyes out of order because it was the only thing possible to do when the war epic was labeled as bugged due to dranniksscars ground spawns not respawning.  I didnt do any of the parts that flagged you or gave you an exp message for handing something in until the patch that fix'd the ground spawns.  Hopefully this provides some insight, I know I didnt explain every little tid bit, but I touched down on the general order of things that I did to getting up to the final battle.  I made sure to hand the finished hilt to Korbuk to flag me for the Krekk Encounter prior to the engagement, how else would I know he was the guy? *edit*<br />
<br />
Late that night at the final battle, handed in my 3 items, Blackfall blade, Potion of the blackfall Spirit, and Hilt of Eternal Power to Krekk Brimblade, his response was along the lines of &quot;I will do nothing to help scum like you!&quot; x 3.  The result was, I lost all of my items and was reimbursed the next afternoon ready to go again but held out due to hearing this was not a freak accident and just was a bug.</div></div><hr />

I got the Blackfall Ore first, then the 3 groundspawn eyes. on Thursday I got the 3 pages, and continued the quest in order. So I looted everything in order, but did not do groundspawns in order.  Did not have a problem with hand in. However,  my group did not get a treasure chest on any of the mobs (Blackfall Borer, Girplan Devourer, or Dragorn Champion) where other people have stated they did.<br />

I only got a chest from the dragorn champ, that was becuase it was prior to the ground spawn patch.  I did the same thing you did, I got the eyes all at once though and you got your dragorn champ eye (the only one off a mob resulting in a chest prior to patch of ground spawns in DS).  its alittle confusing but if you know the quest well you can follow along.  I did my Girplan Devourer and Borer after the patch because there was no way prior to that for me to be flagged up to loot those items, thus Devourer and Borer did not result in a chest if that makes any difference at all, only the champ did for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sent PM. I have never really been close to quitting EQ. 400+ hours played, but I really feel screwed on this. Helped testing alot of event in beta and now my epic is fooked cause of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I kind of doubt it has anything to do with beta for anyone. Unless you were one of the guilds signed up to test (I know Celestias was), the normal peons do not get copied back. Not sure if  the &quot;uber&quot;s got copied back (did they get anything for beta testing? If not, there is really no reason to copy them back)<br />
<br />
However, how many of the people whoa re bugged looted their Champion or Devourer before the patch and out of order? That sounds more like it could have caused the bug.<br />
<br />
I forgot to add above, I did do Veksar before the Thursday patch, not sure if itwas made unlootable unless you are at that part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im 110% sure sure I did all my epic quest in the right order. No skipping steps anywhere.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I looted my champion before the patch that fix'd ground spawns and fix'd treasure chests.  Thats the only part I looted aside from the other eyes this was actually a drop off a mob that did something that spawns a chest after, so possibly a flag?  Still doesnt make sense to me, I still got my Hilt of Eternal power in the end which should read like anyones hilt of eternal power unless its checking character flags and finds one missing break in a link in the chain that Krekk pulls on before going active.  If krekk pulls on the link-of-flags chain and one is not properly linked it will break and not activate anything as if you handed him junk, is this speculation or is this metaphor accurate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds good J, but what led you to believe it was a faction issue from our characters that led away from a flagging issue?  If that info can be disclosed I imagine you checked our characters out and everything seemed normal? Or was faction somehow played into all of us set to a value that was not normal for someone doing this quest? It didnt have to do with race, we've tested that, I'm unsure to how my faction could have gotten ruined suddenly with this mob :-/.  <br />
<br />
Posting this on behalf of a request from Lacroix whos unable to post for some reason-- <br />
<br />
    Lacroix on Morden Rasp here.<br />
<br />
I do not think this is a flag issue.<br />
<br />
Everyone that fails to start the event gets similar behavior from the NPC: he will not turn to face us when hailed and replies negatively / curses. The people I saw succeed cause the NPC to turn and face them and never say anything.<br />
<br />
I had NON-WARRIOR people hail, and most got the face and remain silent behavior, but some got the do not face and curse behavior.<br />
<br />
The similarity between all these people he curses and will not face was that they leveled HEAVILY in OoW to get to 70 (ie messed with faction more than the others who camped in GoD or PoP for leveling).<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope it is indeed a faction fix to solve this problem, when I hailed him he said curses and told me off basically, i'm unsure what he's done to other warriors who've finished because most cant remember off the top of their head and were just praying the hand in worked.  One of the people in my guild got a good response from him, I hope the faction adjustment is noticable. <br />
<br />
One last question, Should we expect to notice a change in how the NPC responds to us?  If he is the same and doesnt turn to us or just curses at us should we consider not doing the hand in?  I imagine the faction change will be significant and maybe even made non-kos now until the hand in to be safe?  If this isnt so I hope there is some way to tell :) .  (i.e. no quotes like &quot;Go away scum!&quot;). I'd be happy with a face me and say nothing but best case scenario would just be to make him indifferent to all until active in which he'd go KOS.  <br />
<br />
Keep us posted please and thanks for responding so timely.  Hope its resolved soon:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm pretty convinced it's a faction issue.  In other epic quests we've had similar problems with final turn in npc's being kos (and why are they kos to begin with I don't understand, this was a problem in GoD with the Sentinel of the Altar).  Some have turned their pieces in to get them eaten, have them reimbursed, then turn it in while sneaking and have no problems thereafter.<br />
<br />
Only problem is those without sneak are boned for now, illusions and FD don't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I leveled 66-70, 45+ aa's, exclusivly in omens in the past week since the release, Muramite Proving Ground to be specific.<br />
<br />
<br />
My Dranik Loyalist faction is Amiably, meaning some of the named dragorns scattered across OoW zones will talk to me and give me quests. <br />
<br />
<br />
Children of Dranik (i think) is negative faction when I kill dragorns, pretty sure this isn't just in MPG, I don't think I have maxed the negative faction with them yet. (ill check again)<br />
<br />
Dragorn Loyalist faction is really high, so it's a possiblity that one of these factions is directly effecting the turn in?<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, he did turn to others, even after the failed turn in people got his attention more than I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I did one thing out of order, the Girplan before the patch - Did Dragorn after patch (which I might add didn't pop a chest) <br />

<br />
:p he wouldnt have gave me the finished potion if I never gave him the borer piece, so yes I did do it, I wrote that within like 5 minutes and just off the top of my head general run down, theres alot of steps and I didnt refer to each one in its utmost detail.<br />
<br />
 After this I did my everfrost stuff and got my potion of the blackfall spirits<br />
<br />
I ment for this to encompass everything I did in everfrost :) and yes thats the complete works of waiting 7am to 7pm.<br />
<br />
And to answer Endo-- even after Reimbursement of my Hilt of Eternal Power the first time I still handed it to Korbuk after I had already gotten the flag just in case I had to redo the flag for some reason with obtaining it from a GM this time and Korbuk gave me the krekk text again but no flagged exp message, because I had already established that flag the first time around. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the observation though daabu ^.^ but I assure you I did everything correctly i've retraced myself countless times and read every step, so I imagine it is indeed a faction issue now after thinking on it for a while and what J had to say combined with the fact of him yelling at you when you hail him and others just having him give a blank stare and face.</div></div><hr />

I use my old epics like you :p never bothered turning them in for augable ones, but I dont think that this npc searches for your epic when your up to him, just that your flagged up to the point for the hand in.  He should be silent and not say curses than for the fail-safe hand in, otherwise factions messed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am also Agnostic dwarf BUT i did alot of my epic before the pages patch Including the champ fight and picking up most of the eyes.  Krekk has eatin my stuff 2 times now and  i think GM's are getting rather sick of me =P  Waiting for offcial word to try again.<br />
<br />
So going by what Korlis said it is a error in the pages patch or an error in picking up the eyes before you are at that part.<br />

I am rather frustrated though so can't wait for a real fix.</div></div><hr />

It could indeed be a matter of picking up the eyes before Korbuk gives that assignment. I did (except Champion). I find it hard to believe ground spawns could be so tied into to the loop on this, but what do I know.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure they can bring the zone down and do this anytime but maybe its not seen as priority enough to do so, so who knows, may have to wait till like early october when they do that full patch, which bothers me alittle bit because its not that difficult to implement and it will be coming up on a week since I've been at this part to complete but havent been able to because of the bug..</div></div><hr />

Course, if it was something to our advantage, it might be inportant enough to either hot-patch (if possible) or bring the servers down for 30mins. Clearly bugs that negatively effect the players aren't as high priority /grumpy</div></div><hr />

He scowled at me and I got my epic, I think the best way to check if you're ok is to hail him, if he tells you to bugger off, don't hand in. I hailed him and he said nothing, just turned towards me.</div></div><hr />

what it comes down to is, the players that xp'd in omens hard before one of the last patches got some wierd faction bugg that effected how Krekk Brimblade reacts to the turn in. (eating the quest items)<br />
<br />
I'm happy to hear it's going to be fix on the next patch, but this was basicly the first time in my days of playing EQ that I was actually disappointed with the game.<br />

Trying to help a cleric last night with the Barindu fight, the mob was killed by another mob.  A green mob spawns that the cleric must interact with.  It spawned while a couple of peeps were watching for it.  We headed to Barindu and were buffing as a roaming NPC came and killed the trigger mob.  I know waiting for it to respawn is easier than losing all your pieces like the warrior epic mob, but frustrating none the less.<br />

There is a special level set for him for when he eats items, and our factions are right borderline there by a mix of racial/diety (imo) It's a pity they've had this bugged for two patches for the majority of us, but that's eq, nothings really changed. And to you getting your stuff eaten (Especially those who were about to get serrverfirst) You have it, in my eyes you do, at least. Keep the pride, comrades, next patch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>atris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Can anyone who's had this problem send me their character name and server in a PM?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that it's one of two issues:<br />
<br />
- Krekk has a faction issue whereby his threshold isn't low enough. This would mean that certain races may be lower than the minimum required. The simple fix to this would be to widen the threshold so that's no longer an issue.<br />
<br />
- Those who have had this problem skipped a step somewhere and don't have the appropriate flags on their character to progress. This could be an issue where a flag isn't being set correctly at some point in the quest, or it could just be that the players who had this problem didn't do the step right before. In either case, this should be a fairly quick and easy fix, assuming I can see a character that has had this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys, and sorry for the issues with this.<br />

I'm in tells with GM Gomzo on Drinal right now, my items were eaten by this guy. Gomzo is doing what he can but he doesn't seem to have any knowledge over the issue like you do, I'm on all day as Atris on the Drinal server if you would like to contact me.</div></div><hr />

Hail Krekk and see what he says, if he says nothing to you its probably fix'd.<br />

I hailed him and he responed negatively, its not fixed *edit*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>lacroix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">GMs and Devs stated the issue required a full patch, so it will not be fixed until the next patch.<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier, hailing reaction is the sure way to know the NPC status.<br />
<br />
BTW, a general FYI...  That problem is not just affecting Krekk Brimblade.   I attempted a trial in MPG the other day.  Once inside the trial, the Master of Subversion, scowl NPC is supposed to be hailed to start the event.  He reacted to me just as Krekk did (not turning to face me, and insulting me).  Guildmates were able to get him to start the event.  <br />
<br />
The point is, this is a global issue that affects any NPC with the same faction standing vis a vis of any given player affected by the issue.  I hope that the fix the they plan to put in is not focused on that single epic NPC.  A full patch being needed tends to imply it will be grobal.  But time will tell.</div></div><hr />
