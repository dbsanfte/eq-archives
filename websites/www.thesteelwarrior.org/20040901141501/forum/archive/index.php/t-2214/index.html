<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vaz_warrior_12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just recently disbanded within 4 months of being formed.  We had around 80 people in the guild with an avg level of around 58 or so.  We had progressed rather quickly in the beginning taking out CT, Tunare, Rhag 1 &amp; 2, etc.  However, things started falling apart after a couple months and people started leaving for other &quot;high end&quot; guilds.<br />
<br />
My question goes out to all of you that have been in a successful guild or even a guild that had a similar situation as my prior guild.  Can you point out specific reasons behind the success or demise of your guild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So many factors heh. Morale, Respect for officers and officers showing themselves to be worthy of respect, Inclusiveness and team spirit, not rushing ahead leaving people behind, whilst not stagnating and boring your members. Fairness and impartiality in decisionmaking and Looting without screwing up the guilds progression....<br />
<br />
It's a massive great juggling act that only a few guilds get totally right :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gnomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It seems like with PoP there has been a lot more guild jumping than of recently.  Anyone can go into BoT and farm decent gear and level up 200 AA's to be top picks in the local top guild's recruiting station.  Gear is simply the largest limiting factor (As it always has been) and people will jump ship regardless just to get it.  <br />
<br />
Now, successful guilds most likely have the following in common:<br />
<br />
1)  They constantly provide a challenge to their members by outlining and following a long term set goal.<br />
<br />
2)  Run by a guild leader who is fair, level headed, and supremely dedicated.<br />
<br />
3)  Consists of members with similiar dedication to the game and devotion to the guild that they're in.  <br />
<br />
I guess you could probably call it the three D's - Direction, Dedication, and Discipline.  A guild must have all three of these traits in order to become successful.  Vaz, it sounds like your guild fell apart because people lacked Dedication.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Val and Eriatha covered all the high points.   Sassinak makes a good point too, but it's just hard to keep your fridge stocked with gnomes....our guild keeps running out, especially on feast days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are two kinds of guilds:  level 65 guilds and non-level 65 guilds.<br />
<br />
Guilds at the top of the game tend to have better continuity.  If you are a non-level 65 guild, you are working at leveling people up to 65.  Don't expect level 65 people to hangout forever waiting on everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vaz_warrior_12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you for your feedback, seems to make sense now (hindsight is 20/20 of course).<br />
<br />
However, we had a crapload of gnomes so atleast we were headed in the right direction :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">4months 80 people <br />
<br />
abunch of folk of one mind ready to kill stuff, or a bunch of folks wanting to be first on the loot order.<br />
<br />
normaly its the latter.<br />
<br />
also the lvl thing. i lvl slow and see it all the time. half the guild play for fun and half play to win. after a while you hit a brick wall waiing for the others to catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree that gnomes make or break a guild..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shouldnt that be Overgnome of Prexus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Proper recruitment is the lifesblood of any guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ogbasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A creedo that youd die for<br />
