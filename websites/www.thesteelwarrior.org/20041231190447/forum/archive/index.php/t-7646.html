I thought about doing sinister strikes next but since it will only be a damage bonus of 6 for a 20 delay weapon, I am not sure if it the best choice to go with.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are...<br />
<br />
Hastened Instigation<br />
Innate and Improved Innate Magic resist<br />
Double Riposte<br />
<br />
but still considering...<br />
<br />
Sinister stikes<br />
warlords tenacity<br />
Finishing blow<br />
<br />
warlord's tenacity seems nice, to atleast have a way to boost my HP, when a CH is not coming fast enough. But would be 30 aa before the bump is really good enough. and even then it is an hour reuse time. Not sure if it is useful enough.<br />
<br />
Finshing blow would just be nice for speeding up ldons. I am not sure what percent it gets too, but I am thinking after FB3 and CDG 3, it would be about 10 percent. <br />
<br />
Anyway, opinions...what did you guys find to be the most usefull aa's that I don't have. Magelo is correct.</div></div><hr />

Double riposte isnt anything amazing, but I find it goes off often enough, and I don;t have hastened instigation but judging by the number of times I've hit AE and it says &quot;you have 3 minutes/2 minutes/etc.&quot; until you can reuse this ability, I probably should have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get at least level 1 of finishing blow.  It's only 2 points and it's fun to see it go off when you're farmin greens or whatever :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I like sinister strikes.  I have 266 AA, so we're pretty close.  It adds several percent dps.  There are rumors it may help a little bit with aggro too (if aggro is a function of base damage and potential damage... and SS raises your offhand base dmg...) but anyway, once you've got your hit points, your defensive skills, your aggro increasing skills, why not get some extra dps?  It's a better return than many of our purely offensive skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Sinister Strikes is static and not percentage based.  Weighed in at ~5 dps as best I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Sinister Strikes is static and not percentage based.  Weighed in at ~5 dps as best I recall.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, the additional damage done by Sinister Strikes scales with the delay of the offhand weapon.  Again if I recall correctly, the damage bonus is 1/3 of the offhand weapon delay, or 2/3 of the max-hasted offhand weapon delay.  Since weapon delay is measured in 10ths of a second, that's 6.67 dps (if you made your Dual Wield check 100% of the time).<br />
<br />
I'm recalling (please, everyone, poke me if I've misremembered the numbers for any of this) that with maxed Ambidexterity, Dual Wield succeeds something like 80% of the time.  80% of that 6.67 dps is 5.3 DPS.<br />
<br />
So Northerner's approximation seems about right.  Sinister Strikes should add approximately 5.3 DPS when dual-wielding.<br />
<br />
My understanding, however, is that with maxed AA's two-handers are still better for DPS than 1-handers, so unless Sinister Strikes can be shown to improve aggro, I'd be inclined to avoid spending points for an AA that doesn't provide DPS when you most need it.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<br />
Even with Coup de Grace, Finishing Blow only works on mobs up to level 59.  That makes it completely useless for Hard LDoN's (and with 280 AA's, I'm sure hoping you're doing Hard LDoN's rather than normal).  I don't know for sure the mob level for normal-difficulty 63+ LDoN's, but I'm pretty sure that many if not most of the mobs in such an LDoN are level 60+.  Can anyone confirm that?<br />

<br />
If you never see your &quot;reuse time not up&quot; msg while your groupmates die at times due to your inability to grab aggro, you are under-using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which for me comes out to a few percent dps.  I was fairly vague on purpose. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm the MT most of the time, so most of the time I'm dual wielding.  So for me, if I'm going to add dps, it usually doesn't hurt if it's something that requires you to be using 2 weapons.  Obviously the usefulness of sinister strikes for any given warrior is dependent on how often they dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm the MT most of the time, so most of the time I'm dual wielding.

<br />
The point I was attempting to make, which I'll agree I didn't make very clearly, is that if you're MT'ing, your DPS is likely to be pretty irrelevant, so augmenting it isn't necessarily a wise use of points.  And if you're not MT'ing, on a raid, you're most likely going to be using a two-handed weapon of some sort.<br />
<br />
About the only place where Sinister Strikes is good price-per-value, then, is when you're tanking for an XP group, where both your aggro (dual wielding) and your DPS (Sinister Strikes) can be important.  And even then, some people (though not I) prefer to use two-handers when tanking for XP groups.  I might even choose the same, if I had access to a BoW.  :-)<br />
<br />
Hope that clarifies what I was saying.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess my point (and I'm a Rogue, hence my interest in both DW AAs and dps AAs of course) was that being static it will not age very well at all.  If SS was an straight 6% increase in my offhand dps, I'd be pretty happy with it.  As it is though, it's about 5dps and that's hardly a significant increase for a 15AA cost.  It's presently about a 2-3% dps increase though and it isn't like I have a ton of other dps AAs to look at, so I guess I won't complain too loudly.<br />
<br />
I would think it's still of pretty marginal value to a Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I decided to go with hastened instigation and then magic resist. I got another VT run coming up and I am going to be thankful for every ae taunt I can get.  Grabing magic resist, because going to be hitting LMM for awhile to flag peeps now that all the trials are done for most of the guild. But turned on leadership aa, because getting hott so I always have access to it is more important than the normal aa. But I think I will be saving most of my aa in july for the new expansion.<br />
<br />
But damn, this weekend even with ldons breaking on saturday and then my cable going down for 9 hours in the middle of the day. I ended up finishing sturdy5, upgraded my legs by 30 hp, got a 12 hp aug, another 2 charm aug upgrade and then 40 hp aug for the new legs. I gained about 200 hp, pushing me to about 10100 hp fully buffed with tribute. Kicked ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bombay_xev</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">interesting thread, it is almost the exact situation i'm in.  285 AA's.  my latest purchase was hastened instigation 2.  will finish off that one, then on to either the finishing blow series, or double riposte i'm thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, what I ended up working on is did all of hastened instigation, 5 levels of innate magic resist. Did sinister strikes. Now I am doing the pop critical hits since it is only 3/3/3. I think my future plans will be to get through double riposte 3/6/9/3/3/3 and do pop magic resist/cha aa's. All depending on how long it will take me to have 30 aa saved up before oow. Oh and at about 284 aa, i started doing LAA. It is very nie to have delegate  main asisst, health of target's target, spell awareness, a few extra HP's and some group atk all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HoTT is probably the best exp I've spent since Run3.  I like MA, SA, Mark (with delegate) and the others certainly but HoTT is simply something I will not do without anymore.  I'm still chugging through a number of them (hehe, too many people I group with regularily like to do leadership also) but I am very glad I've got HoTT for when I do pickup groups.  <br />
<br />
I'd still like to see some filtering options for Spell Awareness though, I simply love it but the spam can be overwhelming at times even in an offwindow.  Heck, make SA2/3 and I'd pay for the refinements.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er ...they were not discussing dps with time weapons in mind.2-handers tend to be significant dps increases for warriors pre time heh.Especially when they get a BOW,SEWS ,or similiar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going from experience, about half of the mobs in LDoN normal is killable by Finishing Blow.  None goes higher than what Apathy mezzes for (62?).  <br />
<br />
After Vanazir there is a seriously lack of decent 2Hander for aggro until Halberd of Endless Pain in Txevu (have yet to get one, but it's the first one I'd consider using) so DW wins until then.  Although there exists good 2H choices for DPS along the way in GoD they're so poor at aggro the only reason you'd ever use them is if you don't want aggro and since the DW options are good for DPS and aggro, why not DW?  Between JoS, Fleshbiter, Demerix, and Chaotic Black Scimtar there's always some combination that will suit your needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er Phantron I'm confused.These guys were discussing dps weapons for the most part among pre ep warriors.Alot of people who don't play anywhere near as much as most time raiders will not see those weapons that are great dps dualwielding for awhile.Yeh, of course when we get into time there are great dualwield weapons with regard to dps.<br />
<br />
However,Hinterdir was using time gear to suggest that dual wield was 10 pct better dps with regard to the above posts where warriors were clearly talking about pre time gear.Comparable 2 handers are better dps pre time/god generally was my understanding with some very notable standouts that make a big differance.My BOW is far better dps than my bf/boc for example.<br />
<br />
Now personally I'd only worry about my tanking weapons where aggro is the only real concern.It's nice to have my BOW when i'm duoing with my wife though.</div></div><hr />

so yes, GoD is a incredible souce of DPS weapons. Thus before EP we have to look for them lower, and actualy Luclin with the creator and the emperor seams to win this match, but ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point is pre time/god warriors look at 2handers as better dps than 1handers.The differance is often marginal,but,suggesting that 2handers are about 10 pct less dps than comparable 1handers is incorrect with respect to pre GOD/TIME content.<br />
<br />
Given that this statement was made in a blanket style reply to warriors discussing advice about dps aa's in pre ep content it is misleading imo.No offense intended,but, a time warrior giving this kind of advice out of context may give some young warrior the wrong idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should get:<br />

Run speed 5 (15AA) (mobility = good. Not having run speed 5 is like wearing a big sign saying &quot;I'm a n00b!&quot; :p)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre time 2Handers are better.  There is a lack of decent 1H aggro weapons before Time, plus BoW and SEWS are easily accessible.  In PoTime, they're about equal before you can get a DBoW but Vanazir is serviceable.  In GoD, dual wield beats 2H until you can get a Halberd of Endless Pain unless you have absolutely no concern for aggro.  However, the low aggro 2H weapons of GoD are surprisingly good at snap aggro just because ratio is more reliable than hoping you'd proc on a mob that dies in 30 seconds.  Of course if things live any longer than that, you'd want a real weapon instead for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One great benefit of double riposte that is often overlooked is that it works when you use your Furious disc.  With a high damage 2 hander and max double riposte you can easily rip off 15k of damage in the first 15 sec of a fight, basically giving you aggro lock over chain nuking wizards.<br />
<br />
Looking at your magelo now I would suggest maxing endurance so you can cycle evasive disc while being MT during raids.  Healers will &lt;3 you.</div></div><hr />
