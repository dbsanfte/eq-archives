You have a player decked out in the most powerful stuff that is currently available against a target that was antequated two expandsions ago.  Color me not surprised this can be done.<br />

I said it in other places: Time itemization is scewed up!  Yet it somehow the entire class' fault.  Color me not surprised again.<br />

And if it can't beat the HP/Mana regen of a player it doesn't matter does it? ^_^<br />
<br />
According to a post where someone reconstituted the posted log and feed it into a parser, Gorenare was only doing a sustained 66 DPS.  I'm not impressed since exp monsters deal more than this. ^_^  With betabuff the rest of the effects can be resisted.<br />
<br />
So what is the deal here?  Why are people offended (or impressed)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
66 DPS vs a paladin, would equate to 60 DPS to  warrior,<br />
<br />
a warrior could keep slow on him with a ToD, which would reduce his dps to 45 or 30... its too early for me to remember how slow %'s work!....<br />
<br />
given max regen, a 11500 HP warrior.... 10th ring....<br />
<br />
few  heal potions......</div></div><hr />

There will never, ever, be a warrior who soloes gorenaire without extensive heal potions, or in the words of one idiot on the FoH boards, 100 Prayers of Life (5 charges of a 393 heal).<br />

But, idiots are everywhere I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And this is would be the point. <br />
<br />
In order to solo a mob like Gore, the paladin must rely on their defense to keep them alive long enough to kill the mob. Caster classes would use range to avoid the damage use high dps ranged attacks in an attempt to kill the mob before they are killed.<br />
<br />
If what paladins say is true: they have one of the lowest dps scores in the game: then the defensive properties of a paladin would have to be greater than what they would lead others to believe for one to accomplish something like this.<br />
<br />
Oh and Haass FYI: there is a limit to the number of potions one can drink in X amount of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The real point of this all isn't that a paladin can do it and we can't - it's that a paladin can do it and end up at 60% mana, when we would likely die before Gore hit 50%.<br />
<br />
This shows how fucked up itemization has become, and nothing more.</div></div><hr />

To me it just reflects the hollowness of those who argue how balanced we are with our hybrid derivatives: this is NOT something a warrior could do if he/she felt the urge, but a pallie can. And its not even an undead mob so that little self-depreciative argument on the uselessness of their spells and abilities can be tossed as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I do not care if paladins can solo better than me (their so called useless utility grants them this), I just wish most knights would stop lying and saying the only use they have at all is to tank and are useless everywhere else and in all other areas including raids. That a 4k mana pool is next to useless and barely ever used, and if warriors want close to their aggro they should get the exact same defense skills and hp as the pure tank class because well their spells are useless and barely used.<br />

Most  warriors know its bullshit, they know its bullshit.</div></div><hr />

no offense, but pure melee suck balls at soloing, except for monks prenerf they have always sucked at soloing, and they always will suck at soloing....<br />
<br />
While I do think its a little lame gore can be slowed, its just a part of natural progression with gear, it really has no effect on class balance.<br />
<br />
OMG class X can solo Mob Y, they clearly are superior for raids and XP groups....<br />

no they are superior at soloing old content with gear that is 10x better then what was in the game at the time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reads like a laundry list or a top 10 of EXCUSES and RATIONALIZATIONS on why something that's clearly OUT OF BALANCE should remain IN BALANCE.<br />
<br />
Manaburn was nerfed because classes had a stranglehold on content they clearly should NOT have had.<br />
<br />
Gorenaire, since she has EPIC drops on her loot table, and is part of the ACTUAL NATURAL PROGRESSION OF THE GAME, should NOT be soloable by any class.<br />
<br />
Ydelma doesn't drop ST key talisman ... or epic bits ... or quest items. So who really cares.<br />
<br />
But Gorenaire drops quite a few things people in smaller guilds NEED. And if any assinine yahoo can run around soloing her, it wrecks the BALANCE of the game.<br />
<br />
And all of the &quot;It's old content ... warriors shouldn't be able to solo ... monks pre-nerf ... yadda yadda yadda&quot; nonsense needs to be dumped in the wastebasket where it belongs. It has nothing to do with the fact that Gorenaire is content that shouldn't be PIGEONHOLED any worsre than she already is simply because some Plane of Time 12 year old wants to go start farming RBB's and WR bags.<br />
<br />
The solution is obvious, btw ... Nerf Paladins ... or just pull a Vox/Naggy on Gore and some of the other kunark dragons, if they're really THAT trivial for people.</div></div><hr />

It was a pure DPS issue (huge damage in a short amount of time).<br />

I doubt anyone is going to monopolize Gorenaire with a Paladin.  I think someone can KS away since it took them 8 minutes to kill. ^_^</div></div><hr />

Sorry thats bullshit. I was put in my place earlier today by my Knights who informed me that this is all old news. Apparently they have been doing this for months (killing all 3 of the Kunark dragons) and are currently working on soloing Zlandicar. Chances are good the next time Xate heads up against him, Zlandicar will end up dead to a solo Shadowknight. I'm rooting for Xate personally. The sheer atrocity of it all is awe inspiring.</div></div><hr />

Zlandicars max hit is ~315 if I remember right, with his proc/ae trivial to resist at 65, I'm surprised a Knight hasn't already done it. I've heard of enchanters soloing him, though.</div></div><hr />

Are you actually trying to say they cannot? Name the giant and I'll load a Knight up and kill it for you - actually I'll start small with the elementals and work my way up to a Krieger; And if you wanna be a smart ass about it Graal, how bout I take a Shadowknight to Doomfire castle and solo some Level 68 Doomfire protectors. Twisting context around to fit your needs is the real beauty of it all, don't you think? The amount of manipulatioin Knights use to insure their order in the food chain is disgusting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to say this as simply as possible...This is not about being able to solo. The clouds would not open up and shine rays of sunshine down on a warrior who solo's Gorenaire. I dont think anyone really cares about RBB's and white dragon scales. Look beyond that, and you'll see the problem. Soloing is only a sick example of how far out of wack things are.<br />
<br />
 It's about itemization. Guess what? 95% of the best gear for you in the game is also the best gear for me. That gear also has focus effects, mana, mana regen, int, and wis which do jack shit for me. At any point in PoP (and even Luclin, and parts of velious) a knight gains more power comparing apples to apples.<br />
<br />
Don't believe me? Here, I'll even do the research for you. Looking only at Elemental armor, the differences are easy to see. Warriors recieve:<br />
~9% more HP<br />
~10% more AC<br />
~3% more attack<br />
~1% more shielding<br />
<br />
Paladins get 1095mana, 30% healing focus, and 10% mana preservation.<br />
<br />
And this is CLASS SPECIFIC ARMOR. These items are not multi-class like the 'premier' items from tier 5/6. These should be the easiest of the items to balance correctly, yet they still are far too close to be called balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get an equally equipped warrior and have them go try to solo Gore.<br />
<br />
Unless he has 30 of those prayers of life, he's more than likely toast before Gore's at 60%.<br />
<br />
And not everyone in this game is in PoP exp.<br />
<br />
There are some people who's current content consists of epic raids, Fear/Hate/Arena farming, etc.<br />
<br />
And when one of these people can get their paladin friend from the local Time guild, and get all those items when their guild may or may not have done it on their own, there's a problem.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that paladins are now uber soloers, it's just that the fact their saying they can't solo is wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Calm down, take a breath, for God's sake use some punctuation and a spell checker and try it again, Madrone.<br />
<br />
Mana Burn trivialized a lot more than PoP mobs. It was a well-known fact that MB teams were running rampant across Norrath wiping out raid encounters and holding loot hostage (epic loot from those now wussy Kunark dragons included).<br />
<br />
Just to put a little perspective on this debacle, the pally in question was TIME equipped with buffs not available to the Live servers yet.<br />
<br />
Now, what many here are saying, as you'll note from Thaak's post, a warrior in equal equipment with the same buffs could not solo a dragon.<br />
<br />
Raaj examined the problem and offered the itemization explaination. The fact that warrior class specific gear is as unbalanced as it is is a very relavent point. Nothing &quot;made up&quot; about that.<br />
<br />
And I believe that your offer of an elemental equipped warrior and a cleric would be highly unlikely to duo Gore, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A lot of Knights for ages have been saying their utility is next to useless. They use this to justify having significant aggro capabilities over a warrior in POP.<br />
<br />
Someone comes out and posts logs of a very well equiped paladin soloing a dragon.<br />
<br />
The first problem:- The Paladins hit points are ridiculously close to a warriors. This brings up itemisation issues.<br />
<br />
The second problem:- a knight would not be able to do much more than a warrior on Gore if his utility was next to useless.<br />
<br />
What does this mean? It means its about time knights admitted that their utility is a significant attribute to their class, that straight  tanking in exp groups is not the only thing they can do (lets not even bring up their self-professed uselessnes on raids), and that an upgrade to make warriors more desirable to these exp groups compared to where they are now will not crush the knight classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's funny since your original post pretty much did just that, touching on ALL the classic BS rationalizations for keeping something unbalanced the way it is.<br />
<br />
You really think GORENAIRE should be soloable content?<br />
<br />
Please. They made Nagafen and Vox non-soloable content for a reason.<br />
<br />
Not because freakin BLADESTOPPER was so uber. But because it would make the game SUCK if some numnutz, no matter what the class, could just sit there and FARM the DRAGON.<br />
<br />
It's time to do the same to Kunark dragons. They're part of the game. And wiping out on your first few dragon raids, and still having the feeling awe and wonderment as you srape your knees and scab your elbows in your 50s should NOT be ruined by idiots who want to farm haste items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look, once you study the log you see that Gorenaire isn't that tough especially with level resists/adjusts taken into account.  If a Paladin can solo a whole slew of other classes can solo with less effort and faster effect.<br />
<br />
I know that elemental and Time gear shafts Warriors.  I'm still unclear how this even factors in.  If Warrior gear was boosted up or Paladin gear was nerfed down this is probably still doable.<br />
<br />
This is the mountain out of a mole hill.  Forget tanking, forget agro, forget all of that other crap.  The thing I saw in the first run was the ability to sustain recovery at that level for 8 minutes.  Paladins can't push HP like the other healing classes can but if this shows that its possible to stretch out durablity if the monster is weak enough.<br />
<br />
Is this evidence for nerfing?  Not in of itself.  A monster that can only do 70ish DPS isn't that strong.  Many of you can tank a 70 DPS monster without breaking a sweat.  The log also showed that Gorenaire blew a bunch of mana on the first half of the fight.  After she went OOM it was just a matter of wittling her down.<br />
<br />
Should Gorenaire be soloable?  If SOE really didn't want that, why did they leave her out in the open where any L65 player can attack her.  They should either changer her or move her somewhere more &quot;appropriate&quot; (the quotation marks indicate sarcasim ^_^).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are other classes that can solo Kunark dragons.  The point here isn't this class can solo a dragon and that class cannot.  You will never say let's pick a Paladin because if we somehow wiped he can stay behind and solo anything that hits less than Gorenaire.  Likewise Paladins will not suddenly go get super insane XP by soloing random level 60 mobs.  The problems shown by Knights able to solo XYZ is that the '25% caster' part in Hybrids nowadays means 'spells that are nearly as good as the parent class and 90% of the parent class's mana' which is what makes the solo efforts possible.  If the game is balanced, you'd expect Paladin to die at roughly the same point as a Warrior did.  Maybe he will last longer, maybe not.  It's not important who died first as long as the two is close (though Paladins probably should last longer due to LoH).<br />
<br />
Whether some Paladin can solo old content that can be done by almost any 2 similarly high end people is of no concern to the balance of this game.  But the spells and gear that allows the Paladin to do such a thing is a matter of serious concern regarding game balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If warriors were where they logically should be in terms of game balance, then very few warriors would really care about a paladin soloing Gorenaire.  The attitude would be, &quot;Oh, well done, jolly good show Sir Macealot.  Now you've soloed a Kunark dragon you're allowed to wear the special `I soloed a dragon` badge that all the shamans and necros are wearing, and you're allowed to paint a dead dragon on your shield.  Incidentally, Brells wore off, so see to it, k?&quot;<br />
<br />
But warriors aren't where they should be in terms of tanking.  Therefore, paladins crossing a new soloing threshold is a big thing, not in and of itself but because it's another new paladin achievement on top of a lot of others that happened before.</div></div><hr />

Clerics have their shard things. Bards have the Undead Bard that requires you to turn in certain things (that you get back.) Rangers and druids use an alternate version of Venril Sathir which needs an item that only these two classes can summon in order to trigger.<br />
<br />
It is dumb that the warrior epic has not gone through similar treatment so that warriors wanting to do this quest may do so without interferance from profit seekers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins are the only other class that doesn't have any sort of block on interfearance but heck, they can solo Gorenaire for the Frost Book now so maybe this is good for them. There are a bunch of dragons that drop the Burnt Book.</div></div><hr />

Taking a wild leap of faith here and I'm gonna assume you consider yourself decently equipped. <br />

Even though there isn't a defined value set for &quot;decently equipped&quot;, I'd go as far as to say when the majority of your gear is from the bazaar, you aren't quite there. <br />

Velks spiders were easily done at 60 with some ingenuity - tod procs, abusing the fear pathing on walkways and in the lower room on the bottom floor, BP clicks...wasn't really a problem.

Well, I always found spiders in velks easy to solo. Why? Because I'm a monk, and at 58 to 60 my DPS was far superior to most warriors I met in there ... I actually COULD fear a spider ... and I could heal myself rather easily up to full really quickly with mend, BW AA and having less HPs.<br />
<br />
Problem with Velks these days is ... they made the XP per kill worse, and they &quot;fixed&quot; the pathing issues, so you couldn't even hang the spiders up anymore.<br />
<br />
So yah, they &quot;were&quot; easy. Not so much anymore. And I'd recommend finding some other mobs for warriors to solo on. There are still a few out there. But it's drying up fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd guess they've gotten marginally easier&quot;<br />
<br />
They've gotten marginally more difficult, and much less worth the time, imo.<br />

Manaburn wasn't nerfed because of Kunark dragons LOL.   I don't understand why people still believe this insanity.    It was nerfed because PoP mobs have low hitpoints and massive offense, and a bunch of MB wizards could easily negate the offense, and completely trivialize PoP.  <br />
<br />
* Manaburn. In addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large concern in recent months.  The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.<br />
<br />
In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.<br />
<br />
At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that  does not stack with other Manaburns.  The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more frequently than once every minute. <br />
<br />
Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have read different reasons for the nerf, but this one was taken off of SoE's website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelissa</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of the discussion depends on definitions.  Can paladins solo?  Well yes and no.  They can heal themselves, have good mitigation and have limited crowd control abilities.  These abilities go a long ways towards mitigating their mediocre DPS.  Do Paladins solo better than Warriors.  Unquestionably.  Can Paladins solo effectively, as in for reasonable experience gain over time as opposed to a 'better than nothing way to fend off boredom'.  At lower levels, possibly (although less likely now that KEI has been fixed) particularly in old world zones where current equipment is very powerful.  At higher levels maybe, particularly against undead.  There aren't many high-level undead in areas that can be soloed though.  <br />
<br />
Can a 65 level Paladin solo antiquated content that was uber 2 years ago in high-end Elemental/Time gear and with AAs placed in the optimum abilities?  Sure, it's been demonstrated.  Does this in itself make them effective soloists?  No, not by a long shot. <br />
<br />
Should a Paladin last as long in a fight agaisnt Gorenaire as a Warrior?  Without healing, certainly not.  However, since a Paladin can heal themselves, they will definately have an edge against a low-damage (compared to level) mob like Gorenaire.  With LoH added to the formula they can effectively double the advantage they already have.  It's the duration advantage that's killing Gore.   (This is nothing new either, Paladins have always had this advantage, if not to as great a degree as they have it now).   <br />
<br />
It's a cool thing for Paladins.  It does nothing for Warriors.   It says nothing at all about the balance between the two classes.  It's mainly just an example of how powerful high-end gear and AAs can be compared to older content.</div></div><hr />

I'd venture to say any warrior with purely bazaar bought equipment is not by any definition &quot;decently&quot; equipped...  Even if you buy the argument that someone cannot raid with a decent guild for one reason or another (thus meaning the bazaar bought Tank has yet to experience high end content...), it ignores that fact that the plat bought rather than experience bought toon has not ever bothered to complete the numerous worthy questable no-drop warrior goodies out there...   or even some of the decent couple groupable encounters out there...<br />

It takes a long goddamned time to bring it back up XP'ing off shit in droga to fix that.  Once again, i'll get it, i'm just unconcerned with it at the moment.<br />

Why no strength of the elements?  Well see there's this little problem with Phinny on CT, and that is that he drops Bard epic piece, Wizard epic piece, Rogue epic piece, and probably one more that i'm forgetting.

I've got 147 days played on my warrior, and more than that on my shaman, and both were created in '99.  Path of least resistance my ass.  What some of you fail to understand is that there are 2 kinds of people that make the bazaar work...people that buy all their shit in the bazaar and people that SUPPLY the bazaar.  I supply the bazaar.  I made over 600kpp selling Fierce JUST in the first 3 months after it came out.  I made a couple hundred thousand platinum selling Chokidai Hide Spaulders in the bazaar when they were the best tradable shoulders in the game and NO ONE camped the Kennel.  I think I earned the right to buy my Bow, and my boots, and my BoC, and my SoD.  I'm sorry I didn't round up 50 of my online &quot;friends&quot; and kill a god 15 times and get awarded loot.  You play your way, i'll play mine.  As much as you look down on me for buying my gear, I look down on you for being an insignificant piece of the uberguild puzzle.</div></div><hr />

The other epic piece that drops from Phin is the Mage one.    I know this because I killed Phinny so god damned many times for mages that I can make my way to his lair and pull each of the seahorses then Phin while asleep.<br />

The rest of you,<br />

I'm sorry but when the game is fair for ANY god damned class who equipe themselves int he Bazaar, yet ONLY not fair for warriors who do the same, it's a HUGE god damned problem.</div></div><hr />

I used to have to spend hours in EC bartering; now I don't.  Sure if ya look at my magelo I've got some sweet no drop stuff too, but piece for piece I have more droppable gear...<br />

CoM<br />
2xBMoE<br />
Clattering Neck (omg I want to get rid of this)<br />
Grimling Mask<br />
2x Valorium Ring<br />
Horn Spiked Plates<br />
Heavy Rubi Girdle<br />
BoC (which I was awarded not bought)<br />
SBoD<br />
Stonewood Bow<br />
<br />
Now... the fun part... my guild is pretty generous with non raid type things... and us warriors look out for one another mostly.  I've only had to buy: Horn Spiked, Rubi Girdle, Valorium Rings, Grimling Mask... the rest were given (at little to no cost) to me.  Would it make that much difference if Haass had all ornate?  That is no drop but buyable right?  I find it much smarter to be able to buy an ornate BP for 200k than to have to spend the COUNTLESS hours I did in HoT for my myrm BP (OMFG Frod do you remember the torture!!??).</div></div><hr />
