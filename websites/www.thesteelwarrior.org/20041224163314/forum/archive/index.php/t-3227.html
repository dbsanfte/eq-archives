<br />
Had like 30ish people in our pick up raid (well me and a guild basicaly and few others) lost to the low level Ishak the Lost or something whatever the first time, (I only had 1 wiz, my 54 warrio and 65 cleric and chanter) but the 2nd time I log my warr and brought in 4 65 wiz, chanter and cleric, vastly upping our dps... Anyway we kill the mob easy. Then &quot;Ishak the Black&quot; or whatever his name spawn in its place and promplety tore us apart. <br />
<br />
So everyone discussing what we did wrong and a lot say well the MT went down to fast. MT say well I took 7800 damage in 2 seconds... Everyone say mob could not be slowed, and we need a better tank, then raid leader calls it and say we can't win cause our MT does not have Defensive Disc. I say our MT isn't level 55 yet???? He say no we have no warriors just SK's. LOL.</div></div><hr />
