<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so perhaps this would be better posted on the druids board, but I can't stand those guys there so I'll whine to you guys.<br />
<br />
I log in today after about a week of nothing but trader and decide to dust off me druid and go have some fun. I've been leveling my warrior, but he needs some more gear to really progree with effeciency, plus I just plain miss charming and kiting with my druid. I figure, I'm getting a little low on cash and I want to work on my tradeskills a bit so I go to round up fomr tradeskill materials. I head to Mons Letalis to farm for rockhopper hides (it's nicE and quiet there on my server), I get there buff up and head in. I pull up tracking and start hunting down a rockhopper to charm. go left, go right, go striat, go behind..you've lost your tracking target...ok, wtf. I hit track again, same thing, follow the messages...you've lost your tracking target....???!!! ok...hmm<br />
<br />
Now as I'm doing this, i keep getting agro messages even though i dont see any mobs, the mobs don't invis here, but i have soe up anyways so i would see them in any case..stand still a while...nothing hits me, maybe it's a bug. hit tracking again, same deal, i give up and start searching the hard way, i find a lonely hopper looking for a friend and we get aquainted with each other and me and him start looking for his pals, bingo i found another. snare, /pet attack, /sit, /yawn...charm breaks, how annoying. run, run, run, turn, cast charm..bam, he's right behind me..jeez, repeat, same deal. OK, stand there, channel charm, /pet attack, /sit..notice yet more empty agro messages... you have slain a mature rockhopper, i run over to loot, bam...red damage message scrolling like crazy. health bar looking aenimic, holy shit...where'd all these mobs come from. No time to channel evac, run run run, as i do that I more my view (i play 3rd person), theres like atleast 15 mobs on me, wth!! run run run, crap still getting hit (yes i have sow) run run run....notice as I run, mobs just keep warping along with me, wth, bard speed mobs? LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
/gu any clerics available?<br />
<br />
OK, i get a SK friend to summon my corpse to zoneline (i think the mobs were all under the world and were getting killed by the geometry or fall damage because of the high mob turn over i was seeing on track, i did a /who and no one else was in zone, the mobs don't agro each other so that was the best explaination i could some up with.) and cleric rezzes, port back to pok and take an extended afk. after /bug ofcourse<br />
<br />
OK, so maybe it's just the rough terrain that is causeing the problem. NP, i can just go play in other zones. I decide to check out the xp in natimbi and work on some aaxp charming hynids. I find a pet and start killing cragbeasts, ok, this is fun, pretty good xp...this is why i love my druid. EQ is fun again if only briefly. Shit charm breaks, run run run, cast charm, bam, right behind me again...jeez, this is totally flat group here, wth, buffed hynid breaks charm + can't run = LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
/gu any clerics available for rez?<br />
/who cle...<br />
/t cleric_01 could i get a rez in natimbi, i can port there and back.<br />
cleric_01 tells you, sorry no expansion.<br />
<br />
/who all cle...<br />
<br />
ok, so no cleric available, i just go loot my body and mess around while /who in zone. while waiting I get attack by some mob, np, i can kite most anything in this zone..so long as it's snared (snare=no warping so far), kill loot some aligned ore...notice my corpse dissappear 50 feet away, mobs body stay right where it's at...wtf, click corpse again, hey more loot, wtf<br />
<br />
OK, so somehow EQ client gets it in its head that i want to loot my body 50 feet away instead of the mob corpse right under my cursor...right, ok, someone's been smoking something. Now I'm 57, i lost my level when i died and now I'm 4-5 hours xp away from 58 (important level for a druid becasue we get our first big heal)...very pissed now, /camp<br />
<br />
Now i'm not sure if I shoould be pissed at myself or SOE, but damn, that was definitely NOT FUN in my book. It's hard to justify playing when everything you want to do in the game is bugged to all hell.<br />
<br />
I've dont the Katta loyalist shied quest 3 times with my warrior already, each time the vah shir goes poof after I kill him because I can question him. Petitioned each time and GM just say they can't give me the quest tem from him so I have to redo it each time from the beginning, which as you guy know isn't much fun with a pet porter around to take you to SH and back.<br />
<br />
I just needed to vent guys, feel free to whine along with me, call this the OFFICAL &quot;I&quot;M SO PISSED&quot; WHINE THREAD.</div></div><hr />
