Basically just looking for some actual data so I can get a definitive answer, sick of argueing with people &quot;agi is important, you avoid more with it!&quot; and &quot;I proc a ton with maxed dex,&quot; without any parses to direct them to.  Basically what I've always thought was both stats are pretty much useless with maybe a very slight increase, but it would be nice to see some parses if anyone can dig some up.<br />
<br />
Also I know about the 2 proc per minute on most weapons(procs based off delay or whatever), just would like to see a parse with low dex vs high dex and if it modifies the procs per minute.  There was a post about procs in the library but none had to do with dex testing really.<br />
<br />
Also two other quick questions while I'm at it, can you proc on a riposte and can you proc on a flurry, not sure how it would work since I'm guessing they're based of 0 delay obviously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The AGI stat increases the AC a bit but it seems to me the AGI level ratio to AC is not all that red hot.<br />
<br />
Buffed and aug'd by armor .... I see better results on DEX -vs- AGI.<br />
<br />
I have no parse on this or &quot;hard&quot; numbers.<br />
<br />
Anyone else? <br />
<br />
*just going by my experience so far*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes agi has a minimal increase on AC, 1ac per 6agi or something small like that.  Problem is most of the stuff you can't just eye since avoidance/proc rates can be streaky at times but they usually average out to the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azunias</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Bulbog<br />
<br />
The DEX ratio factor for the crit/proc's is very flaky. Kinda like AD&amp;D paper chasing. <br />
<br />
It's all a random roll.<br />
<br />
But I have noticed that the DEX that's aug'd and buffed, in combinitaton with the dam/delay weapon(s) in your hands does in fact run a better chance of crit/proc than unbuffed. <br />
<br />
**I need to do a few LDoN's to add an augment and test this theory**<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
**edit** I have proc'd ONCE on a ripotse ... although it may have been a fluke. Flurry I have no idea ... but i se no reason why not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, some people with 305 dex and more of the offensive aa's that add more swings are up over 2ppm, and when I do my parsing with 175 dex unbuffed, I sit at around 1.8 or so PPM.  So yes, Dex does have an effect, albeit a very small one.<br />
<br />
Agility is the same way.  It does have an effect by directly increasing your AC by a small amount, but likewise, you need a huge chunk of agi to add any appreciable benefit.</div></div><hr />

I remember Brad saying how Dex and Agi were important stats to rogues and a lot of rogues rerolled with high dex and agi... only to find out later...<br />

If two items had the same ac/hp then if one added more agi and/or  dex it was better. Now though, you should consider the effect of dex and agi on endurance as well.

<br />
I assume you are dual weilding procing weapons or have 2 procs on one weapon. Or possibly you are using one of the special weapon with a more frequent proc.. whatever agro weapont hat one is...<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you are producing far more procs than any other level 65 warrior with 305 DEX out there.<br />

I have an avatar procy and swap it in for the proc and use my BBB the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
As for AGI, I have a feeling that it helps make Dodge/Parry/Riposte activate more often, it also apparently increases your endurance bar which is a nice side effect too. I can use Incite every single pull and not have my end drop at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarn_Rider</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will forever take Dex over Agility. This comes from my history of my Ranger Main.<br />
<br />
I've begun building myself as a Warrior to have considerable Dex so that I can proc more. I have no parses or what not, but two years of playing a ranger has shown me just how important Dex can be with procs and crits and such.<br />
<br />
Even soloing in DSP, I've had a Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic &amp; CHoS each proc 2-3 times a fight.<br />
<br />
Especially with the orb, get one proc a fight and it made for pretty efficient Warrior soloing up through the teen's 20's and early thirties so far.<br />
<br />
Dex will always be important for me if I'm using Procing weapons, which will most likely be forever. /chuckle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy fucking shit. People still believe DEX has a significant affect on proc rates??? Didn't we coves this in a thread like 45 pages long?<br />
<br />
Let me try a Haass impression ...<br />
<br />
Pull your heads out of your asses. We have conclusive parses that prove that weapons other than a few special high proc weapons parse out at 2 procs/minute with 305 DEX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes .. at 305 DEX.<br />
I think you re-answered most people here.<br />
<br />
What they don't know is how big the difference is on .. say .. 100 DEX and your 305 DEX. That might be significant, though personally, I'm guessing the differance is about 0.5 PPM between those two DEX values. I would be really surprised if the difference was bigger than that.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if you are over 200 with standard buffs (like Harnessing of Spirits or something like that), I doubt you will see any big difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is basically what the stats do for a warrior :<br />
<br />
STR is nice to carry items and do a teeeeeeeny tiny little bit better DPS. Gives small bonus to Blacksmithing. Partly governs Endurance pool.<br />
<br />
DEX gives a small bonus to proc rates and helps how fast you get skill ups with offensive weapon skills. Small bonus to Fletching I think ? Partly governs Endurance pool.<br />
<br />
AGI gives a bit on the AC side, but the effect is small indeed. It also governs how fast you get skill ups with defensive skills. Partly governs Endurance pool.<br />
<br />
STA is good, you should know why already. Partly governs Endurance pool.<br />
<br />
INT / WIS is good for tradeskills in general, whichever one is the highest. Fletching and Smithing excepted afaik.<br />
<br />
CHA is good for Divine Intervention and shopping prices.<br />
<br />
Any stat under 75 (human baseline) gets a severe penalty.<br />
Any stat at 100 or higher gets a REALLY small bonus to aforementioned skills.<br />
Same bonus seems to apply at 125, 150, 175 ... etc .. but the increments are so small it have been hard for anyone to document them.<br />
<br />
Shamans have done a LOT of parsings on stat buff effects and generally found them ... useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Summa Summarum :<br />
-HP &amp; AC is still your biggest worry.<br />
-STA gives HP, so it's nice.<br />
-Resist are important, especially if you raid.<br />
-All other stats are pretty much insignificant.</div></div><hr />

Ya guys, this isn't open for fucking debate here.  We know this to be true.  The guys who are telling you that stats are pointless contributed to the data that helped draw the conclusions.  You're just coming here with anecdotes that don't prove shit.  We know what we know, we're trying to tell you what we know, and you're arguing with us about it.</div></div><hr />

DEX does in fact effect proc rates.  Granted i have 3 procs getween my weapons and self buffs, i have parsed a difference in DMG done.  Using CHoS and Sword of the Blood sworn, along with my Call of Sky, i do about 75 dps with my unbuffed 196 dex, and with 255 dex, i am doing on average 85 dps.  seems like a vast improvement to me.<br />
<br />
All tests were done on a 57 Ranger in PoV.  And yes I did tank those mobs.  Hurt like a beyotch but i did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loredena</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug  I suspect it's a curve, and perhaps there are even some class dependencies, certainly there are weapon dependencies.  When the clerics were given their new summoned hammer and yaulp, the devs specifically stated that the dex modifiers were to further up the proc rate.  Which is also weapon-dependent, with the proc rate on the summoned hammers being rather high.  As someone who is not yet 65, and therefor with far from maxed dex, I see an appreciable difference in proc rate as I get my dex buffed.   I am inclined to think there are 'jump' points at the lower ranges, and possible a hard cutoff point past which no difference is made.  (As a reference -- it's been shown that there are 2 cutoff points for the impact charisma has on prices, past which no difference is found.   110 and 130 I think.  It would not surprise me if similar cutoffs are in place for other stats).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From Derrict's post at http://www.eqbeastlord.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=10317&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=50<br />
<br />
&quot;Procs also increased with 80 more dex and 335 higher attack.<br />
50dd lifetap proc went from 1 proc every 57.475 sec to 39.41, 50-100dd proc dropped from 51.95 sec to 34.6 sec, 125dd proc went from 108.18 sec to 91.58 sec. I wasn't doing the parsing for proc rate so I'll have to do another controlled parse set to remove the attack variability; I'll probably do this once I'm able to max my str w/o relying on buffs so that I can keep the attack at a constant while raising my dex with frenzy / IoS / dexterity.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's looking to me like a fairly sizeable improvement in proc rate.  Don't know the size of his parse, of course; but the fact that the proc rate improved for all three different procs makes me suspect that we're not just looking at a statistical fluke here.<br />
<br />
I'd welcome some actual parses, though, if anyone's done some.  All I've seen on this thread so far is competing &quot;But everybody *knows* DEX has [no|a huge] effect!  The parses have been done!&quot;<br />

P.S. Me?  I max my DEX on general principles, just because I can.  Does it make a difference?  I haven't done the parse, so I won't even venture a guess.  But I'm pretty sure it doesn't hurt.  :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The parses were done a long ass time ago and have been lost to the ages of switching messageboards and whatnot.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to see parses, I suggest you do them if you don't want to take the people who did see them's word for it.</div></div><hr />

DEX  Small bonus to Fletching I think ?<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Just a minor note here...<br />
<br />
You have the tradeskills and stats linked correctly there, Anker.  However, they don't give &quot;small&quot; bonuses.  Those stats are actually used as the primary stat for those tradeskills, if they are higher than either your Int or Wis stats.  (which of course they are for any melee).  Therefore, if any warriors want to do tradeskills, which more and more are doing now with quests such as Aid Grimel, then make sure your Str is maxed for smithing, and your Dex for fletching.  Currently, those are the only 2 tradeskills that use a stat other than Int or Wis as the main stat, and the stats listed are the only ones they use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While not directly related to the question of Dex vs. proc/general DPS...<br />
<br />
While I agree the added direct DPS is big whoopty-do, to me those extra 5 procs are very nice, and very worthwhile.  One of those procs might be the one that keeps a mob pinned on me instead of pasting the cleric or slower or whichever other &lt;insert squishy class here&gt; group member.  So to me, Dex is definitely worth maxing if possible.  So if an extra proc or 2 keeps that mob standing where it's supposed to be, in front of me and the other melee, instead of running all over the room chasing a caster, then that bit of extra dex has actually increased DPS significantly.</div></div><hr />

i use spiked velium mallet/short sword of ykesha most times but if i'm not MT i'll often switch to my 2hb (can't rem name) which procs 96. for those who don't know about the mallet and sword they proc respectively 120/75. my base dex is 122 geared no buffs.both weapons proc pretty good at that lvl but when i have HoS+dexterity on me that puts my dex well over 230 and my procs seem to come more often...i don't have any conclusive evidence from testing or &quot;parsing&quot; (pardon my weak vocabulary) but i support the claim that the more dex the more procs/crits you will score.<br />
<br />
having said that i should also say that your skill in the weapon class (1hb 1hs 2hs 2hb pierce) makes a difference too as my 2hb proced good at a skill of 101 but does much better now at 150+ with same base dex of 122 geared...so perhaps a combination of the dex and your weapons skills will make procs come more often.(ok that made me sound like a freaking noob stating the obvious)<br />

anyways i would say more and further prove my ignorance but i have to get back to the game and max the rest of my skills :) have fun all!</div></div><hr />

Of course doing another parse would be nice, but proc rate parses are necessarily a lot of work, so don't hold your breath hehe.  A big change, like +100 dex on avatar, will make a difference in your proc rate, but not a huge one.<br />
<br />
Get dex when you can, but don't give up any ac or hps for it.<br />
<br />
And hot damn you guys totally deserve a parse rainbow for some of these posts, but I am to lazy to do it today so you get off easy 8)  There is just no way that you can tell the difference between a weapon that is averaging a proc every 35 seconds and one that is averaging a proc every 40 seconds on a very streaky RNG unless you do a very long parse, so no offense, but your 'feeling' that a weapon is proccing more or less is, in a word...worthless.</div></div><hr />

At 129 DEX proc rate is around 1 ppm<br />
At 209 DEX proc rate is around 1.5 ppm<br />
At 305 DEX proc rate is around 2 ppm<br />

It is pretty safe to say that you get .5 ppm for every 100 DEX, which is hardly anything to write home about. You should not be sacrificing HP or AC for DEX.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You take a big hit in AC when AGI drops under 80.<br />
<br />
Also, when your HPs drop to a certain percentage of total, I don't recall exactly what the percentage is but it might be where you go berserk, your AGI goes down by a third.  <br />
<br />
So, when fighting, it's helpful to have your AGI at 120 or more.  That way, if it gets cut by a third, you're still at 80 or more, and you don't take the AC hit.  <br />
<br />
In practical terms, that's meaningless to your average overlord, but for lower level warriors it's important, because you want to make sure you keep your AGI above that magic number (buffed).</div></div><hr />

But my question is this:<br />
<br />
If Proc Rate is an item database variable, did Sony/VI get super lazy and have all weapons but those three have the same proc rate?<br />
<br />
Is it unreasonable to think that different weapons possibly have different proc rates? Or is it the contention that there is simply a flag. Proc_Craploads= [Yes/No]<br />

Very useful info on this thread.<br />

The dex vs proc info still seems pretty conclusive, but was there info on Dex vs Crits?</div></div><hr />

Slight correction. The magic number is 75.</div></div><hr />

Nah, that's a minor infraction, you'll prolly only get an elbow to the base of your skull.  He's reasonable that way.</div></div><hr />

With that being said, you can trust quite a few people on this board (Wandor, Haass, Brutul, Splaktar, Sscaley, et al) when they speak about parse inf0z.</div></div><hr />

Or is it the contention that there is simply a flag. Proc_Craploads= [Yes/No] <br />
<br />
I would wager that there is probably a proc rate flag in the item database, and that there was simply a default value for every weapon up to Luclin.  It stands to reason that during the design of luclin, the dude working on Ssra decided to tweak his items a little bit by modifying the proc rate on a few of them.  Think about it...the Blade of Carnage was the top end warrior weapon from Velious, but what really is the difference between that and a Bloodfrenzy?  1 damage, a couple of hit points, it's certainly nothing to excited about for sure.  Modify the proc rate so that you're generating more hate per minute, and you definitely have something that warriors would want...and they do.<br />

I'm also guessing that guy left in the mass exodus that happened when SoE took over creative control of Verant, and that's why there haven't been any since.</div></div><hr />
