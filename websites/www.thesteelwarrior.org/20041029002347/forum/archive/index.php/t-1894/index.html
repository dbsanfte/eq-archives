<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a FYI for your guilds since this will not affect warriors. As of July 10th you can no longer cast through walls in Hate they are real walls now. But as this is somewhat of a detriment to casters it is a bonus to groups in the fact that mobs no longer seem to aggro through walls so navigating hate is a bit easier now :)<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s I even spell checked this post :) although I doubt it is gramatically correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure that had anything to do with Hate but maybe. Seems some spells that used to not be Line of sight were made LOS with the patch. Malo is the main one I know was changed as I was using it to pull with my shaman in PoV as usual when I got the message about can not see target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It may be part of SoE going through and making sure spells that should be LoS are. in hate any spell could be cast through walls LoS did not apply there now it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Um there is a general change to LOS for any detremental spell.  Stop saying its a &quot;small change to hate&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um there is a general change to LOS for any detremental spell. Stop saying its a &quot;small change to hate&quot;.<br />

Ok obviously you are missing the point let me explain in simple terms.<br />
<br />
1. Before july 10th you could nuke mobs through walls IE if the mab was in a building and you did not have los you could directly nuke it and make it come out after you.<br />
<br />
2. After july 10th this no longer applies you have to be able to see the mob to nuke it.<br />
<br />
Thus it is a small change to hate and liek I said on the positive side mobs no longer seem to aggro through walls in hate.<br />
<br />
any questions?<br />
<br />
<br />
(any otehr changes made to LoS I do not know about and am not trying to talk about hence my subject as this applies only to hate that i know of it was the only zone where LoS did not apply to my knowledge)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was made to PoP zones as well. Like Aeka said, the new zones that didn't check LoS now do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was made to PoP zones as well. Like Aeka said, the new zones that didn't check LoS now do.<br />
<br />
That may be but like I said I have no kowledge of any chage other then what I posted.<br />
<br />
I do not fight in PoP no reason to when I can kill certain mobs in Hate for 11% aa exp a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Read somwhere that all zones are flagged 'indoor' or  'outdoor'.    'Outdoor' LOS isn't checked cause the area is considered open, 'Indoor' walls are solid etc. SoE have tended to go on reflagging spree's so that many outside zones are now considered 'indoor' they had a new spree this patch. PoHate is one of those affected. I know you don't like him but find a proper reason to spread the Apothes hate hey?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually when Pohate B went live it was flagged indoor and LoS still was not checked so they must have done somethjing different to make LoS work there.<br />
<br />
and the outdoor stuff I did not know thanks for the info too bad it's fixed now hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe the zones since PoP didn't check LoS, even the indoor ones like CoD. The new PoH was evidently made the same way. This has been rectified, though it seems that the LoS changes are all messed up and people are having trouble casting on mobs if there is even a small bump in the terrain between them.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this will make it easier to dodge some AEs in PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even the old PoH did not have LoS but it was flagged ouotdoor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1. All of the new zones and all of the PoP zones now enforce LoS rules - indoor and outdoor. If a mob is behind a hill, you can't cast on it.<br />
<br />
2. This DOES NOT effect mob AE. In outdoor zones, AE will stall land through a wall.<br />
<br />
Overall, this change sucks ass.</div></div><hr />
