Correct or is he talking out his ass?</div></div><hr />

Also, it keeps those stat foods there, and you don't have to force feed yourself so often.</div></div><hr />

A stack of Grobb Liquidized meat, and 10lb meat pies lasts forever now. I bought my last stack on may 21st and I still have 2 of each left.

<br />
I use grobb drink and halas pie.  They are both consumed at the exact same rate.   I am almost positive that innate metabolism works for all food/drink.</div></div><hr />

Halas meat pies..3pp in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

What does that take y'all, like 10 mins to make?Well considering I have like nothing worthwhile left to work on aa wise I figured i'd test it out. Stir fry's dont grow on trees ya know. :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does not take any flags or special containers to make the Bristlebane's Platter.  Only the Bucket of Crab Legs requires access to zone that a level 65 can't get to by just being level 65.  <br />
<br />
It's certainly within the reach of your joe average level 65 gamer (provided you have the baking skills), as long as you know someone in elemental planes that can provide you with the Bucket of Crab Legs, and the Crab Legs aren't exactly a closely guarded commodity (but not too common either)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol i had a look at the subcombines for the bristlebanes, sheesh its as long as my arm. dont think im gonna be trying that anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">metabolism? youre kidding right?<br />
<br />
eating stat foods means one thing - SOE slipped item decay into the game and the playerbase is fine with it.  item decay sucks.  Screw stat food.  screw buying aa's to make stat food suck less.<br />
<br />
iron rations for life, baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't have it, you'll think it's a bit of a waste. Once you get it, it'll be one of your favorite AA purchases <br />
<br />
Aeryl put it perfectly =p<br />
<br />
Even with iron rations it helps, you simply don't have to carry as many on you, nor have to restock near as often.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'll take any hps I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlea</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that as soon as I get a stack of Tormentor Stir Fry I'll invest 3 points into Metabolism. Sure, when you carry Halas Pie with you it's no problem, that stuff is sold for cheap in bazaar everywhere. But once you use food that you can't just go out and buy but have to go farming items yourself for, you'll look at it different and value this &quot;useless&quot; AA high.</div></div><hr />
