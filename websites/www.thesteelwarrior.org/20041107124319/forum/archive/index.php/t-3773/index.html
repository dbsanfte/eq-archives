<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyxander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&quot;We are also working on removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh.  I have forage bound to a movement key as well, on my ranger character.  Can I have 200 of that at creation, please?<br />
<br />
Damnit.  Knew I should have waited a couple weeks to start my new chanter character.  Then I wouldn't have to wade through<br />

<br />
Is this a joke?  Because you can map a movement key to it they throw in the towel on a nice piece of n00bie hazing functionality?  <br />
<br />
Next thing they will say is because you can double box that everyone will just get +100aas because you'd get them anyway and they don't want to inconvenience you.</div></div><hr />

Cry me a river, pansies.  Dwarves better get some cool shit in return for them nerfing one of our advantages, 50 sense heading. Yah, thats right! +50 to hp, all stats, ac, and 50k plat. Seems fair 'nuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dammit, I got carpal tunnel hitting that damn key back when I started.  Don't even know if you could map to movement keys back then.  If we could I was a clueless n00b anyway.  But I don't know if that would have helped me when I was trying to find my way out of FP the very first day :p.  That and Kelethin, I still find myself looking down in that city.  Can you say splat?  But I think the most lost and scared I've ever been was my first time in DL.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The most lost and scared for me was when I was 25 (24, 25, 24, 25...) and was heading to Kunark for the first time. I got thrown off the shuttles, spent the next half hour swimming around looking cluelessly for any land at all.<br />
<br />
Then, just as I find Ogre Island, I get told by a GM that yes, the bloated belly will take me to Firiona Vie. Lies! But I believed them, being a good little newbie.<br />
<br />
After a couple of rounds on the barge, I jumped ship in OT, ran visible through hostile territory all the way to FV where my friend was meeting me. I got within /yell distance of my friend just as a swarm of those goddamn drachnids slaughtered me.<br />
<br />
I ended up having to run all the way back, but at least the second time I didn't miss the boat (Didn't miss the boat, but Vekis spawned just as I was looting my corpse and skinned both my friend and me.). :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They say the memory is the first thing to go you know.  The most lost and scared I've ever been was the first time I tried to go to SolB when I was 35.  The run through Neriak with all the guards on my back.   Not sure how far I got before I found myself back in good ole WFP.  2nd time I made it to Lava.  However, I zoned into Najena instead and didn't realize it.  Again, I found myself back in good ole WFP.  3rd time I fell into the lava pit.  Beginning to hate good ole WFP.  4th time I made it and there was much celebration and thanksgiving, until I got lost somewhere around upper bugs.... I really did hate good ole WFP at that point.  When I finally got to the tiger room, I was told I was the puller.  You get the picture. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">*sigh* more helmets and elbow pads for the newbies. so much for stumbling around a bit and actually learning more of the terrain than the straight line from zone to zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As much as I enjoy having the map function of LoY, I think the game would be a bit more challenging and have more potential to weed out dumbasses that can't find their way to Maidens Eye at level 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe make it work only in cities or something, so that it actually helps a noob out.. but make their sense heading skill lower the the number at which I value the steaming brown logs that come out of my behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heck, I zoned into Plane of Fear and Plane of Mischief and got &quot;Mapping not available in this zone&quot; instead of even an arrow on a blank screen. They can do that with the rest of the zones if they felt like it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Binn, I don't think I want to know how high/low that number is. Just finish up and remember to wash your hands. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Aren't those n00b memories the best?<br />
<br />
I remember on my very first character and my whole world consisted of 5 zones: the 3 zones of Neriak (I was a DE cleric), Nek forest and Lavastorm mountains (which I had zoned into once by mistake/curiousity only to leave a corpse and recieve a premature trip back to bind.<br />
<br />
I was happily bashing away at black bears and skeletons at about level 7 when I received a tell;<br />
 <br />
&quot;can you cure disease?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ummm, I don't know&quot;<br />
<br />
Cos spells were real expensive to someone who's fortune was made selling fire beetle eyes to vendors and I had only bought the ones I thought were essential.<br />
<br />
&quot;we need someone who can cure disease so we can go to befallen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well I'd never heard of Befallen, but you play this game to adventure and have fun etc so I ran back to my guild and sold up my current haul of rat ears, snake skins and rusty weapons so I could afford cure disease and then headed back into Nek.  The group had someone meet me at the bridge as that was the furthest I had ever travelled.<br />
<br />
The trip from Nek through EC, across WC and to Befallen as to have been the scaryest and the most awe inspiring moment I have had in EQ.  All of a sudden the world seemed huge and was filled with so many things to be afraid of.  One of the people in my group told me that because I was an Inny worshiping Dark elf all the FP militia guards would want to kill me so I was on an intense look out for guards as well as young kodiaks (I had already had a fatal encounter with one of these), orcs and lions.<br />
<br />
To be honest tho, I don't think I would have found that experience any less intense or less nerve racking if I had my sense heading skill maxed and a compass to follow.  I think this thread is the equivilent of my stepfather telling me how when he went to school he had to get up at 6am to catch his horse, saddle it and then ride to school in the snow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh, <br />
<br />
<br />
I loved my first 1-30 levels or so on my first 3 characters (not all of which made it past 10). Not knowing where &quot;orc lift' was in kelethin, hell not even knowing that kelethin and the area outside felwithe was the same. Not knowing how to get to orc hill, getting directions and dying... or to get to EC. <br />
<br />
I remember taking my beastlord on a trip from halas to freeport once. That was scarey... I'm so freaking lucky I didn't die in ... uh, any of the zones. Especially kith forest, glad I crossed in the day time!<br />
<br />
Learning your way around the game, and how to navigate is an essential skill to learn in everquest I belive. Some people belive that discipline through backhand slapping, or getting down in a push-up position is a good way to punish though, so while I think that this idea is, as my previous statment stated &quot; a pile of steaming crap&quot; I'll go along with it. I'll probably be done playing before any of em have the blessing to group with me ;)</div></div><hr />

Getting sense heading up gave me something to do while I was staring at my spellbook back on my old druid, but you don't have to look at the spellbook anymore either (thank God).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I just do sense heading while using kick or taunt.  After a while I developed a rhythm to hit those that I started sense heading even when it's already maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Maps cause more newbs than this sense heading thing will.  Though, since previous to this, you couldn't get max sense heading until 40 right?  I think they should leave sense heading as is, and make maps not even work until you're at 200 skill in it, except in cities.  Having it this simple to get through, and making leveling so much easier, it's just really too bad that newbs don't get to do more of the adventure that we did.  Really, that was some of the most fun I ever had, even though at times it was very frustrating, in the end I felt like I had accomplished something.  Instead of all these people who think that everything should be given to them on a silver plater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Newbie moments, hmm Started in freeport, got a couple of levels, got a few neat little cast offs from a couple of 'probably female' wood elves that i bantered with (back when EQ was about Roleplaying! :p). <br />
<br />
So anyway, i decided to get drunk to celebrate my good fortune, went into tassels tavern and splashed out some of my hard earned gold on some Elven wine. Got smashed, had the tunnel effect and all that, thought it was massively funny, wandered down to the docks in East freeport and see a ship  come in. <br />
<br />
Didn't know where the heck it went, but, being 'drunk' i thought what the hey and stumbled aboard. We set sail! LOADING PLEASE WAIT....Entering The Ocean of Tears.<br />
<br />
 Cool, sea as far as the eye could..see. So anyway, lessee whats below, still pissed, careful on the stairs, below there is... nothing , oh well. Run back up the stairs, wobbled too far to the left... Aaahhh! *Splosh*.<br />
<br />
Shit! i can't swim, come back! The ship sails off into the distance and here I am stuck, waiting to drown. Ok try to turn through 180 degrees from the ships course and maybe i can swim back through the zone in. I swim back the way i 'think' i came watching nervously as my stamina bar drops, when it reaches zero will I stop swimming and drown?!? Everytime it gets low i seem to get another point of swim skill and my stamina bar seems to boost slightly! Much prayer ensues. <br />
After 5 minutes that seem like an eternity, swiming through a twilight sea, I see an island! With huts and lights upon it! Civilisation! i made it! <br />
<br />
Drag myself out of the water and cautiously approach the huts in the dead of night - ok that's good, there is a pier, but does any ship dock there? I could swear my ship won't cause i would've seen the island wouldn't I on the trip out? Getting hungry so i go into one of the huts, nice looking wood elf shop keeper, she seems to like me, not much in the way of food on her though.<br />
<br />
 As i'm making conversation (I was bored, sue me :p) some bastard runs through the wall and starts hitting me! Ack red con, i'm soo dead, try to run for the pier - if i die there maybe i can find my body later. Turn to face him and make my last futile stand on the pier.. LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br />
<br />
<br />
I never did find my corpse, chalked it up to experience and didn't set foot on a boat for another 10 levels :p Only much later did i learn i had died on Sister island, killed by one of those bastard pirates, first stop for the boat from Freeport. <br />
<br />
DOH! :D<br />
<br />
Despite it all, exploring something when you are so new and clueless is probably an experience i will never beat in EQ, it's fun to remember the 'good old days' when class balance, damage ratios and mechanics didn't rule the world :)</div></div><hr />

I could sort of see having it apply to indoor zones differently, but since they didn't do that, they might as well get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

I just got a chuckle out of those really.  The way this game is ran just reminds me of many companies I have worked with.  I am quitting though.
