<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, How has 2003 affected everyone in Everquest?<br />
<br />
Seems out of all the new expansions that have crossed paths with our logins; and new zones we've all become accompanies with.... I think 2003 has brought a small ray of sunshine to the Warrior Class.<br />
<br />
It seemed Late winter/early spring here finally took us away from the EZBoard beast; and witht he help of sHORTY and Raaj found us a new little niche here on our own terms; with most of the old gang coming along plus gaining some new faces as well.<br />
<br />
I for one am glad to see how this community has thrived over the years; nevermind my horrendous postcounts number; and I still fondly think back when I myself was a n00b over at the old boards and getting beat_down by Ganzo; hearing about how the Half Elf Conspiracy(tm) was still in it's infancy being led by Jaikar and Adex.......and Xexys spilling juice all over his Keyboard and typing god-knows-what......and to really show my age here at TSW, How Vanzandt decided one fine patch day back in Kunark to take his wurmslayer; wrap it up real tight with bandages, and stick it in the nether-regions of EQ's collective gluteus maximus....<br />
<br />
What Memories.<br />
<br />
Back on topic though. Come September or so; we were informed for the (x) number of time that SoE was goign to try for 'Melee Balancing'...oh how our ears bled at those very words....<br />
<br />
The funny part was...come December...They came True. <br />
It was incredible. Thansk to our rather large and often explicitally vocal community and with help from our Plate Hybrid buddies :D ; things actually might have been considered and with help from our Test Server Players here plus everyone else who got a try to go over and try out what SoE planned for us, the Ball started Rolling.<br />
<br />
And Roll, it did.<br />
<br />
Now; we're fresh into 2004; and the Warrior class has recieved quite the breath of fresh-air; from the ones here who played there Warrior since the Early Days of EQ when there were only 6 hotkeys; right down to the six-boxxing ( hehe ) abominations who god only knows how continue to keep the warrior class on the map.<br />
<br />
So, to all my fellow Warriors and Warrioresses whom deal out death and destruction firsthand and; as my friends fondly say, &quot;Tanking it in teh Face!!&quot;...lemme just say thanks for all the hard work you've all put in; and continuing to go forward and helping shape the future of EQ and all the young Warriors who decided one day that they themselves want to share in the pride and glory of being the one who stand tall in the heat of battle with nothing but the armor on your back and whatever weapon you got in your hand.<br />
<br />
We sure moved forward this past year. Let's keep the ball moving and showing pride in who we are; and what we can do no matter what adversity stands before us. We're Warriros. We can take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Everquest is dying I am starting to see this everyday andthe people at SOE don't care about it anymore and it is so obvious that they don't.  They let criminals profit from their game, such as Yantis and IGE that use hack, bugs and exploits to make a profit.    Why hasn't SOE shut down sites such as www.playerauctions.com www.IGE.com or www.mysupersales.com that so blatently go against the EULA that it is not funny.  Now Yantis is buying up serverboards so he can make a profit from selling our email addresses to the Email AD spammers so he can make more money.  Why hasn't SOE make a case against Yants and others and force them out of bussiness. Why are they letting these people ruining thier game.  Why aren't they taking legal action against people selling SOE property (EULA States that items, coins and characters are property of SOE/Verant).  This by far has had a biggest impact on the game in 2003, no expansion ever came close to the greed of certain people.<br />
<br />
That is my 2cp<br />
<br />
Edit-not what shik meant but still it effected EQ on whole.<br />
edit^2-I am a illeraite bastard child of retard monkies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cheers Shik,<br />
<br />
Nice post and happy new year. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Liquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Selling email addresses?<br />
<br />
Ur an idiot</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ur an idiot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I've been suffering Steel Warrior withdrawal the past several weeks. Went to the temporary site, it was never up and by chance I found our old URL working. It's like a late Christmas present for me!!!<br />
<br />
We have seen a lot of change over the past year. LDoN made a big impact. The level of  item available to the non-raider has improved. It's almost like Norrath has a new culture in it. <br />
<br />
The new Combat Abilities do help. They are not unbalancing. I am anxious to see what the second phase will bring.  <br />
<br />
And for me, now that I have reached level 65, I've started the AA quest and going back and doing some old quests I had let slide.  I've gotten the opportunity to work on elemental flagging and the experiences are awesome!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Liquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes isk the only reason they buy sites like this is for email addresses, not the thousands of dollars plat sales make.<br />
<br />
Buy a clue chief</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The site is not being bought.<br />
<br />
Let's get this back on topic. This was a hard year but turned out to be crazy good for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They let criminals profit from their game<br />
<br />
Violating an EULA is not a criminal act.  It does not violate the law.<br />
<br />
Why hasn't SOE shut down sites such as ... that so blatently go against the EULA that it is not funny.<br />
<br />
Why aren't they taking legal action against people selling SOE property (EULA States that items, coins and characters are property of SOE/Verant).<br />
<br />
Perhaps because taking such legal action isn't as cut-and-dried as you seem to think it is.<br />
<br />
I think the 2 big events in EQ this year were<br />
1) the plat dupe bugs that caused prices to skyrocket, and<br />
2) and the new melee system</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why hasn't SOE shut down sites such as ... that so blatently go against the EULA that it is not funny.Because they have no legal ground to stand on. They can't shut the sites down because they are not breaking any laws.<br />
<br />
Why aren't they taking legal action against people selling SOE property (EULA States that items, coins and characters are property of SOE/Verant).They did, they lost. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on to the real topic, great post Shik. I agree, warriors have been taking it on the chin for some time now. The introduction of the first round of melee changes has made a huge impact on warriors for the better. I find myself playing my warrior even more since the changes. Cheers SOE, a little late coming, but pretty nice result!</div></div><hr />

 Mind doing a little linking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Great post Shik! Really captured the flavor of the year.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, although the cash farmers may have tryed especially hard this year it was still a good one in the end. I don't know about anyone else, but I look forward to 2004 and the mayhem I can get into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Theonolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great post Shik....I started playin back in april as a druid and got bored!!!! So late in june I started my warrior and have found  what I was looking for in the game. =)  I think the way Sony is headed is for the better of us warriors myself and hope it gets better.</div></div><hr />
