Unparalleled New Trade Skill Quest Goes Live Online October 8th!<br />
Some lucky contest winners will receive the quest rewards.<br />
<br />
Of course you know that every EQrpg product contains clues to exclusive new<br />
online quests. Yes, the quests have been a while in implementation, but the<br />
next one makes the delay worth the wait. A huge quest that rivals the POTC<br />
trade skill quest goes live on October 8th, 2003. In fact, the rewards for<br />
the quest are superior to the POTC earrings (EQo players know what we<br />
meanä), and one of the rewards can even be attained without the complexity<br />
of the trade skill portion of the quest.<br />
<br />
Remember the oldie but goodie, the Robe of the Oracle? Well, like the rest<br />
of Norrathπs inhabitants, the Oracle thought it was high time for him to<br />
upgrade, so heπs about to unveil his Grand Robe of the Oracle. Or for the<br />
clerics, druids, and shamans among you, he has a Grand Tunic of the Oracle<br />
to offer. The Oracle will want your Velious robe/armor in exchange ã but<br />
take his word for it, itπs a trade you want to make.<br />
<br />
And the other item? How about a phylactery like the one that enabled<br />
Miragulπs transformation into a lich? With EverQuest trade skills, anything<br />
is possible!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">w00tz0rs mebbe if i hand my crafted breastpate over to Skakyrn Meadogreen he's make me a I'll_make_Raex's_look_like_cloth_with_THIS_BADA$$_AC Breastplate :D<br />
<br />
back on topic; things liek that sound cool. hopefully get more updates soon on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Buy a robe of the oracle or 5 now while they're cheap. Wait till quest gets solved, sell em for profit.<br />
<br />
There's my take on this information ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Uhh, i'm not seeing anywhere that says he wants an old robe of the oracle...it's saying he's upgraded his and wants a velious BP in exchange for it.<br />
<br />
I dunno tho, I have a hard time believing he's gonna hand me something better than that Wolf Caller's BP on my shammy or the Warlock's robe on my necro.  I'll wait till someone else wastes their loot on that trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the pen paper thing is true. but were talking what soe thinks is a upgrade. theirs prolly some code you have to enter. somewhat like they did with the ldon bag. and youll get a pending item tag thing on your toons. dunno how they did the bag thing but the flag portion is implemented.</div></div><hr />
