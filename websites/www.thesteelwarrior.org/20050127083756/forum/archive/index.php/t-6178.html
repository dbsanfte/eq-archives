Went on a mini-raid to get some people in my guild keyed for some of the islands that they were not able to make it on the larger scale raids.  Which thankfully are not no rent anymore.<br />
<br />
We managed to make it over to the 4th island with the dispelling eyeballs when 4 too many came with the pull.  Our mini-raid was going down faster than a bucket of chicken in front of Oprah so what we usually do is have our cleric hop on his drog/horse and go diving.  Sounds like the diving horse idea from the early 20's and 30's.<br />
<br />
Thus landing him on island one giving enough time for him to camp out and come back when its safe to rez everyone.<br />
<br />
We then get the tell of he's swimming around freeport now.  Doh.<br />
<br />
Also found out that if any members of your group/raid that clicks over to the next island and is on drog/horse...Dies on landing on the next island.  They will receive a message saying they fell to their death.<br />
<br />
So get off the drog/horse before you click on over.<br />
<br />
That's the latest information I have on Plane of Sky.  Hope it helps anyone that plans on venturing there.</div></div><hr />

So get your keys, bank them... you can go backup easily with an invis to any isle.<br />
<br />
Not that the place is fun, but believe it or not people still want their epics and its easy to farm peices fro classes in your guild or friends alts or even for MQ selling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jumping and landing in Freeport isnt a bug, thats why he said fixed. Previously if you jumped from any of the isles while on a horse, you would land on Isle one alive and healthy. But that was deffinitely a bug I would say.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, thats an exploit. Props to SOE for finally fixing it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't always land on island one safe when diving with a horse.  First and last time I ever tried it was off of island one itself.  Thought it would be funny to see the little gnome falling while on horse back, so I dove off taking screenshots on the way down.  Had ran my warrior off at the same time and just left him alone to fall in peace.<br />
<br />
Warrior zoned to Freeport like he should.  Gnome &quot;wrapped&quot;.  He fell beyond the zone point, warped to a higher point, and cratered on Azarrack island.  Note, I jumped off island one, and Azarrack island is physically &quot;above&quot; island one.  The little guy actually wrapped back to the top of the zone while falling beyond the bottom, and refell through the islands again...  hitting one of them.<br />
<br />
Kinda suprises me that they changed it so that you'd appear on island one unscaved for as long as they did.  Usually they just leave in the bug that can kill you instead of opting for a solution that could be exploited.</div></div><hr />
