<br />
<br />
Actually if I don't use stonewall I will pull on the horse and then drop off it when I get back to the group... Gives me lots of time to set up before the mob gets there...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you pull with arrow you have more then enough time to start before the mob gets to you from 200 plus feet away, and then if you drop off mount (click off the buff) when you get to the group you eliminate the stop lag..... you stop dead when you click it off.<br />
<br />
But anyway if you know you are going to use stonewall seems its best to be on the mount. Stonewall is way better then defensive cause your dps stays up the only downside is the movment which is compenstated (at lest for posititioning purposes) for by the mount, dosnt work in all zones but...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In ANY case, knowing you can move in any method with stonewall seems like a useful piece of information, and I would understand why he would post it, granted it only works with people with deep pockets. <br />
<br />
Attacking the guy because he has a 100k horse and can use it seems more stupid then him having one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's not stupid to have one. money is always relative to people. i dont have millions of plat, but i know how to make money when i need it, even if it's for stuff to screw around with. and besides, i travel alot, better than carring around sow potions or asking druids and the like for one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone might try it with the lower level horses as well. I know that when you are under rez effects or have to much coin on you slowing you down that when you have a horse it mitigates these effects. Of course you can be snared on horseback.... But there might be more to it then just the extra movement speed that the horse gives.<br />
<br />
Why would you not have a item that allows you fast speed movement? A lizard is a valuable addition to any class, espically casters, but mellee can also use them to their advantage in many situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of Combat value it is next to useless, I'll agree. Fighting on horseback is annoying and pulling in say Earth is no faster if you need to recast it on ever pull.<br />
<br />
I bought it because I thought it would be fun, which it is and that in the end is what a game should be about. In reality all it will do is save a little time getting to places. I had a ball running from Everfrost to Freeport tho:p<br />
<br />
As for stonewall, it works fine in exp groups; either just walk forward and turn around or strafe back left and right.<br />
<br />
So yeah, the original point of thread is basically one giant internet manlyhood waving contest, which is best ignored.</div></div><hr />

And Esvee now too.  Long as it isn't just me.  BTW, I use stonewall alot in exp groups, and have little problem staying in position just strafing...alot cheaper than 100 k horse.</div></div><hr />

I have a very fast Drogmor will see how it works fighting while mounted.  I can't really picture myself as a warrior mounted on a steed fighting though..although with my Primal Lance it would look like I was jousting.  I mainly use him right now to cross large zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont now about the regen of endurence sitting vs. standing but you are considered sitting while on a horse....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok to all those people offended because I called a 100k horse stupid . . . .<br />
<br />
If you have the extra 100k then gfy, just seems like there are more important things ANY warrior could spend 100k on since we can;t fight on a horse.  I don;t think I am the only warrior who thinks the implemlentation of horses is lame, but if that's how you want to spend you're extra cash flow then i guess far be it from me criticise your actions.  <br />
<br />
That noted, I really don;t think a horse is exactly going to help me pulling.  Run3 is not exactly the speed of light, but it's not that slow either.  Chances are if it's a mob I need stonewall for I'll probably have 1 class that can cast SoW or something.  Most times I pull with a bow, so I get a head start on running back to the group, being there earlier doesn;t really do much.  If I was their earlier maybe i could grab a cup of coffee while the mob comes in, but i hardly see that there is much &quot;setup&quot; i would need to be doing.  If i need to position the mob, i'll use fortitude then stonewall, just straff to where i want or i can just live with defensive and the smaller damage output.  Besides i don;t know how i would be positioning a mob when i don;t even have attack on, incite may be good for aggro, but it's not ungodly aggro.  To each his own though . . . if you like spending 100k on a horse and think it'll help you pull . . . BRAVO;  i'll just let a monk pull or deal without having the horse thankyou.</div></div><hr />

From my understanding (and truely i could be off on this) you cannot attack a mob while mounted on a horse.  If this is not true then i would stand corrected.  I would question if that was true why bother to dismount, but other than that I still think horse is eye candy, and something people with wealth brag about rather than adding to our pulling prowess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can attack a mob while on horseback.<br />
<br />
You can't feign death while mounted. But that's about it.<br />
<br />
My warrior has a chain bridle and has spent much time fighting on horseback (it used to be my escape valve while soloing, if things went bad, odds are I was ok cause the horse would outrace entire ZONES, heh).<br />
<br />
I've done a ton of fighting on horseback. It's annoying, but you eventually get used to it.<br />
<br />
It's also fun to bow kite on horseback. Heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok on that part (attacking while on horse) I stand corrected;  however still seems to suck tanking on one (at least according to other people: i don;t have a horse and don;t want one), and  I just question the validity of using one to pull, esp if you spend 100k on one.  I am sure people use a horse to pull, but does it really help and how exactly.  Getting back to the group and waiting 10 seconds for the mob to catch up allows you to do what?; besides dismount your horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can lay some arrows into the mob (I got nine arrows in one time by stopping 3 times on the way back to the group) while waiting.<br />
<br />
But the whole idea of warrior pulling is that you get the initial agro, you don't have to take agro from the puller. Pump 2-3 arrows into the mob then go full speed to aother spot stop pump 3 more arrows (I doning this just to get my skill up actually) and then get back to the group, dismount wait for mob then hit insite... so you have initial agro, a few bow shot agro, and incite agro.... and you can move normally cause you are off the horse.... its all win/win.<br />
<br />
Also what if the pull is bad and you get 3 mobs instead of 1? With fast horse you can zone or out run the mobs and not get hammered. <br />
<br />
And then of corse is the stonewall thing now.... and who knows maybe you de regen more endurence if you sit.... no idea on that though...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya you can bow pull also, its just a bit safer to horse/bow pull... and you can defensive but stonewall is better. But your right, if your total fortune is like 400K, then 100K is better spent elsewhere... if yur total fortune is 3,000,000pp then you surely will have 100K to invest.<br />
<br />
I know I will be accused of bragging but I have like a few million pp in stuff on all my guys (I have 3 of the 100Kers and 4 of the 10Kers horses), not much no drop though. Im not guilded so I really dont see anyway to get gear except though bazzar (maybe farm some Dunder stuffs but thats about as high as I will get) and thus I spend an hour or so a day generating pp (mostly buy Jelery Craft items and make things and resell, even 500pp in profit on a BD bracer adds up when you can sell 4 or so a day of each kind of item) and doing merchant things. Merchent stuff is like a whole other game you can play.....  I have 200K in the bank and there is almost nothing for sale at this point that I can buy that would be worth the price to upgrade....</div></div><hr />

any particular reason you use fortitude instead of furious?  It seems like riposting all the mobs hits would be better as it will help you build aggro.  I plan to do this for some boss mobs.  So if there's a reason to choose fortitude instead, let me know.</div></div><hr />

Just stop man. Just stop the bragging please for the love of god. IT'S OLD and nobody cares! You don't have to look any farther than your sig to see it. And no I'm not jealous by any means. I've had plenty of plat come and go in my days, and I certainly don't need plat for upgrades either. To make matters worse however, you come across as an ignorant braggart, because half of the things you state as fact are actually incorrect or misleading (not necessarily the subject of this thread though).</div></div><hr />

I use fortitude because I want to take little if any damage while moving the mob around.  I guess i could use furious, it's just one of those disc'd i never have used before.  It's kinda like SoE gave us all new /disc's because all that existed for me was defensive and evasive for years.</div></div><hr />

You mean the fact that he's posted dozens of screenshots of his PvP &quot;victims&quot; might be considered bragging?  heh... I especially think it's funny that we're supposed to be impressed by the sight of his 6 characters standing over 1 corpse.  So..... it takes 6 characters to kill that one guy?  Wow... I'd say it's the player who was just killed who has the uber skills.  At least try taking him 1 on 1.  <br />
