Not talking about 100k items, just enough to buy even 5-10k upgrades for every slot would be nice.  So can someone suggest a few zones to make plat - especially in those times I can't get a group?  This is my main so no alts to help out.  :)<br />

Gornit is a walking ATM and the seafuries in like 1 out of 5 kills drops a 70pp+ merchant loot like mith amulets or stones liek fire opals/etc.</div></div><hr />

When I leveled up on test I did a ton of Dulak.  Not many places you can kill stuff that drops diamonds/blue diamonds for exp in your 40s, and the weapons sell pretty well too (except for the shivs, drop those).</div></div><hr />

Everything should be green at 54, you'll get lots of little gems, velium weapons and other assorted vendor trash (leave the picks and shimmering velium rubies alone, they aren't worth anything).  The big money, however, comes from the small pieces, bricks and blocks of velilum.  Check the bazaar for prices on your server, establish a competitive price and set up a trader overnight or whenever you're not playing.<br />
<br />
I was struggling myself at that level until I started hitting CC and farming it.  I'm still nowhere near rich, but my gear is a whole lot better now.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that only the miners drop the tradeskill velium, and the watchman and foremen drop the weapons.  Foremen can also drop the Skull Cap, Oracles drop a nice cloak, and Inspectors/Herbalists occasionally drop some random bazaar fodder as well.  All of the pieces are lore, though.  I usually just stash 'em in the bank and use 'em for a few easy points of tribute, as it's not always easy to sell newbie gear on my server.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are better places for sure, but this is pretty easy to do with no help at all.<br />
<br />
You can get over a k an hour there if it isnt crowded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a lot of farming in Highpass at that level a long time ago to buy items for FH gear. Every guard there drops up to 6pp and a fine steel sword. I was making from 300-700pp an hour depending on if there was anyone else there. <br />
<br />
I was there not long ago and it was pretty deserted so there should be little competition unless your server is different than mine. If you can handle them the nobles also drop gems and ringmail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the options listed above are pretty good ones.<br />
Well, I posted in the other thread about ice giants in Everfrost, which you should be able to handle. Get virtue the first time, see how it goes. Bring bandages. But the giants are on about a 7-minute timer and drop anywhere from 5 plat+ fine steel+ minor vendor items to 30 plat + fine steel + vendor items.<br />
If you do start farming stuff, do yourself a favor and save anything that says it can be used in tradeskills until you figure out what it's for. Some giants drop items for the tempers in cultural smithing: ice giants, for example, drop essence of winter. Tribunal cultural armor requires two of these, and they are not common drops and not sold by vendors. Other giants droop other essences for cultural armor. Might be a bazaar market for 'em. <br />
Poisen-making stuff often isn't worth anything, but any tradeskill item for smiths or tailors, particularly stuff that's not sold by vendors, is a potential bazaar item.<br />
On your way to and from the ice giants, whack any mammoth you happen to see. tusks are heavy, but they sell well.<br />
Also, start surveying any friends you have to see if they do tradeskills. You'd be surprised how eager your friends will be to help you go camp the soulscream if you given 'em half a stack of some drop they need for their smithing or tailoring or even alchemy. Not to mention the free buffs, free potions, etc. they'll eventually be pestering you with.</div></div><hr />

geonids in cc, okey gem drops but depends on spawns a bit.<br />
mammoths in everfrost :) <br />
ulthorks for the tusks(hand in to chief in cs), these can be found on merchants at times for 1pp'ish<br />
if you can do icegiants wyverns in cs might work as well, the quest gems sell for a bit of pp to merchants, not sure how much to players.<br />
<br />
Dulak ships can be nice enough, made 900+ pp in maybe 2 hours thanks to the gem drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to try out Crystal Caverns a little more extensivly after reading this post.  I am a college student, and often I have a 45 minute to 1.5 hour break several times a day.  I parked my 62 warrior in CC the night before, did some killing while getting ready for class, and came back 2 - 3 times during the day.<br />
<br />
What I would do is camp at the geonids.  I would then wipe out all of the geonids, zone out, zone back in (at the top of the orc part), head down killing all the orcs and looting everything but picks, vellium gems, and the no drop junk.  After I make it to the bottom, I put on m charisma gear, sell droppable stuff to vendors, bank the velium, and go back to the geonids and repeat.<br />
<br />
I averaged 1,245 pp an hour over the last 3 days of doing this after bazaaring the vellium.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">head over to bazar, check out what tradeskill items sell well on your server. then go farm them. <br />
<br />
rockhopper hides in DSP sell pretty well. i remember the wyverns drops in cobalt scar  also used to sell pretty well, and you will get exp from them at the same time. <br />
<br />
sebilis will be hard for you to solo atm. i do second dulaks tho, great place. decent exp and lots of cash drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd farm the grimlings in TM, with a healer behind you you should be able to clear them pretty much nonstop. I usually made around 700pp or so on average an hour from just the vendor stuff (all gems but windstones and the etched acrylia runes) not to mention the acrylia which is generally another 400 or so (and thats undershooting it) and the windstones which is another 200 or so (if you choose to sell them) but if you do go there...make sure to bring a LOT of bag space. There are tons of gems and etched acrylia runes that you'll be picking up. I used to go there in the mornings/late nights before raids and I could clear one cave...go to the other kill it and come back and the first one would be repopped and I'd do that for about an hour or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one advantage of farming in CC is the bank / vendor in the same zone.  Not having to travel 15 minutes one way when your bags fill up means more time to make more money!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groovdog</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">POJ Basement is good spot for both xp and loot around those levels (may be slightly too high not sure been long time). Lots of diamond droppers and you can get EP for spells too. At whatever point your grp can handle it, it is a nice spot. Eventually many classes can solo there (xp not great at that point, but loot still good for cash purposes). You might want to try DS in OoW. Lots of the mobs in there drop 5pp ea and have vendor drops that can sell for decent amounts as well.</div></div><hr />
