<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vidden</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first post here, so I am hoping that this is the right board for this post. <br />
<br />
I have currently collected EVERY piece for my epic minus the Spiroc Wingblade. My guild now has keys up to that isle and I heard that it is possable to make the lord spawn over and over. In order to do this, you must not kill the Guardian. However, here are the problems that we are running into. When we agro the lord, the guardian usally agro's also. Now, when the lord dies, Sirran spawns. And we all know what happens when Sirran is spawned and there is still agro. <br />
<br />
My questions are these. Is it possable to pull the lord without agroing the Guardian. If so, how. Also, does a new Sirron spawn everytime the lord is killed? Last thing (I promiss), where do we pull the lord to kill him so that the respawn doesnt agro Sirran?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A new Sirran spawns if there is no Sirran currently up anywhere in the zone.<br />
<br />
The best way to deal with Sirran is to move kill locations a bit each time you kill the Spiroc Lord.  There is plenty of space near the island's edge to do this.<br />
<br />
If your general kill location is at one of the island corners nearest to the Spiroc Lord, then you will generally not get Spiroc Guardian aggro.  But be prepared for it, and have everyone camp out in that case.<br />
<br />
Since you are dealing with deathtouching mobs and Sirran's uber melee, I recommend always having a cleric bot camped out for the duration of your wingblade farm.<br />
<br />
Unless things changed, you can expect a drop rate of about 40% on the wingblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vidden</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah! 40%? That sucks. So we are looking at about once ever 3 kills. If Sirran is up from the first death of the Lord, he wont respawn until the first one poofs? If so, we could do non-stop killing on the lords bind point...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know how you are getting guardian agro. I farmed the lord many times back when Velious was launched and we had people pull him np as the other bird was on the opposite end of the island. Try pacifying it? or just have a monk train it away and fd?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bounx</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's how we farmed TSL. When you port in you should be safe as long as no one moves towards the bird houses. The little spirocs were all content to just run around in circles.<br />
<br />
If you move to your left from the arrival point it will make things easier.<br />
<br />
Once in the SW corner, pull the nearest birdhouse. You will get three maybe more. If you also get the guardian, don't worry. If you get a guardian, move away from his spawn point while fighting. Kill the guardian first (if accidentially pulled), then the vanquishers, then the other mobs. Just make sure you have people calling out what they are off tanking and have the MT grab those mobs quickly in order.<br />
<br />
By killing the guardian first, he immediately respawns. Back at his is perch near the SE corner<br />
<br />
Kill what ya got and then move north along the west edge of the island. <br />
Here you will be near one of the bird houses. Pull it dispatching the vanquishers.<br />
<br />
You may or may not of gotten the third bird house by now. If not stay at your camp and pull the mobs over there. <br />
<br />
Once everything is dead except for the guardian and the lord farming time begins.<br />
<br />
The Spiroc Lord spawns near the portal pad in the NE corner of the island. To do this, pull the spiroc lord to your camp along the west edge. Once there kill him and do the hand end of your keys to Sirran. Now you will need to move your camp closer to the spiroc lord. There is a swail between your current camp and the spiroc lord. I guess you would say this is about North Center of the island. From this camp, you will be able to see TSL at his spawn point  Pull him here and dispatch. Pull him again and kill it. <br />
<br />
Now here is the trick. One Sirran spawns, you are on a timer. Watch the clock carefully and time your pulls. If you can not kill TSL before Sirran despawns, then wait. Once you are in this waiting pattern for Sirran to despawn, move back to the West edge camp where Sirran spawned. Immediately up Sirran's death pull TSL to here and kill him. Sirran will spawn here which means you move back to the North Center camp. <br />
<br />
Basically, the idea is to watch the clock and kill TSL in a place where Sirran wont aggro on you. Then move to another camp and repeatedly kill him until right before Sirran despawns (20 minute timer).  <br />
<br />
After a while you will get this down. We went thru 20 spawns of TSL and recovered 6 wingblades for epics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We went 0 for 13 the other day on the first 13 then got 3 out of 4.<br />
<br />
maybe it would have balanced out if we stayed longer ha ha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long ago we did it the following way.<br />
<br />
When Guardian is aggro one tank seperates with him and only held him aggro until all is done. Then all log out except the tank and his healer. After that the healer can try to log out. The tank will die now and guardian is up ... . Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest way I've found is to Pacificate the Guardian.  When my guild goes to Sky, I play my Enc, and I can tell you this.  PoSky is trivalized with Pacification (or was before the duration nerf)  I never found a mob I couldn't land it on, except mobile belly casters (drakes on 7th)  I could Paci the efreeti, any spirocs, even the DT sphinxes (which saved us a lot of deaths while clearing drakes)<br />
<br />
My suggestion is take a bard, and have him keep paci on Guardian while you clear other spirocs.  If bard aggros due to fail, have him pull Guardian as far from raid as possible and hopefully won't add after bard dies.  If he does, tank + cleric holding pattern till you can camp out.<br />
<br />
Also, someone suggested farming him on his bind point.  I don't recommend that.  While its true you can kill him several times, we almost wiped by accident that way.  We had killed him once, then charged the 2nd to get away from Sirran.  Forgot that, duh, he's gonna insta-repop again.  We killed him 3 times in a row with a 3 group raid, but after that we couldn't keep up with the # of DT deaths.<br />
<br />
Also, if Sirran gets into a &quot;bad&quot; position, have a monk move him.  Throw, flop, run, flop, run, flop, /q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember, if you PACIFICATE, you can EXTRAPOLATE the guardian to ISOLATE him from the rest of the ORNITHOLAGICATE. <br />
<br />
remember, always ANTICIPATE, PARTICIPATE...<br />
<br />
then REDUCEICATE mobs hps to ZEROIFICATE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned, the reason to not fight the Lord on his bind point is because you won't be able to control his deathtouches when he respawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gart</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clear the island except the Lord.<br />
<br />
Then pull the Lord to the right of the portal and kill him.<br />
<br />
Sirran spawns.<br />
<br />
Park someone in front of Sirran and &quot;Hail Sirran&quot; for 3 hours or however log you want.  If you need, drag Sirran over with a FD class, and then start the Hail lock.  <br />
<br />
Farm Lord over and over and over and over.  <br />
<br />
I believe we did him about 20 times one afternoon.  Something like 8 wingblades dropped.  Bear in mind the Lord actually drops rare items for a couple of decent 41% haste items.  <br />
<br />
It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure this the way we did it.</div></div><hr />
