<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have noticed several times during the first 6 GoD trials and in general, that casters that are on horses ALWAYS seem to attract the attention when mobs repop and thus get jumped and splattered.<br />
<br />
Its especially unfortunate when these people are clerics and/or your evaccers, and you are far inside the dungeon, leaving you stranded.<br />
<br />
I also noticed today that a mob seemingly agroed on someone that was following behind me(on a horse), even though I was closer to the mob. At least it looked like that.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have noticed this? Or am I totally imagining this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like they might have gotten around to making mobs consider people &quot;sitting&quot; on a horse (with appropriate mana regen bonus) the same as people &quot;sitting&quot; on the ground.  That's the easiest explanation anyway.<br />
<br />
Pretty ouchie if so, horses will go back to being somewhat annoying transportation devices instead of the faux-FT mana regen items they are now...<br />
<br />
Wouldn't surprise me, will try and do a few tests with some expendib... er, willing casters soonish.<br />

RdT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a buddy who swore up &amp; down sitting on a horse = more agro now, but I still dont believe it personally.<br />
<br />
I dont like sitting on horses unless I have to when I play casters personally (well except for mage/wiz) cause I do a lotta ducking with priests/chanters personally so it kinds ruins my style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I'm not playing my main, I'm two boxing a druid/beastlord duo these days.  Druid typically sits on a drogmar, Beast pulls with slow.  If I don't stay between the mob and the druid when I pull, they will almost invariably turn and go smack him.  This is after being slowed by the Beast, and before the Druid has so much as belched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ffcnemesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I´ve noticed a slightly increased agro modifier by distance in tipt trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's pretty ironic if it's true, since wasn't one of the advertised perks of having a horse that you could sit without generating sit agro?  Or was it like monk FD in that it's use wasn't intended, and is just a lucky result?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it wasn't a perk, it was an accident.  horses were not intended to be use for mana regeneration.</div></div><hr />

LOL, I would have to say it's the druid and not the horse. I know it's either paranoia and/or just bad luck, but I'd swear my druid gets more aggro just for the fact that he's a druid, sitting on a horse or not. I remember pl'ing a wizard around level 20 with my level 65 druid in East Karana. We'd both be standing there and level 15-20 mobs would come up and smack the druid, leaving the juicy level-appropriate wizard alone. This happened even when both characters were medding, or both were just standing there. More than once, a lion or gnoll would walk right over the wizard to smack the druid further away.<br />

Go figure.</div></div><hr />
