<br />
  I don't read the Safehouse, or normally the SOE forums either. However, when I was taking a look at the new forums these rogue threads caught my eye. Are rogues just whining here, or do they really need upgrades?<br />
<br />
  I feel like IF their damage is below where it should be, that should surely be raised. Pure melee need to be the best at what they do; I feel that's fundamental. I get the feeling that most rogues don't want much other than DPS, just like we only wanted to be able to tank better prior to the warrior changes. I definitely think that SoS should work on everything but named mobs and occasional strategically placed mobs. It just costs too many AAs to make it mostly useless in an entire expansion.</div></div><hr />

It's the low /mid end rogues that need an upgrade to their dps.

<br />
The same argument can be applied to monks and berserkers. The two other pure melees that are forced to fight for room in the DPS phone booth prank that SOE has been playing on it customers.<br />
<br />
Do rogues need upgrades? Probably. All melees need DPS upgrades right now. Problem is ... I don't see the devs doing that for any of us.<br />
<br />
And if they do, it'll be far too much of an upgrade, forcing them to simply boost casters again, making the whole thing a waste of time ... from a balance standpoint.<br />
<br />
Sorry, my cynicism is showing through again.<br />
<br />
They could go the other way and nerf caster DPS ... or mana regen rates ... or a whole number of things in the house of cards that holds that end of the class-balance-equation together.<br />
<br />
But that too would be doomed to fail. And would cause quite a stir on message boards I never frequent (the caster ones).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to be fair, Monks have a few other uses besides DPS and they really can shine again as pullers at present.  Rogues are in a stranger position.<br />
<br />
Low/mid-end Rogues are struggling for dps, and I mean that right up to elementals.  At a very minimum, VT gear (or a bazillion LDoNs) can only get them to a decent attack rating and they are still heavily hindered by a very small weapon selection.  Yes indeed, Monks have some troubles there too but there are some really pretty damn good Monk weapons in this range, while Rogues don't really open up much until Fennin.  Of course, they struggle more in comparison to casters but there we are. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Rogues at this level are still pretty decent for scouting/CRing.  Pre-GoD these abilities are still quite useful, even if they might be much more situational than a Monk's pulling abilities.  Berserkers are still in limbo as far as I can tell though.  They might just do some decent dps but I've never seen the parses at this point.  We've got one in the late 50s in guild now though so I'll keep an eye on him once he gets geared up some.<br />
<br />
High-end Rogues are rightfully annoyed about SoS getting screwed over in GoD but seem generally content with thier damage production.  From Fennin+ encounters there are quite a reasonable number of Rogue weapons for a change and most will see good upgrades through Time if not elsewhere.  Attack also becomes pretty trivial to cap, as opposed to nearly impossible pre-elementals.  It's a good time to be a dps Rogue at this level, although they are still balancing through equipment and not at the class-skill level.</div></div><hr />

Haass, compare that same rogue to a similarly equipped wizard or mage and you will see a gap.  With a trueborn dagger (15-21) and epic, assuming most offensive AAs, SoV / SoT / SoP and probably 1400-1500 attack, that rogue would be lucky to see 150 and would be more likely around 130-135 dps sustained.  A wizard or mage should have no problems sustaining 160-180 dps, depending on aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The wicked shank has a DoT proc, which will screw up rogue escape AA ability so it's not something most rogues would want to use.  The gargoyle talon is a 17/24; the average rogue won't have the attack to fully utilize a 17 damage weapon, resulting in backstabs and pierces that aren't as good as it should be.  Both are decent weapons but neither will give the rogue the boost they'd need to outdamage  a wiz/mage over a sustained period of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhh, yes, and they're casters.<br />
<br />
Apparantly in your zeal to be the best, rogues also forgot about this thing called balance.  You see, to make up for the fact that you can fucking tank things (not everything, but you tank better than a wizard or a mage), your DPS is lower than a pure caster, AS IT SHOULD BE.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, wizards don't start becoming THAT effective on DPS due to aggro considerations until they get concussion pants in the EP's.  If I can barely keep aggro off the rogues, there is going to be zero situation where a wizard is going to significantly outdps them without getting their proverbial ass handed to them.<br />
<br />
Here's a little reality check for everyone.  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE BEST AT EVERYTHING ALL THE DAMNED TIME.  Wizards SHOULD have no rival in the DPS department because they wear fucking cloth, and up until the point where they start seeing double digit FT numbers, their DPS is limited severely based upon their mana pool.  Your rogue goes AFK for an hour and comes back and he's still doing damage.<br />
<br />
You can go ahead and think whatever you want, but when you're discussing damage, you need to compare apples to apples, and comparing melees to casters isn't going to solve your problems.  You outdamage all the melee.  If a caster beats you by a few percentage points, stop sweating it and just play the game.  Your life won't end, trust me.</div></div><hr />

At level 20 anyways. Compared to the level 20 versions of the warrior and monk skills ... rogues got the shaft.<br />

<br />
2 problems with this - in the high end, rogues and wizards are fairly equal on their damage.  JTB / Quarmer rogues can put out relatively the same burst dps as an equivalent wizard.  Same goes for sustained DPS since most decked out wizards are 7-8.5k mana pool.<br />
<br />
As I stated, the problem is in the mid-game.  Where is the balance between a pure caster and a pure melee?  There isn't one, pure melee are at a huge disadvantage - warriors / monks / rogues / berserkers.  While you're busy trying to LFG, that same wizard is probably off somewhere quad kiting endless mobs until C3 wears off, goes to PoK and gets a fresh one, then goes right back at it again.<br />
<br />
Apparantly in your zeal to be the best, rogues also forgot about this thing called balance.<br />
Great quote - in the thing called balance, classes such as a rogue bring damage and slight utility in CR but what else?  Traps and locked doors are expansions ago.  Graveyards remove the need for a corpse summon or drag, just wait 15-30 minutes.  Why take a pure melee class for dps when you can grab a mage for summon items (hello mod rods), CoH, pet offtanking, etc or a wizard for good burst and sustained dps, ports, evac, snare/root crowd control, yada yada yada.  In the low/mid end, casters have a large advantage over pure melee.. there's the 'balance' you speak of for your robe wearing friends.<br />
<br />
I'm beyond that point in the game and I am glad because being an average equipped pure melee class blows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our rogues consistently out dps my monk by at least 50 dps, they have Gargoyle Talon(17/24) and Wicked Shank(16/21).  Low to mid range monk weapons are about the same as warrior weapons (CHoS, Orb of the Infinite Void, GSotFW).  From the parses that I saw, more than 1/3 of their dps is from BS.<br />
<br />
What weapons are you calling &quot;Damn Good&quot;?  I need one because I'm basically using warrior weapons (and dps) while wearing druid armor!!!<br />
<br />
As for pulling, other classes can do that job just as well (and sometimes better) than monks (SK's, Necro's, Bards, Ench's...etc).  While rogues can pick locks, disarm traps, do CR's, target mobs for lulling, and scout.<br />
<br />
I guarantee that there are more retired monks than rogues, I'm peeved about what you said because you said that rogues are struggling for dps then followed by saying that monk weapons are damn good, implying that monk dps is okay or better.  I haven't experienced that.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that rogues don't need an upgrade, just that for non tanking classes, abilities should make a class distinctive and dps should be about the same.  There isn't much of a difference between a rogue and a wizard when the mob is quadding for 3k, they both go splat very quickly.<br />
<br />
One problem that I see is that SOE keeps adding classes, but group size is still limited to 6 people.  Someone is gonna get left out.<br />
<br />
Basically, a raid needs one or two warriors, sk's and pally's for off tanks, a lot of clerics, 3 or 4 enchanters, a druid for B9, a BL for SD, a wizzy for portage, a few mages for mod rods and possibly coth, possibly a ranger for snare tracking and pre raid scouting;  the rest is just dps.<br />
<br />
Imbalance happens when a group would rather have two wizzies than a wizzie and a rogue or just one or two warriors per raid and ten rogues or when a group can't function without a certain class.  I would prefer all classes to be both dispensible and desired at the same time.  I don't know if it's possible but that's balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why should we be doing a league less dps than, say, a warrior when we have a pet up, are dotting and burning what mana we can on nukes.<br />
<br />
We don't heal like a paldin... our parent class is a 'DPS' caster class (yes that's what necros do, in case you'd forgotten they're perhaps the highest dps class in the game)... all we get from our caster side is the aggravation of controling a pet, and having to click spell gems every second or so while watching mana bar... all to be doing significantly less dps than a warrior pressing 'a'.<br />
<br />
I've always understood why knights should be doing less dps than a warrior from melee (and we do... drastically less)... but why should we be behind even when using out caster abilities too?<br />
<br />
It's not like we aggro that much better anymore (if at all)... and we are not even in the same league as warriors tanking GoD content.</div></div><hr />

SKs are parsed, consistently, doing more damage than warriors. That is, of course, in addition to tapping for self hp and group atk and/or mana. Whine is thusly invalid. Next.</div></div><hr />

I draw my own conclusions, I don't base it on what I read.  Most rogue threads are unreasonable and unrealistic, asking for offhand backstab, higher assassination caps, and other DPS upgrades that would be ridiculous.  I'm suprised that you, being an average equipped warrior, don't see the disparity between the pure melee and pure casters at your level of the game.</div></div><hr />

If you really want to up thier DPS the easy way, you could also revamp thier &quot;poison&quot; abilities. It should be more about damage and less about farmage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not so sure on this. Maybe for a short while on full raids where you have mana comming in at an amazing rate and can chain cast lifetaps (fast recast but terrible damage done vs mana spent).<br />
<br />
For example... parsing damage done in phase 3 in time (where warriors aren't tanking so thats not an issue) I seem to outdamage them all. And you can see by my magelo that they will be much better geared than me.<br />
<br />
However... I parse like 120dps total in an exp grind. That's with pet up, blood of hating every mob, and nuking where I can (which isnt much).<br />
<br />
And I read threads on here where warriors are doing more than that with just the 30% clicky haste gloves for buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At my level of the game, casters are hard pressed to get anywhere near double digit FT.  They're also severely limited by aggro generation by warriors pre Blade of War.  Rogues on the other hand have little issues stacking on a decent chunk of attack, and getting 15/20 daggers, in addition to the excellent DPS increase that unlocking discs provided.   Rogues are fine.  If there's an issue, it must be between you and me, but I doubt that as well since your argument that most rogues can't make use of a 17/24 dagger is perposterous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still go to BoT and do LDoN so I group with average equipped players often, both melee and casters.  Most casters hover around FT 3-5 thanks to the ornate bracers, solstice earring, and numerous other FT items in the market.  I rarely recall any casters other than the cleric or enchanter say &quot; low on mana.&quot;  With the numerous mana regen spells (SD / C5 / 9 / bard song) most average equipped casters probably can't use up their mana due to aggro limitations but still be able to maintain 150+ dps.<br />
<br />
 but I doubt that as well since your argument that most rogues can't make use of a 17/24 dagger is perposterous. <br />
I've already done hundreds of hours parsing various attack set ups and have posted them on the Safehouse, and a few others have done the same.  Until the rogues are able to hit 1400+ attack, a 17-24 weapon will do negligible damage in primary because the average pierce and backstabs just won't be high enough to make up for the slow ratio.  Most will bag the gargoyle talon and go with the wicked shank / ragebringer combination since it is about 6% dps over a wicked shank / gargoyle talon combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do think Sneak attack line of ability should be an attack just like backstab on the backstab timer. Actually there is two things wrong with SA line :<br />
- The cost is insane for a marginal increase in damage.<br />
- you need to ALWAYS use backstab after this ability : 2 buttons for 1 ability, it's nonsence. <br />
<br />
Solution 1 : make it already a Backstab, you gain 1 button push, its easier to use.<br />
Solution 2 : make it a toggle, when its activated every 1st backstab when you break hide is a Sneak Attack.<br />
<br />
about rogue upgrades, I dont think they need a DPS upgreade, but more a sort of Sneak abilities upgrade. currently what rogues can do are :<br />
- DPS (they're good at that)<br />
- Hide+Sneak (but actually only used for CR purpose and scouting)<br />
- Disarm trap &amp; picklock (click click click... Traps should stay disarmed AND be more fun)<br />
- Poison (platinium sink, very costly and time consuming)<br />
<br />
So I'll prefer to see added :<br />
- A special rogue PP table<br />
- A better poison system (f*** the insane quest for pop and old system, and the permanent farming needed)<br />
- more roguish stuff (ability to &quot;see&quot; fake walls, a better way to see WHO is seeing thrue SoS)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : where are gone all the &quot;openings&quot; ? Armor pierce/crush/slash (debuff melee against a type of weapon) ? those &quot;jolt slice&quot; attacks ? those are still on lucy and could be alternatives to the traditionnal backstab-backstab-backstab-backstab-backstab...</div></div><hr />

And when I did get in the right position, the max BS I did with sneak attack was 174.  Without sneak attack I have seen a max of 214 with BS.

No point in debating any further in thread with you Haass since you're not going to change your mind.  Good debates are hard to find since it seems they always in comments like &quot;but your Rogue can't get a fucking avatar. .&quot;</div></div><hr />

Casters have l33t DPS with all their mana regen spells and FT gear, but rogues suck when they're unbuffed and using shitty weapons.  Solid man, solid.</div></div><hr />

I also play a 63 rogue regularly, and in group situations (LDoN, BoT, HoH, that sort of thing) where Avatar is available (which is rare), I never get avatar; the damn thing can only be cast once every three minutes, so only the tank and maybe the second designated tank gets it.<br />
<br />
No, we don't have primal or prismatic weapons, yes, I just use a 15/21 trueborn's with rage off-hand. Yes, I'm probably a casual slacker in your eyes, as is everyone I play with...but that's a lot of EQ, bud, and those folks do need a little attention from time to time.<br />
<br />
Regularly doing mid-500 damage backstabs and then buying a new ability that lets me do &quot;initial one-time sneak backstabs&quot; that have yet to go over 440 damage is not my idea of &quot;getting some attention&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I had Ferine Avatar waiting in the bank when Cag hit 65, and I've had it on me, and every melee in my group since then.

<br />
Of course I guess I can't really blame rogues for that, since &quot;casual&quot; shaman just sit around and bitch about spell prices instead of just doing something to get them.</div></div><hr />

haha.  These parses are with rogues with SoV in most cases and any attack buffs depending on the group setup (ie SoT SoP SV bihli avatar ferocity).  I'll go back and crawl into my little hole of elitism and leave you be and let you worry about having pure melee balanced against casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a warrior who just recently dinged 65, I agree it's quite tough to play a melee in the non-raid-guild world. For starters, KEI lasts as long as 4 hours. Virtue lasts 4 hours, but you're kidding yourself that hp+ac even comes close to 14mana per tick.<br />
<br />
Ok, so avatar is great. It lasts 7 minutes. If you don't have a competent shaman, you won't have it. Casters are rolling around with at least a 14mana per tick bonus all the time. Theres no reason not to, even without a chanter in their group. That directly translates to a solid dps boost, although i haven't calculated it out.<br />
<br />
In addition, getting spells generally seems easier and cheaper than attempting to gear up a melee, although I may not be being realistic about this, what with the need to research etc.  That being said, 60-64 spells all drop off trash that is unlikely to drop anything of use to a melee.<br />
<br />
Thats before we even get to the fact that even without KEI, most casters have skills that allow them to solo in a way pure melees can only dream of even with good gear and buffs, effectively making it easier for them to power up through levels and aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woojed</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is a 65 Rogue on Veeshan.  I am currently in a small raiding guild.  I wield a Wickek Shank mainhand and Ragebringer off hand.  I have about 15AA's, and I think rogue DPS is fine.  With full buffs in a an exp group situation, my dps is nothing to sneeze at.  I hit for 108 regular and 661 backstab dmg.  My max crit on backstab is 1028 so far and in duelist mode my max bs was for 1673 (crit) non crit 1331.  My DPS fine.  Rogue shouldnt be bitching about an dps upgrade, they should bitch about our shitty posion skill and SoS not being worth a shit in GoD.  Now that is something to bitch about.  Monks are the ones who need an dps upgrade.</div></div><hr />

That would give them a unique role to play in groups without causing any balance issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Just die.<br />
<br />
:P <br />
<br />
Or as Isk says:<br />
&quot; Rogues pulling singles? I can just hear the monks complaining already. =D&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't even get me started, hahahahaha.<br />
<br />
Besides, we all know that rogues pulling singles would totally unbalance Bards. So it's never going to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weapons after BoT towers but before Fennin Ro for monks is :<br />
Hand of Honor<br />
Battle Fists<br />
Mithril Shod Staff<br />
Rune Etched Bamboo Bo<br />
Stone Etched Mace<br />
Fiery Staff of Zha<br />
<br />
It's just an itemization gap that hurts up and coming pre-elemental guild rogues because the ones that *do* drop rogue weapons (Sol Ro, Mith Marr) are annoying encounters to farm, whereas getting anything up to the zha is straightforward and lacks any real annoyance.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the LDoN dagger ( malevolent dirk of deception ) neatly filled the hole for non-raid/early raiders though, so it's not anywhere near as much of an issue as it once was.</div></div><hr />
