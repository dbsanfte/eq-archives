<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Good Do'urden</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been trying to spawn named in anguish with 3 groups to start a raid\expe then have other 2 group quit once main group inside to clean up till named spawn but none poped  at there usuall spawn pts . Anyone ever try to farm those with 1 group with success of making nameds spawn or  do we  need to be part of a raid to spawn them ? <br />
<br />
Imo this is good XP but still not the best place to xp , they have to many hps and they give about 5-6 pct a kill aswell do RS or MPG they easier and they die faster . I like the fact that mistake are not allowed and also gave us understanding on how the zone was working  wich make raiding  in anguish easier .<br />
<br />
Taught i could by pass guild raid to get augs and give others more chance to get them .Would Be nice to know if its doable or not and  what to do to give more chance to spawn them . This was our second try and we pretty much cleaned up to Ture . We will try again tomorow  and see .<br />
<br />
Here what i was thinking on what could possibly spawn named . Kill # to spawn them ?  Trap trigered  ? X # of time to clean up to triger pts ? Maybe need to have the most people  possible in zone as a raid to have more % for spawn to pop or we where just unlucky . Are we loosing our time ,  anyone know ? <br />
<br />
Thank You in Advance !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also believe I read somewhere on this board it was changed so that they will only spawn if 18 people are in zone(or was it in raid..? forgot).</div></div><hr />

Kept killing and spawned minis.....while the original 18 were still in the exped window they werent in zone. <br />
<br />
So to me that shows that they just need to be in the exped and it shouldnt matter if they are in zone or not. <br />
<br />
Minis were cake....tanked with non defensive and non furious since they werent hitting hard...had 3 clerics and there was never a point where it was even close. Trash in RS hits similar to minis. <br />
<br />
Assuming that these could be done with the right 1 group....but i have yet to test that theory. (whether or not they will spawn)<br />

We had 9 guildies, plus a couple cleric bots in a raid.  Asked random people in WoS to join the raid until we had 18.  Got the Anguish expedition, zoned in, and had the random people leave the raid.  Of the three times we did it, the augment mobs spawned on the 40th kill all 3 times.  Twice there were still 18 people in the expedition, once there was only 17 when the augment mobs popped.  We never had more then 11 people in Anguish at any one time.  Average time to clear all the way up to and kill Minas (since he spawned all three times) was 1 hour 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
Raid make-up: Paladin, Druid, Magician, Magician, Rogue, Rogue, Enchanter, Shaman, Bard and 2 cleric bots.  Out of the three runs we had 4 total deaths.  Bard twice, once each for the rogues.  Right around 1.5 group leader AA and real AA per run.</div></div><hr />

From what I noticed, everytime we got the emote, we were in different areas of the Citadel. Id like to confirm this 40 kills. We usually do the augs sometimes twice an evening, one time after raids for pick up.<br />
<br />
p.s.  group leader XP in Anguish for the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was 40 kills every time I counted.  Once, someone else was counting and said it was 38, but I think they just miscounted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
edit: tried tonight and its definitely 40.</div></div><hr />

****************************************************************<br />
Did exp in CoA with 1 group by asking groups in WoS to join raid for a short time, then kicked them out. Killed about 40 mobs and named spawned. <br />
<br />
Group was: <br />
-Cleric (flagged in) <br />
-Shadowknight<br />
-Rogue <br />
-Shaman<br />
-Mage<br />
-Bard<br />
<br />
Rogue won a 90hp/mana 5% stun resist augment. Had a ph on other mini. Called it quits after we killed ph and Keeper. The ae's were totally resistable with bard resists. Few trash mobs ae ramp, flurry, etc... About 6% to 7% per kill, seemed to have few hp. Our reward, a measly 2 hour lockout before we can do it again! <br />
<br />
This zone is totally an exp zone with great loot. We never had more than one mob in camp at a time. With more people, I'm sure things would go faster, it took us about 2 hours to get the minis to spawn with 1 group, and got about 2.5 aa in that time. <br />
<br />
All in all, this is a great zone for small before or after raid groups. It doesnt take a stellar group, just 5 flags. <br />
<br />
*****************************************************************<br />
<br />
Posted by the Magician about the CoA single group experience<br />
<br />
Wasn't much harder than RS. <br />
<br />
To Clarify a little what we did for exp...we had the raid formed with 18 (had to go to POK to get the numbers) Once we got the exp we zoned in and all 6 droppped raid and we got in 1 group. <br />
<br />
Snare is important and having a good puller is because of the double pull mobs. The pathing is bad in some places so be prepared to move so your puller won't get warps. <br />
<br />
When you get in the first round room (with Keldovar) don't fight near pit because you can fall in  <br />
<br />
<br />
We hit our 40 mobs pulling the first two mobs up the spiral staircase. Only thing you need to watch is that in the second round room (the room right before the spiral stairs) a Mini will pop on the number 40 kill. We were lucky that we were in the hall between the 2 round rooms. <br />
<br />
Only bad luck was we got a PH and 1 named ..instead of the 2 mini named. <br />

We seem to average a little less then 3.</div></div><hr />

Shortly after that, we cleared a few mobs to get to the named aug droppers, and we got 4 to pop. It was a beautiful night ;) Harrier first kill then 4 nameds.</div></div><hr />
