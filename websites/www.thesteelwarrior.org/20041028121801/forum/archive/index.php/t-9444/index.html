With 0 augments.  Everything is buyable in the bazaar.  Imagine duel anger3's ... 5 40 hp augs from ldon ... 5 10 ac augs from ldon ... <br />
<br />
Hehe for those doubting how easy it is to hit 11k buffed these days ... visit your local bazaar.  Yeah ... it's all expensive and these arent the choicest of the items available (actually gets better than this) ... but you could technically get all of it never setting foot out of rathe mountains farmin Hill Giants.<br />

<br />
I don't want to start an uber vs. casual thread, and I think it is neat to see what can be bought in the bazaar, but I think it is slightly misleading to say it is uber and elemental qualit.y<br />
<br />
It's great, and he has nice HP and saves, but look at that AC. Even with LDoN augs, it is still some crap AC. <br />
<br />
If you compare this to a level 70, actually elementally equipped warrior, it won't even come close. If you compare it to a real &quot;uber&quot; warrior, it's more like the stats of his caster friends.<br />
<br />
Hell, I am guildless and don't raid, and the other night in my exp group I had 12090 HP and 2050 AC. It's not so hard to reach those numbers anymore with all the new buffs and the huge HP increase by simply leveling to 70.</div></div><hr />

Not bored enough to run all the numbers yet, but if someone is doing it, they probably haven't even seen all those items for sale. Just for reference, I know of 1 pair of those shoulders and 1 pair of those boots for sale on CT.<br />

Binbar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The ac on several of these items are actually extremely respectable.<br />
<br />
Helmet<br />
Boots<br />
Breastplate<br />
Legs<br />
Rings<br />
<br />
On the other hand ac on several of these items is kind of low.  <br />
<br />
The point was that now never setting foot out of the bazaar and BoT can yield an 8500hp buffless tank.  Taking this same exact magelo and adding the 20ac augs out of MPG ... 15ac augs out of WoS ... 15 ac augs out of ferubi ... 10 ac augs out of ldon ... i think you could add a total of 150ish raw ac ... which should add something like 300ish total shown ac.<br />
<br />
Still a little bit light on the ac ... but fully augmented in single groupable pre-KT encounters i wouldnt be surprised if this magelo was closer to 9000/1750 with 0 buffs ... meaning that with a decent shield you could break 2k ac in raid situations ... never setting foot outside the bazaar for gear and single groupable xp groups for AC augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think the disappointing thing is that, the guild I'm in has druids that get over 10k buffed with raid loot, yet a non raiding warrior can get about 11k. Raiding warriors are probably up near 15k buffed hp. It's a pretty big disparity, and needs to be reigned in at the top end I think. Then again, I'm pretty well over EQ, so it might just be my slightly underwhelmed point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">rough estimation from how things currently are in the bazaar on drinal:<br />
<br />
all the oow gear, if it was up (and i haven't seen 75% of this stuff yet) you could pick up for 100k per slot, some for a bit less imo. for ease of math let's just say some is more than 100k and some is less...averaging out to 100k a slot. add in the HoRZ, BoC, etc.<br />
<br />
i would say that it's not unreasonable to peg this setup at around 2.1Mpp assuming you bought everything for what it would cost right now, not 6 months down the road. and assuming it's all available for your price all at the same time.<br />
<br />
farming, trading, and/or skilling your way to 2.1M is no small feat if you're at the point where this gear would be a big upgrade for you. i think i'd sacrifice some hp to get some ac back into that setup if it was mine.<br />
<br />
heh, i can't even imagine how difficult it would be to find all that stuff, and buy it from people who aren't insisting insane prices for all of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally, it ticks me off that certain raiders get upset about what you can theoretically achieve via buyable gear.  Get over it - the rest of us play the game too and deserve a chance at upgrades without being required to join an uber raiding guild.  Also, it's not like you get a couple million plat for free...that's more than I've probably made in my entire EQ career.<br />
<br />
(yes, I'm ignoring buying plat online...you could also buy a warrior online with 15k hp so I don't consider that route pertinent to the discussion)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You could still earn much, much better gear far easier and faster raiding than earning the plat to get to this setup... which would then still be lacking in AC, and about 3,000 hp below the current end game warrior.   Raiding is still the easiest/quickest path to gear, so I'm not sure what this magelo proves.<br />
<br />
Like Abynormal said you have to ignore buying the plat for it, since you would just buy a raid geared warrior instead for the money involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The point, laura, is that if you would bother sifting through multiple threads on this site you would find numerous complaints that hitting 9-10k buffed these days is very hard to do, and that it is impossible for non-raiders to get EP-quality gear.  Your average player will not farm Hill giants for 2.5 million platinum, but the beauty is that prices will fall and a whole lot of these are gotten in xp groups.  Therefore you can 1) camp it yourself or 2) sell the loots you are winning and/or trade for the new hot item you want.<br />
<br />
You can buy 11k+ buffed hps these days.  Toss in the 1 groupable stuff and you'll see profiles hitting close to 9500/1900 never setting foot in raids.<br />

<br />
It was the &quot;easy&quot; comments that annoyed me... ;)   &quot;Technically possible&quot; and &quot;easy to do&quot; are completely different things.  It's like when knights posted about &quot;warrior agro lock&quot; after incite came out...I replied to those posts because I didn't want anyone at SoE thinking they actually had given warriors agro lock.  I post to threads like this one because I don't want SoE thinking they have made it easy to get near raid-equivalent gear without raiding.  <br />
<br />
Also, even at 9.5k, 1900 ac that's only 2/3 the stats of high-end raiding tanks...<br />
<br />
For the people that posted about not being able to hit 10k buffed post-OoW, yes, I agree they are wrong.  BUT, hitting that is in no way easy, and will require much more time then it would if you raided (especially since the drops to get you to 10k hp are essentially trash drops for high-end guilds so they can be bought with few dkp's.)<br />
<br />
Edit:  in summary...if you don't want to start another debate thread, just post the magelo without the &quot;easy&quot; commentary... ;)</div></div><hr />

 Well, no shit, Sherlock. Of course, the point he's trying to make with his fake magelo is A) wrong and B) stupid. It's not 'easy' to get those upgrades or to buy a Bazaar only 11k buffer - easiest proof? He has to use a fake Magelo because there is no person in game that exists with the gear + incredibly stupid AA purchases. Not ONE tank among 42ish servers. <br />
<br />
 It's a dishonest argument, it's a blatant fantasy, and it's unsupported by the reality of the game as it stands. I award it NO points and NO credence, and any further 'thoughts' of the OP will be treated with all the respect they don't deserve.<br />

<br />
Not quite.  If you look at my profile, which is not maxed out for elemental gear but pretty good, your guy is missing about 400 hps (500 if I bought Sturdy 5 and 600 if I had the new chaotic potential AA) and (more importantly) 400 AC.  Also about 100 saves.  <br />
<br />
Considering elemental is 4th tier gear now, and realistically nobody is gonna buy all that stuff in the bazaar (even if you were able to find it all it would probably cost 5 million plat, and for that much coin from Yantis you could just buy a better-equipped account for less money) I don't see why this is a problem.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just noticed the no augments thing.  That would even things out even more, but like I said, you will never see a guy with this much gear who did nothing but sit in the bazaar, and even if they did it's no worse than buying an account.</div></div><hr />

I've yet to see anyone but me sell them on my server, and I sell them for 5k each no matter how freaking rare they are.  I'm sure I could gouge the crap out of the tradeskillers, but to what end?  All that is going to to is ramp up the price of charged magnetic through the roof.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look ahead 6-12 months, when prices have dropped, availability has increased, and you've had 6-12 months of casually upgrading from the bazaar. Combine this gear with time spent AA/LDoN'n and you can produce a rather solid warrior, quite in line with your average EP equipped tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...correct me if I'm wrong, but PoT is the end game from 2 expansions ago...hardcore raiding tanks should be in GoD or OoW now (and they are), and they have considerably better stats than 9.5k hp and 1900 ac.<br />
<br />
Exactly how many single people have ever killed a mob with a million hp??  Just because you went in a large group and the large group killed a mob doesn't mean you have more skill then someone that grouped with 6 people to kill a mob with 200k hp.  Let's not even go down the &quot;I'm an uber raider and therefore I'm better then an non-raider and I deserve more&quot; line of BS.  I don't care if you believe that, but you're wasting disc space trying to convince me of that crap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Firstly, I do buff to over 11k in full raid-mode.  Why don't i currently have any/more of this gear? Keep reading.<br />
<br />
Secondly i quit almost a full month ago now (shortly after hitting 70).  Several of these items have only been discovered since i quit.  That, and not all of the pieces are notable upgrades (if at all) to what i'm currently wearing. I'd upgrade to some of it, but certainly not all of it.  On our server, however, i do know that my roomate and I discovered the boots before anyone else on Mith marr and long before you could see them on magelo or Alla's.  Thankfully my roomate bard won the roll, otherwise they'd be rotting on my unplayed character.<br />

In fact the only thing that i said was &quot;easy to do&quot; was imply that 9-10k was not hard.  My original statement, which i assume was the one you had problems with was:<br />
<br />
 Hehe for those doubting how easy it is to hit 11k buffed these days ... visit your local bazaar. <br />
<br />
There you have it.  Buyable 8500 hps unbuffed with Zero augments.  You can augment this setup to over 9000 hps unbuffed (can anyone say 12 buffed?).  I, myself, also did it without any of this new attuneable/tradable shit thanks to the new buffs and levels.  If my thread has mislead you Partha i apologize ... perhaps i should have written:  &quot;For those willing to buy ebay'd platinum and/or are willing to work hard on your characters, hitting 11k buffed these days is not all that hard.&quot; Shame on me for thinking you were intelligent enough to catch the implied purpose in the post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I personally find the magelo very useful. There have been many threads in the past from people asking what is the best  they could get in the bazaar. Since PoP, it has always been the same answer: Acid Bracers, Storm boots, HoRZ, etc, etc. For the first time in a long time, we have new tradeable gear that is actually better than the old Velious uber loot. I can guarantee you there will be a new thread in the near future with someone saying &quot;What is the best war I can make, money not an issue,&quot; and this will be linked. <br />
<br />
It is also useful for people like myself who do not raid, but would like to get the best they can with their playstyle. I have plat, I have drive, and now I have a useful resource on potential  upgrades for some of my weaker slots. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only issue I have with any of this is the following:<br />
<br />
You can buy 11k+ buffed hps these days. Toss in the 1 groupable stuff and you'll see profiles hitting close to 9500/1900 never setting foot in raids.<br />
<br />
Those numbers (9500/1900) are really hard, if on the edge of impossible, without raids. I have toyed around with magelo using full Ikkinz/KT/RSS/Epic1.5 loot and augs, and you end up right around 9500/2000AC. One thing that pushes these numbers higher is MPG trials. I have not tried them yet, but from the sounds of it, at least some of the trials seem doable without raid gear. That would push the numbers a bit higher.  Anyway, while I agree those numbers are possible, I don't think more than a handful of non-raiders will reach them before the next expansion is released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Helpful magelo/post to me. I'm unguilded and play almost exclusively in single group mode, so this is the type of stuff that I can look at to help plan gear upgrades. Help give me an idea of what zones/camps I could benefit the most from, etc...  You have to want to pick a fight pretty bad to be attacking Apo over the original post.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, very few single groupers wil be hitting 9500 unbuffed, but looks like its possible.  And Im sure we haven't seen the end of Omens surprises.  Also, as has happened with previous expansions, our definition of &quot;single groupable&quot; will continue to evolve and those numbers might get more realistic than they seem at the moment.<br />
<br />
Im gonna go monkey around with magelo while im supposed to be working and see what I can come up with for single groupable/buyable stuff.</div></div><hr />

As I said in all of my posts...the magelo has very good information...it's the attitude I was commenting on...  Here is the portion of the original post I was referring to:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Drozan_RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Hello all.  I found the post to be an interesting read.  Shows some of the Non raiders that gettin nice gear is possible with some work and dedication.<br />
<br />
I know I am new to posting but I pop in almost daily and read posts and try to find things to better myself as a warrior.  I have been playing my warrior for abour 4 years or so now and learned something that rings true.  I have told friends and guildies many many times.  You could have very high Hps and AC BUT it doesnt make you a good tank.<br />
<br />
The higher Hps and AC just give you room for more error.  If you dont know how to play your class then all those Hps dont mean crap if you cant hold agro or peel casters when they need it.<br />
<br />
Guildie told me a few days ago she had a 70 War in group that couldnt hold agro and she almost died every pull.  I looked up his Magelo and saw he was very close to me in Hps and slightly lower AA but I could absolutely see NO reason he should be having probs grabbing agro and keeping it.<br />
<br />
Feel free to flame me or take my post apart piece by piece.  It really doesnt bother me.  Yes Hps and AC along with AA are wonderful things.  They are simply tools coupled with skill of your class that allow you to be a very good solid Warrior people trust and can depend on.<br />

Hey Drozan - nice to see a new poster here...and you're completely correct...gear and AA's help alot, but learning how to play the class is incredibly important and often overlooked.</div></div><hr />

 Perhaps if he'd post an informative non judgemental post like Ciae's stickied GoD drop post he'd get a better reaction, instead of trying to make a smirky point with a backhanded slap at lesser beings than himself.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Mourneblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Ahh, a very good thread indeed!!<br />
<br />
In all honesty, to become fully Time/GoD equipped requires more than your average non-hardcore guild can give.  Sure, you can pickup-raid your way to most of the great drops but in these situations you are pretty much stuck with a /random chance to get anything.  This would take even more time to achieve.<br />
<br />
I'm all for bazaaring your way to a few more HP's and AC should you need it and have the cash to spend on it.  Not all of us have the ability to farm really great equipment...<br />
<br />
Now, I will state that should you bazaar your way to uberness and not be able to control mobs or play your class then you should be sacrificed to Rallos Zek for your stupidity.<br />
<br />
I play a 65 warrior on the E. Marr server, and am slightly above 7200 hp buffed and roughly 1400ac with only 8 AA.  I have absolutely no problems tanking anything Tactics and below.  This suits me just fine, but trust me..... coming from a casual raiding guild I'd more than happily purchase a few upgrades given the chance.  I'd rather buy a few items than sacrifice myself to the greed of joining an uber guild to achieve the same effect.<br />
<br />
I've worked hard for everything I have, inluding my plat.  It doesn't grow on trees you know :)<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Yeah, cool magelo with good info. We saw that ring drop while exp'ing in Ruined City last night. Upgraded my hard LDoN ring. Mob that dropped it hit for X and did a single target debuff of Y. Easy to get to , but watch out for the see invis mob at pos 234 neg 455. etc...&quot;<br />
<br />
This apparently isn't going to happen. Instead, lets keep grudge fucking each other in every thread on this forum.  Lets battle over sematics at every turn. Lets find imagined insults in every post. Don't let the agendas die! Hate the info cause you hate the source! Feud on! <br />

There was no smirky backhanded slap at &quot;lesser beings&quot; (I assume you're referring to yourself).  If you've inferred as much, that's your problem and not mine.  It seems your e-wang has somehow been insulted, and for that i apologise.<br />

<br />
and this is bad?  12  months from now we will be at the 3 year anniversary of Planes of Power.  Who cares if a bazaar geared player can reach the point where raid tanks were 3 years ago?  By the time anybody can get all this stuff top end tanks will be pushing 20k hps :p.</div></div><hr />

No no, this is definately not a bad thing. This will make it easier for tanks to explore newer content, 1 group and raid enounters alike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're basing it on Buyable items only, there are those nifty new 40% haste augments available. I understand you said no Augments, perhaps as in Grinding LDoN type augments. <br />
<br />
But there is the new augs that are 100% buyable in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">15 ac augs out of ferubi  <br />

I can't see someone with that gear and skill level (little or no raiding exp) tanking ferubi. Ferubi isn't that hard but you don't just walk in there after you get done exping in Poi and own. Especially not the mobs that drop the augs. Again, they aren't really hard but they aren't easy either.<br />
<br />
There's some nice gear out there from oow but it's not all that most of the stuff I see is only 90-110hp and much of it with fairly low ac. It'll help people fill in spots or maybe get a leg up so they can start working the GoD chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">You need raiding experience to tank in Ferubi?  I could have sworn last time I was there Ferubi was 100% easy single-pulls with the occaisional roamer?</div></div><hr />

On my server that Helmet that is 28 ac and 115 hps is the same price as the HoRZ.  Hard choice to make there.  The Velious and CT drops are still the best drops around.

While the old drops are still the best for certain slots (HoRZ, Acid Bracer, BoC). Some drops like storm boots, earth rings, kizrak's legs/BP, etc. are no longer the best. My examples may have been bad, but if someone asks tomorrow about the absolute best bazaar gear, it will in fact be different than it was pre OoW.</div></div><hr />

Check into the Trial of Subversion in MPG. I haven't tried it yet, but from all I have seen, it doesn't need any exceptional gear. Some rediculous shoulders drop in there.</div></div><hr />

If loot for GoD attunables (upper-end) work anything like the 50ac boots in this magelo you MIGHT be able to get them in more ways than one.  It was once thought these boots only came off the new epic encounters, but our xp groups have dug up a very small number of these boots xping in RSS.  It's not entirely unbelievable, then, to assume that there might be some sharing of loot tables btw epic encounter mobs and higher level named in the harder zones.<br />
<br />
So to say, at this point in time, that you need a mini raid force may not be entirely accurate.</div></div><hr />
