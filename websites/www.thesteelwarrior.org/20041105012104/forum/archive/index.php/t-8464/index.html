<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many people have told me that  the Cord Hilted Spike Driver (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16391) and the Great Blade of Storms (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17368) are about the same for aggro weapons, but what I want to know is which one you think is better (even if only a tiny bit better), and why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GBOS is better from my observations.  I have both weapons, and had less aggro issues main handing GBOS and offhanding CHSD.  For a while I tried each in main hand.  Also, the DPS from the GBOS is higher from the ratio and the proc.<br />

No parsing, no data, just pure subjective observations :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe that the combination of better ratio and the higher than inate proc rate (listed somewhere around here) gives the GBoS an edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">GBoS has better dps and a proc with roughly equal aggro.<br />
GBoS has more hps.<br />
<br />
It really isnt hard to see which is better  :D <br />
<br />
14/18- somewhere over 400 hate per proc which adds dps (stronger than anger2)<br />
13/19- 450 hate raw, measurable <br />
<br />
Both are great weapons for their respective level, but the hammer is not that good by comparison.  GBoS is better.  I've had both and have several tanks in my lineup who've had both.  The GBoS is the all-around preferred weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GBoS. Reasons all posted above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GBoS doesn't have an enhanced proc rate, it's still better for all the other reasons listed. CHSD isn't anything to to sneeze at either though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GBoS doesn't have an enhanced proc rate <br />
<br />
You are correct its 070 value is zero...hrmm my mind must be slipping</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">might have confused it with that other weapon from tactics or whatever, obsidian scimitar of war or somesuch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GBoS &gt;&gt; CHSD.  CHSD was nice when I first got it.  I used it for a long time, but as soon as I got my GBoS, it went to the main hand, and has stuck there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">More common then the CHSD too - goto GBOS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The CHSD proc is unresistable, 450 hate, and you cannot loose to a ranger rolling on it lol.  GBoS is better if you dont get hopped over by another group on the way up =O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The CHSD proc is unresistable, 450 hate, and you cannot loose to a ranger rolling on it lol. GBoS is better if you dont get hopped over by another group on the way up =O<br />
<br />
Dont roll on it.<br />
Make it the goal.<br />
<br />
Grab 6-18 friends and say &quot;Hey! Come help me get a GBoS, might get an ornate BP out of the deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Depending on the mentality and comradarie of your guild, it is possibly the easiest weapon to obtain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GBoS is better than CHSD, coming from someone who has both and used/uses them for quite a while. I still have GBoS equipped, but offhand, with OSoW primary. <br />
<br />
GBoS is pretty easy to get, short respawn is nice. I got mine one night when i was sitting in bot AFK, and a group of time+ wanted to kill the towers, and invited me along to be a second tank. Piece of cake. If you cant do this, then a raid of 18 tops should be able to get one for ya, as mentioned.<br />
<br />
CHSD is great, but I don't even think it's worth the trouble nowadays. Go from cookie cutter CHoS/SotBS and then get the GBoS and offhand CHoS. This lasts you til OSoW, BoC, ssra weaps, etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the only weapon i've personally obtained that could pry my GBoS out of my mainhand was my BoW.<br />
The CHSD is good; but the GBoS is; like; dozekar loot...easy(relative) and well worth time investing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;The CHSD proc is unresistable, 450 hate, and you cannot loose to a ranger rolling on it lol.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unclebong, the stun proc on GBoS will produce the same amount of hate whether it is resisted or not. Unresistable doesn't really matter in the case of stun/aggro procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In all fairness, its just as easy to kill Xanamech to get the hammer.  Plus you can spawn him like every two hours or something?  Personally I would take the GBoS over the hammer, which is what I did, I have both, but I bagged the CHSD.  However, I would take whichever one I could.  Infact, I would use both, I think the CHSD is a better weapon than the CHoS.<br />
<br />
Redleaf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They are approximately the same difficulty, but I would have to say that the clearing time for Eindride is less, and there's no gnome NPC to fall under the world or accidentally kill when you go to Eindride.  And as mentioned previously, the drop rate for GBOS is higher than for CHSD, and the alternate loot items are much better on Eindride.  (The next person who says that a 50hp haste choker is good, in these days of tribute haste, shall be shot!) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">GBoS is a little bit better aggro yes, the proc is about the same aggro however the DPS from the GBoS pushes it out ahead in the aggro department.<br />
<br />
however, in stats i think the weapons are about the same. the CHSD has 35 total resists with the GBoS only at 15. i also know that when i was wielding both weapons, i was lowish on stamina so the 12sta on the CHSD was also attractive. <br />
<br />
they are both nice weapons for the difficulty in getting them, if you have both then the GBoS is better mainhanded but overall i view them pretty equal in terms of nice-ness</div></div><hr />
