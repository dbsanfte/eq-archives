<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow comrades, name is krorghar MT of Rerum Daemonis a pre-elemental guild of antonius baile server. Will spend some time in these forums triying to learn from the more experienced. First question is about equipment, here u can see my magelo.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=822226<br />
<br />
Actually we got enough punch to do BOT towers, but slighty more.<br />
I got 110K in bank and I am anxious to purchase/loot a upgrade.<br />
What stuff would u guys think it will be best for me at the moment? any hints, oppinions or commentaries welcome..<br />
<br />
many thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your stuff is near the best possible droppable equipment you can get your hands on. (You probably know the remaining items/will get them out of Tak/will get them aug'd)<br />
<br />
So there isn't really any purchasable direction you should go.<br />
<br />
To get your hps higher, you can dig up the Shaderock Amulet from the Va'dyn in Akheva 100 hps in neck slot. sucky AC, but 55 more hps is a lot compared to your limited options atm.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it seems to be as though you need Vex Thall/Elemental flags to get your stuff to start going up again.<br />
<br />
Not sure what your raiding profile is, but that is your next step.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Many thanks guys, Ill try to find these stuff, specially the black plated collar, but seems to be uber rare, only saw one in the bazaar and was in the 150Kis range. Sol C is still up? or its no more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not sure if it is still there or not so I can not give you a straight answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jacobpr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi Krorghar...One upgrade that you might want to look into would be boots...I suggest &quot;Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites&quot; as aa non-no-drop purchasabe upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The black plated collar drops (or also drops) in Tactics off Swordshitter or one with about identical stats as it has been a while since we killed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Amazingly everyone has missed the most obvious big ticket item - get a BoC. I just got mine a couple of weeks ago and I can't begin to tell you how much better this weapon is that anything in your current arsenal. BoC+GBoS is flat bad ass. Great DPS, great agro and fairly easy to get, particularly if you have a load of plats.<br />
<br />
The rest of the items you could upgrade to would be marginal upgrades at best, save your plats and get a BoC, you won't regret it.<br />
<br />
And as far as I know, Black Platred Collar drops in Tactics, not SolC.</div></div><hr />
