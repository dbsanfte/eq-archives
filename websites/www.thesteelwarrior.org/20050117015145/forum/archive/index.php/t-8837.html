<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tried this for first tiem tonite with guildmates. things seemed to go ok at first, we killed a named and i got haste bracer by default then we cleared boss room and killed the first boss. iused furious/stonewall on him and both the rogue and the ranger used dps disciplines. he went down no prob, we waited for stonewall to recycle and moved to next named. this time cleric and shammy ran out of mana, cleric at about 25-30 and shammy at 10 or so. i tanked him to 4 percent and died, the cleric died and the ranger WS him til dead. We rezzed up at the ent and moved back, by that time all 3 bosses were back up so we changed strat a lil and started with boss1. this time i only used stonewall and neither of the dps guys disced. i did however swap to a 2hander dps sword after i had built good aggro, this seemed to help a lot and the healers had plenty of mana. we moved to 2nd one and i ae taunted it and we killed it as well. i think the ranger may have trueshotted on it, not sure. again mana was ok and we killed roamer respawn while waiting for disc. disc popped up, cleric and shammy got FM and we called go. here is where it went to shit. it seemed like he insta summoned the cleric and the shammy even before i hit him. ae taunt was still down and both my taunts failed so healers went smush and then chanter went smush, rogue escaped and i went smush, then ranger went smush and rogue sighed. it was late so we didnt try again. i need some help in figuring out exactly what happened on 3rd boss. i have some ideas but im not sure about them and i couldnt find anything on 3rd trial in search. <br />
<br />
1 why did the cleric and shammy get summoned when mob was still at 100 percent? ive heard of mobs doing this but i dont remember actually seeing one do it til now<br />
<br />
2. does it matter what order you kill the three in? im guessig it doesnt, im assuming whichever is last will pop the bonus adds and stuff<br />
<br />
3 do you think cleric and shammy built up large amount of aggro from previous 2 boss fights?<br />
<br />
4. is the summon based on line of sight? if so, maybe if my fat ass had gotten over the wall faster it woudnt have happened<br />
<br />
any thoughts or help will be greatly appreciated as i rethink the strat for next try</div></div><hr />

1. When you have cleared the zone, and all you have left is the 3 named and the little archers, go to the far door behind and to the left of the nameds, and EVERYONE camps out but the tank.  Kill the first named, EVERYONE camps out but the tank. Rinse repeat for the last named.  The aggro is very odd here, and the best way is for the group to camp out and clear aggro, or healers/debuffers will get instasummoned and you'll be screwed.<br />
<br />
2. No.  The way I do it is we go to the door and kill the left one first, and move right, using the camp technique.  And not sure what you mean by bonus adds.<br />
<br />
3. Yes, and the aggro doesn't seem to be numeric at all when the fight starts, he'll just summon whoever he wants.<br />
<br />
4. No, they'll summon a cleric through those little walls seperating the nameds.</div></div><hr />

had this happen once when the shm pet went wild due to lousy attention after the romaing Kyv<br />
and yes, it does not matter in which order you kill them, middle one is the hardest.</div></div><hr />

Have your healers relog after you do each of the bosses, while you wait for your disc to reload.  It should save them being summoned at the beginning.<br />
<br />
edit: The middle guy has the weirdest aggro, I think.  It might be worth it for the ranger to WS it and build aggro, then AET+incite off him.  Consider saving furious for the last one, it helps a lot if an add pops unexpectedly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cool, camping was what we were planning on trying, we had the chanter camp a lot sicne he was pulling and kept geting boss aggro<br />
<br />
was already waiting for stonewall, will wait for ae taunt too now<br />
<br />
our shammy didnt have a pet up and we didnt have any other pet classes. both cleric and shammy say he was at 100 when summoned, i know i was about to engage and i saw him summon the cleric<br />
<br />
we didnt clear the entire zone, just to their room<br />
<br />
we killed left, then middle, when we went to kill the last one i noticed adds both in front of his cubby like the others but also 2 more in the cubby with him. those are the bonus adds i meant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryanosky</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get a kick out if it when I hear people having thier healers log out before they engage each boss, that probably makes things harder.  Perma rooted mobs act differenty than PC rooted mobs in that they wont attack anyone other than the person at the top of hate list.  <br />
<br />
So say your cleric has agro on the next flesh hunter from the previous one you killed.  No problem, just move in the room of the one you just killed and have anyone you dont want to get hit hide in the corner, might take a DD spell here and there but in no danger whatsoever.  Med up, wait for disc or whatever you gotta do to prepare for the next hunter in the corner.  When you are set, have the tank go in the room of the next hunter and literally stand in front of it, its still agro on the cleric and wont attack anyone else.  You can either sit there and taunt till a successful one or go ahead and ae taunt it.  When it starts attacking you from a successful taunt it is certain no one will get summoned unless the tank sucks at holding agro.  Repeat this process for the next and you should find it to be the easier of the 3 single groupable trials.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you went ahead and started attacking it when you cleric had a ton of agro and the moment you got it to 96% it summoned him/her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope, they got summoned before i was fully in position to start on the last boss, mob was definitely at 100 percent. we all looked over the text for a bit while waiting for cleric to get back to ikkinz to rez and the summoning messages were before my taunt message. since taunt is the first part of my attack hotkey im sure i wasnt attacking yet and i know the ranger and rogue werent either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never seen them summon until they have taken any damage. I just start the fight on the second and third with AE taunt before attacking and I have never had a problem. Camping would work as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the bonus adds pop if you don't kill the bosses fast enough.  If you kill the bosses within about 5 minutes of each other, they don't happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prepare in advance:<br />
<br />
I do them in the order of &quot;last one first&quot;, then middle, then the first one last.<br />
<br />
The middle one is more or less &quot;melee only&quot;, pretty much entirely MR, thus open with furious with a BIG 2h weapon, then stonewall, other melee using offensive discs (or HT if applicable).<br />
<br />
I also have the healers camp between each kill.   I've had the whole group summonned even AFTER an AE taunt landed on the last mob, thus camping them is safest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healers can camp but what I found to work well is to chain incite every time it wears off by poping your head up on the wall and then backing off. You may take 400-500 in arrow damage but thats minor compared to the 1100 hate you get. By the time you get in there you will have rock solid agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We move to the left wall also and begin from there.<br />
<br />
When we're ready the last few times we've had a cleric da run down the line to pop all the adds and aggro them.Be careful with that cause once one of our clerics had da dispelled.As you move in to hit each fleshhunter his adds will stay focused on the cleric who is out of los.Therefore no one gets hit by the arrows.<br />
<br />
I'm a lightweight so I weight for discs and ae taunt and stonewall each fleshhunter.Healers will have lots of aggro built up normally so I ae taunt before damaging them.Pretty sure they can't summon without being damaged.<br />
<br />
Think they go from the far left cubby on entering; fire resistant,magic resistant and then cold resistant.Not sure cause well i don't nuke hehe.The middle one is mr though and my wife slows him with disease slow.<br />
<br />
There is a local roamer on about a 30minute repop.If you go with discs you can beat him by a little bit.However, if you're delayed or have low dps expect a Kyv roamer to visit once during trial if waiting for discs.</div></div><hr />
