Again, im broke, and even if i did have cash it would go twds upgrading armor.  Someone suggested the SH in my main hand, but it's a piercer, so my atk will suffer...thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I've never used a Frostbringer but according to about everyone here it seems to own as far as holding agro.  I use Shadow Hear and Long Sword of Freedom for my 1handers but I don't use them anymore got me a GSoT.  Me personally I would do Frostbringer Mainhand and Club of the Ice Ocean offhand the 149dd proc is nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your atk will not suffer as long as you have piercing at the same skill level as 1hs/1hb. With this in mind, I would definitely keep the ribcracker in secondary, sell the club of ice ocean, and either use frosty main ( for aggro ) or Shadow Heart main ( dps )<br />
<br />
Also, what level are ya? Depening on your level/guild/friends, you could probably farm drops in veksar, chardokb, etc. There's some really nice weapons dropping in the new revamped zones, might be worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Platinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">in 50 to 60 i was like a  Wavecrasher and Frosti.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aratus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For aggro I'd go with Frostbringer/Ribcracker. I'm not a big fan of that Ice Ocean Club, though I've never used it so I couldn't say for sure. For Dps, Shadow Heart/Ribcracker looks good.<br />
<br />
Definately save up for a Greatstaff of Thunder though, prices are tanking lately so it shouldn't be too hard to purchase one, have seen some for 8500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm goin on lvl 62 now, and am in a guild whose latest accomplishment is dropping AoW.  As you probably suspect i did not tank AoW ;)  In fact, i dropped pretty quickly tanking rumblecrush and almost instantly tanking doomshade.  I am the new guildie on the block, so unfortunately I am in no real position to request assistance in equipping.<br />
<br />
For aggro I'd go with Frostbringer/Ribcracker.<br />
<br />
Aratus,<br />
Why would you choose the Ribcracker (RC) over the Shadowheart (SH)?  It ls my understanding that the SH and RC have comparable damage output, while the SH attacks significantly faster.  That generates more aggro, correct? Am i missing something?<br />
<br />
Btw, for damage output i have a Stonebladed Axe of Dismay (44/44), so for the purposes of this thread im talking strictly aggro generation.  I threw the Lodi club in the mix because i was unsure how significant its proc was for generating aggro.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to another question entirely and that is:<br />
How much aggro does a given proc generate?  I know stuns are good and debuffs, but I've never seen anything to quantify their +hate value....is it a 1-1 thing, as in 149DD = 149hate? More less?  What about DoTs, debuffs and stuns?  At what point is it time to replace your old procing weapons (been using frosty and Lodi club since 51) with weapons which are simply higher DPS?  I guess i just need to do more testing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used the 44/44 axe for agro. It was pretty nice, then I got a GSoT.<br />
<br />
I kept being called a pally though, and that made me cry :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depending on what you are fighting, faster is not always better as long as they have similar ratios.  If you are fighting something that ripostes a lot or ENRAGE, slower but more damaging can be a big benefit.  Ever have a brain camp for a second and miss an ENRAGE while wielding two fast weapons?  You end up dieing pretty quickly.:eek: <br />
<br />
I dualed a frosty/club of the ice ocean for a very long time, and I was always disappointed in the club.  The proc on the club is nice, but it generates no aggro what so ever.  I would probably go Frosty in main, and then whatever your best ratio weapon is in the other.<br />
<br />
I saw someone begging people to buy his GSoT last night for 6500pp.  Great weapon and a reasonable price.  Same goes for War Marshall's Bladed Staff.  Both will keep aggro well and are dropping in price like mad.  Just something to keep in mind if you want to ditch all of your 1Hers and switch to a 2Her.  I usually only break out the 1Hers if I am having problems letting someone else keep aggro, and then I cannot use the good aggro producing ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are wanting good agro on a budget you have a couple choices. First of all, I would sell both tradeable weapons. While the Frosty may have the best agro, it's really not that spectacular. Once you sell your tradeable weapons - all of them - then start shopping for a GSoT. The way prices are dropping you should be able to pick one up rather inexpensively.<br />
<br />
Once you get a GSoT, you will have a pretty good all purpose agro/DPS weapon. Now you can spend some time farming. Get a group and head to Droga for the king camp. The mobs are easy, but they do have a bit of HP. Take a DPS heavy group so you can kill fast and keep up with a lot of spawns. You want to be able to keep the king room AND the pool room right outside clear. This will give you a shot at a Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn if either named pops. Then you can ditch the SH and use droga weapon main/ribcracker offhand. If you get lucky you might get both. Either weapon is great to pair with a BoC when you get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aratus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Faster isn't always better. Don't forget that you have no damage bonus going to the off-hand weapon. So generally it's best to stick the best ratio weapon you can in there, unless your dual'ing proc weapons or something.<br />
<br />
As for your aggro on proc questions: Regular DD's give a very low amount of aggro, I can chain proc a Snowchipper three or four times and not pull off a Ranger Call of Fire proc. Dots'll do a decent amount of aggro depending on the dot. Things hate being AC debuffed, and Stuns are golden.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder all the way, it has the versatility and multi-purpose role your seeking.</div></div><hr />
