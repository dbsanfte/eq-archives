Procs are one big random factor.  Another is the taunt skill check, which may or may not work on a given attempt.  Both of these factors alone can cause ping pong within melee groups.  Likewise, people who use feign or evade to reduce aggro don't always succeed.<br />
<br />
Proximity to the mob is another factor that can change from fight to fight.  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I should have clarified.  For example, as our guild has a lot of warriors and paladins, we'll often have grinding groups of 4 tanks, cleric, and chanter/shammy.  The mobs will ping-pong between the melees.. only 1 of whom is taunting or using proc weapons (the MT).  I'm sorry, I figured ppl would realize that I was talking about situations where procs or taunts would not explain it.  In this same situation, feign death/evade is not an issue.  I'll agree somewhat on the proximity agro factor, but only to a very minor extent.  We're usually pretty good about melee range, with the tank being right on top of the mob.</div></div><hr />

Well, I do believe 100% that each attack that is made is a set hate value.  However, the random element is of course taunt checks, procs, etc.  Which you addressed.  The one thing you didn't think of was the double/triple/flurry/riposte rates.  You never make a set number of attacks.  Sometimes you double, sometimes you triple, sometimes the tank ripostes, etc, etc.  All of which will affect agro.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I am away from EQ at the moment, but I hope to do some more parses by the end of the week.</div></div><hr />

You're absolutely correct, I didn't take that into consideration, and that would explain most if not all of my observations.  Me bad.  Looking forward to seeing any more parses you can come up with.</div></div><hr />

I have tanked Emperor using shissar bane 2hander (with orb of sky clicky buff and some insta clicks for initial agro), bloodfrenzy/boc and a blade of war on our last kill.<br />
Although i did 0 real damage (except force of ykesha procs which were resisted completely a lot) and still he was glued on me better than i could remember from using dual wield EB or bane weapon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synapticus</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What i am wondering is if the hate per swing is reduced in using defensive disc.  It reduces how hard you hit, but does it reduce the aggro per swing (aka potential hate) as well?  I wonder this because a common hotkey is &quot;/rsaid Defensive up... watch your aggro&quot; or something along those lines, I am wondering now.. is &quot;watch your aggro&quot; really necessary?<br />
<br />
As an addendum, its pretty clear now that evasive should not (in theory) affect your aggro output, you stil have potential to hit as hard, you just wont land half you hits.</div></div><hr />

If this is true it would explain while we've always percieved that faster main hand weapons generate more agro, even when those weapons aren't doing more damage (ie the ratio is worse but the still hold agro better).  The damage of the main hand weapon is less important than the delay....except where the minimum jumps up to 2 - ie 15 damage weapons in secondary OR primary should be a jump up from lesser-damage weapons.<br />
<br />
If you use the above forumla suggested by Kaledan you could find a Hate Value based on Hate per swing divided by delay.<br />
<br />
Hate Value = (DB + 11 * MINIMUM)/delay<br />
<br />
<br />
Kaledan: how are you calculating minimum hit (particularly on the 2 handers)??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaledan</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The formula for minimum damage is RND(DAM/10), where DAM is weapon damage value and RND is mathematical rounding (1.2 -&gt; 1, 17 -&gt; 2, 1.5 -&gt; 2).<br />

soru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, lets run the math.<br />
<br />
BoC mainhand: 13 + 22 Hate Per Attack (HPA) = 35 HPA.<br />
BoC offhand: 22 HPA.<br />
BoC proc hate per second: 700 / 30 = 23.33 HPS<br />
<br />
BoC mainhand hasted HPS: 1.8 (DA) * 2 * 35 / 2 + 23.33 = 86.3333 HPS<br />
<br />
BoC offhand hasted HPS: 1.8 * 2 * 22 / 2 * 0.8 + 23.33 = 55 HPS. (probably have proc rate wrong for an offhand)<br />
<br />
Primal (or other 20 delay, &lt; 15 damage weapon) offhand hasted  HPS: 1.8 * 2 * 11 / 2 * .8 = 15.84 HPS<br />
<br />
BoC primary/Primal offhand HPS: 102.17 HPS.<br />
<br />
GSoT HPS (no AA): 1.8 * (33 + 36) * 2 / 3 = 82.8 HPS + stun proc.<br />
<br />
Placing a stun proc at 700 hate, that's 106.133 HPS.  GSoT aggro should be roughly the same as BoC+Primal.  It needs 575 hate per second to match the hate of a BoC + Primal.<br />
<br />
If the 2 H AA abilities boost 2H swing rate by any significant degree, the GSoT will own a BoC+Primal (or the like) combo.<br />
<br />
There are a few edges to 2 1 H weapons.  First, if you can get both of their damage at 15 or above (according to the round rules outlined), you are in a good place.  Second, if they both have aggro procs, and both are augmented with LDoN +aggro procs (either stun or anger), you can get (probably) better aggro than with a single proc and single LDoN +aggro proc.<br />
<br />
Very interesting model, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, here is an intersting question:<br />
Is there really a large hate step going from 14 to 15 damage?<br />
<br />
Blade of Tactics has 14 damage (the non-proc warrior epic sword)<br />
Centi Warhammer has 15 damage (a cheap bazaar vendorable weapon).<br />
<br />
If the &quot;round * 11&quot; math is correct, the Centi Warhammer in the offhand should take half as many swings to steal aggro compared to the Blade of Tactics.<br />
<br />
A pretty simple test, and the results should either confirm or deny the rounding * 11 theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would deduce from his earlier posts that double and triple attack count as two and three attacks each respectively.  Here is why… <br />
<br />
He mentions that some tests went an attack or two over the normal number because the last attack was a double or triple attack.  What are the odds that those were the ONLY double and triple attacks he had in any of the trials?  I would assume that he had them sprinkled throughout, and he counted them like any other attack.  The results he posted would not have been as consistent as they were if double and triple attacks only generated one attack's worth of aggro.<br />
<br />
By the way, this is a great thread.  Thank you for the time you have invested in this Brotha Thepp!  Let's see if we can get some other folks to do some parsing here to spread the work around and corroborate the results.<br />

<br />
Hate Value = (DB + 11 * MINIMUM)/delay<br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
One Handers:<br />
<br />
Hategiver (15/19)<br />
(13+22)/19 = 1.84<br />
<br />
Curse-Smelted Long Blade (16/19 - LDoN purchase w/ a +2 dam aug - total cost 2300 points):<br />
(13+22)/19= 1.84<br />
<br />
BoC (15/20):<br />
(13 + 22)/20 = 1.75<br />
<br />
Galdiator's Jereed (15/22):<br />
(13 + 22)/22 = 1.59<br />
<br />
Sunflower Thorn(5/16):<br />
(13+11)/16 = 1.5<br />
<br />
Great BLade of Storms (14/18):<br />
(13+11)/18 = 1.33<br />

Splitblade of Destruction (14/19):<br />
(13+11)/19 = 1.26<br />

<br />
Two Handers:<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of the Four Winds (41/31):<br />
(36+44)/31 = 2.58<br />
<br />
Timeworn Desert Spear(35/32 - LDoN purchase):<br />
(37+44)/32 = 2.53<br />
(Note: this is an 1150 point item with no additional Augs)<br />
<br />
War Marshall's Bladed Staff (31/28):<br />
(35+33)/28 = 2.43<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder (31/30):<br />
(36+33)/30 = 2.3<br />
<br />
Windblade (50/44):<br />
(45+55)/44 = 2.27<br />
<br />
Obviously weapons which have a built-in taunting proc will do better than the numbers would indicate, but it is interesting to compare how the dam/delay ratio directly impacts the taunt factor.  <br />
<br />
Again, this is pretty much pure speculation at this point...</div></div><hr />

<br />
IE: Do double, triple, etc attacks effect the outcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a pretty interesting read, thanks for doing this.  When you use the sk to add +hate however, have the sk get in melee range of the mob first then cast terror spells as they give only 1 hate when the caster is standing outside of the mob's hitbox.  Also, I dont suppose youll be willing to try this for other classes?  I would be willing to bet monks/rogues/beastlords and possibly rangers/bards all recieve less hate while using the same weapon, also Warriors generate more than Knights with the same weapon some of this obviously is due to an increased number of swings but it might be worth looking into to see if you have an innate aggro modifier which I would be willing to bet you do as 1 enraging blow proc gives you more hate than me casting a terror of thule/terris combo (1110 hate), yet a 2 thule combo still keeps me ahead (1200 hate), however since eb is only listed as 700, it seems like theres a modifier there somewhere...</div></div><hr />
