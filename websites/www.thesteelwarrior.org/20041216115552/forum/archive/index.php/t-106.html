Anyone have a clue why that would be as intended??  an exact 7 day spawn is horrendus.  A)  one week flag mobs suck.  B)  with no randomness its very easy for a guild or timezone to manopolize that spawn for months.  We finally killed him last week cus of a server reset that bumped his spawn past the euro primetime.  Was our first shot at him and we had been looking for months.  So anyways, anyone have a clue why they would want it to work like that?  Maby im missing something but seems rediculious.........</div></div><hr />

There is in fact a pattern to the way spawns work and it is not entirely random, don't make assumptions that anyone can monopolize a spawn, treat it just like you would anything else and watch it, you need to know when it died and over time you'll be able to reasonably predict when it will come back up.</div></div><hr />
