I was hoping that someone who has completed the quest could tell me if it is really worth the time anymore. Any other information would be helpful as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance (if you deserve it that is)<br />

BTW this is my virgin post, been hitting the site for a month or so though  (c=<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That quest is a bitch. Seriously. I thought the naginata was worth it, but I just like those weapons, so hey =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've heard the proc is decent aggro.  The problem is, the weapons ratio is only 37 / 40, subpar compared to the standard buyable 2handers (GSoT, WMBS, WB).  The quest is long, and really is a bitch.  If you have your smithing up, and don't mind taking a lot of time working on it, then it might be worth it.  Though GSoT is really cheap these days, and I believe would outperform it in dps, aggro, and hps.  It would be a very unique weapon that few would know about though, and would be a fairly proud item to wield, knowing what you had to go through to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Still working this on Torv, the only part that I now need to do is to go to the arena and get the dang chromium ore.... other than that most of this is duoable by a shaman and warrior /grin.... <br />
Anyway I want it as my guild isn't big enough to finish my epics yet, so this is my alternate epic for now ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vladimoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your guild isn't big enough to finish your epics yet then I highly doubt you will be able to muster the forces required to kill the dragon you spawn in Dragon Necropolis.  <br />
<br />
Just something to keep in mind in case you weren't familiar with the entire quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bombay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i've completed this, only one on xev as far as i know.  its cool and all, but i have recently swapped it out for a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We can get a few people together from the friends list to do the final battle, we never have any issues with that sort of thing, just not enough time or motivation to try and do teh epics.<br />
<br />
Just need a trip to HS, (group is all keyed now) and a piece of ore from down by the statue, hehe cake walk if I can find out what guilds are doing him on Torv, have the blade and the staff made and in the bank just need about 54 more combines and two pieces and I will have completed this as well.</div></div><hr />
