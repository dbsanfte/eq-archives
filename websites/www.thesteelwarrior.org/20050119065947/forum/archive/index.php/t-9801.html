Stick to 1 handers for now. Leave out Augments, because everyone has them, and lets see how far we can get! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johnjacobjingle</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or update them?</div></div><hr />

For instance you look in the bunker and almost every day you see 3-4 new &quot;Gear Check&quot; &quot;Upgrade Me&quot; &quot;Help with Gear&quot; &quot;New Armor&quot; threads, and if they would just look at the ones already posted they could see what good upgrades are and about how much they would cost.  People will still ask no matter what you do.</div></div><hr />

I agree, what i found funny about this was it was someone basically saying the same thing you are, but at the same time not recognizing that there is a running sticky thread himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johnjacobjingle</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pages and pages on the sticky thread O_o<br />
Jagged Blade of War still not listed<br />
Brutish Blade of Balance still not listed<br />
Thunderclap still not listed<br />
Champion's Sword of Eternal Power still not listed<br />
Reinforced Sandstone-hilt Sword still not listed<br />
Bone-rending Battle Sword still not listed<br />
<br />
I’ve got all the time in the world to read threads, and do, but when there’s an out dated list people keep ignoring, try not to complain to the people trying to help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Common sense &gt; all</div></div><hr />

Thats great, so post them in the sticky then =P<br />
<br />
And btw, most of those you listed are in the thread.</div></div><hr />

Most of the questions people have with agro is which weapon is better. 1HS and 1HB should be listed together. Same with 2HS and 2HB. No one looks at slashing and blunt anymore because there both maxed out. I'd just like to see two full and up to date lists for agro in sticky. That's all! And yes every weapon does need to be broken down, because if not people will still ask for them to be :p</div></div><hr />
