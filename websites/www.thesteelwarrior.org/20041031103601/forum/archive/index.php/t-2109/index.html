<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does the proc have a stun component like I saw someone say?<br />
According to Lucy it's only a dd but then again why would it be in the list of best aggro weapons?<br />
Hope someone can verify this,if not I'll test it on some giants tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rolsdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Proc is 179dd + knockback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if lucy says it doesnt have a knockback it doesnt have one :)<br />
Maybe the unresistable part gives extra agro... ask enchanters regarding Tash :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">179 DD and 1 ft knockback and unresistable.<br />
<br />
<br />
I used it a longer time and it was great for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Poison counters are why tash pulls so much aggro, not cause of the unresistable factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ONE poison counter causes that much agro?<br />
What good poison proc agro weapons do we know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if lucy says it doesnt have a knockback it doesnt have one<br />
<br />
heh<br />
<br />
lucy is damn good but as a friend pointed out, people rely on it waaaaaaay too much. Unresistability doesn't add aggro.<br />
<br />
Gaudralek has a tiny knockback. It's been documented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In lucy under the RAW section<br />
<br />
pushback 1 <br />
<br />
The spell proc reports:<br />
Cast on other: Someone has been force struck. <br />
<br />
This is the same for the spell &quot;Force Shock&quot;<br />
except Force Shock caries <br />
2:  Stun(0.00 sec) <br />
<br />
Im not postitive what a 0second stun actually does but Force Shock has &quot;pushback 1&quot; also and the same &quot;proc message&quot;.  It could be possible that the proc is identical but the developers (or lucy could be wrong) have forgot to add the Stunn proc to the &quot;Rage of the Sky&quot;.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, Gaudralek has an unresistable proc which carries a pushback of 1, and Lucy has it listed accurately.<br />
<br />
As for poison counters, I don't think they add that much aggro. Maybe it's just the, uh... -50 magic resistance factor of Howl of Tashan which pulls as much aggro as it does? If you really want to test though, there's a dagger similar to bloodpoint (also warrior usable, I forget the name) which drops in The Deep, procs a poison DoT which adds 9 poison counters.  I wouldn't try tanking with it myself. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah like Dubb said, the poison counters aren't what give Tash a lot of agro. Tash didn't always have poison counters you know :p. Even a long time ago enchanters would talk about deathtashing on boss mobs at the start of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It has a 0.0 stun too; I've never had it not interrupt a mob's cast when it went off.  Mobs can channel through a 1 ft pushback sometimes.<br />
<br />
 Very nice weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If a weapon has a stun component any mobs above level 55 will not be affected by it. You will get a message that the mob is immune to stuns. It would not matter if the proc was un-resistable or not, mobs above level 55 will be immune, even 0.0 sec stuns. The only time a mob will be stunned, or casting interrupted is with a planar stun type weapon; this proc is up to 65. Unless the mob is flagged for no interrupts, sometimes being pushed can in fact cause an interrupt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Snowz, you obviously don't have a Gaudralek.  The proc is unresistable.  It works on anything.  No &quot;your stun spell didnt take hold&quot; message.  My monk has several weapons that give that message (t-staff, baton of royal stature, adamtite club) so I know what you're referring to.<br />
<br />
Gaudralek WILL interrupt mobs if it procs, no if's and's, or buts about it, at least up to and including Bastion of Thunder, HoH and Plane of Tactics which is as high as I'm flagged for.<br />

Isn't this the entire thread for Pali stun agro?  They use there low level stuns and take agro even though mob is not affected??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If Rage of the Sky indeed has a stun component built in, what slot does it take up? Say for arguments sake Rage of the Sky does have a stun component on slot 2; unresistable 179DD + 0.0 second stun. If a mob is flagged to be immune to stuns please explain how this stun would ever take hold. Unresistable and immune are two separate things all together. <br />
<br />

<br />
Stuns generate agro period; it makes no difference if the mob is immune or not. I don't think this was the argument in this thread.</div></div><hr />

Snowz, you obviously don't have a Gaudralek.  The proc is unresistable.  It works on anything.  No &quot;your stun spell didnt take hold&quot; message. <br />
<br />
That's because it doesn't have a stun component =P, which is what Snowz was telling you.  I don't doubt that the knockback interrupts, but that doesn't make it a stun.  If it was a stun, it would say so in Lucy, and you would get the &quot;immune&quot; message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Misunderstood you Snowz... it is affected, just you will get a message stating immune.   When my Hammer and Bone-Blade proc on an &quot;immune&quot; they still get &quot;pushback 1&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Arent there 2 types of stuns? the pre PoP stuns and the post PoP stuns? bit like the palie cast stuns? my Norge'tal doesnt stun PoP xp mobs - but the 6 ft push pisses em off guud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tested it in Kael last night.<br />
Copper hammer of striking generated the immune message,Gaudralek didn't.<br />
So I guess it has a knockback that interrupts and pisses them off but no stun.<br />
Question answered tho,good aggro because of the knockback.<br />
Thanks for your replies :)</div></div><hr />

He's not too hard of a fight since he's Disease slowable (40%), but I would have imagined that he was insane before the introduction of PoP.  <br />
<br />
Still, no Gaudralek, but he drops great loot nevertheless.  Dropped 2 of those Knight hammers and those really, really awesome gaunts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Before Lucy, what a proc did was subject to misunderstanding. I in fact concluded from published info the Gaudralek had a 0 sec stun and wrote it at this site - it doesn't (according to Lucy).<br />
<br />
179 DD 1 Knockback Unresistable.<br />
<br />
Although I have a BoC, I often tank with Gaudralek for a couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Using two 2Hdrs can get you reposted to death.<br />
<br />
2. BoC doesn't proc often enough (IMO) that you can use a Furious Bash shield.<br />
<br />
3. My choice of offhanders is Ichorflow, Trident of the Deep Sea, and Blade of Strategy. All of them have resistable procs.<br />
<br />
4. That tiny knockback can actually be a big plus for positioning mobs.<br />
<br />
If resisted stuns produce good aggro I'll probably at least try a weapon with a stun in the offhand.<br />
<br />
Still there aren't a lot of decent 2H aggro weapons and given how much mobs reposte in PoP I doubt if I'm going to bank Gaudralek any time soon. Not the best 2H aggro weapon in the game, but decent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Balthizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Also dont forget the 50ac and 100 hps helps alot also tanking mobs in PoP :) Its kinda cool to have the option of my Gaudrelak or using my 1handers Greatblade of the Storms and Copper hammer of Striking (switching out with primal for avatar). Great weapons all together to have in the arsenal. I usually gain aggro with my 1handers and switch to my 2hander after defensive drops.</div></div><hr />

This weapon is fantastic,I still use mine frequently in groups it puts out decent DPS ,Procs an acceptable amount it is unresistable and holds good aggro,even defensive,Sometimes.<br />

Back when I got mine we had 3 of them in like 7 Vyemm kills,though I am aware we were quite lucky as it is a rather rare drop.He has been known to drop more than one at a time though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
right, the &quot;push back 1&quot; component isn't a sure fire way to interrupt spellcasters below 55 either, unlike a 0.0 sec stun is.<br />
(i played a druid back before velious in OS and used Fury of Air a lot)<br />
<br />
Orb of the Sky has a DD+push back 1 just like the Gaudralek, except that it isn't unresistable... but I've noticed no aggro increase from the Call of Sky proc at all.</div></div><hr />
