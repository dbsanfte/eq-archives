<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">some insteresting factoids listed from the SOE news page<br />
<br />
<br />
* Over 2.5 million copies of the game and its expansions have been sold in box or digitally downloaded since 1999. <br />
<br />
* If stacked end to end, the total number of EverQuest boxes created would reach a height of more than 265 miles, which would stretch out of the Earth's atmosphere and past the orbit of the International Space Station. <br />
<br />
* EverQuest averages about 250,000 new subscribers every year. Currently, there are more than 420,000 people playing the game. <br />
<br />
* At peak times, more than 100,000 people around the globe will be playing EverQuest simultaneously. Heaviest hours of operation for EverQuest are from 5PM Pacific Standard Time to 11PM PST, with the biggest days being Thursday and Sunday -- traditionally, the biggest nights for prime-time television viewing. <br />
<br />
* There are almost 12 million characters created by players within the game. Of these 12 million, more than 3 million have been played in the last six months. <br />
<br />
* The oldest EQ player is 78 (part of three generations of a single family that play together from different states). The youngest is 9 (he plays with his mother and father).<br />
<br />
* There are more than 1 million non-player characters populating the world of EverQuest, made up of nearly 400 unique types of creatures. <br />
<br />
* Total play time for all current players in the game equals more than 184,000 years. <br />
<br />
* Only 17% of the characters played within EverQuest are human. 83% are comprised of the fourteen other fantasy races available in the game. <br />
<br />
* EverQuest currently has more than 420,000 inhabitants, making the game's population larger than 42 of America's state capitals. Based on 2000 Census figures, EQ's population is four times that of Berkeley, CA, Springfield, IL and Gary, IN; three times that of Pasadena, CA, Hartford, CT, Lansing, MI or Tallahassee, FL; twice the population of Orlando, FL, Des Moines, IA, Providence, RI or Richmond, VA; and roughly equal in population to Atlanta, GA, Kansas City, MO, Fresno, CA and Virginia Beach, VA. <br />
<br />
* There are over 350 square miles of dungeons, mountains, plains, valleys, cities and forests to explore in the game. <br />
<br />
* There are more than 40,000 unique items for players to discover, create or buy within the game. More than 3,000 of these items have never been discovered by players. <br />
<br />
* There are almost 100,000 trees within the world of EverQuest. <br />
<br />
* More than 1500 servers run the world of EverQuest, which is the equivalency of one of the world's top 100 supercomputers. More than 18 miles of wire and cable connect all these boxes together. <br />
<br />
* Over 10 quadrillion bytes of EverQuest data have left the SOE network in the past five years. That's a ten, followed by 15 zeroes.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, that's some time well spent ^_^</div></div><hr />

Alot are probably the result of buggy ass unfinished quests...</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of them.<br />
<br />
Yes, seriously.<br />
<br />
Edit -- Seriously, if that number is true, I want them to reveal 1...just one, from any expansion prior to LoY and show us how to obtain it.  Not some bullshit they just made up either, I want a bonafide item you can obtain in the game, and does not appear in anyone's magelo across any of the servers.  I would REALLY love to see some of these items they say we've never found but are legitimately obtainable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know the truth is 420k accounts, not players.<br />
<br />
Half my old guild was two boxing accounts that had been left with the guild.<br />
<br />
Either way it's income for them, but still.. not exactly true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is really arcane unsolved quest results in some tradeskill item that results in 100 different pieces of lowbie carp.<br />
<br />
I think that once a month they should reveal one of the oldest unfound/unsolved items in the game as it's apparent that it was programmed as too hard to find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume this is physical age. I know for a fact that there are players whose emotional age is no more than 2.</div></div><hr />

I was playing my very first MMORPG at... 9 or so. It would have been earlier, except back then they were obscure as hell. This one had a total player base of about 2000 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of those 3,000 items probably come from GoD droppable items, GoD tradeskill items, and other random tradeskill items that have never been made.  Look how long it took to figure out some of the recipes for the tradeskill earring, specifically baking.  The number of combinations is quite large, and I'm sure there are entire lines of items that have never been made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My niece was playing at 8. Didn't have her own account, but had some characters, got up to level 8 or so, and definitely knew what she was doing, for the most part. Knew her way around amazingly well, but mostly loved looking at npcs and fishing. She's since given EQ up for a Disney online game, which I think made sense.<br />
<br />
We closely supervised her online (one of us was always with her), but she did get harassed a few times. One wanker in particular is still on my friends list...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it was ment that &quot;that family&quot; ranged from 70 to 9.   <br />
<br />
I do not ever recall them running a age census at my home.  Though my 5 year old perfers Lineage 2 &gt; EQ</div></div><hr />

Impossible.  And I don't count tradeskill items which are only now appearing with the new UI which could have never been found unless someone started combining things at random for a few years real-time.<br />
<br />
These must be items from quests that are broken or cannot be started because there is no starting point.<br />
<br />
Seriously, how many times have players called SOE on broken stuff, only to hear their standard reply of 'no, it's not' or 'we just tested it and it works fine'?  Not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My daughter is just about to turn 2 and she know's enough from watching me play to move the mouse around and bang on the keyboard, I'd probably rate her a little bit higher than some people i've grouped with too =p  I'm swear by the time she's 3 she's gonna have her own damn account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">* EverQuest averages about 250,000 new subscribers every year. Currently, there are more than 420,000 people playing the game. <br />

Cool turnover.</div></div><hr />

I don't buy it. The fact that he was part of the same family was a mere addendum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sentence doesnt imply the oldest and youngest player are both in the same family. <br />
<br />
Just because they're in the same paragraph doesnt mean they are referring to the same family. They are grouped together because it's a statistical listing, and those two statistics go together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would imagine that they meant the youngest player with a registered account. My 5 year old niece played for a while, but like most other 5 year olds, she was bored in a week.</div></div><hr />
