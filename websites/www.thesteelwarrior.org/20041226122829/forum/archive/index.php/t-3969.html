<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am wondering if anyone has any parses or evidence of how multiple attack AA's combine.<br />
<br />
For example, triple attack seems to be about a 10% chance that a given double attack gets an extra attack. <br />
<br />
PB3 seems to be about a 9% chance that a given double attack gets an extra attack.<br />
<br />
Can you have PB AND triple attack go off at once for 4 attacks ?<br />
<br />
Raging Flurry 3 seems to be about a 3% chance per swing of a flurry occuring for an extra two attacks. <br />
<br />
Can you have flurry and PB go off together for 5 attacks ? triple attack and flurry for 5 ? Triple attack, PB AND flurry for 6 ?<br />
<br />
In some fairly extensive (4hr) parsing of 2handers with triple attack and RF3 ( no pb ) there were no occurences where both triple attack and flurry occured in the same swing - has anyone seen this happen ? ( and if so, what was the hasted delay of the weapon you were using ? )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was under the impression that it was calculated like this:<br />
Normal - Check for double attk - successful<br />
Double - check for triple attack - successful<br />
Triple - Check for flurry - successful<br />
Flurry (4 attacks) - check for PB - successful<br />
Flury+PB = 5 attacks<br />
<br />
I read somewhere back when AAs first came out that it was calculated like that and havent seen anything to prove it wrong since then, but im not a warrior and cant parse it myself.<br />
<br />
If im not mistaken somone said earlier in the thread that his triple attack chance was ~3%, which would probably line up about right if you had to calculate the chance of adding the extra attacks in the above fashion, actually I would think it would be lower but I dont know the chances for warriors to double/triple/flurry based on successful single/double/triples.<br />

Punishing Blade is independant of all.  So it would go something like this.<br />
<br />
Sucessful DA, checks for TA<br />
Sucessful TA, checks for Flurry<br />
Sucessful Flurry 1-2 extra attacks<br />
Sucessful Punishing Blade check independantly gives you another attack in any given combat round with a 2 hander.  Succes rate depends on your level with the skill.<br />
<br />
So IF you have PB3, you have a greater chance of having an extra attacked added on top of everything else you have.  With all flurry maxed, ferocity, and PB, you'd basically get 1-6 attacks per round, with the probability of 2-3 per round quite high due to ferocity and PB.  <br />
<br />
I'm certain that PB has nothing to do with Flurry or even triple attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy way to find out if triple attack requires double attack, just parse your average amount of doubles at 59, then parse your average amount of doubles at 60.  If triple attack does not require double attack, then your doubles will be much higher than before as a triple attack without a double is still a double.  Flurry is same way, but that's easier as it gives you a message when it goes off.<br />
<br />
I just like the idea of quad'ing with a 2hander. :D</div></div><hr />

Theorectically......yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would seem that with PB and triple attack and flurry that you would see rounds with 4-5-6 possible hits while using a 2h weapon.  In practic though I have never seen a round with 5 or 6 hits in it.  I don't have raging flurry, but I wonder if regular flurry only happens in rounds without triple attacks or PB attacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After an extensive run of parsing old log files, I have found that flurry and triple attack CAN occur in the same round ( using a 2hander with a delay of 30, so no chance of two attacks in the same second ), but that the vast majority of flurries are only 4 round attacks (without PB ), so it would seem that flurry is not dependent on triple attack in any way.<br />

[Mon Oct 27 22:27:01 2003] You unleash a flurry of attacks.   <br />
<br />
The more interesting thing to my mind, is that the percentage of single attacks was identical between someone with no flurry or triple, and someone with triple, and someone with flurry and triple ( 34% in all cases ). This was also parsed to be the case with punishing blade by someone on the ranger boards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have the AA's in questions, so I cannot do a test, but perhaps someone are up to punish the Katta banker or that MOB in POI factory ?<br />
<br />
They need a good spanking anyways. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you could get a lvl 59 warrior (who wont have triple attack because its a lvl 60 benefit BUT can train the class skills) and get him flurry 3 and see if it ever goes off.<br />
<br />
I'd bet it does.......</div></div><hr />

Flurry probably is linked to Primary attack (first hit) rather than double / triple attacks or whatnot, would make it much easier to implement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure you have had flurries go off for a total of 3 attacks ? ( You have misses on right ? )<br />
<br />
I gave myself a headache verifying 100 or so flurries and none of them were 3 attacks, although some of them looked like it due to ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I hit 3 times total for a given round - the original, failed double, and then got flurry. Total of three attacks even though I flurried. If flurry only went off on a successful triple attack then I'd do at least five for that round.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I posted a little further up, my finding was that flurry is certainly independent of triple attack, what I wished to verify is whether it is independent of *double* attack, which did not seem to be the case.<br />
<br />
Would it be possible for you to dig up a couple of examples from your log where you flurried and only got 3 attacks (whether misses or hits) when you had misses turned on ?<br />
<br />
If you can flurry on single attacks there has to be something I am missing, because logically about 1/3 of all flurries would be triple hits, and I have yet to find any from my own logs (they were all 4 or 5 ) 8(</div></div><hr />
