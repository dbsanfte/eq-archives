<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zondelfinni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was curious what you guys think of the Split blade of destruction/shortblade of lightning combo... Was thinking if it might out damage war marshalls staff id you get all offensive aa's and lvl 65... Have not seen many people weilding that combo...<br />
<br />
split blade of dest..<br />

war marshalls<br />

31 dam 28 dly<br />

I am pretty sure war marshalls still out damages the duel combo, but I am quite curious what you think the average DPS of both would equall to roughly at full offensive aa's, and for kicks, lets say you are hittin mob in the back.. =)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A thousand and one apologies for offending you, oh great Zondelfinni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zondelfinni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That GSoT stuff is gettin old real fast... I have one of those, and it isnt GSoT&gt;all... Besides I asked questions not ever pertaining to the GSoT... If you can help the person asking a question about something, or you have no info that might benefit them, dont say nothing... You think your coming off as funny, but actually its quite childish...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its so hard to say without actually parsing the weapons! There's so very many variables, what are the probabilities of you double attacking, triple attacking, flurrying, punishing blade triggering and dual wielding?<br />
<br />
So I decided to play with the numbers a bit. This could all be completely wrong but since most of what I'll guess at will affect the dual wield combo as well as the two-handed weapon maybe it won't be that bad!<br />
<br />
I seem to remember a long long time ago it was thought that the chance to double attack was double_attack_skill/300 and chance to dual wield was dual_wield_skill/400.<br />
<br />
At 250 skill this is 0.83 for double attack and 0.625. Let's say Ferocity 3 and Amidexterity give a 10% boost to those skills respectively. <br />
<br />
Punishing Blade 3? Say 10% chance of the extra attack.<br />
<br />
Flurry 6? Flurry is dependant on you triple attacking. For me Flurry (at level 3) will go off a couple of times per normal exp-type fight. So I'm gonna guess about 40% chance to triple attack, given a successful double attack, and then a 20% chance to Flurry. Sometimes Flurry can add two attacks instead of one, so say 19% chance to single, 1% to double. Remember these are cumulative its 20% flurries of 40% triple attacks of 92% double attacks - i.e. ~7%.<br />
<br />
Can you triple attack with your off hand? Let's assume you can - it only benefits dual wield anyway.<br />
<br />
If I plug these numbers in I get the comparative damage numbers of 8.16 for the 2h-er and 7.23 for the dual wield combo.*<br />
<br />
Yes I guess at a lot of things but if we take a closer look at the affects of the probabilities I assigned:<br />
<br />
- Increasing Flurry probabilities (which do seem low) benefits the two-hander more than dual wield.<br />
- Is Punishing Blade too high a chance? Completely remove it and two-hander still comes out on top with a damage score of 7.83. <br />
- Is triple attack rated too high? Remembering that flurry triggers off of it that would not seem to be the case (these numbers would make you flurry about once every 15 attack rounds at flurry 6), but altering it up or down doesn't change the outcome. <br />
- Is double attack too high? Again one would have to double attack to triple attack to flurry, so it seems doubtful, and any change I make to it affects both results equally.<br />
- Is dual wield too low? You would have to tune it all the way up to 99% as opposed to the 69% chance I am using to overtake the 2h-er.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Exactly how do I derive those numbers. Add up the probabilities of each outcome of an attack round to get the average number of attacks per round (2.46 for the 2h-er, 2.36 for primary and 2.06 for offhand), multiply this by the modal damage of the weapon (2*base + bonus) and divide by the delay, remembering no bonus for offhand. <br />
<br />
<br />
Please don't go flaming my numbers, I've pointed out myself that they are guessed at but I've also shown that changing them doesn't change the outcome. The only way I could see the dual wield combo winning would be to tune dual wield up significantly from my postulated 69%, bring triple attack down and (in face of the evidence) tune flurry up. But even then 90% dual wield, 10% triple attack and 60% flurry (one every 19 rounds!) still gives the edge to the 2h-er.<br />
<br />
I think its fair to say that whatever the real numbers are, Flurry and Punishing Blade are superbly effective with 2-handed weapons and do very much bias the choice of the warrior looking for dps to those weapons.</div></div><hr />
