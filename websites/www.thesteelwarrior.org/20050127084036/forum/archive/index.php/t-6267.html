<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terail</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question about going with emp's 1hand sword or waiting on a Enrageing Blow wepon, my guild killed XTC as often as we can get em, but hes being stingy. <br />
<br />
Cursed's Bloodfrenzy is out of the question seeing as we have Asian raiders killing him. AoW Blade of Carnage allso when ever we have the chance to kill him and he allso have been really bad at giveing us a BoC.. he has only given us 1 so far.<br />
<br />
So anyways Should i get a Acrylia Handled Broadsword and aug it with a Anger 3 for main hand.. i have a Chord Hilted Spike Driver with Anger 2 at the moment that i could put in off hand just wondering if that should give me efficient hate for raids or i should wait on EB wepon? any help is apreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if your guild is a DKP guild, or what. People often say putting a hate aug on a weapon without hate often ruins it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the sword with Anger 2 was to lazy to save up for Anger 3 it's a decent weapon but I think I made a mistake.  Now thought I don't have a choice as I'm to low on points to get another weapon.  If you are next in line for an EB weapon I would just wait.  Besides the graphic looks dumb :p</div></div><hr />

I have one and it is an excellent weapon, with anger III in it it would be equal or very close to a BoC for aggro and better dps.  You take a hit on hps compared to the emp sword, but it should be better aggro.  Also looks very nice :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got myself a CHSD last night and am close to my 2nd Anger III augment. As far as I know CHSD has better aggro (but less dps) then GBoS...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

I probly will get it becouse of the Dps.. im not next in line for a EB any warrior in my guild can bid there isnt a list.. anyways thanks again :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">unless youre looking for a low aggro dps weapon, i'd leave the AHBS for rangers/rogs and that crowd.  burning an anger3 augment on a weapon without an innate aggro proc is a waste.  if you have access to an AHBS, you have access to quite a few good taunting weapons.<br />
<br />
if all else fails ... get 1-2 groups of friends and kill SW tower in BoT for a GBoS .. it puts out less dps, but i'd wager it would be the hell out of an AHBS for aggro.</div></div><hr />
