I realize Bst 's arent the best healers but with the baby Shammy buffs, regen, and the added dps and stuns from the pet I think it'll be alright. <br />
<br />
Looking for a place that'll be low db to the War so I'm at least getting some AA, at least until I get Paragon for Bst then going to raise him to 65.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much</div></div><hr />

You might be able to handle harder zones.  However, I'd focus on non-planar zones, regardless of what difficulty level you settle on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try veksar, I love that zone plus some very nice items drop there that will be an upgrade for your warrior.  The zone is pretty linear so start at the front and work your way to the back until you are at about the right difficultly of spot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Veksar worked out well. Its a little crowded on my server at times. <br />
<br />
A guildie recommended The Deep and Ive been there ever since. The entrance mobs are 50% LB to my War but still get about 3%AA every 4 kills. Mostly DB to the BST and getting about 1% aa per kill, about 1% xp per 4 mobs. Gets considerably better when you head a little farther in.  And LOTS of drops in there. Its close to bank and KEI/ Virt.<br />
<br />
So if anyone else is looking for a spot to duo with an even marginal healer like a BST, the Deep is an excellent spot.</div></div><hr />

Honestly you'd get better xp picking up a random lfg druid/cleric/shaman and hitting up Valor, Storms, BoT and the like.</div></div><hr />

Nice drops, easy cr since nothing sees invis.  Look up the named and PH locations and you can get some decent gear drops as well as decent xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you 2 should be doing fine there,<br />
mobs have low hp - drop almost no loot - and XP is ok but not better than any grp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arzul</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the BL to 62 to get a good pet, then hit up Maidens Eye, Griegs End, PoNightmare, PoInnovation, PoJustice.  My wife is a BL and Im a warrior we can duo in PoStorms/Valor easy.  Just remember to be hasted and regen and Spiritual Dominion.  Have Infusion of Spirit, dex, str and Talisman and your good to go.  Pull with slow and taunt the mob off the BL.  Its very easy really.  And use healing will at the end of each fight while BL meds.  Use Stonewall if your getting hit on too hard for BL to be able to keep up with heals.  In the Planes, I switch to 2HS because riposte from the &lt;20 delay weapons makes me take a lot more damage.<br />
<br />
One other thing, cast the pet proc that doesnt cause a knockback.  it helps when 2 boxing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shih00</div><div class="date">12-05-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice everyone. Ive gotten the BST to 64 and Paragon, through a combination of BoT, HoH, Veksar and a couple ldon's Now I was wondering if anyone had any additional advice. I dont have OOW but do have GoD. I 2 box on the same computer so GoD zones are a little tough especially in open areas. Was thinking about trying Howling Stones. Anyone have insight on that zone? Was hoping for a place with some loot to start looking for some bazaar upgrades for either. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">12-05-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 66 beastlord as my main, and the best place I find to solo or duo is in Grieg's End. I can fight there for hours on end with only regen and paragon healing me, so I imagine with a warrior it would be even more trivial. Decent tributeable items and pretty good vendor trash. Endless low-blues with almost no chance of adds and few casters. That's my recommendation at least.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Get the beastlord to 65 ASAP. The lvl 65 slow is 65% instead of 50% and casts about twice as fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on Grieg's End as well, I'm a 69 beastlord and I can mow through mobs there like a chainsaw with only regen and paragon to heal, an equally geared warrior should make killing these guys trivial even if you use the beast only to slow and buff and hotkey an /assist, /pet attack on the beast while he is on autofollow.  At 69, the entrance mobs at both DSP and SD zones are light blue, but the inner mobs are DB all the way to 70.  Solo I can do an AA here in about an hour and 15 to an hour and 30 minutes.  Even duo AA exp moves decently here (sometimes I'll pick up an LFG lowbie and have them follow me around).  There are also lots and lots of random named mobs throughout the zone and some extremely nice tribute loots.  Most of the items don't sell for much in the bazaar, but the tribute value is quite nice.  No need to worry about snare here because nothing runs and if you wander around, you'll never ever have to worry about running out of mobs.  I often go here if I only have a short time on, because in the 30 minutes I'd spend LFG, 10 min to run to a zone where the group is, 10 more minutes to buff, and 15 more minutes to start really pulling I could have made nearly an AA from non-stop pulls in GE.</div></div><hr />
