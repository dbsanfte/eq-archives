<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Help, I'm a total and complete n00b! <br />
<br />
I started playing EQ about 2 months ago and a rl friend of mine gave me all the non-nodrop gear off of his 55 warrior and bought me some bazaar bargain stuff for the other slots. Needless to say,  I've been using it up until now, and it's been great. <br />
<br />
I'm a level 52 human warrior, and I've started to notice myself lagging behind some of the other players I'm grouping with these days, and was looking for some suggestions on what would be my best bet for upgrades with about 30k plat to spend. <br />
<br />
I've been reading the boards for a couple weeks now and have seen some great advice given, and I know I could use some. Magelo is currently down so here is my gear setup: <br />
<br />
Ear: Vahshir claw earring, Twisted Ring Loop<br />
Face: Mushroom veil, 8ac, 12dex, DS + 15 <br />
Head: Helm of Raldukan <br />
Neck: Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
Shoulders: Barbed Dragonscale Pauldrons<br />
Arms: Fierce Heraldic Vambraces<br />
Chest: FH BP<br />
Back: Iksar Hide Cape<br />
Wrist: 2x FH Bracer<br />
Belt: Spider Fur Belt<br />
Hands: Silver Chitin Handwraps<br />
Fingers: 2x Velium Fire Wedding Ring<br />
Legs: FH Greaves<br />
Feet: FH Boots<br />
Range: Idol of the Thorned<br />
<br />
Weapons: Frosty/LSOEE for aggro, but most of the time Great Maul of Hatred for dps, and ToD for slowing. <br />
<br />
To give an idea of what might need upgrading, my stats with the Great Maul wielded look something like this: <br />
str: 125 <br />
sta: 164<br />
agi: 103<br />
dex: 133 <br />
<br />
AC: 1089 <br />
HP: 2951  <br />
<br />
All saves under 100, fire and cold the worst both 40ish. <br />
<br />
Any and all suggestions would be *very* much appreciated, and I'll put up a magelo link just as soon as the website is back up.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, on the nameless, Soulscream Belts are going for 25-30k, this will probably give you the most improvement for your cash, rather than doing small upgrades for like 5 slots. <br />
<br />
I'd say your gear is definitely better than the average 52 warrior, just get into a good raiding guild if you aren't already, and start getting some nodrop stuff (Although even SS armor won't be a big improvement over the FH. You can sell the FH once you get some ss though, and buy some new stuff)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For waist, belt of Putrid Hide(65 hp one)<br />
For back, Cloak of Greater Pernicity(believe it has more ac than iksar hide, and the stamina will make up for the hp)<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also look for a new weapon, Something fleshgrinder'ish(Although they still go for 25k on my server, for some reason) Check out Copper Hammer of Striking price, good DPS and aggro to go with the Frosty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You armor is pretty good for a 52, I would be more concerned with weapons and haste. Upgrade your haste first. You'll need to decide whether you want to go with back haste or belt haste since it is going to determine your upgrade path for some time. With the funds you have right now, belt haste would be the way to go. IMO though, you are better off saving for a CoF - it will last you a lot longer and net you better gear in the long term until you can get a good NO DROP haste item.<br />
<br />
If you go ahead and go with belt haste, look for either a Soulscream belt, Broken drive belt, or Runebranded Girdle. That will allow you to get some decent gloves. SS MQ would be a great choice, but if that is not possible, you can always get a pair of FH gloves.<br />
<br />
If you can hold out for a Cloak of Flames, then you go with a Putrid belt of rotten hide until you can afford a Heavy rubicite girdle. For hands you can go SS or FH again.<br />
<br />
As for your weapons, you can camp a Copper hammer and a sword of the bloodsworn yourself, that combo will last you a very long time. For DPS I would recommend investing in a Greatstaff of Thunder, it is by far the best weapon you can get for the pp. On my server they are down to 5-8k now which is unreal for a weapon of that quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the help and suggestions, I appreciate it. :D <br />
<br />
I'm inclinded to agree with wandor about haste upgrade, since my gauntlets do, in fact, suck. CoF is pricey....but I'm about halfway there, and that's one of the only non nodrop items I've ever seen with 36% haste. <br />
<br />
As for weapons I can get a GoT for pretty cheap after I hit 55, but the hammer/sword combo from Droga seem a bit out of reach, due to the fact that the tribunal server seems *way* undercamped; only seen one hammer in bazaar and it was about 40k. I know there are about a million threads about the droga weapons, but I think I'd probably be too low with a group of all 50-55ish characters. <br />
<br />
There is one other thing I wanted to ask the collective wisdom of the board about though. <br />
<br />
I'd say your gear is definitely better than the average 52 warrior, just get into a good raiding guild if you aren't already, and start getting some nodrop stuff   <br />
<br />
I've been a member of two newbie guilds that were good for absolutely nothing other than the annoying guild tag under my name. Problem is, I am noob myself, albiet a very dedicated one, and I don't know diddely about PoP just yet. I'd love to find a good raiding guild on my server, but I have no idea where to look for resources about such a thing. If anyone could point me in the right direction as to where to look, that would be great. <br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
