That is what made knights that more liked then warriors. That we was able to snag aggro fast with our casting side.<br />
<br />
LDoN force groups to look for dps. The mobs are that weak in normal missions that everyone can tank this mobs. There is no real us for the 'tank' classes in LDoN. At the moment the best tankclass for LDoN is a monk. Becuase he will outdps every other tankclass and his selfhealing power is good enough to let him tank with low support (healing) costs.<br />
<br />
I like LDoN because it is fun to do stuff without to have look for a 'perfect' groupe. But i see more and more groups get formed with only dps classes to farm 'Points' as fast as possible. A real dps groupe will be more then twice as effectiv then a 'normal' groupe. I allso see a very high potential for AE groups. The mobs are way to easy to control (low resists) that AE Stun will 90% of the time keep the mobs stunned and if you have a shaman you can make it near riskless with AE Slow.  <br />
<br />
With all this trends in the direction of dps you still think that knights are that overpowered against warriors or you start to think the light tank classes are overpowered because they can do your job in LDoN?<br />

Their extra damage vs undead pretty much eliminates any DPS negative they suffer compared to warriors. As for chain and leather classes tanking, as more and more groups start working on hard missions, it will strengthen the need for a good tank. Not a real problem in normal mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The general feeling I get is that in hard mode there is some need for a Warrior.  But most people won't do hard mode because the difficulty is too high for the reward.  So they'll do normal missions instead.  And while most groups will take a tank, there isn't really a requirement for it, and the Paladins and Shadow Knights still bring everything that made them desired in PoP to the table, with the added benefit to Paladins that their DPS is generally higher due to the high concentrations of undead.<br />
<br />
LDoN didn't make the Warrior situation worse, I don't believe, at least not yet.  But it sure didn't improve anything for us, and I think it just gives the Knights one more expansion to tighten their lock on experience tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While any melee can get a group (particularly if you are willing to risk defeat) LDoN presents some challenges.<br />
<br />
1. There is a positive benefit to completing an adventure as fast as possible with the least amount of risk. As a result the only area that a Warrior might have an advantage (survivability) needn't come into play. Kill Bob scripts can be avoided in Favor of Slaughter for example. This encourages groups to choose MT's based on aggro management and utility.<br />
<br />
2. Deepest Guk, which is where you get points for the Force of YKesha augment, is much better suited to having a Paladin MT. Sitting in South Ro /lfg for a Deepest Guk group is not going to be very productive.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the surest way of successfully competing is not competing. Friends that will give you a regular group or 2-boxing a Cleric is the only Warrior advantage that counts for anything.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm reluctant to be in a group that lacks a ressor. That makes Clerics, Paladins, and Necros (yes, Necros) very popular in LDoN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For LDoN normal runs, the adventure system doesn't punish groups for having Warriors as much as it did in POP.  But that doesn't excuse SOE from the problem.  In fact in normal runs, it might be a &quot;safer bet&quot; to run things like slaughter with 3 tanks.<br />
<br />
I am disappointed that the Adventure System doesn't punish groups for having too much DPS.  The easiest way to do this would be that those participating in adventures can't get a new one until 90 minutes after the start of the adventure.  This kind of mechanism would &quot;throttle&quot; high DPS groups into waiting a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The argument ia always made that paladin DPS blows compared to warriors and supposedly in LDoN this should work to our favour, yet that is only true to a limited extent. 3 of the 5 camps have significant undead populations (Mistmoore, Guk and Miragul's in that order) where Slay Undead mitigates the DPS advantage warriors might hold.<br />
<br />
Granted in normal groups the need for aggro lock has been reduced as well (with trash maxxing in the 300s for the most part), and until the risk/reward thing is changed I don't see a lot of people moving to the more difficult settings, where it may be necessary.<br />
<br />
The itemization is again discriminatory to mana users, but that is more on line of what do you do with your points, rather than can you earn them.<br />
<br />
And as for Aeka's &quot;throttle&quot; thought, I disagree unless they bump the rewards for the difficult setting: make Risk vs Reward mean something. The reason high DPS/uber groups do normal is because there is no incentive to do the others with the RvR as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A high DPS group risks no more than a low DPS group and yet gets the reward of going for more adventures in the same chunk of play time.  Both adventures will get the same level of random items except the high DPS group will have more because they attempt more.<br />

I'm not sure how fair that is.  Maybe that is just the way it has to be...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The need for aggro lock due to hard hitting mobs is gone in normal mode.  However, people are looking to do maximum dps.  Whether perception meets reality (being argued in another thread), the perception is that people see knights as allowing them to go all out on mobs, whereas they have to hold back with warriors.  Whenever I am in groups with a knight, the knight tanks due to just that.  The good news is that people don't see it as big enough of an issue that they think they need to wait for a knight, but knights are still chosen first, especially pallys in the undead zones (once again, perception is they do massive dps when really they just meet warrior dps, but they now have no real negatives).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What happens for the 15 mins (or slightly shorter if you have the aas) that you don't have aetaunt?  Especially in hard, Pallys are great tanks to have.  Hard brings back the need for aggro control cause mobs can pwn casters well, and has multipulls.  And get more than 3 / 4 mobs, aetaunt + def even and you get yourself killed without a lot of hps.  I'd still go with the pally on normal.  Always available aggro lock is a lot better than 1 guaranteed taunt (which is not near aggro lock) every 15 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is that. Then again, I thought he was referring to &quot;COULD have an UNEXPECTED multipull&quot;, which by the way he worded it to my mind, was an occurence such as this happening rarely, where AE taunt would seldomly NOT have the time to refresh between uses.<br />
<br />
Pallies aren't all that in Hard. Sure, they got better snap aggro, but very very few of them can tank well enough to take down a named... they really are almost designed to need defensive, or to be a cast iron bitch without it.  And with how hard the mobs hit, the difference in how much better warriors can take a beating is fairly significant. I know of a group that faield on hard because the pally tried gamely, but he got beat into the ground by the named repeatedly, cause they just hit too hard.<br />
<br />
On normal, I agree. Pally &gt; Warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Hussar, I know for a fact not everything in Hard is fully slowable, so ya might want to check your facts on that. The rest of that sounds quite... off... to me, considering that Hard was designed to be a challenge to elemental+, but I won't argue the point. If it's doable, which I certainly concede that it is, I certainly don't think it was as easy as you're trying to make it sound. Nameds mitigate slow and quad for 1100+ a round, which, at 4400 max, can't be all that much less than your pallie's unbuffed hitpoints. How they'd live the 10 seconds between complete heals reliably enough to kill it, even buffed to, say, 7500 HP, is quite perplexing. Not that I'm calling you a liar. But damn, chaining those cheals on a named has gotta be hard on the mana.<br />
<br />
And yeah, in normal, the ac/hp advantage in normal really means jack. Hell, Rangers and Monks can tank in normal. On hard tho, it's a different story. From visiting several boards, the common comment is, &quot;warriors are good in hard&quot;. Defensive is named often when speaking about hard named.<br />
<br />
Eh, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every mob I fight gets slowed, the shamans have never mentioned that it was mitigated, so I didn't think differently.  Hard is no where near that challenging.  It's like fighting only krigers in BoT.  Yeah, nameds can hit up to 1100, but their atk must be low cause it's rare as hell to see it from my experience.  The mobs hps aren't too high, so it's not like it takes enough time to really be trying on a clerics mana on a named.  Warriors are good for hard, yes.  So are pallys.</div></div><hr />

I thought I saw a fairly impartial parsing of 300k swinging that had shown a warrior does more DPS from the front then a monk would from the front (TM3 + PoP flurry 3)  May not be able to heal, but I did a normal missions with the only healing being Divine Arbitration and Hopebringer.<br />

Slaughter is a joke for elemental geared peeps.<br />
Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Wizard, Bard, Cleric and you have your high dps group in about every dungeon but especially in Nro as the summoned stones can be charmed by mages.<br />
There isnt a real need for a slower even and in this kind of groups a warrior is not necessarily needed but preferred just because of his hp advantage when rushing rooms instead of pulling.<br />
<br />
And Hussar, Paladins in LDoN have a serious dps advantage if they have slay undead 3 in the undead dungeons.<br />
I was in guk yesterday with a guildie.<br />
I have about every offensive and defensive AA there is and use a BoW, he was using the VZ 2hander.<br />
We were split tanking and group handled 3rd or 4th mob in room with monk or ranger offtanking.<br />
He was usually finishing his mob when mine was about 45 percent health.<br />
He did have a harder time tanking due to lack of gear (he isnt the best equipped paladin in guild by a fair margin) but he did good enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It doesn't really appeal to me to have to destroy an older item which is intially better than LDON stuff so I can use many of the LDoN merchant augmentations. Whats the incentive to spend points to get an item thats more or less the same as what you had after its augmented? When most of the armors strength comes from wis int mana why would I want to augment it so it can be what I have now, but with wis int mana?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Itemization is godly for non raiding folks even compared to cultural or ornate.<br />
Not necessarily for warriors even though i'd be hard pressed to find an easier accessible ac 54 bp than the one that drops in tak very often (bejeweled architect bp or something like that).<br />
I replaced almost 50 percent of my twinks equipment with drops from ldon(hehe if you can call a 64 bard a twink still, although my 42 ranger certainly is one).<br />
Not everything is good, recommended levels are pretty high and certainly no upgrades for raiders with pretty low hp or mana adds.<br />
But a common drop from ruj just replaced my bards ornate boots for regular groups and we all know how much they would have cost when bought from bazaar until recently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Tak armour typifies exactly what is wrong with itemization: sure some of it is an upgrade for non-elemental warriors but lets take a better look at the stuff.  Now I wear a combination of ornate, cultural and other crap but I crunched some numbers on the complete sets. Assuming a full set (2 bracers, gaunts, vambs, greaves, bp, boots and helm) you  have:<br />
<br />
314 &quot;raw&quot; AC - yay we all love thick plate (warrior ornate is 298 total)<br />
46 Sta - everyone can use this (warrior ornate is 60 total)<br />
34 Str - again a stat everyone can use (warrior ornate is 50 total)<br />
0 Dex - gee thanks for the help on proc rates (as limited as it may be... warrior ornate has 34 total)<br />
30 Agi - another stat we can all use (warrior ornate is 26 total)<br />
26 Wis - grats clerics and pallies on mana (warrior ornate = 0)<br />
34 Int - grats SKs on mana (warrior ornate = 0)<br />
23 Cha - yay DI help (warrior ornate = 0)<br />
525hp - we all love our hp (warrior ornate is 530 total)<br />
525 mana - grats pallies, Sks and clerics on more mana<br />
29 MR (27), 31 FR (12), 36 CR (19), 36 PR (43), 37 DR (39)- we all love our saves. Total resists 169 (140 on warrior ornate)<br />
<br />
In short, with the Int/Wis/Mana on it, this stuff is more beneficial to the hybrids/clerics than warriors.  Comparing the &quot;base set&quot; the other plate classes all gain much more AC and HP over their ornate gear, compared to us. A warrior's main benefit in this gear vs Kizrak's (aside from camping mobs or raising plat to buy ornate olds) comes from 2 extra aug slots per piece... some incentive to try and horde the 4942 pts (1492 + 3 x 1150 pt augs) for the piece. The hybrid/casting classes can then use the same HP augs we can to get the exact same item as us... and still have belts, cloaks, earrings, rings, neck, range and charms to augment their mana pools further. Hell they can add FT augs to this to make our Vengeance or Regen mods look that much more outgunned.<br />
<br />
Yeah the Tak armour is great shit...</div></div><hr />

I shouldve came and read this post before I got my own Hard group.  I thought something was wrong when i was getting hit for 900s, like i forgot to put my gear on or something lol.  I thought... oh boy... then when the shaman said he the mob mitigated slow i was thinking fook, where are my warrior friends...however the cleric casted CH eaerly... but i was at -623hp :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When talking about the mana, WIS, INT of the Tak armor being a benefit to other plate classes more than Warriors you have to compare the levels of those stats to the levels that are on the Ornate of each class as opposed to Warrior Ornate.<br />
<br />
Paladin Ornate has 42 WIS and 550 Mana.  So you lose 16 WIS and gain 200 Mana by going to Tak over Ornate.  Not a huge jump relatively speaking.<br />
<br />
Also, I think a group with both a Paladin and a Warrior (same level and gear assumed) that lets the Paladin tank is missing out.  The Paladin loses a lot of the utility we have when we tank.  While that utility usually does not get us groups, it is silly to waste it when it can help the group.  When I am in an LDoN group with a Warrior I usually pull.  I stun the mob on incoming, and once more.  The Warrior taunts off of me and tanks that mob till it is dead.  If we have a chanter, he mezzes the add mobs, if not I off-tank.  When the first mob is near death, I switch to the mezzed mob and break mezz so that the group loses no time between mobs and the Warrior taunts off me again.  When the last mob in camp is near death I go to look for more.  <br />
<br />
Once the Warrior taunts off a Paladin who has dropped 2 stuns on the mob, he can usually hold aggro easily for the rest of the fight.  Meanwhile, the Paladin is free to do other things to help the group.  Perception can be a problem though.  I have had to convince groups to try this a few times, myself.<br />
<br />
Lastly, at the level I play, LDoN groups all have at least one tank.  (65 with 20 – 100 AA average)  I guess some of the truly uber folks can rip through the adventures having a mage tank, but I thought the most pronounced problem area for Warriors wasn't at the very high end.<br />

<br />
You're really not telling us anything we don't know.  We know that if a Warrior has a Paladin around to use a crutch then we can get quite a leg up on the hate list.  The question being of course, why should we have to group with a Paladin just to be able to do our job in an acceptable fashion?  Do you typically feel you have to group with a Warrior to be effective?  I doubt it.  So why should we be required to group with a Paladin to be effective?<br />
<br />
Also, many groups want only one tank.   This isn't as true in LDoN as previously, but it's still pretty true.  And currently, unless doing something very hard, they'll take the Paladin over the Warrior because the Paladin offers close to Warrior tankability plus a whole plethora of things that the Warrior doesn't, including aggro lock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well a couple thoughts on this quote and the post in general. First off, are you mana ahead, losing 16 Wis and gaining 200 raw mana instead?  I betting you are and thats all that matters in the end. Hell I know you can optimize the pieces you want to maximize the benefit even: we all do it.<br />
<br />
Secondly the mana/wis/int is irrelevant in terms of the closure of the HP/AC gap.   I don't know the exact numbers for pallies but I know that the full set of warrior ornate has more AC and more HP than the paladin set... and thats the way its supposed to work. We gain 16 AC, we lose 14 Sta and lose 5 hp vs the knights gaining more than 16 AC and -5 HP (and probably don't lose as much Sta either). The fact that this armour exists contributes to the class imbalance: warrior gear and paladin gear at an equal level of play should not have equal HP/AC. I don't begrudge  you an increase in your mana pool, but when you get that as well as EQUAL AC/HP to a warrior, then that says its more beneficial to the Lower AC/HP class (i.e. the hybrids). <br />
<br />
As far as working with paladins, I do it with my guildmates and it works beautifully, but they generally aren't the type that like to play aggro-keep-away just to bask in their superior idiocy (and those paladins unfortunately do exist). I would rather work with a pallie in a group than a second warrior a lot of the time :p</div></div><hr />

I was responding specifically to someone's comment that the group they were in had the level 63 Paladin tank over the 65 warrior.  This group was foolish.<br />
<br />
I am not implying that a Warrior needs a Paladin in the group to do the job.  But if you have a perfectly good Paladin lying around, why have him tank over the Warrior when he could help the Warrior tank better than either of them could alone?<br />

I agree that it is not very sensible to have a Paladin MT insted of a Warrior if both are in a group and all other things are equal.<br />
<br />
The trouble is that Paladins have gotten to MT successfully in many experiance groups and display their aggro superiority. That factor alone is enough to totally blind many players to the capabilities of Warriors.<br />
<br />
Are Warriors totally gimp in LDoN? No.<br />
<br />
But Paladins aggro abilities are the standard. LDoN groups are very reluctant to delay at all for the MT to secure aggro and keeping it is now the MT's problem and not the groups.<br />

<br />
Does this make a lot of sense to me?  Not really.  But it happens, and not that uncommonly.</div></div><hr />

He still had only his Baron title. Had facesmasher, and about 3KHP less than me, buffed. something like 5khp for him, 8khp for me. Plus, I had level 65, and all defensive AA's as well.<br />
<br />
The enchanter left in a huff because she wanted the pally to tank and we said no, because I was about twice as good of a tank... she kept slowing the mob while it was still coming to camp, so of course it would run right past me and beat on the chanter. Dumbass woman.<br />
<br />
That example illustrates the problem, right there.<br />
<br />
I don't CARE how stupid the rest of the group is, IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE should a warrior who is unquestionably at least twice as good of a tank be passed over in favor of a hybrid because of simple aggro.</div></div><hr />
