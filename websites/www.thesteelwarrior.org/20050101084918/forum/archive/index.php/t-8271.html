<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chicklet24</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the ashes the other day for the quest so I decided to start it.  The only problem being that the  certain faction that the vendors/nobility types are on I am dubious to.  I'm amiable with everyone else like guards etc.  I  did some researching and searching of these forums and figured there were only a few ways to raise  the faction that I THINK the guy you start the quest is  on &quot;Concilium Universus&quot;  (sp).  <br />
<br />
1) Kill Seru -  My guild hasnt gone after  him in a long while.<br />
<br />
2) Kill &quot;of the Heart&quot; people in one of the four towers - No one in my guild is doing the earring quest so  cant really find people to  help me kill there.<br />
<br />
3) Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick quest - so far I've handed  in 3 sets of  four to the quest gnome in katta raising my faction three times.  This doesnt  seem to be a very big faction boost though and it  usually takes me  about 30minutes per  pick since they are so uncommon.<br />
<br />
Illusion potions arent getting me past dubious either. tried frog,human,high elf,wood  elf, and eurdite.<br />
<br />
So this leads me back again to the wisdom of our forums.  Is there anyone else out  there that had trouble starting  the quest due to faction?   If  so,   I could really use your advice.   Being on Firiona Vie I could just have a  friend do the turnins  but  I'd like to do it myself without bothering them.<br />
<br />
Thank  you</div></div><hr />

Just took a while till I found that clear room with the chest to pull to</div></div><hr />

But then again, I'm agnostic and I heard  that religion is still significant despite illusions.</div></div><hr />

Guess you have to be high up into dubious or something *shrug* but anyways shield here I come :)</div></div><hr />
