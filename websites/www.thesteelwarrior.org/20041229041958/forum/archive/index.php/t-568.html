<br />
I'm thinking about getting some acceptable resists for a 50+ guild. Not the uber level 65 only guild lmind you.. so I'm thinking just to be accepted, somewhere along 75 in MR CR FR would be a good start I can always get better items later.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for suggestions on cheap items.. I really can't spend much after upgrading my ac, I don't duo box or have a high level char to farm stuff.<br />
<br />
Looking to spend 400-1000pp .. :(<br />
<br />
I'm also wondering  what kind of AC a warrior can sacrifice for resistances, I suppose there is not much sacrifice to do when you have great gear.. but until then.<br />
<br />
I have made a 'resist' alternate profile on my profile below, which has 4 items I own (like the Cured Tizmak Gloves).<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you want to get resist gear for your low 50's guild, or do you want to get resist gear so you can GET IN to a low 50's guild?<br />
<br />
I got answers, but I need some clarification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">take a shm/cleric partner. get maps of UGUK and LGUK. find the ent to LGUK alive side from UGUK. i found it after a little bit. right next to king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh wow good idea. My 51 monk is wearing one in fact . I don't solo with her anyway since her 45's I cant spend enough on two chars, so I'll iust get the Crown, the AC isn't much different from my crappy Crafted Helm :)<br />
<br />
So on my Resists profile I'm at <br />
78 SVM 73 SVF 65 SVC<br />
<br />
Do you want to get resist gear for your low 50's guild, or do you want to get resist gear so you can GET IN to a low 50's guild?<br />
<br />
To get IN a guild :)<br />
<br />
I should probably try to get 100 FR or CR , not necessarily at the same time, is that true ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
So until I get the ring, I have updated my profile, and I'm at 81 83 75 or 81 73 81 .. as much as 60ac loss but I guess the resists are for when I assist and have to soak elemtnal damage area effect...</div></div><hr />
