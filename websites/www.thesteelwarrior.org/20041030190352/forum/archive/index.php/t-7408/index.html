<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Len</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, im a 56 Wood Elf Warrior and i was wondering wether the epic is worth getting, bear in mind i dont raid hardly ever and i dont get much money to afford things like SBoZ( Swiftblade of Zek ) or SBoD( Split Blade of Destruction ) or any of them.<br />
I have some friends who farm places like Sky and Hate/Fear a fair bit for fun, and they are willing to help me get the items i need, so is it worth getting?? the stats, the fact you have it and the great graphics.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kodoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SBoD and SBoZ both suck for agro, and are complete wastes of money for Warriors.  Get a Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn, both are pretty cheap and decent agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree.  Even if you have to camp them, these will be much easier to get than epics and far superior for both dps and aggro.</div></div><hr />

I've read mention (this is unverified hearsay, now) that Epic 1.0 will save you some steps for Epic 2.0.  I don't research EQ rumours as thoroughly as I used to ... If Epic 2.0 turns out to be something worth having, the current epics may be good to have handy if you decide to by OoW (and can actually complete the new epic quest!). <br />
<br />
Otherwise, the Droga weapons are terriffic, and Droga is a fun zone to run around in anywho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my opinion, no epic is not worth getting.  You can take all the pieces you would turn in for your epic, sell them in the bazaar and buy two weapons better than the epic.  That to me says the epic is not worth doing, unless you want to do it just to do it...but that is a question for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">epic = the shiney!<br />
CHoS/SotB = real weaponry for the average joe warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You could buy the droga combo for about 13k plat (on Luclin).  But I would suggest you just camp them.  They are easy camps to hunt , providing they're open.  At your level you can get great xp and upgrade your weapons for free.  I myself hated toting the cookie cutter combo in planes xp groups.  Especially when everyone in the group had the same weapons ( bards, monks, bst's). Hell I was even in one LDoN that Every member of the group had a copper hammer.  Aggro was hard to manage but not impossible thanks to the incite tomes.  Basically my point is although everyone has them and they're cheap or easy to obtain.......<br />
<br />
you won't find a better aggro combo , for such a cheap ( or easy to obtain)  set of weapons.  People rave about the GBoS and it's the same proc as the CHoS.<br />
<br />
droga weaps &gt; epic 1<br />
<br />
If epic 1 is required for epic 2 then you might want to consider it.  Otherwise, if you friends can help you kill the mobs to get you epic, then they can help you kill the mobs to get even better weapons.<br />
<br />
I never bothered my friends for my epic, It would just take up slots in my bank.<br />
<br />
But to each his own.  I guess they look pretty walking around in pok.  But if I was in a raid and the MT showed up toting epics, I would leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Epic 1 will not be required for Epic 2, but it will make it somewhat easier. Hopefully the benefit of having epic 1 scales with the difficulty of getting it (ie.. a monk  or rogue doesn't get as much benefit to epic 2 as a mage or sk or warrior would) but I doubt they willd o that for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would still take CHoS+Red Blade than CHoS+SotB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I came to the point where all i needed left was the green dragon scale, rest i had gotten cheaply or thru raid drops. Despite some serious hesitation (since I'm a poor warrior) I coughed up 10k for the scale and am a happy camper.<br />
<br />
The 2h is my dps weapon of choice atm, and now that I augged the red blade with Ykesha, i dual it with CHSD (anger2 augged). This duo does great for me in LDoNs and low end PoP.<br />
<br />
To each their own. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would still take CHoS+Red Blade than CHoS+SotB.<br />
<br />
I personally would take the red blade and use a SotB instead of a CHoS. Mainly cuz it can stun most, if not all, mobs iirc (more of a chance to interrupt mobs that use the Gate spell), the CHoS stun caps at level 55 mobs. That's just from experience using both the SotB and CHoS at one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yep, but CHoS has better ratio and the DD part is bigger, with Ingenuity AA it can crit proc to a nice 350 I think :)<br />
<br />
For normal grouping, I use my Epic 2h auged with Anger 2 and I do just fine, even when grouped with EP DPS classes, agro is not a problem, so Im a happy warrior, using a weapon that doesnt have a great ratio, but has a nice innate proc (Im in a family guild and we dont raid EB weapons mobs yet, so the 500Hate+175DD is actually, great :) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you don't mind looking stupid, hard to beat the Greatstaff of Thunder. Terrific weapon.</div></div><hr />
