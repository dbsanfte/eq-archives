When I go to make the hot key, I see that most stuff is self-explanitory but 2 has got me floored.  What is the diffrence between COST and UPKEEP.  Does not make since to me, one friend said that COST was how much of the Endurence it would cost to use, well that seemed ok but he did not know what the UPKEEP was, another friend said the exact opposite So which does what and why???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cost is flat out endurance cost upkeep is endurance per sec</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that you can end a disc, why would you want to pay for the full fellstrike, when you can end it (paying only a portion of the endurance) and going defensive?<br />
<br />
<br />
So upkeep definitly does not suxxorz, it's quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semidil</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cause when you are out of endurence, you are out.  To my knowledge there is not edurence song, endurence type crack or a endurence feeder to replinish it.  <br />
<br />
I first do not like the fact that these are litterally Warrior spells, check it out when you try and cast something and you have nothing targeted, it if says &quot;you must have some one targeted to cast this spell&quot;  Not what I was hoping for.  More and more they are making us ranger light.<br />
<br />
That is not even taking into account how fast your endurence gets eatin.  I tested that upkeep thing on my 65 Warrior last night.  It drops the endurence like a rock and takes forever to get back.  I have 55 Druid that I keep around strictly for porting and stuff.  She can get her mana back faster than I can get my endurence back.</div></div><hr />
