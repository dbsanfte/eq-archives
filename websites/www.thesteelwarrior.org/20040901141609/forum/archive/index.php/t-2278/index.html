<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have someone on Rodcet that wants to buy the MQ of the etched soldiers crest and dissertation of dark war. What would you all say the MQ of thoes 2 items is worth? crest is for second piece and disertation is for 3rd.<br />
<br />
Trying to find a baseline. and if the person that asked me about them posts on this board I will give them a price break as I have a soft spot for TSW posters :)<br />
<br />
please no flames I am serious I have no idea what the mq's are worth. they did make me a offer I could just take it but if thier offer is what you all consider fair price then I will knock some off of it that is if the person in question posts on this board :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bah I am such a moronic pally posted in the wrong forum obviously as this is quest related can a mod move it to the keep please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the new PoH stuff is NOT MQable, when I tried turning in the Minor signet of the dark knight as a warrior he simply gave it back to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>skrimish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the quest maybe MQ able if the one doing the quest and the one that has the item is of the same class .  2 war or  2 priest  and so forth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the quest is mq'able no matter what class I turned in crap for my wiz with my pally and my wiz got item. the quest was kinda messed up at first where it was not defiante who the right person for what class was. SoE fixed that now. So I would assume Trondir you gave to the wrong person. and skrimish give me some of what you are smokin :)</div></div><hr />
