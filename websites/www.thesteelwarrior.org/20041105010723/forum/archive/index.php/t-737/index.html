<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jablunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">halo... me and my bro have been bored with eq lately and was wondering what mobs/bosses we can take out with 4 lvl 65 chars: CLR, WAR, MONK, &amp; ENCH. all toons are pretty well geared. of course 2 of the 4 chars will be boxed. just wanted to see what mobs would be fun to keel and maybe some lewt for our twinks. ie: Lord Dojo, Zelinthak, etc... what other mobs out there are doable? pls share your duoing or low number encounters =)<br />
<br />
peace out,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vathoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might try HoT, I'v seen it done with 3 before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jablunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would do HoT but my chars have faction issues. =/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vathoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">do vindi then =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can't do vindi with 4 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">best loot for 4 ppl is named camps in CT. va'dyn(akheva) and servitor of luclin(griegs) are other options.<br />
<br />
with a little patience, those 2 cave mobs in UP are doable, i foget their names. i dunno about Zeli, hes got a ton of HP, the cave mobs do too, wouldnt be easy fights. Zeli has some weak AE i think that would be a hassle for 4 ppl. <br />
<br />
dont be afraid to /w all &lt;insert class&gt; for some xtra dmg or hp buffs to join ya.<br />
<br />
lol, 4 person vindi fight. still a 10-15 man encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kunark dragons are fun with 4 as is Wuoshi. Basically any pre-Velious mob should be possible with your crew. Maybe try Rhag1, he should be doable. Lord Bob wouldnt be too bad, but he doesn't drop anything worth the fight.<br />
<br />
I would try Velketor, he has super slow regen and likes to cast so if you can get some charmed DPS you should be able to pull it off. If you can do Velk, then Vindi is worth a try.<br />
<br />
FYI - Vindi is 1 groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jablunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">took the crew out and killed: Zelinthak, Woushi, Lord Dojo, &amp; Kelorek Dar last night... maybe we try some Kunark dragons. next possible target? we'll find out =) any more suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a different type of answer here :)<br />
<br />
You mention to equip your twink.. well I have done small grp to get my rogue epic'd. You have a bst? I am sure you can get him epic'd with your crews too.<br />
<br />
Also, try BoT mini. Instead of HoT, do ToV entrance.. clearing those Drakes in the hallway, they do drop Kael quest armors. Farm PoJ Trials for loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slight derail.. Anyone know what level the BST epic procs? ( the slow one )<br />
<br />
I hear it's possible to do the BST epic before your are level 50 so I thought I would ask what level it procs if anyone knew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jablunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Compo, yeah we've gotten our twinks.. 2 druids, and a rogue epic'd (all under lvl 47) with this crew. maybe i'll start getting my lvl 30 beast  his epic.. i haven't really looked into the bst epic yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">id have to see it to believe it for that 4 man crew to kill lord dojo, maybe hes been severly nerfed heh.  same with vindi and velk, add 3-4 more ppl and open up few more mobs.<br />
<br />
if you get a mage to coth you behind tormax throne, all those green mobs give excellent faction, can fix your cov in a day and head to tov. HoT or CT is the best loot for 4 ppl, and of course you can time things like vadyn.<br />
<br />
some nice farm items also if you are willing to do the key quest to tactics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grieg is likely doable with 4, though probably quite a challenge (though the shadow masters are the tougher part with small numbers).  We've done him with 9, and we're a pre-ntov guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh i'd like to see that done ( grieg ) with 4 people.<br />
<br />
not that i'm saying ya can't; but grieg &amp; his cronies are such a royal pain in the ass i'd like to see how it progressed. the shadow masters are basically the only roadblock there.<br />
<br />
( reading up some; too bad your toons aren't able to run into ToV; Dozer is such a sweet target to hit up if you had it as an option. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jablunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ya.. workin on my faction now. i wanna finsih some ToV quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i'm suprised no one said Vaniki yet..cheese mobs...killer mouse.../rimshot :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jablunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">gawd.. i hate DN. although Zland would be cool and fun to take out with a small group/raid.  whats the smallest  amount of peeps for this encounter?<br />
<br />
Jablunt_Standanko</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vladimoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Zlandicar is easily doable with 5 well geared characters, I suppose those 4 could probably do it as long as the monk ended up on rampage and has the proper AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seen 11 (2 botted) toons take out Zlandicar, with pre-NToV loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">add a wizard and kill klandicar with that group<br />
<br />
-kriegar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've duoed Zland with a shaman and killed most of the kunark dragons twoboxing a cleric, all are fairly easy.  HoT is probably your best bet, worth fixing faction for, get a few friends and start farming dozekar and named drakes to do quests.  He can be done with one group too, but it takes like 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />
