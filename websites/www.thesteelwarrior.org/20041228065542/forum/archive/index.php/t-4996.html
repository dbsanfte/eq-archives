<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is actually very easy to max out your weapon skills in the early levels (50 and less) if you switch your weapons after you have maxxed your skill for each level. Make sure you have several different low-delay weapon types. <br />
<br />
Some things to keep in mind: <br />
<br />
Your dex stat will affect your skill-up rate. Get a dex buff when trying to raise your skill level.<br />
<br />
Piercing is one category. There is no 1-handed and 2-handed seperation. <br />
<br />
You cannot get skill-ups on green con mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaoraEci</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just keep an array of weapons on you at all times, this way you can swap weapons in and out as you gain skills. <br />
<br />
If you group a lot , get dex buffs as these will help you learn your combat skills, the faster you learn them the faster you can learn others.<br />
<br />
Don't fret. There is plenty of time to learn these skills. There are many chances where you may do a raid or even have some time to kill and ask a xp group in the area to practice on the mobs they pull.<br />
<br />
Have fun :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CATEIRE</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, <br />
<br />
Always switch out your weapons as you go makes life alot easier to have all your skills maxed when that Uber weapon drops and you wanna use it. It would suck to get a CHOS or a GSOT and never trained your 1hb and 2hb. <br />
<br />
When I was leveling through the 50's I carried<br />
<br />
ToD 2hb ---&gt; still useful  50% slow<br />
Centi warhammer 1hb<br />
Centi short sword 1hs<br />
Lammy 1hs<br />
Shimmering Partisan 2hp<br />
Bloodpoint 1hp<br />
Gorangs Spiked club 1hb<br />
Kunzer Kutish(sp) 1hs -----&gt; still useful   snare dot<br />
Silken whip of Ensnareing 1hs ----- &gt; still useful  snare<br />
<br />
Seems like alot but when the slower dies or leaves and you bust out a 50% proc the cleric is very happy. Or if you have no snarer switching out the snare proc is also a life saver in dungeons or anywhere a runner will get you adds.<br />

Ummmm .... actually you can ... if it's a non-damage skill. The only one I can think of at the moment is disarm. There may be others as well. Bear in mind that if you wanting a blunt or piercing (or hand to hand for that matter) skill to increase, that will not happen against a greenie.<br />
<br />
Greenie's get really mad at you too, if you try to disarm them.  :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chances are that you won't max your skills until the late 40s, early 50s.  Keeping 1hs and 1hb and piercing maxed isn't terribly hard.  I usually dual wielded every time I went up a level which quickly maxed out one or two weapon skills, plus double attack, offense, and dual wield skills.  Then I switched to 2h for the rest of the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the fastest weapons of each type that you can. That really helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xguk</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips, i might have thought it would be harder than it really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azunias</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess my question is why piercing? Short of a ESK to proc no rent band-aids, there's better aggro/damage producing weapons out there. (My piercing is at 128)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xguk</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well heres another question, what level should i start trying to max out each weapon skill, isnt it kind of hard since you level so fast 1-25 or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Equirs</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did was pretty much stick to 1 handslash till lvl 50 or so... that served me well :/ Then I got a jade mace and had to level that up...then I got a two hander and I had to level that up..then I got a 2hb which I have to level that up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Azunias - Because someday, we will get our cap raised to 250 and then won't you feel silly. And because bloodpoints are sweet for farming harder greens.<br />
<br />
Xguk - My level 25 monk has had 1hb, 2hb and h2h maxed since like level 15. But Monks have the advantage of dual wield skill since level 1 and higher dw skill caps for more swings with the 1hb and h2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azunias</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cuclain ....<br />
<br />
Hmmm .... makes sense .... but not really into farming.</div></div><hr />
