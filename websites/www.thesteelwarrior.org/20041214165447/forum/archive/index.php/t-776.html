<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athatar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt is practically a class-defining skill for warriors, and yet, as everyone here knows, we have the same taunt skill as paladins, SKs, even rangers for god's sake.  While all those classes get taunt and spells to help aggro, we basically get no upgrades over taunt. <br />
<br />
Well, we should!  Here's some ideas on a whole line of taunt upgrades, to make the art of trash-talking a truly class-defining ability for warriors:<br />
<br />
The Trash talk ability<br />
<br />
At level 15, the warrior gains the ability to mercilessly TEASE his opponents.  This is a combat ability, similar to Kick or Taunt, which causes your opponent to gain 100 hate towards you, and has a recycle time of 5 minutes.  Mobs of level 25 and above are immune to teasing.<br />
<br />
At level 25, the warrior learns how to relentlessly MOCK his opponents.  Mocking causes your opponent to gain 200 hate towards you, and has a recycle time of 5 minutes (independent of the Tease recycle time).  Mobs of level 35 and above are immune to mockery.<br />
<br />
At level 35, the warrior's bitter experiences in life allows him to CUSS loudly, angering those who hear his words.  Cussing causes all mobs within hearing range to gain 300 hate towards you, and has a recycle time of 5 minutes (independent of the Tease and Mock recycle times).  Note that as an AE effect, cussing can cause nominally friendly NPCs to aggro, or cause mobs who hear you to aggro through walls.  Mobs level 45 and above are unaffected by cussing.<br />
<br />
At level 45, the warrior can issue a stream of INVECTIVE, causing all mobs within hearing range to gain 400 hate.  Invective has a recycle time of 5 minutes (independent of the Tease, Mock and Cuss times).  Mobs level 55 and above are immune to invective.<br />
<br />
At level 55, the warrior masters the art of PROFANITY.  Using profanity causes all mobs within hearing range to gain 500 hate towards you, and has a recycle time of 5 minutes (independent of Tease, Mock, Cuss and Invective times).  Mobs level 65 and above are merely amused by profanity.<br />
<br />
At level 65, the warrior's verbal abuse reaches the level of BLASPHEMY.  Uttering blasphemy causes all mobs within hearing range to gain 600 hate towards you, and has a recycle time of 5 minutes (independent of Tease, Mock, Cuss, Invective and Profanity times).  Only mobs level 75 and above are immune to the effects of blasphemy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Analysis:<br />
<br />
Generally you'll only be able to use two of the trash talking abilities against exp mobs, every 5 minutes.  This will let you get a little &quot;snap aggro&quot;, which I think is enough to protect your slower from an unlucky string of taunts, but won't be enough to save rampantly overaggroing wizards or chain-snaring rangers.<br />
<br />
In the high end game you'll only get to use Blasphemy, and only once per 5 minutes for an effect less than one Enraging Blow proc, which seems unlikely to seriously affect raid aggro.<br />
<br />
The best effect of these abilities, of course, is that you'd be able to have EQ conversations that go, &quot;Man, the wizard overnuked again, so I had to open up with invective and profanity&quot;, and &quot;I accidentally cussed in the bank, had to train to zone with a dozen merchants on my ass.&quot;</div></div><hr />
