i started the first one, way back in the start of EQ when we had that gay looking sky over the selling grounds of EC, its moved across the servers like a plague, and now it has found its way into the mind of the dev team.... another grand layer of addiction and a great way to bleed off some of that PP that was gained with exploits<br />
<br />
(btw, this casino they are adding kicks ass!)</div></div><hr />

Apparently there are already people that have won primal weapons, pre-nerf fungi staves and such. I can just imagine the huge plat-sink this will be if people think they can win some nice stuff. Hell, I know I'll try it once or twice ;)<br />
It's amazing how quickly &amp; vehemently (supposedly) that they've put the smack down on the plat exploits; and now they're following up with a stellar idea like this. Hooray!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds interesting.<br />
<br />
If it's NOT true, and it's just a very good hoax ... heh, maybe the devs should take some notes anyways, and consider making it true.<br />
<br />
As plat sinks go, it's a pretty interesting one.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'd ever bother with it. It all depends on what exactly would be the rewards. I've never been a big fan of throwing my plat away, as I never usually have much of it. Even during the big plat-flation of the past month or two.</div></div><hr />

Thats around 110 tokens, and I won between 2 and 25 tokens a couple times so I'd estimate 175 or so total tries.<br />
<br />
I got about 15 &quot;Wheat Bread&quot;, 10 or so herb stew and vegetable stew, some kabobs, a gnomish firework, and a flawless diamond.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt go throwing money into it praying for primal or a guise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like it needs a little tuning on the reward side. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was there last night watching.  I spent 500p but mostly  just watched.  It was pretty funny.  <br />
<br />
The high rewards I know of was 1 fungi staff and 1 pre nerf DE illusion mask.  Think the primal was just a rumor but not sure on that.  <br />
<br />
Mostly you lose or win food or more tokens.  If you can afford to spend it cause you have more money then you'll ever know what to do with it might be a neat way to get a cool extinct item but it isn't really that fun to play.  You just hand the 'dealer' a token and it tells you you lost or puts the winnings on your cursor.  <br />
<br />
Think it will soak up quite a bit of money when it first goes live but I think it will only last a few days since playing isn't fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i spent 1100 (11 tokens) and got 1 bread, 1herb stew, 2 gnome fireworks.<br />
<br />
/cheer<br />
<br />
from chat it sounds like right now they are just testing how it works. the payoff will be changed later, so dont go around thinking that the rewards will stay the same. It will get better before it goes life. I would have spent more money but i kept getting booted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if it keeps these people busy; than sure let them play their casino.<br />
i'd rather just load up Blackjack or Baccarat on the PC tho for my gambling needs</div></div><hr />

65, Gerick.  Since when have you been playing on Test?</div></div><hr />

They'll probably have a merchant nearby that you'll be able to sell no-drop items to.  If you go talk to the Gnome named Bugsy in the back of the casino, he'll let you borrow money for a [small fee].  When you can't pay him back, two Lv 70 Ogre Thumb Breakers will spawn and camp your corpse until you log on an alt to pay him.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, as far as I know 3 people have won guises from my guild.  A rogue and 2 dark elf enchanters :P<br />
<br />
It's pretty fun, I've spent around 3k there and just won vegetable soup, fireworks, and velious quest gems.  I hear it took in 2.5 million plat the first night on Test though, so I think it will be a very effective plat sink.  The plat sellers that are sitting on 50 million plat right now will like this a lot.<br />
<br />
Haven't heard of anyone getting a primal weapon, but I have seen guises, fungi staffs, sleepers tomb resistance stones, and that monk 2hb that used to drop from  trakanon.</div></div><hr />

Best prize was a storebought gate potion - also got the velious gems, gnomish fireworks, 2 illusion potions and a stack of kabobs.<br />

On the plus side, while I was there 2 people won themselves Beer Goggles.</div></div><hr />

Apparently I am lucky though...several people on my server have sunk over 250k and havent won any golden tickets as well as a couple other gold tickets winning items like pre-nerf rubicite BP (ac19 2pt regen) and similar items that have nothing but sentimental value.   I think its gonna help the economy</div></div><hr />
