<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playign a warrior on EQ for about 2 years now. I'm wondering what EQ was like for the highend warriors back then. Could anybody that played a high level warrior back then shed some like on what warrior were like compared to Pallys/Sks back in the day?<br />
<br />
As of right now, most Sks and pallys on my server at 65 have better gear/weapons than I do because alot of their massive upgrades are way easier to obtain as compared to ours. <br />
<br />
I've gone thrugh the Magelos for some Time/Elemental guilds and I see around a 100-250ish difference in Knight AC and about a 200-500 difference in unbuffed HP.<br />
<br />
Considering warriors are supposed to be the most hardy and the best defensive class in the game this appear to be such a low difference that it only makes sense that Knights are the perfered tank of most exp groups.<br />
<br />
I suppose my question is, was there a larger difference between warriors and knights back when Kunark was new? Or even Velious? Or was the difference around the same? (If it was around the same, back then 500 more hp and 200more AC was pretty huge right? With PoP 500hp/200ac appears rather trival)</div></div><hr />

Even back in the day if a sk/pal was in a uber guild and a war was in a gimp guild the sk/pal could have more ac/hp than the war.  Just the way the ball turns.<br />

<br />
Warrior - Indicolite Breastplate +35 AC, +15 Str, +15 Sta, +15 Dex<br />
Paladin - Valorium Chestplate +30 AC, +13 Str, +9 Sta, +9 Wis<br />
<br />
In general Warrior armor had better AC/HP's and Paladin armor had WIS.<br />
<br />
Twin Y'Kesha's were l33t among Warriors while most Paladins used Ghoulbanes.<br />
<br />
By the time Kunark was in full swing Paladins were sporting Deepwater Breastplate +40 AC, +10 Str, +10 Agi, +10 Wis, +50 Mana and a Fiery Avenger<br />
<br />
While Warriors proudly wore a Cobalt Breastplate +45 AC, +12 Str, +12 Sta, +12 Dex, +50 HP and weilded a Sebilite Croaking Dirk and Blade of Strategy.<br />
<br />
In general &quot;high-level&quot; Warriors had more AC and Hp's than Paladins and owned the first &quot;Hate&quot; weapons in the game.<br />
<br />
Paladins had small mana pools and their best heal was Superior Heal.<br />
<br />
As a result, of this Warriors became the prefered MT's in raids and groups. Many Paladins who weren't in advantageous guild situations gave up and either retired or made another character. Others toughed it out and accepted an offtank role in raids and largely grouped with friends and guildmates.<br />

Cleric and rogue armor fell like rain, but indicolite just never fell for me. Shammy armor too was way rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was no real advantage to having a warrior over a ranger and the ranger could spirit of wolf you...  Weapons were very bad, most armor had no hps.<br />
<br />
Kunark:  Warriors were the cool melee<br />
<br />
Hit point advantages were there and superior AC gave warriors there short day in the sun.<br />
<br />
Velious:  Things were pretty well in balance IMO<br />
<br />
The armors you could get crafted by the giants, dragons and dwarves kept warriors in an advantageous position.  SoDs and BoCs allowed warriors some decent agro control.<br />
<br />
Luclin:  Monks were uber for the first half of it<br />
<br />
Monks were soloing like crazy for AA points.  Monks could avoid damage like nobodies business until they were nerfed to where they should be and everyone who made a twink monk that later became their primary hold a grudge til this day.  Items that were all/all, or melee/all hurts warriors a lot.<br />
<br />
PoP:  Knights own, Bards are ridiculous for soloing, warriors and monks blow (in general)<br />
<br />
This is where we are at.  Read all kinds of places for how things are messed up throughout the Steel Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vagabond</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the original game warriors, especially troll and ogre warriors who maxed STA, had a helluva lot more hp than paladins or shadowknights.  Something like 2400hp vs. 1800hp with top end gear.  Even if the race were the same, the hp gap was pretty big; say, 2200 vs 1800.<br />
<br />
While hp were significantly higher, AC was closer: a paladin with his self buffs had about the same AC as a warrior. <br />
<br />
In addition to much much higher hp, the warrior did a shitload more damage because dualweilding fast 1-Handers just did a shitload more damage than any 2-Handed weapon.<br />
<br />
In ROK, the hp gap came down a bit but warriors still had tons more hp.<br />
<br />
For tanking in xp groups and raids warriors were preferred over paladins and SKs.</div></div><hr />
