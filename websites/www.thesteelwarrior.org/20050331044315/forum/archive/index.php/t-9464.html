Since murkgliders is now a pain in the ass to duo, I'm looking at doing either fire pit or watering hole, with my 66 shammy getting the instance. Does anyone have a site of out of game maps with the correct named locations, or does anyone know that actual /loc or description of their spawn point?<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

For some reason the Firepits map wasn't included in the Omens of War map pack at Mapfiend.  I had to download that map separately from Map Fiend.<br />
<br />
For 66 Firepit the 1st ph is a Noc Warrior.  He lives in the room with the big firepit in it  (he's right next to the firepit thingy).  The second ph is a Dragorn Commoner.  He lives in the last L shaped room in the back of the dungeon.  He's the mob kind of in the back left corner of the room.<br />
<br />
I've only done the 68 version of watering hole so can't help with ph of the 66 instance for that theme.</div></div><hr />

Its the middle Girplan in that room.  The other PH is a Discordling Warrior, and is located on the north side tunnel, between the L shaped room and the round room half way down. It is the only Discord Warrior so should be easy to find.<br />
<br />
   And with a good group you can almost clear all the mobs between PH's by the time they respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the discordling warrior PH in watering hole is somewhere around +650, +2250? I've heard this mob is one that you can kill without any adds without using paci, has anyone else done this or heard of it being done? Would make it much easier for me and shambot to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have pulled the discordling warrior solo easy enough. What I do is go past the ph into the far hall. There is one mob there that wanders back and forth.  Wait till it wanders down away from the warrior then aggro and kill it. Then pull the warrior there, once again being sure the wanderer in the other hall is away from the PH when you pull it.<br />
<br />
   Trying to kill the wanderer in the hall before the warrior seemed harder as adds from the L shaped room aggroed.</div></div><hr />
