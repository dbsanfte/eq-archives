<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if there will be additional beta sign-ups or if they'll only be sending emails to those who already signed up.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I didn't meet the minimum requirements for the beta during the 1 week sign-up (my video card was RMA'ed at the time!), so I didn't sign up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Last official release I saw was no more allowed in.<br />
<br />
But, who knows, they might change that.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, away I go to check my e-mail today hoping that I get that magical notice.<br />
<br />
(pathetic that a 38yo man, wife, 2 kids is sooo excited about the possibility of beta) /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, they will definately let more in at some point.  If you read the front page on www.blizzard.com they come right out and say it.  They are, however, vague as to whether or not there will be more sign-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bandvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most likely no more til they go to a open beta. Which Blizzard just posted saying their beta is going to be 5+ months.</div></div><hr />

So that means open Beta wont start for another 5+ months? :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already sent out emails for acceptance into Phase 2, so there will definitely be more people before the open beta.  Right now there are under 1k people on the server, so it's pretty much a given they're going to add more to test out the server load in certain areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Found this link at blizzard's site, http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/:<br />
World of Warcraft could be the next big thing when it is released later this summer. (http://www.gamegossip.com/article.php?id=42) <br />
This summer?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Summer 2005.  If it comes early, you'll be pleasantly surprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Summer 2005.  If it comes early, you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Who wants to do the Stress Test though?  They will basically just give out crap loads of keys and see how bad the lag sucks on the server.  woot.....  heh</div></div><hr />
