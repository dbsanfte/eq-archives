<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been camping in ssra quite a bit lately, and am getting super pissed at how rare comm2 seems to pop (and even more so at how I lose the rolls on his drop =p).  Is there anything special about his spawn, or are any of the snakes on the second floor placeholders for him?  I know there can't be more than one comm2 up at a time, so we always check track and such, but it seems like he only spawns if you are not around.  For example, if we just sit in a tube room and kill snakes from there and surrounding area on same floor, he never spawns.  But if we camp both comm1 and comm2 and move camp up/down floors, it seems like every time we have gotten a commander to spawn, it has been the commander for whatever floor we were not currently on.  Is there any kind of other special spawn logic, or are hours of unsuccessful camping starting to get to my head?</div></div><hr />

( honestly; it's all crap luck...good luck though on getting him to pop up )</div></div><hr />

I'd go 5-6 hours without seeing him pop. Then i'd see him pop like 4 times in one hour the next day. Just pure luck I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
it worked well for a bit, then the pullers kept getting summoned everytime they had 10+ mobs on them at the same time. We got Zhero and Zazu to spawn twice or so each...<br />
<br />
<br />
    I think its just luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
No special logic. Kill PHs (yes basically anything on the 2nd floor can be a PH), hope for Commander. More dead PHs = more chance for Commanders.  2nd floor seemed to be the rarest from my extensive experience camping key pieces. If you want it, you just gotta grin and bear it, pretty much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlaydennSL</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zheroszh is the suck, his spawn is totally random. Best suggestion I can give is if your guild is looking at Emp, get three groups in at a time, 1 doing Zazuzh, and 1 group on each section of level 2 looking for Zheroszh. His spawns about an even amount of time on the 2 different sections. Lot easier to camp him when your friends around u. Camping him is worth it tho :)<br />
<br />
As I say, unfort he's all random. I have seen a group earlier this week not get him once in 6 hours, 2 days ago a group of us got him 3 times in a single hour. <br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why most people camp him in assassin room. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah Comm2 is streaky but he is pretty damn easy to kill and not tough to clear to him and camp him with yourself and a healer. Your gear and AA are roughly same as probably even better if comparing with the gear I had when I did that and without kinz gaunts. Also I dont think I ever gone more then 4 hours without comm2 pop so he is not that bad. Ore in the mines can be much worse. By the way if you are doing it with cleric make sure you clear portal itself cleared since mobs do run, but get stuck in portal.<br />
<br />
Comm1 is even easier and more common.</div></div><hr />

When you get close to that amount of grinning and bearing it let me know.<br />

Well over 300 hours farming commanders and shards for people in ssra here. The place where I've had the best luck was in tube rooms with the the 2 guards at the ramp from outer to inner ring. I've especially had the best luck with those guards of the 2nd floor tube to the arch lich side of 3rd. But that camp requires a key or aggro pulling through the locked door.</div></div><hr />

Clear the 3 spawn by any of the tubes on 2nd floor he pops there the most from my experience too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the hundreds of hours I spent there was helping others mostly. The reference was more that over time I'd noticed patterns, not that he's that rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you go there with a balanced group and only you need the items id say 3-5 hours avg to get pouch, comm1 idol, and comm2 ring</div></div><hr />
