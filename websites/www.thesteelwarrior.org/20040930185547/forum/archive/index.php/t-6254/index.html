<br />
Today there was a GM event; an ogre drunken run down the SK pass to the bridge. Sounds cool, I tell the &quot;channel&quot; and Koko and Muun show up. We get going, and then run down. Muun ends up dying on the way down, Koko gets 3rd, and I get 5th because I forgot to jump half the time. We all get slain by trained mobs, then we go back to Feerott....for Koko to win....<br />
<br />
Fucking Qeynos Afternoon Tea.<br />
<br />
That's it. <br />
<br />
We hear of another one on Cazic-Thule, so we go on, and then Dima joins up. I get disqualified at first because I was drinking before the &quot;Ale Nazi&quot; told us to on accident making a hotkey. (IT WAS MUUNX'S FAULT!) I get taken back, but it was too late because I had to start last =(<br />
<br />
I get like 6th this time, Dima falls off the cliff, Koko gets 1st, and Muunx gets 2nd.<br />
<br />
What do we win?<br />
<br />
Kaladim Constitutional.<br />
<br />
GMs need to SERIOUSLY learn how to give out prizes =/<br />
<br />
EDIT: They even asked Koko and Muunx to log onto their mains. God knows why.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is part of whats wrong with this game nowadays.  We're all so jaded that we've missed the point of these GM events.  The experience is all about the competition or the fun we have with a few of our friends.  Instead everyone hears 'GM event' and we all want to know what the winner is going to get.   I don't really blame GMs for not doing more of them with the attitude most of us bring.  <br />
<br />
I remember once when I was hunting in DL around lvl 40.  Some GM event happened where the GMs all stormed into the zone disguised as voracious brutes with names.  They were pretty tough for the level we were at and the group I was in managed to bring a couple of them down.  After the GMs rezzed themselves they rezzed our fallen group members and proceeded to give each of us a gem and a tradeskill flower of some type.  The gem I sold, think it was worth about 2g.  The flower I kept, still have it to this day collecting dust in one of my bank slots, but when I look at it I have a fond memory of something I did when I was new to this game.  Thats what these events are supposed to be about.  Call me sentimental if you'd like :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">khaz i could understand that if GM events still had the flippy darkpaw mechs, ya that'd be something fun and interesting.<br />
<br />
but this shit? any player could hold the same event and give out BETTER prizes.<br />
<br />
if a player can hold the event just as well, it didnt have enough effort put into it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Before PoP came out, a GM Troll went to Thurgadin, sat at the bank and started to shout that she had a story to tell. Many ppl ignored her of course, but a few, myself included, sat and heard her talk, and emote and laughed with us, he even said I could be a great dinner :p and after all the talk and stories, she gave each one a few cookies and chocolate and poofed. Not much of a GM event but it was a really fun time :)<br />
<br />
Just like when they were celebrating the day of Erollisi or something about Love, and Erollisi sent everyone to bring her things across Norrath and help her forging love between races... or something like that... another fun too... and I think I got some flowers after all the run haha, Im the kind that keeps all that stuff in the bank like Khazzuz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">best i ever did was diving for treasure, and the gm(and about 5 guides) started popping up as PC controled sharks and they played jaws as we recovered a bunch of loot from 5 or 6 ships that were sunk just for us.... that was really neat.<br />
<br />
another cool think is we found a human head in one of the sharks and it sparked the second half of the GM event, finding out what sunk the ships and what person needed the remains returned to them.<br />
<br />
i was about level 12, 4 years ago on my hummy war and i made 80p in gems (mind you that was alot back then) it was really neat and very enteraining</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">funniest GM event prize is still the milk and chocolate chip cookies for listening to a GM talk about stuff; but overall the best GM event I ever attended ( prob because no one in EQ was a high level person ) was about 100+ of us were following around Mayong Mistmoore on his quest to slay Lady Vox.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you know what?  I don't want GM events where I get drunk and run from Point A to Point B.  I want the story to evolve a little.<br />
<br />
What ever happened to the time when Qeynos was plagued and there were CONSTANT GM events as they tried to find the prepetrators?  Even down to a trial and execution.<br />
<br />
I don't want to catch an ogre called &quot;A Lovely Bunny&quot;, I want to vanquish the evils of Norrath or help spread them.<br />
<br />
I agree, it's about the fun.  But there's very little fun in running from A to B and going &quot;Wow, GM's sure do put a lot into these things.  I'm glad they got off their busy schedule of not answering my petitions to tell me to do what I do with friends whenever I'm bored.&quot;</div></div><hr />

A very long ago halloween event where EK was full of spectres, WC was full of werevolves, Nro was full of zombies, was really fun too :)<br />

I wonder if talic still has the log of his event he was in with The Battle of Fallen Kithicor. It was a cool story and he even got a little reward for it and got to meet some GM-run NPC's which were key players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">they need a gm event for every new expansion like was done with shadows of luclin.</div></div><hr />

Yeah story was amazing.  Aftermath was great.<br />
<br />
Implementation of further GM Events were atrocious :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bloody Kithicor was my favorite GM event. Most of you know the details by now, so I will just tell you I got to fight along side the High Elf GM's. I was playing a level 20 or so High Elf Paladin I named Ealin Honorshield. We awaited the onslought of evil in the middle of the zone somewhere along the path. Whether or not it was intentional, when Lany's and her evil army came, we could not attack. Only the GM's could attack. It was very confusing, so after a while i just stood back and watched, when I noticed the leader of the good side had fallen. I had bowed before him earlier, pledging my sword before the fight and whether he was a lootable mob or had given me loot rights to his corpe (you could still do that in those days) I will never know. I right clicked and what did i see?<br />
<br />
Bladestopper<br />
<br />
Golden Diamond Mask<br />
<br />
and  a Nature Walker' s Scimitar<br />
<br />
These items were very nice at this stage in the game. In fact on our server, Errolisi Marr, Bladestopper had not even dropped off Nagafen yet.<br />
<br />
Well, as with looting anyones corpse, I had my sence of honor about me... I gave him a tell saying, &quot;I can see your corpse and its lootable, do you want me to loot the items and get them to you?&quot; No reply... I must have sent him about 10 tells before I just decided to loot them and get them back to him when I saw him next. Of couse you know I never saw him again and I was the proud owner of some pretty neat stuff at level 20.<br />
<br />
That is all i can remember of the event. I wish I had screen shots or something else to remember it by, a log perhaps. It was a fun time, I long for something like thatin the future. Perhaps it shall happen again.<br />

But they were fighting stuff, not running around drinking. Im sure there was training and griefing though, it was SZ afterall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the halloween GM events ( deathfests ); esp the ones where EK and RM and a few other zones were run over with those lower level PoF mobs; was hands down the funniest sh*t ever.<br />
<br />
Dying in them was almost inevitable. And I personally laughed the entire time and even lost a level. But it was worth runnng home to log in for.<br />
<br />
These days the only GM event i'd run off to is some h0ttie Fem Wood Elf wet T-Shirt contest. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Haass said is true. Few days ago they had a war tournament in the Freeport arena on Luclin. Had to from 60 -65. Price to get in was 10k ( little steep ). Only about 15 warriors showed up most in the Time plus guilds. They all left when they were told all would have the same gear and weapons. Needless to say the event did not make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I managed to take part in the beggining of a gm event. I was on my druid though and it was an evil only type thing I guess. An iksar necro the conned red to me at 45 spawned outside the tofs and all sorts of zone wide emotes were going on. I tried to talk to the iksar and got the usual begone peck type talk, (hey, im a halfing, I guess I deserved it lol) Then, when I threatened to teach him to respect the forces of the light he immidiately killed me. :( I ported back and watched for awhile, he eventually zoned into tofs, saying something about tserrina or whatever her name is, then there were DOZENS of those guardian mobs spawned outside. Too many for me to run through and live. (I tried three times lol) I really wish I had gotten inside to follow along.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Wow, that GM event on Luclin couldn't have been more elite, where the warriors all would have had the same gear.<br />
<br />
I really like to duel, but there comes a point when someones gear is just so much better than you'll never win if they even have the slightest clue as to what their doing.<br />
<br />
Me and a monk pal of mine &quot;grew up&quot; together and we always would always duel each other.  I could own the hell out of him until he got that damn 54/30 or something weapon from Time =(<br />
<br />
GM events are pretty fun, that's the whole point of them is to have fun.  It often brings alot of different players together and blah blah, everyone holds hands and eats a snack.  I'd really like to see them put some more time and effort into some really good scripts =(<br />
<br />
Shikarii, what happend with Mayong's quest to slay Lady Vox?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">a few times in the last month or so a couple of GM's show up in PoK and duck-walk in a line saying &quot;chooo-choo!&quot; and getting people to add to the line making it longer.<br />
<br />
YAY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Arrliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There was a GM run event about a month ago in the Arena zone off Lake Rathe. Buy in was 1k. The event was the Fatties against the Skinnies. Large races (Ogres, Barbs, Trolls and Human ) against small races. It looked well thought out until people started showing up. When the event started there were twice as many on the Skinny team as on the Fatty team. Now, for the most part, there aren't too many casters in the Large department. So you can see where this is going. The casters basically wiped the Arena floor with us! It was somewhere around 23 Fatties mostly warriors with a few shaman and beasties against almost 50 pure casters and hybrids. In the end we only killed 14 of them while they won the event. I was playing my 65 shaman and was killed by some level 49 mage! I still remember him sending me a tell after tell afterward asking me how it felt being killed by him. I told him to step back into the Arena with that attitude and no one to back him up and he promptly stop sending me tells. Needless to say, it was a fun time had by all (even us losers). The GM's rezzed everyone that had died and lined up the winning team against the Arena wall and called the forth one at a time to give them a reward of 3k. There were also 3 people from the winning team and 1 person from the losing team picked as MVP's these people got some somewhat nice gems and equipment. The only one I saw was from the losing team MVP and it was a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think the GM events have been somewhat lacking, but that is due to the fact that just about everyone in the game is more high end now. There are very few actual n00bs. Most people are so twinked out by level 2 that there's no reason to give out anything other than cookies and milk at a GM event!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Personally I'd just like to see some token saying &quot;So and so took part in some GM event&quot; or maybe grafting your character's name onto an item (GM created or otherwise). Just something special to keep as a conversation piece for later on. Fabled gear for example is among the best keepsakes of a great event, and I still bang my head on the wall for missing out on Fabled Fippy's Paw.</div></div><hr />

Zone crashed :D Serious. Once Mayong and about 4 people made it inside Permafrost the zone crashed inside, than whoever had gate and was stuck outside tried to leave...but us poor melees ( i was a bard at the time so i fired up selos and rann for halas ) ...  it was over.<br />
<br />
GM's gone, corpses gone, and from what i can recollect Vox got the sh*y beat out of her; by NPC's tho I bet. I think the guild that was really big in levels at the time was Prophecy? It was right before Dark Brethren was formed. ( this was bertoxx server )<br />
<br />
But Mayong kicked ass. It was the same model ( Dark Elf, Dark Blue robe ) that is shown on Allakazam's and he was talkin' shit the whole time while dragons were seen flying across Norrath.</div></div><hr />
