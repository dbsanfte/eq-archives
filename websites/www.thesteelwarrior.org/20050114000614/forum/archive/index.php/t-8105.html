<br />
I've got A3 on my mainhand and I'd like to get another A3 on my offhand.  This will leave me with an A2 unused.  I've debated turning it back in for the half credit or possibly putting it on my GSoT ( but why bother really?).  Then I thought, hey my bow has no aug on it.  I could toss the A2 on my bow and hope that it may fire sometimes as I can usually get off a few arrows on a pull.  However, I'm wondering if I was in a situation where I'm not supposed to have aggro, I may sit back and toss arrows at a mob.  But then again, if I'm standing in the distance and tossing arrows for relatively small damage I doubt the +400 to hate would do much at that range.  What do you all think?  Anyone experimented with this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually my bow ( stonewood compound bow ) uses a type 4 aug.  But I didn't think to check the aug requirements, no range.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, I guess I'll turn it in for pts.<br />

I was suprised that it does proc more than I thought it would... but still, it doesn't proc nearly enough to be worth it.  Throwing a cheap proc on is kinda a nice bonus when it goes off, just for &quot;wow that's neat&quot; sakes, but not worth putting anything expensive on there.</div></div><hr />

I've been thinking about this off and on.  When I get my anger augs, I will probably just move one of my cheap aug's to the bow for now.  However, the Ykesha stun proc seems to be the ideal proc for a bow (think Paladins stunning mob on pulls) for incoming agro.  Of course, it could also slow pulls down if it's sitting there stunned...but imagine hitting taunt after just 1 stun from bow (plus it's innate possible proc, of course) then incite.  That's close to 1k agro without turning on auto attack.  Still...not something I'm liable to do right away since ldon points are still better spent on other items / augments atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm...ok, I hadn't thought about the range issue with agro...but Paladins certainly had something going with their pulling w/ stuns.  As I said, low on the todo list, gear and anger augs first (now that we can remove augs, which is, sweet!).</div></div><hr />

Like that cheap 2hb with the stun proc from BoT.<br />

Hala</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the aug mentioned.... 20 pts for a 20DD proc.<br />
<br />
I can think of lots of ways to waste more points for less benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">like the ft1 type 7 aug a accedently bought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ykesha is a 0sec stun.  The mob won't even stutter other than the slight 1 foot knockback the Yak also has.</div></div><hr />
