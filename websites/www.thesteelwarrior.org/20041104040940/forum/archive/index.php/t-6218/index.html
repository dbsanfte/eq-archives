<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am planning on starting my crown of deceit quest.  I have read mixed posts about this quest.  From some races cannot do it regardless of how many frogs in dead side of guk they killed.  To anyone can do it.  But, I was wondering a few things.<br />
<br />
I am a troll warrior, have the scalp for the faction boost.  I worship Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
1.  Have any trolls completed this quest?<br />
<br />
2.  Where can I check my current faction?<br />
<br />
Any other things I need to know would be greatly appreiciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garthud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tried to look up the details I kept on doing this, and couldn't find them, so will have to remember this off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Troll here, had to have been maxed kos, because lived on the Live side of Lower guk, since most good races stuck to the dead side.<br />
<br />
Scalp will help either 300, or 500 faction kills.  Don't remember which, but was one of them.<br />
<br />
Total kills to get from Kos up to good enough, with scalp, was around 2700 I think.  I also bribed an enchanter to come down and cast IMP illusion, which was a 1000 point modifier, but have heard that trick no longer works.<br />
<br />
Did make some decent money after all the fine steel.. some of the drops sell to the vendors for much more than the market... 80-85 pp or so.<br />
<br />
I bent over backwards trying to be considerate of people that was fighting down there for exp.  Often I'd offer if they wanted to join up, and get all the loot, would often difuse any hard feelings, and help the kill count go faster.<br />
<br />
I have to pass on the funnest time with this... 3 of us.  Me 65 warrior, 65 cleric, and a 51 shammie friend.  We are in the Lord room, only ones on the dead side.  I announce to my group &quot;Inc 75 !&quot;  I think my shaman friend about fell out of his chair.  Got almost every undead frog in the zone.  Run to the back of the Lord room.. wait for the train.... repose on almost all of them (remember need to get a hit on them for faction).  As my repose finishes, cleric does an AOE undead AA ability, finishing them off..... Shaman friend gets 75 exp messages *laughs*...  Given our refresh times, we could do this about once an hour... was an absolute hoot.<br />
<br />
Good luck on the quest... quite handy for a troll.</div></div><hr />

Con any living Froglok in Upper or Lower Guk works. There are also other places I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Undead side is sprinked with living froglok slaves at various places which you can use to monitor your faction (exe room, jail, slave pit, frenzy, and of course live frogs through the gargoyle door).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK I have a dumb question I can understand why an evil race would want this item but as a hobbit is there any reason I would want this?</div></div><hr />

Look in the mirror, and you'll find your answer.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From my understanding large races use it because a troll/ogre/barbi cannot be shrunk enough to corner some mobs so they use it for that reason.  Or so they dont have to use shrink in small places.</div></div><hr />

Thank you that was what I was thinking but was not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great for Vah Shir; we cannot corner tank because of our tails. I used this until I got my human clicky from VT.</div></div><hr />

Great for Vah Shir; we cannot corner tank because of our tails. I used this until I got my human clicky from VT.  <br />
<br />
Really? Vah Shir's tails get in the way of corner tanking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Main thing i use this for is Conering. 1 shrink + Illusion Crown= me able to corner mobs when i tank on raids being a Troll in all, took me about 1 week atleast to get faction up, but i am Agnostic and used a human illusion potion to do turn in with &quot;An old froglok&quot; quest guy.<br />
<br />
-Good Luck</div></div><hr />

Really :( Was a big problem for me for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you have an Rampage/Earthshaker, factioning becomes fun/trivial.<br />
3 Easy steps to faction farming:<br />
#1. Run all through Lguk Dead side aggroing every frog you can.<br />
#2. Run back up to the top of the tower and out the front door on the bridge and back a forth a few times on the bridge to get them all grouped.<br />
#3. Turn to face them(get right up to them so rampage hits as many as possible), target and Rampage.<br />
<br />
Be prepared for the screen to momentarily freeze as the whole mass falls over dead ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snarl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you have to get max faction no matter what race you are.<br />
<br />
good races max at warmly which is enough to do the quest.<br />
<br />
evil races max at indifferent.. they must then get the faction mod scalp that the ghoul lord drops and get an illusion goody potion.<br />
<br />
best way to get faction is the furious/AE method in Lguk.  You can also get live faction from sebilis aswell.</div></div><hr />

Well, this Barbarian is and has been ally to frogloks for several years (solo'd level 54-59 in AM/Lord hall).  I got the first crown on Xev, mostly because I didn't have to do any faction work.</div></div><hr />
