<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'm glad that SoE finally increased the availability of a few weapons with aggro procs, like the Greatstaff of Thunder, or with solid dps, like the Greatstaff of the Four Winds, I just think they look way more stupid than they need to. <br />
<br />
What warriors, especially REAL warriors (like ogres), need are big axes, brutal looking hammers, spiked clubs, cool looking swords, etc. What we don't need are completely bizarre things that have no visible relationship to a weapon, and that really look like some kind of caster staff. The GSoT might be a sort of balancing tool making badly needed aggro and dps available to warriors not able to summon up 60 person raids to gather them gear, but it shouldn't come with the penalty of making them look like gimps. I mean, I might be a welfare warrior, but do I have to run around with a sign saying &quot;GIMP&quot; on my back by carrying around some freaky caster staff/weapon?<br />
<br />
The Exe Axe or Earthen Blade -- now THOSE were cool weapons. Mithril 2Handed sword? Win! Felhammer? Win! Club of the Ykesha? Win! GSoT? Not Win!<br />
<br />
Bring back the Exe Axe!<br />
<br />
(Maybe if I just put an Anger III proc on the Exe Axe...?)<br />
<br />
P.S. I will agree that the sword of the bloodsworn looks just fine, and even the droga hammer is okay. Props there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.<br />
GSoT's biggest &quot;win&quot; is that the group can regocnize it easy and know you have an at least decent aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, who the hell designed that weapon ?<br />
I mean, for Shamans and Bards the graphic is kinda fitting, but for a warrior ?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
If used in real world settings, the weapon would have a lousy balance and that ring thingy would be anethemae to doing any significant damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here is where I agree with Furor wholeheartedly... gimmie Rallos' flaming axe of own.<br />

They could probably stand to make a couple more true polearm models. The Black Acrylia Halberd model was a nice start.</div></div><hr />

the GSo4w? i agree, looks like a big tazer, and when ya fight with it...... its like a giant push broom :D</div></div><hr />

That is one of the coolest weapon models ever. Put some flames on it and BAM! That would be the axe of pwn. I weild a Poleaxe of Sorrow for DPS, if I hear one more &quot;oh you have a windblade&quot; comment I am gonna go bezerk on some poor caster. Big lances, big hammers, big axes!</div></div><hr />

Usually, they stop and go &quot;Why do you need such compensation?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not mad for many of the new weapon models (the LSoEE is still one of my favourites) ... but the first thing I wanna see is an end to the poking with my 2HB.  It's not a game of 9-ball!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is no lance model in game currently that doesnt look even gayer than centi Longswords and Black Acrylia Halberds.  Please, no more gigantic dildoes of doom.<br />
<br />
Lances wouldnt be usable anywhere except a horse anyway - they should replace all warrior 2hp weapons' graphics with the priceless velium spear graphic.  THERES a spear.<br />
<br />
But yes, Exe Axe was a great graphic.  As are many of the graphics in LoY and LDoN.  Too bad neither expansion includes a single warrior usable weapon worth equipping past lvl 20.</div></div><hr />

heh ... not as much as hitting them with a Frostreaver or something like that, yet it performs just as well.<br />
<br />
On another not, I really like the look of the Stone Etched War Sword (aka. SEWS). Snapshot of  Gerald wielding it (http://members.cox.net/mondo/sews2.jpg). I'd really like one of those. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definately agree... GSo4W rocks but I feel like a pansy wielding it... exe axe, earthen blade, palladus axe of slaughter... that is for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  The fact that my BBB looks like the standard luclin trash 2hs, along with a lot of other weapons makes me sad.  I wish it had the Sword of Truth look, or at least some special model, not something so common.  I loved my GSo4W, but I really got tired of that look.  Especially since 2hb has a piercing animation, it looks like a fork.</div></div><hr />

You hit this right on the head.<br />
<br />
Two of the weapons I use often GSOT and Club of Mad Researcher look fairly ridiculous.  The animation on 2HB really is particularly sad....with illusion frog I look like I am waving a baton in a parade.<br />
<br />
I loved the ol' Exec axe.  Loved the EBW, loved the SSoY.  <br />
<br />
In SoE defense though: some the weaps I do use also look fairly cool...I like my CHSD and the droga weapons looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  I myself, like the look of the Windblade for an axe (albeit some plagerism from LoTR).  I'd love to see some 2h axes with big stone blades, chips in them, make them look like a warriors weapon for crying out loud.</div></div><hr />

The JBoW is the best looking warrior weap, bar none.   I also wish there was a 2-hander with the Katana of Pain look (maybe there is, but I don't know of any).  I can't complain about my WMBS too much, I like Japanese style weapons.</div></div><hr />

Holding a staff weapon at the middle and then swinging it overhead with your legs spread is not a pretty sight!<br />
My favorite graphics are the Cazic Thule 2.0 look. I used to have both the 10/19 1hb and the 33/36 2hs. Stone hammerhead or stone axe blade on a shaft that actually looked like wood.</div></div><hr />

Now make the same graphic about 25% bigger and it would draw the &quot;ooooh's and aaaaaah's&quot;<br />
<br />
It is by far the best looking sword in game , the detail is amazing.<br />

It has definitely a Shaman's look over it. But then again, i have never seen a graphics change unless something was really wrong (the &quot;boobs&quot; armor from Velious comes to mind).<br />

<br />
Due to the fact that all plate armor looks the same, the only real way to look different or interesting is by having cool weapons. =&gt; <br />
<br />
If I see a bazaar warrior with a split blade of destruction, my immediate reaction=idiot with too much plat. <br />
<br />
See a GSoT and I think=&gt; smart guy, but I do feel sorry for him having to wield a weapon with that graphic.<br />
<br />
I m actually very fashion victim (and somewhat idiotic) myself.....I was in such a hurry to ditch my Copper hammer of striking I bid on Vallon's Scimitar and the Jagged shard of Frozen Flame off Jiva......both of which are ok offhand (especially auged), but dodgy when defensive. Then again, they were cheap dkp-wise and both look very cool :p<br />
<br />
My BoC is still my mainhand workhorse, but I hate the twinky graphic with a vengeance (damn cheapass Cursed and RZ.....1 BF and 3 BoW s in 25 kills each, 2 of which went to warriors who quit=&gt; we are cursed). At least it is recognizable on a veteran warrior as an enraging blow weapon. <br />
<br />
Dammit, yeah, there should be more F****ing warrior only 2 handers (especially huuuuuuge axes and swords like the Frostmourne in WC3) like back in the heydays of NToV.<br />
<br />
/em steps off soapbox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the operative word here is &quot;elegant&quot;.  Far too many of the new weapon designs that come out are over the top.  That splitblade thing just offends my senses.  The bloodsworn is about at fancy as it should get.  Just make it look like an finely honed, balanced weapon that an noble warrior wouldn't get laughed at for brandishing on the battlefield.  Heck... I'll take more katanas any day of the year!  I'll even forego particle effects... I don't need 'em.<br />
<br />
PS.  My guildmates used to call my GSoT the &quot;anti-bard picket sign&quot;.  I'm so glad I sold it for 40k when they didn't drop off EC orcs.<br />

They are huge and clumsy in some cases, often being so big that they would break the wrist of any regular man if were even just trying to pick it up, no less wield it.<br />
<br />
We want more elegant swords in the game dammit !<br />
Like the Narsil (http://www.cbswords.com/product_info.php/cPath/21/products_id/41) from lord of the rings movie, that's elegant.<br />

Oh well - I guess the overly large stuffs is popular with the kiddies.</div></div><hr />
