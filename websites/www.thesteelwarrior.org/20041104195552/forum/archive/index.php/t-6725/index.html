<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not a very active LDoN adventurer, only now having almost enough EF points to be able to get an Anger2 aug, and probably forever before I would be able to purchase an Anger3 one.  I do have enough points from other themes combined though, that once I can get the Anger2 aug, I would probably be able to get two of them.  Given how long it would probably be before I would be able to get an Anger3 aug, do you think it might be better to go ahead and get two Anger2 augs for now?  I currently have a BoC primary and Strat secondary, and I'll probably be upgrading the Strat to a CHSD or GBotS soon.  I'm thinking that it will be better for me (for a while anyway) to have two Anger2 augs than waiting who knows how long to get one Anger3 aug.  What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anger 2 = Ykesha (might as well go for that one for the extra dps).<br />
<br />
If i were you, slowly save up and put Anger3 on the BoC.<br />
Leave the offhander un augmented.<br />
<br />
Anger 2 main hand = 2PPM = 800 h/min<br />
Anger 2 off hand = 1 PPM = 400 h/min<br />
<br />
Anger 3 main hand = 2 PPM = 1200 h/min<br />
<br />
The results are exactly the same, and wont &quot;lock you&quot; with 2 weapons.<br />
And if one day you ever get a mainhander better than BoC.<br />
You will still keep BoC offhand and get a great combo</div></div><hr />

My advice is to get the anger2. You'll feel like you are accomplishing something and they work fine. No need to wait the additional YEAR to get anger 3.<br />

regular ldons are incredibly easy.  any healer + ench + tank + 3 others = gtg<br />
<br />
if you cant find an ench, make sure you have a bard or a monk to pull and sub in a shaman or even a beastlord.<br />
<br />
anger3 makes all the difference over anger2.  especially if you plan on tanking any boss mobs.  the extra 200 hate per proc really adds up over time<br />
<br />
its quite possible to grind out 500 points in a long day of playing via regular ldons.   i know, because i did it with patchwork pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To grind out 500 points would take 23 successes on normal or 15 success on hard.<br />
<br />
It usually takes about 70 minutes or so to complete a mission (this is a rough average). If I multiply 70 minutes times 15 hard adventures, I learn that it will take me 17.5 straight hours to accumulate 500 points.<br />

Ouch! Personally, I'd buy the Anger2 augment.<br />

<br />
I wonder though, exactly how true that is, and how much of it isn't just our normal reaction based on the way sony designed LDoN.<br />
<br />
I mean, boss mob tanking was done prior to anger augments. And anger 1, 2, or 3, technically would be better than NO anger. So Anger 2 would be an upgrade for the person.<br />
<br />
And then there's the presence of INCITE. The extra hate generated by Incite is actually designed to add up over time.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is ... if all you need is 373 feet to hit a home run ... is it really that big a deal that you can hit one 420 feet with your aluminum bat? A home run is a home run.<br />
<br />
I dunno. I think that's something that gets overlooked from time to time around here. A little weapon affinity, a little Incite, and a weapon like a copper hammer that already has a hate proc, and I just don't think the difference between Anger 2 and Anger 3 is really making much of a dent on tankability at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go for Anger III in the BoC.  If you are a casual player you won't upgrade that BoC for a long time, and there is a significant difference between Anger 2 and 3.  It doesn't take that long if you can get into a group that will do a few in a row.  The thing I hate about LDoN is it takes an hour to get a group together, an hour to do an adventure, and then everybody logs.  Much harder to find 6 compatible LFG people to get LDoN going than just to find a group in BoT that can use one more. If you can find a group that is committed to doing 3 or 4 adventures as fast as possible though, the points add up pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it all depends on who you are grouping with.  youre right, you only need to hit s 373 foot homerun.  to use the your analogy, its like saying:<br />
<br />
a wooden bat can hit a ball &quot;x&quot; distance<br />
an aluminum bat can hit a bal &quot;1.3x&quot; distance .... 30% farther.<br />
<br />
you wont always get your maximum aggro potential out of your weapon swings.  random number generator;s can be a bitch, and your value of x may not be running at maximum.   wouldnt it suck to try ang hit a homerun with a wooden bat, but instead being shy 20 yards.... all the while knowing that if you had sprung the extra 20 bucks for the aluminum bat the ball would have gone over the fence?<br />
<br />
all this assumes that you never raid tank against high dps casters and/or very high dps hybrids/melees.  to put it bluntly, no ... a copper hammer + anger 2 wont let you hold aggro while at the same time letting everybody go full-out dps.<br />
<br />
if you really are that slow at racking up ldon points ... and you desperately need more aggro RIGHT NOW ... go ahead and anger2 your BoC.  in the end, though, you;ll wish you had saved up for anger3<br />
<br />
i anger2'd both my stick and my now sold CHoS.  i regret ever doing it, as i would have 1k more ldon points now if i hadnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ps with wa2 i lost aggro with a CHoS  + anger2 on a gimp tower raid a month or so ago. offhander was unaugmented.<br />
<br />
evert little bit helps.  there is no such thing as too much aggro.  especially since the rest of eq now knows that warriors have all these new aggro toys.  they used to hold back, but now its assumed that our aggro is stronger than a paladins (which it is over time) right from the getgo.  will you rise to meet this new expectation?<br />
<br />
edit-<br />
to lathen:  at 65  you get more than double the adventure points you get now.  most regular ldon runs at 65 take around 40 mins to complete averaged out (unless you get very unlucky with a bad group).   double the points .. half the time ... the road to anger3 really isnt that long.  especially since there are people running around with full ldon bought 1450 point armor with allt he augment slots filled to the brim.<br />
<br />
once you have anger3, you wont ever need to replace the augment for an upgrade ... unless you upgrade the weapon itself.  i would save anger3 for a weapon of at least CHSD/GBoS calibur though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Premeddel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">58th level?  22 for easy or 34 for hard?  ugh...<br />
Get a few levels... xp in PoP a bit... at 65th level you'll get 51 easy and 105 hard.  <br />
<br />
Very important to be able to make your own groups.  Either a known set of folks or start grabbing the LFG's.  If you like who you get, grab them again next time... it won't take long to get a team of regulars... even if &quot;regular&quot; is only once a week for one adventure.<br />

dont even need a slower all the times.  if no slower try to pick up a second healer.  i have done many LDoNs with no slower.  ive even finsished off a few where the healer goes link dead, and have to have the ranger and beast heal me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The beauty behind LDoN is you get your own private dungeon to venture into at any time thats convenient for you, and if your doing normals you don't need any specific class. Get someone to tank (Any leather, chain, or plate class), get someone to slow (any slower), get someone to heal (hybrid healers are your friends) and your good to go! The rest of the spots in the group don't really matter, as long as they contribute any kind of DPS. You can do it faster if you have certain classes, but as long as you have enough to fill the 3 basic roles, you can successfully complete a level 65 normal dungeon in record time. <br />
<br />
To save time, I'd suggest you get to 63+ in PoP (or anywhere that has good experience, just not LDoN - too slow post 50 unless your getting AAs), then start grinding out the points for anger 3.</div></div><hr />

What's not made clear from the original post is if he's taking it away and holding it, nor is it clear what the other warrior's are weilding.  They're aug'ed with Anger 3 ... are they BoC or equivalent?  A BoC/GBoS combo is pretty good aggro, aug'ed or not, after all.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm holding out for Anger 3 over Anger 2.  Every little bit helps, and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>EQLiquidslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">To clear this up..... I am aware that taunting automatically puts you at the top of the hate list. What I was saying is that if I am fighting the same mob as one of the warriors with anger3 augs, and we are both taunting, I keep agro just as much of the time as they do. One uses HG(anger3) and BoC(anger3), the other uses Render (anger3) and BoC(anger3). I feel that unless you're a ldon freak, it is wiser to get anger2 augs for 1h weaps, and use the rest of your points for hp augs etc... Once you get a good 2h weap anger3 it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">re: the original topic, I'm in a similar boat, the majority of my EQ time is spent raiding, some days I get home early enough to squeeze in an LDoN before raid time, but not all the time given my RL commitments, due to timezone I raid till about 2-3am and get up at 8am so grinding points after the raid is out of the question too.<br />
<br />
I picked up my BoW about 5 months ago and at the time only had enough EF points for anger 2.  Knowing how long it was gonna take me to get enough points for anger 3 I bought anger 2 then and have been happy with it, at this stage I still dont have enough points for anger 3, so with my play times (and it sounds like the original poster is in a similar position) the choice was between Anger 2 now or Anger 3 some time in the future.  Had I chosen Anger 3 sometime in the future I would still not have a hate aug on my BoW and having the extra hate from anger2 has certainly made a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">liquid i'm confused ... am i to understand that both of you are pressing the taunt button on the same mob??  if so, that's completely retarded.<br />
<br />
in the long run given the same weapons, aa count, level, gear, stats .. with the only difference being anger 2 vs anger 3 .... WITHOUT TOUCHING THE TAUNT BUTTON ... anger 3 will kill anger 2.  no, you will not hold aggro with anger2 if the other person has anger3  (unless there are gear/aa/stat differences that would alter the aggro output or proc rate).  <br />
<br />
 4 + 4 is not more than 6 + 6 .. i dont care how you look at it.  the only way that you could in fact have aggro at all is either by sheer luck or the fact that you are pressing &quot;taunt&quot; .... in which case i will refer back to my original statement that its possible to steal aggro momentarily off an anger3 BoW while using duel fine steel short swords (or nothing at all for that matter).<br />
<br />
anger2 will suffice in most situations.  anger3 is worth the investment.  there is no such thing as &quot;enough aggro&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
If more than one tank is taunting (or using aggro tricks), this is predictable.  Whoever gets a succeeding taunt will keep aggro until someone else climbs it by procs or spells, or taunts and takes it away. <br />
<br />
For me, this is how the math works:<br />
<br />
One Anger III aug = 1150 pts.<br />
Two Anger II augs = 1020 pts.<br />
<br />
One Anger III aug in primary (at 305 DEX) = 2 ppm = 1200 Hate.<br />
One Anger II aug in primary and one Anger 2 aug in secondary (at 305) dex = 3 ppm = 1200 hate.<br />
<br />
The extra cost of 130 pts is well worth keeping that offhand aug. slot open, for another aggro aug or even for a damage aug.  Or no aug at all, just to keep the weapon droppable until you upgrade and want to sell it off ...  The extra 1 ppm is not worth the trade-off to me, and 130 pts are not terribly hard to come by.  One or two evenings.<br />
<br />
I am working for Yak augs (guildies being a little gun-shy about Guk atm) for the weapons I hope to upgrade, for decent but economical  aggro boosts, which is how I would use an Anger 2 aug, if I were in a hurry to beef it up any.  But I'm not having any real issues right now, and I'm willing to hold out for Anger III.  I wouldn't Anger III any weapon I was hoping to upgrade, unless the points started coming in so fast I didn't know what I wanted to do with them (except that I do know what I'd  want to do with them).<br />
<br />
The most important point is that they're your points and it's your game, do what you want with both - insert *YMMV clause* here.<br />
<br />

<br />
What if, all you needed to hold aggro well was simply 7?<br />
<br />
Then 4+4 and 6+6 would both do the job well.<br />
<br />
I think that's the point I've been trying to make all along. <br />
<br />
You take a Blade of War. The thing is an aggro BEAST, completely unaugmented. It can do the job a warrior is seeking to do, all by its self.<br />
<br />
As can a bunch of these other weapons people are talking about. Blade of Carnage. Bloodfrenzy. Stone Etched Warsword. Etc. Etc. Etc.<br />
<br />
You add INCITE into the mix. And even the silly old taunt button, when it decides to work.<br />
<br />
And really, you reach a saturation point. You're well past the 353 foot mark to hit that home run, no matter which anger augment OR ykesha augment you decide to put on your Blade of War. The Blade of War itself was the home run. Now you're just bragging about distance or aiming for someone's car in the parking lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hehe, thanks for all the thoughts guys!<br />
<br />
For me, the difference between two Anger2 augs and one Anger3 aug is not just 130 points though, because I do LDoN so rarely that I only have enough points in EF to barely get an Anger2 aug for 510 points.  But I do have enough points combined from all the other adventure themes to get two of them.  This is the route I decided to take, since I don't see myself doing enough more EF adventured in the foreseeable future to get my EF earned up high enough to get Anger3, and because of where my guild it at in the game (do BoT towers and Seru regurlarly and keying up for Ssra Emp and VT - not killing PoP gods or anything) I already held agro pretty fine, but these gave me the boost I needed to be pretty solid in the agro department for where I'm currently at and will be in the near future.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I did 2 hard EF last night and I can see the Anger II aug now just got to clear the points to be able to buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I had an anger 2 aug and I would never buy one again.  If you don't want to save for anger 3 then save 760 AP and get the Ykesha aug.  The Ykesha aug will generate slightly more aggro than the Anger 2 and will add dps as well.  On higher level mobs the stun is resisted most the time but even resisted stuns generate aggro and the DD component lands most of the time.  The Ykesha procs are plenty of aggro for 95% of your grouping situations, yet not too much to control when not the MT in raids.</div></div><hr />
