<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>acfreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't think this is right, does anyone ACTUALLY do their keys anymore?  All the sudden with the new epic's coming out I see alot of mages asking necros or SK's t help them to the 7th Isle in Sky.  I'll say this.... JUST DO IT WITH YOUR GUILD!!  Even at level 51 going to sky for my epic was great fun actually, even though it took 3 hours to get to Spiroc.  I've only been playing for a year but I can tell you this, I've honestly only seen about 50% of EQ players do their epics all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is no fun in eating 20 DTs getting to isle 7 every time you want to farm crowns. Hell there are enough DTs to eat pulling isle 7.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with NCST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They should just make all the epic drops ground spawns in isle 1 if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoSky just plain sucks.  No real challenge or fun doing it.  Who likes doing a raid for an entire day in very old content with sucky drops (no, I'm not talking about the quest pieces) just to get to the island for epic quest pieces?<br />
<br />
DTs suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, after the 100th DT...the shit gets old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so this is what you were talking about at school?  whatever man...i dont care how i get there as long as i get my spiroc wingblade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sky can be 1 grouped in under 2 hours, done it myself. Took 2 DT's per isle at the most.<br />
<br />
Easiest way is to find a necro that has all the keys and just have them run up (nothing sees invis in Sky) and summons your corpses.<br />
<br />
Isles that are agro:<br />
<br />
Azerack, Spiroc, Bee<br />
<br />
Everywhere else is indiff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or, you could 1 group alla way up, and then leave all the keys on a corpse for later retrieval from shadowrest... good place to store junk that ya can't justify keeping but don't really want to delete. ;)<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Unless I'm mistaken, the Sky keys do not decay now. I know I have a set in the bank still, at least I think I do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't, I have a bird whistle in my bank!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a key to every isle on me at all times! Never know when they will come in handy hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">but do you still have the guard's keyring for najena? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice trick considering one boss (isle 4?) spwans 90 minutes after you clear the island below it...a needless time sink.</div></div><hr />
