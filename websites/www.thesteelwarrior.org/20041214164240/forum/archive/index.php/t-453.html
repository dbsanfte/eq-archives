<br />
I thought of the other races that can become a Warrior and the first thing that came to my mind was Ogre. Well, Ogres have the Highest STR and STA and pretty much suck in everything else. No regen.<br />
<br />
Then I thought of Iksar. Badass. Oops, no plate. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Gnome. [This space intentionaly left blank].<br />
<br />
Halfling. See Gnome.<br />
<br />
Then I thought of Troll. Good stats, regen, nightvision, can wear plate, and are now the roleplaying kings as of the LoY exspansion. This seems to be the best possible race for my liking although they do have the experience penalty. <br />
<br />
Now on to the question.<br />
<br />
Does the exp penalty really show? How much percent is the penalty and do any Troll Warriors out there regret become a Troll because of the exp pentaly? Also is there any other pros/cons I missed about the Troll? Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

And just because ogres and trolls have higher str and sta than lizzies doesn't make them better wars, str and sta will be easier to max than agi and dex later in the game, so lizzies get a head start on that.  And what's more fun to roleplay than a dark-scaled warrior?  It's no fun rp'ing a big fat dumb troll...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venox</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thank you for the info. I most definatly will not be a halfling. <br />
<br />
I might try an Iksar but I am leaning towards Troll more so, just because of the Roleplaying. Trolls don't necesarily(sp?) have to be stupid dumb and fat. Trolls have a HUGE bane towards Froglok's and that would be fun ... because Froglok's are the new puntable race. <br />
<br />
I like the way Burarum backed up his discission to become an Iksar. That does appeal to me to have Regen/Innate AC/and moderatly high Agi and Dex. <br />
<br />
Is the Troll and Iksar experience penalty the same? <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

I love my dwarf warrior I would not have any other race for a warrior.  Plus roleplaying a dwarf is a blast too.<br />

Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

I dig the whole hairy feet thing of halfings.. iksar look like they were meant to be soldiers man.. they rock.. trolls kick ass.. but I LOVE my ogre... especially with luclin graphics on they look like demonic steroid enhanced humans.  They were not always dumb (read the stories) as they helped create civilzation as one of the first races created.. they were smart but penalized for sacrilige or some shit like that anyways.. for roleplaying all races have their own stuff.. for coolness all have their own stuff.. stats don't really make a crap at the end so the game is being nice enough to say.. bah.. pick whoever and you'll have fun...</div></div><hr />

However, it is not insurmountable.  You need a little extra work to get to where we all end up, but you will get there, and you will have a nice slam attack, night vision, and fantastic regen to show for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Play whatever you WANT to play.<br />
<br />
From your post it sounds like Regen is what you want most. It also sounds like you want to be able to wear plate armors before Velious quested levels of stuff.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, TROLL is for YOU! It's what you WANT to play. Play it.<br />
<br />
In my case, I wanted the least XP hassle I could get, and I wanted to be a shortie, cause I was tired of having to duck.<br />
<br />
Halfling was for me.<br />
<br />
Play a troll be happy, and quit worrying about your race. If you're happy with your toon you won't notice the XP penalty. If you're unhappy with your toon, you'll notice the little things like night blindness or being short or being fat or lack of regen or whatever the heck else is bugging you that day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a Steel Warrior from Freeport I can tell you there are more ways to be human than any other race!<br />
<br />
You could be the soldier on the front lines and veteran of the many race wars in the commonlands, or a swashbuckler defending the seas from pirate attacks. You could be a loyal investigator of Antonious Bale or a member of the corrupt militia seeking to usurp the government. You could be a member of the Dismal Rage, rising up from beneath to consume all, or a fighter of the holy wars in Freeport that pit the guilds against each other.<br />
<br />
Other races have stale role-play types.  Large races being dumb and kind or violent. Elves and Lizards being conformist and outcast of their home cities. Halfings always after a piece of tail and jum jum.  Dorfs being drunk. Gnomers being, well gnomers~ And have you ever seen a person truly role-play a frog or a cat? I haven't.<br />
<br />
In short, if you can't see a nitch for your human, you aren't looking well enough.<br />
<br />

Oh, and Greater Lighstones rule!</div></div><hr />

Ok, this isn't a flame. This is my complaint about the holes in EQ's storyline. Ogres and trolls are RP'd as being the dumbest races. The NPC's are babling bunch of retards. But if you were to go by the actual game stat of INT halfling warriors are the dumbest mofo's there are. Starting at 47. Followed by trolls at 52. Then barbarians, dwarves, and ogres are tied at 60. /sigh Sony developers. While on the subject of RP'ing. Trolls losing Grobb? BS. The story makes sense. But I think the only reason they wrote it like that because they didn't want to make a new starting city. Imagine if Innothule Swamp was like Hollowshade with ongoing wars. That would be cool.<br />

The trolls have been deleted, the ikar monk lives on because he kicks ass but I can rarely afford the time to level him.  That said if you want to put the time into a regen class you will not regret it.  <br />
If you want a warrior here and now make an asling, if you want the best of all worlds make a barbi ( just know that you and all the other warriors will look like me :p )<br />
<br />
Play what makes you feel right... you will know when you have the right combination but make sure you give it the time you need to know for sure.  Level 1 to 30 can be done in a week put some time and effort into it and find your inner child.  My inner child just happens to like ice fishing in Halas.</div></div><hr />

Somehow there are much more bright than dumb ogres or Trolls out there anyway.<br />
People that really want to RP prefer to play something that has weaknesses too.<br />

<br />
While this is a wee bit off topic, I do have to correct this statement.  Halfling warriors start with an INT of 67, not 47 as Castersrealm would have it.  (As an aside, never rely on Castersrealm for anything that isn't related to being a caster -- and for that matter, don't rely on them for things that are related to being a caster.)<br />
<br />
As for RP, RP is what you make of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes the penalty is noticable<br />
troll penalty is 20%<br />
but warriors get 10 percent bonus in xp since we get no spells<br />
so troll warrior get 10% xp penalty<br />
also there is a problem in some dungeons and on raids because of fat itchy butt<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over again I'd still go troll! If you want best race for warrior its hands down ogre. No stun from front is actually usefull. Troll regen not really usefull once u get 3k+ hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why nome? Nomes are fun to make fun of so you can always have yourself to laugh at.... Seriously though the gnome tinkered armor is awesome.  BP as invis, arms have haste, boots I think have a SoW like buff. Awesome stuff that will help tons with leveling and what not. /shrug<br />
<br />
Orge would probably be the best because of the no frontal stun.<br />
<br />
All in all just do what you want. Don't let anything keep you from making the warrior that will make you happy.</div></div><hr />

Trolls/ogres are annoying because you're always asking them to shrink.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Must be out of ignorance.<br />
<br />
Gnomes only have 2 minor problems as warriors, that are related to being short.  Some steps require individual hops, such as a couple flights in Kael.  Other people get up them faster.  And because we are short, sometimes people have a hard time seeing us, and being able to follow the fight.<br />
<br />
Both of these are correctable by carrying a maximizing device.  Also, dying your armor a bright  color helps the visibility problem.<br />
<br />
While the drawbacks to being a gnome are minor, the long term benefits are major.  To start with, most of the time our small size is a benefit.  It is generally easier to maneuver in fights.  Also, we are the perfect size to tank a standard corner pin.  Most of the time we end up shrinking all the fatties down to gnome size anyway.  With gnomes you don't have to go through that hassle all the time.<br />
<br />
As for stats, top warrior gear has loads of str and stamina, once you're maxxed, you're even with the big races.  Actually, you are ahead, because your dex and agility start out higher.  While top end gear is loaded with str and sta, dex and agi are a bit more uncommon.<br />
<br />
But, the single greatest benefit to being a gnome is, gnome only gear.  In particular, clockwork vambraces.  These babies make all the difference.  40% self haste buff.  No need to drag around an enchanter or shaman for haste buffs.  This buff stacks with all the haste gear.  I currently use Cloak of the Fire Storm, so when I solo I'm running around at 80% haste all the time.  This means I XP faster than any other race.  In the time you gain 7 aa as an ogre, I gain 10.  If you group in a chanter or shaman to haste you, you will kill a bit faster, but you have to split XP with them.  I don't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm not mistaken halflings still get an xp bonus so I'd say they're the best warriors.  There's not really a significant advantage to any of the races though IMHO.  Ogres are immune to stun but there's an AA for that.  Trolls and Iksar get regen but when you're getting hit for 500-1000 or more per hit who cares what your regen is?  It won't matter.  Some races get better gear choices at various stages of the game but at endgame it's all the same.  Some races can hide but there's items out there with unlimited charges of invis so who cares?  Some races get stuck because they're big but there's items you can use to shrink or give yourself an illusion so who cares?  Some races have an xp penalty but it doesn't apply once you hit 65 so who really cares?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Play what you want to play, period. In the end, the race isn't going to matter much. While you level from 1 to 50 (and depending on whether you're power-leveled or not) some races have minor advantages that may make leveling a bit easier:<br />
 Halflings get an exp bonus. Combined with the warrior class exp bonus, they're the fastest levelers in the game (about 15% faster than humans). If I decided to do it all over again...I never would have deleted my halfing warriorette and replaced her with a barbarian. There was much to be said RP-wise for a black-skirt-outfit-wearing, 2-handed-wielding little death machine. ;) <br />
 Gnomes, dwarves, frogloks all have some small advantage, not the least of which is size. Size is important when you realize your barbie, troll, ogre, and sometimes cat or lizard, can't go into someplace without a shrink being cast on them. All the small races also have infravision or better. Frogs can only worship Mith Marr, though, so that does limit them on some religious armor choices.<br />
  Trolls and Iksars level slower, a full 25% slower than halfling warriors. For that slowness you get regen and are hated mostly everywhere. Iksars do get natural armor, though, so the sting of not having access to plate in the early levels isn't that bad.<br />
 Dark Elves, Wood Elves and Half Elves are fairly rare as warrior choices, affording more possibility for RP (because a lot of people are going to ask you &quot;why the heck did you make a ____&quot; and you can then go into your spiel). They all have infravision or better night vision, can wear most if not all warrior useable plate armor, and none have an exp penalty.<br />
 Cats (Vah Shir) offer plenty of RP choices, along with a reasonably solid set of stats. They get safe fall (important when considering that trolls or ogres can hurt themselves walking down regular stairs). They have infravision but consume more food than other races and do not have the slam ability of the other large races.<br />
  Barbarians are big humans with the slam ability. Still, my warrior is a barbie and as much as I've wanted to replace him over the years, I still play him (he just made 58, as a matter of fact).<br />
Actually, my question to you is, if you're so concerned about RP, why not start a warrior in the Firiona Vie server, instead of hanging out in a regular server like BBane?<br />
<br />
Really, the choice of race means less than the choice of server in your situation.</div></div><hr />
