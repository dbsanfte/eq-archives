How often do they proc.. was thinking about augmenting a very nice ratio 2hander weapon with tons of hp's but I'm afraid that it won't proc as good as for example GSoT and that I might have been better off augmenting GSoT instead.   My guildies are telling me I might as well augment a weapon that seems to work decent without the Anger 3 Aug so that the Aug simply makes it more &quot;for sure&quot; to get agro.  Any opinions?</div></div><hr />

It procs about the same rate any other proccing weapon I've ever wielded does. Not noticably more or noticably less.<br />

In regards to your other question, it's a tough call. I know an anger proc on a GSoT would make it pretty effective.<br />
<br />
But then again, non-proccing weapons that had superior DPS to your GSoT when given an anger proc would probably do better than your current non augmented GSoT. So either choice is an upgrade.</div></div><hr />
