<br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.<br />

Do you think this description, from the maker of the game, describes the warrior class as it is now?</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, no, this is absolute bullshite.  Maybe if they changed it to &quot;At one time Warriors WERE the masters of armed combat and defense.....&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually make the best coffee in the office, here. It still pales in comparison tot he coffee made by the former con chair for ConVersion in Calgary. Man, Mr. Bunnyslippers makes awesome coffee.... Was even better for knocking the edge off my sleepless drunken stupor from the previous night. :D</div></div><hr />

With a little text editing; here's the results :<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
Warriors were the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons like their hybrid cousins; Paladdins and Shadowknights.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina like all the other melee classes of Everquest, making them equal to the plate hybrid classes and only slightly ahead of the leather and chain classes. When and only when they use their Defensive Discipline, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat like all other melee classes, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics except for piercing which is slightly lower. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm. Unfortunately for them; the Taunt ability is easily and oft negated by other people's choice of spells which begin at level 9 and remain useful until the higher and ultmately end-game scenarios of Everquest.<br />
<br />
Warriors used to be the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. These days due to lack of upper eschelon weaponry + effects along with the poorly designed 'Random Number Generator'; Warriors are now often only picked if they posess at least one 'Enraging Blow' type weapon plus large amounts of Alternate Experience points. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone; unlike their Plate Hybrid cousins whom can 'solo' almost exclusively with the proper Alternate Experience poins and mediocre gear ( due to their ability to cast spells ); and are usualy a poor choice for those who enjoy random hunting and grouping and taking the front line in battle.</div></div><hr />

I've done feedback for months but I've never really seen a change other than the fact that pallys/sks are getting even more groups than I am because they're today's perfered tanks. Sorry if I come off as such a noob, but if you could point me towards who to rant at, I'll head there.</div></div><hr />

We have ranted at everyone form /feedback to Absor himself and *looks down at the sig* This is our response :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Omni, we've done everything, we've asked Absor (smash!) about class balance and he said that the devs will work on the higher priorities first.<br />
<br />
Apparently class balance isn't one of those things.<br />
<br />
So we resort to public humiliation (as if SOE doesn't do that enough already) and put it in our sigs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the problem in EQ evolution has been corporate structure and revenue mandates. Thus, you see Absor plugging for an expansion, and not addressing balance.<br />
<br />
Priorities are not made with what is best for the game, but what is best for the revenues. This structure works for a period of time, however the long term affects are extremely detrimental. <br />
<br />
Everquest characters are more than a product, but a relationship. Part of the reason may people continue to put up with this BS is one word &quot;Invested Time&quot;. This has been a marriage for a lot of people....so much that we don't want to see it go away.<br />
<br />
It's not just balance that is broken in EQ, it's a sense of utility that is broken in EQ simply because, and Absor stated, that it is easier to work with spells than it is to work with pure melee. Spells increase utility, and over time it has a huge impact.<br />
<br />
EQ was more balanced at its onset. But because of the above EQ has become a caster centric MMORPG. This places those with spells at a far reaching ability of utility than non spell casting classes. Mana has improved at amazing proportions relative to original game inception. The product is game inbalance and utility problems. Also, keep in mind the original creators of EQ left because their vision of gaming was different than what the corporate structure was allowing for. They went to start a completely new game.<br />
<br />
My opinion in a more balanced game and one that allows for proper utility is one where mana and caster evolution has not taken so much attention that EQ has allowed. Though I think EQ has more content in the upper game, DAOC has a better vision of caster to melee implimentations. There is no such thing as complete heal in DAOC, and the role of a tank is cornerstone. (I use this as an example, and not an endorsement because I still play EQ. However, had both games been available at the time I started from square one...and EQ was like it is today I would'nt be playing EQ) Obviously without unlimited mana and Complete heal the only outcome would mean more utility to the tanking classes and those classes with a slight advantage would actually have those advantages noticeable. Any advantages, and this is even debatable due to itemization, we have as a warrior is non-existent in a caster centric MMORPG with mana at the proportions it is now.<br />
<br />
Can SOE Everquest address these issues? Can a representative even sit down with its player base and discuss issues that its player base has said is important to them? A company that can build a product MMORPG and understand that the product is also a relationship from the onset will win the seat as the greatest MMORPG to date.</div></div><hr />
