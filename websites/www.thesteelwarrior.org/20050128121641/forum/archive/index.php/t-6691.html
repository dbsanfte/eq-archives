<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am getting confused here all I know we have hashed this out tons of times but help a lil hobbit figgure this out. <br />
<br />
I have all 3 of these. <br />
<br />
My normal group is as follows:<br />
Warrior (Me)<br />
Cleric (Wife)<br />
Enchanter (Guild Leader)<br />
Shadow Knight (Guild Leader Boy Friend)<br />
2 others what ever we grab most times  Ranger and Wizard<br />
<br />
With the CHoS+SotB My aggro works pretty good only times I loose it is if the wizard over nukes or the SK is having ego issues. <br />
<br />
I have tried the GSoT and I do not seem to get the procs from it I need. <br />
<br />
Assuming buffs from a Shammy or BL and BOON from the chanter I have maxed Dex. <br />
<br />
All the posts I have read I see taht the GSoT is better for aggro then my DW setup. I am asking as we are going to start to do Hard LDoN soon and if ripostes are so bad in Hard LDoN then the GSoT would be better but not if I cannot keep aggro. I have over 600 LDoN points scatered around the camps so as soon as I can get enought I will smack a Anger Aug on one of the weapons but am asking for Help here. Yes I am only 56 and we are doing LDoN to XP and for points. Thanks in advance for all help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will read a lot of different thoughts on this but there are a few facts (at least as near as we can get to one in this game).<br />
<br />
#1 the proc rate is the SAME FOR all but a few weapons, every one you listed has the SAME PROC RATE, you can take this to the bank.<br />
<br />
#2 the proc rate is 2 per min main hand and 1 per min oiff hand, for both 1 hand and 2 hand weapons.<br />
<br />
So with this info you can see that with the Copper/Blood you will get 3 procs per min and 2 with the GSoT.<br />
<br />
In my exp both the GSoT and the Copper/Blood give about the same dps so if you want aggro there is only one choice.<br />
<br />
If you take the proc rate to the max, anger augs and WA5 you get 9 and 6 procs a min, thats 3 more procs per min.  Then when you are told to use the staff because of riposte ask to see  a log parse on rispote damage.   I have done the logs and I get 6-7 dps risposte in LDoN normal and 12-13 in LDoN hards and 25 on Agnarr using 1 handers.<br />

GSoT with anger2 was never as effective as duel wield with anger2 on CHoS though for raid mobs.</div></div><hr />

Level 55 hard is the same as level 60 normal and level 60 normal mobs hit like Tier1 PoP mobs. Going from Copper Hammer + Sword of Blood to GSOT will cost you about 85 hp, 1 proc/min and will be lower DPS.</div></div><hr />

do you mean anger 111 <br />
I thougth anger 11 was one hand only?<br />
Like enery one else I have these weapons too<br />
I prefer GSoT unAugged seems to hold Agro without<br />
probs ( but I really wish the Graphic was changed)<br />

No one is concerned about DPS from riposte damage, rather, spikes in damage. Attacking 2-3 times a round at a slow pace leaves some room for spiky riposte damage, but is still more predictable and easier to recover from than you swinging 3-4+ times a round at a fast pace. It won't really matter too much unless your facing mobs that can take out 20% of your HP with one attack, but its still something to consider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if this is true its a difference of 6 dps or 60dpch (damage per complet heal cast time) - not  a huge amount. as for personal experience ive never noticed riposte damage on 65 normals to be very great or very spikey. when mobs enrage you can take an enormous spike however so be very wary of the enrage if your health is low. i duel weild pretty much always when main tanking the 65s. i wouldnt be overly worried about  the ripostes. it is extremely rare that i die to a spike and if i do .. well .. i get a rez. a much more common cause of death is the cleric failing to get a heal off on time due to getting hit herself. and guess what? thats a taunt problem not a spike problem. so concentrate on getting the agro up more than getting the spikes down and that means the duel weild. i dont have experience with a gsot so i cant compare agro from direct tests. im just saying that riposte spikes are not a huge factor in choosing between the two setups in your level 56 ldon groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering that XP mobs hit you only about 50% of the time, and considering that really the max hit on a mob I'd do in a normal Xp group would be something like BoT hitting in the 500's, he'd have to hit me quite a few times, FOR MAX for me to even notice he was riposting me.  <br />
<br />
It may be an issue if you're at like 2500hp unbuffed or something, but if you've got some halfway decent gear, and the defensive AA's to go along with it, riposte isn't something you should ever be concerned about on a day to day basis.  Hell, near the end of the time I was playing, I used to plow enrage about half the time because I was too lazy to shut off my auto attack (Tactical Mastery 3 makes you wanna do that).  95% of the time, it didn't make a difference, and there were only a few occasions where I said &quot;Ah, shit, guess I gotta actually stop swinging here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use an Anger II aug'ed SoD mainhand and a BoC offhand (tried it the other way around, and seems like more aggro this way /shrug) as my main aggro combo.  I'm always kind of concerned about riposte damage when I'm one one of these supposed 'high riposte' mobs.   <br />
<br />
I'm not Mr. PoP (guild just about to get into VT) but have done a pile of Hard LDoN's.  It seems to me that if a hard LDoN mob gets lucky and rolls a few 20's, I'm dead like fried chicken (1500 AC, 8.5k hp buffed up), but this is pretty rare.  I'm not sure if this is due to ripostes or just normal damage.  Should do some parsing I suppose.  Guess that's not much help other than to let you know that I'm able to dual wield hard LDoN's with only the occaisional mishap.  <br />

Renix I have MT'd every mob up to ep with DW and NEVER died to riposte. Every death was do to me doing something stupid but NEVER once did I go back over the log and find it was from a &quot;Risposte spike&quot; NEVER ONCE.    Your logic is flawed, if you are so scared of risposte dont get any off AA's, dont make 65 and trip atk, dont use a haste item and never get a haste buff in fact never swing so you cant get riposted at all.<br />
<br />
Last time I MT'd Raex (quads for 1680hp cant not be slowed procs a 5000hp lifetap and did I tell ya hes very very fast) it was a flawless fight and I was DWing.  He will one round casters you CANT let him get away from you or its game over.<br />
<br />
My point is you take about ~5% more damage to get ~25% better control.<br />

I'd prefer it anyday on CHoS/SoBS Combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the people who think GSoT is far superior to a droga combo have enough offensive AA's to make 2h weapons a much better DPS option than dual wield.  If you don't have the AA's, there's not a lot of difference damage wise, but the aggro is better with dual wield.  Even if you do have offensive AA's, DPS will be better with 2h, but not enough better to generate more aggro than the dual wield combo.  Unless you're really pushing the envelope of safety riposte damage isnt really a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in the upper 50's with a set of droga 1 handers and a GSoT.  I was doing some LDoNs and I was considering what to Aug.  I held off, hopeing I might get lucky with some other weapon to come my way.<br />
<br />
Nothing did.<br />
<br />
I went with putting a Anger II aug in the GSoT and it worked out fine for me.  My GSoT was my workhorse and was fine for me all the way to 65 and into grinding AA at 65 in BoT.<br />
<br />
I still packed around the Dual Weild set up and would switch it out depending on what was up.  I feel that I got a lot of good mileage out of the one aug I did buy for the staff over 2 augs I might have blown on my now sold and gone droga weapons.  I still carry around my GSoT to switch to against a really heavy hitter - aka GoD trials - but more and more I just leave my BBotE in the main and plop my shield into 2nd slot if I'm getting my ass handed to me and hope to live to the next heal - more stats better ac doing that and seem to hold the agro through it.<br />
<br />
I have zero regrets of my GSoT usage (especially after I put the Anger II aug in it), with the possible exception of looking like I was packing around some dumb ass caster stick.   :p <br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />

In some places/group compositions one works better, in other places/groups the other works better.<br />
<br />
Without offensive AA's the dps is about equal (I parsed a few thousand swings from each on various mobs...not worthy of publishing the details, but enough to convince me  ;) .)  <br />
<br />
I normally use the GSoT because I like to run at maximum efficiency most of the time - and if I can hold agro just as well and take 6 less dps, I'll do it.  But there are times (ex: melee heavy group in ldon) that the droga wpns seem to give better agro - so I switch out.<br />
<br />
Try em both and see what works for you.   ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you hit the NAIL on the head for me my normal group has 1 or 2 pets and a SK with me as MA so the droga weapons do seem to do better.<br />
<br />
Edit: PETS i.e. beastlord pet or mage pet or RANGER /flamesuit  :eek:  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to prefer the 2 handers and the GSoT over the droga combination. As such I did Punishing blade first . Back when PoP first came out Ripostes were bad and even duoing in Justice it was a noticeable decrease to damage using the GSoT.  But they did decrease the amount most PoP mobs ripostes a long time ago.<br />
<br />
  But lately I use the 2 Droga weapons all the time. Of course a big part of that is because I finally got an Anklesmasher for snaring, and when Duoing or playing with a group without a snarer its a lot easier to swap the one handers in and out for snare proc. With a War/Shaman duo and 305 dex fights almost always last long enough to get a snare proc, at least in PoP and Droga .</div></div><hr />
