<br />
Says that it will go up to level 59... are all or even a majority of the mobs below that in LDoN?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I 32k-ed Faydedar twice last week and Ulump once while helping people with druid epics. Saves a long ass chase across the zone and makes the level 50-something go &quot;woah!&quot;.<br />
<br />
In LDoN on normal with a 65 group I seem to be able to finish nearly every type of mob. You're at the mercy of the random number generator of course. Some dungeons I don't finish any, at other times I have finished 30+ mobs.</div></div><hr />

I rememeber it activating for one of my friends in the Hole awhile ago it turned out useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Works up to level 59 mobs with coup de grace 3 PoP AA which is another 6 AA to max.<br />
So total cost would be 18 (FB 1-3 is 2+4+6=12 and another 2+2+2=6 for Coup de Grace).<br />
Chances for it going off are probably higher if you dual wield although i have no idea if it fires for main hand only or if the chance is there for either hand.</div></div><hr />

Coup de Grace 3 since the  first mission<br />

Total Slays : 2<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps it works better for people dualwielding fast weaponry? <br />
<br />
I dont recall seeing discussion on it before, but if finishing blow have a chance to trigger every time you get a critical hit, it would stand to reason that fast dualwielders get alot more chances to F-Blow, since critical hits occur on a fixed percentage of swings.<br />
<br />
When I group with coupe de grace 3 dual-wielding rangers/rogues/monks, they seem to get 2-5 finishing blows every normal mission(at least if in melee-heavy groups, with no wizard burning down the last 10%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since Coup de Grace 3 i have a minimum of 2 slays per mission.<br />
Yesterday on a slaughter about 50 percent of the kills was done by finishing blow, most of course by the 2 rogues in the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had it go off on both hands and kick.  I want to say bow as well, but I'm not 100% sure i'm remembering right on that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fires on bow too, got a kill with bow yesterday.<br />
Different message from a ranger though.<br />
I got, You land a Finishing Blow, he got you land a Finishing Strike (not sure though but definitely different).<br />
We were both shooting orcs in oasis while masterlooter sold at camp after adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, with all finishing blow AAs, ive never complained.  Specially in LDoN where every mob runs off when low health (?) except bosses).  If you dont have a snarer it works great, I use a 2hander though with longer delays so im sure it works better on the dual wielding classes.  Also works great in Ssra / sebillis, and even seen it work on PoN/PoD/PoJ a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I've kicked, bashed, slammed, crushed, slashed and shot with an arrow for a 32k finishing blow. Doesn't seem to make much difference what weapons I wield (1h-ers vs 2h-ed) though. If anything I seem to get more with the 2h-er.</div></div><hr />

Three comments:<br />
<br />
- Who knows, it might be that finishing blow works like an extra proc on your attacks, kind of like the lifetap proc on Boon.  If that were the case then the proc rate for finishing blows would basically be constant for a given dex (ie. weapon delay, haste and slow wouldn't change the number of procs you get per minute on average.)<br />
<br />
- Another possible use for finishing blow I didn't see mentioned is if you're hunting solo.  After all, if you're soloing as a warrior, odds are the stuff you're fighting is low enough level to use finishing blow. Might save you having to chase a mob around at the end of your fight if it's not snared.<br />
<br />
- Two things I don't like about FB.  One is that you basically need to completely max it out for it to be useful up to level 59 mobs.  So without that huge AA investment the skill isn't helping you much if at all.  Compare that to any other AA where even the first rank of it helps you somewhat.  <br />
<br />
The other thing I don't like about it is that it is totally worthless in the tier 2+ planes.  And while LDoN is fun and has better cash and mission rewards, the exp in the planes is much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting results for Emilia... two total finishing blows in LDoN in 150+ missions?<br />
<br />
I've had Coup De Grace maxed since first day of LDoN, but my results are much different.  I finish 3-10 mobs PER MISSION on Normal setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carrot</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the dungeon and your pull/fight style.  Only squeak out the occasional Finish in a Guk or Mistmoore mission where almost nothing runs, but can easily crank out a dozen in Rujark on all those sprinting goblinoids.<br />
<br />
The level complaint isn't entirely valid.  Used to see Finishing Blows frequently when the level cap was 60, even without maxing it - just think of where you XP'ed in Kunark and Velious and Luclin.  The reason it seems it doesn't provide much of a return is people sprinting to 65 before training AA's, or at least before training anything besides HP or defensive AA's.  It won't make you a better Raid MT or anything, but dropping 2-6 points into it when it is first available is still a valid AA choice if you don't have a regular snarer, or a lazy one :p</div></div><hr />
