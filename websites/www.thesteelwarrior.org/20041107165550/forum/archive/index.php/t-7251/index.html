<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well today I placed a feedback in game right before I logged out to go to work. The feedback was for make the thugs stop running forever like they are little boys when Michael Jackson comes around.  Did not get an in game response since I logged out shortly after but when I arrived at work and checked hotmail I found three emails from NCSoft.<br />
<br />
<br />
One was a copy of my feedback,  other was a confirmation that they received my petition/feedback and other was a response and not a copy/paste response either.<br />
<br />
I am pleased with the CS so far I hope they keep this level of customer service up for a long time.</div></div><hr />

This is typical of what I've heard of CS in CoH (I've not had an issue myself, yet).  And they respond often on the user boards, I've noticed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What'd they respond?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Project DARC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive had a few CoT spectres get stuck in the walls during a missions, and i recieved very prompt responses, both in the form of email and an ingame gm showing up (came as a little police drone hahah).  so far i am thoroughly impressed with the interaction and personality of the gms and CS staff ive come in contact with.  its nice to have an existant support team!</div></div><hr />
