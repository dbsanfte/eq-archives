<br />
Warriors in WoW really do get what they deserve.<br />
<br />
We can Dual Wield. (At lvl 20) Use 2H weapons (After 30 skill points - around lvl 8 I think) and we can use 1H+Shield.<br />
<br />
We also have 3 &quot;Stances&quot;  Battle Stance (Balanced) Defensive, and Beserker.<br />
<br />
Each of the 3 styles generate Rage (Tank Mana) for special moves, and Special Moves available are based on the Stance.<br />
<br />
Its a viable solo class provided you are willing to invest in materials to reduce sitting and healing, but when we are outnumbered by worthy adversaries, we die.<br />
<br />
Each style has a different strategy, and allows the adaptive warrior to hone his/her skills in excelling in close combat.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have finally got warriors exactly where they should be, up front in the thick of things, either dealing it out, or taking it - the good warriors adapt to the situation... the bad ones run, or get rezzed.<br />
<br />
To all my fellow front line fighters, this one gets a two thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree warriors in WoW are very nice, the special moves especially, theyre great enhancements with utility that add power to your class also, theyre not generic / useless shit thats not even worth clicking most of the time.<br />
<br />
Some of them EQ should have implemented years ago, like bash for example, what makes more sense, you slam into a mob as hard as you can and it interrupts his casting but he immediately starts casting again, or you bash him interrupting his casting and he cant cast for 4 seconds while he regains his balance etc..? Common sense stuff that should have been in place years ago.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a lot of people will fall in love with WoW, I still cant play it more than an hour or two without getting annoyed or aggravated at something and logging though. <br />
<br />
Like needing first hit to claim a mob to get the xp, very great idea btw even though FFXI did it first, to prevent KS'ing but warriors start with no range attacks at all so you will be running mob to mob to mob just trying to hit one before a caster, ranger or rogue tag it from a mile away before you can run up to it and attack it, you'll get lucky sometimes and actually hit it first though! If it pops right next to you that is.<br />
<br />
Or needing some groundspawns or drops off mobs that are needed by 400 other people also, racing to each one as soon as it pops, competing over insignificant things like that just pisses me off. They really should have used instancing and triggers a lot more imo. Especially in high traffic areas, but since they have seamless zones it would be impossible. <br />
<br />
Earth and Beyond and City of Heros both used instanced zones when they were over crowded which was really nice. Like if 50 people are in west freeport then anyone else to zone in would have the option to go to a new instance of the zone, west freeport2 etc.. They could still go to the crowded zone if they wanted to, like if they were meeting someone there or whatever.<br />
<br />
A lot of the 'bad things' about WoW are from the sheer number of people in the same level range and vicinity as each other though, so a month after release maybe they wont exist or bare no real significance, who knows. Zone instancing is still never a bad thing imo.<br />
<br />
The game also seems way to easy which may change as you get to a high level, I didnt since I couldnt stand to stay on for long amounts of time, so no idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavelloc</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so far the war in WoW has alot of power then ones in EQ, started a warrior and hit lvl 4 with a few quests and once i got rush/charge was great since we can rush at a mob and stun em plus get a little rage from it to say hit em with another special attack and also i like that you can accually hit the mob at lvl 1 and not miss 18 out of the 20 hits you swing at em, so far at lvl 7 and gaining fast in lvls, too bad work has to get in the way for i can try the war some more, wasted my time trying a hunter when i should of went with war first  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like needing first hit to claim a mob to get the xp, very great idea btw even though FFXI did it first, to prevent KS'ing but warriors start with no range attacks at all so you will be running mob to mob to mob just trying to hit one before a caster, ranger or rogue tag it from a mile away before you can run up to it and attack it, you'll get lucky sometimes and actually hit it first though! If it pops right next to you that is. <br />
<br />
You get a charge ability at some point (level 6 or something?  Haven't been able to play all weekend since I got to 9 on thursday nite), it basically enables you to  sprint to a mob and smack it.  <br />
<br />
The other issue can be addressed simply by going where people aren't.  Granted I started playing immediately on Thursday when the servers opened, and I've got a half decent clue of what I'm doing, so I was ahead of the pack for the majority of the time, but you can still do some of this anyway.  If you see a big mob of people, don't stand next to them and expect to do things.  Or play with caster friends...problem solved.<br />
<br />
Bitching about overcrowding in noob zones on a new release is kinda retarded.  That's not the game's fault, and any remedy they put in place for that situation is going to be redundant in a month anyway when no one is there.  We're kinda hoping to avoid some of the dumbassery SoE brought to the table here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I wasnt just standing around tons of people hoping for mobs  :p <br />
<br />
Started as a NE Warrior, everywhere around the starting city was overcamped, so I started doing quests hoping they would send me other places which they did, that other town Dalaanu or something, Shadowglen or something and that lake that starts with an A, but they were all crowded also because of people getting the same exact quests ofcourse.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it will thin out and not be as much of a problem a month after release, like I said in my first post. <br />
<br />
Instanced zones that activate only when a certain number of people are in a zone are still great and should have been implemented though, theyre not redundant a month after release they just wouldnt be used as much, it doesnt hurt the game in any way whether theyre being used or not other than the server overhead when they are active, which is a non-issue. Or triggers akin to most of FFXI's quest where anyone at that point of the quest can trigger their 'spawn' whenever they want.<br />
<br />
I did get charge before I quit playing and it did help quite a bit with the tagging issue. The special attacks in WoW are really just spectacular with all the diversity they add to your class.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to take anything away from WoW, it's a nice game and I may even play it again a month after release. It's just an objective opinion from someone who doesnt think Blizzard are the gods of rpg's, quality or customer service that can do no wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not really that they do no wrong, because they do.  The issue is that there are some companies who think that EVERYTHING is excusable, and that people will keep buying their shit no matter what.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is that there are things that have gone on in some games way too long, that certain companies just don't give a shit about.  It's a refreshing feeling to actually be surprised by a game where the people who make it and run it DO give a shit.<br />
<br />
Fuckin hell..server downtime is 10 minutes in the stress test to fix issues.  10 fucking minutes, when was the last time you saw a 10 minute patch from SoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maleick</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Paen<br />

<br />
Two words bro, <br />
<br />
STRESS TEST<br />
<br />
They overcroweded it on purpose so they could tune their servers, not so that you could play and enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
On game release they will have double or triple the servers that they had during Stress Test and overcrowding won't be a problem.<br />
<br />
However I do agree it was annoying but after I got to level 10 or so I could go to a much larger range of areas to fight so it wasn't a problem after the first day or two.<br />
<br />
WoW is teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maleick</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Haass,<br />
<br />
I would like to add that the server downtime was intentional, and no random crashes. I think it did crash one time but that was becuase they shut down several servers and had everyone log into a few servers and where trying to crash it on purpose.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I had Zero lag, again Ill remind you this was a Stress Test and the only reason we played is so that they could tune there servers  :p</div></div><hr />

Hello?<br />
<br />
Frog says Stress Test is limited duration and ends this Sunday<br />
<br />
Frog says that purpose of Stress Test is blowing up game servers BEFORE WoW goes retale.<br />
<br />
Frog says concerns here are HARDWARE limits not gaming limits<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

Warriors are so much fun that even the blaster/caster house defender enjoyed playing one.  And her rogue.  And, as she put it, finally playing a *real druid*.  And her pet cat, a Cornish Rex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow warriors, and other classes such as hunter (teh win) and warlock, are completely awesome. The quest centric gameplay and each class has multiple roles it can fill, making forming groups very easy.<br />
<br />
As for the tagging issue, its already been stated by the devs and frankly quite obvious that crowding of that sort was intentional, as *gasp* this was a stress test. This was to test the load that the physical servers can handle. Except for a few wierd lag spikes, I can count them on one hand, lag was non-existant. I found a few bugs and reported them, but even then the game in its current state is more bug free than any other online game I've ever played, excepting perhaps DAoC with there uber-nazi-coders that they have.<br />
<br />
The game is great I was very sad to see the stress test end. I can't play EQ anymore. I can't find the appropriate analogy, but going back is not an option. There's just no contest.<br />
<br />
PS - I'd also like to add that I wasn't very excited about WoW when hearing about it. I read a little on it and liked the artwork, but wasn't too concerned with it. Stress test sign ups came and I decided to give it a go and got in. I've played AO, SWG, DAoC, and Horizons. Many of those because of free trials, but I think it gives me a bit of prespective. I still hold EQ above all of those. WoW however strikes me as the true next generation in MMOs. Even in its current state it stands head and shoulders above the rest and it isn't even finished.<br />
<br />
I'll leave my last statment. EQ2 had better be DAMN better than anything that they've previously released. It needs to be the powerfhouse that EQ classic was when it first entered the scene. I haven't had so much fun playing a game since I first started EQ. My family, who is usually ok with my extended EQ sessions and have gotten used to the time it requires, were concerned with how much I was playing WOW. The shocking thing is that I wasn't doing it because of some hideous timesink built into the game. I was playing because I was having fun. I'll probably log onto to EQ sometime this week to say my goodbyes and let my subscription pass. I'm sure my family will love the extra time I spend with them until WoW releases.</div></div><hr />
