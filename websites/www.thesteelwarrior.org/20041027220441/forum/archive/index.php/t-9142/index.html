<br />
I checked aold threads but were all about items I &quot;should get&quot; with money.  But I have none.  So basically I am lookign for advice of what I can get while leveling up.<br />
<br />

<br />
Please feel free to laugh and judge...I have a few newer things cause I played again but only shortly...but most of it is stuff that used to be okay.<br />
<br />
Anywhere I can hunt for upgrades and not get trashed is okay by me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have a budget / some nugget of savings? are you looking to solo / group?<br />
<br />
Theres probably a decent amount of new stuff out there from OoW to keep a look out for too, but better to give advice on what I know, so heres last expansions recommendations.<br />
<br />
If you are wanting to group in places to get upgrades initially your best bet is LDoNs.  The bazaar market is mudflated to the point where these days sub 60 its pretty hard to find somewhere you can get XP and see drops you would actually want to wear.  LDoN offers the occasional drop supposedly appropriate for your level range, some adventure points you will be able to use towards upgrades later, and some XP (though its not exactly fantastic XP).<br />
<br />
Some other spots you could head for drops are -<br />
Velks Labyrinth - get a healer partner and head up to the upper spiders area.  From here you can get 22% Haste gloves which you can sell for a couple of k plat each since you're already wearing 90hp gauntlets, and also 15AC 40 hp bracers.<br />
<br />
When you hit 55+ you can take groups to the revamped CT.  Here you can try and camp spiderfang earings, Heavy Rubicite Toolbelt, Mosquito leg earrings, Lizard bone earrings and the Heavy Rubicite BP.<br />
<br />
Veksar is another nice place for XP and Drops in the high 50s / low 60s.  Soulscream belt from there would be a great upgrade for you FBSS, some of the bits of Kylong armour would be a good shortterm upgrade for you too.<br />
<br />
Also closer to 60 you can take a group to the revamped Droga and camp for a Copper Hammer of striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
If you are going solo I would recommend a bit of farming 1st.  Hunt mobs that drop tradeskill ingrediants (spider silks, spiderling silks , pelts etc) and sell them in the bazaar to people skilling up.  The 1st thing I would buy as a soloing warrior is a new weapon - you want to kill them before they kill you, agro isnt an issue.  Something like a stonebladed axe of dismay would be a good investment for soloing and hopefully not too expensive.<br />
<br />
Some other things to look for - Collect blue diamonds when you see them drop, farm some velium and see if you can find a smith to make you some Fine Heraldic plate.  Bracers at 25AC, 30hps will be a good upgrade for you, Boots at 30AC, 30hps and Legs at 40AC, 40hps are all good deals for the price you will pay.</div></div><hr />
