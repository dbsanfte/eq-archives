<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wubba Wubba</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am the raid leader of a casual, non-raiding guild.  All of my guild members are working people with time constraints.  Amost all of us have been in this game since it started in 1999.  My guild can normally sees 12-20 on a weekday, and can field 4 groups for raids on the weekends.  Almost every main is 65, has lots of AAs and is very well-equipped from PoP and LDoN.  I am a 7k+ unbuffed warrior who has pretty much everything I can get with my guild.<br />
<br />
As the raid leader, I have to sit down before the weekend and plan what we will do.  My constraints are: less than 4 hours per raid, can't require keying or flagging, must allow for late additions and people who need to leave at short notice.<br />
<br />
In short, I am a serious casual raider from a small guild.  I have no idea what proportion of the EQ playerbase I represent.<br />
<br />
Lately, planning Friday raids has grown tougher and tougher.  None of the recent expansions has offered anything for people like me.  Very little pre-PoP that is unkeyed has anything to offer that would excite anyone in my guild.  And we're sick of pre-EP PoP where we are stuck.  Where the hell do I take my people on a fun Friday night?<br />
<br />
You need to be able to feel like you can progress in games like this.  This simple fact is that for serious casuals like me, there has been very little progression in the last year.  There're just glass ceilings everywhere.  And I'm sick of hitting them. <br />
<br />
Blizzard just has to say &quot;size-scalable content for all levels&quot;, and my guild will be out the door in a shot.  And this saddens me, as I'd love to keep playing EQ, but there is nothing left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavariel Baenre</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More mini's like BoT towers, IV, Va'dyn, DS, rumblecrush, etc would have been nice to see with GoD. <br />
<br />
If I were to take a stab as to why they are not in GoD I would say its because either<br />
<br />
A) Sony truely didn't keep your playing style in mind. 18-24 person encounters are not popular enough to warrant the program time.<br />
<br />
B) Higher end people would 1 group these encounters, leaving you high and dry.  Already in GoD are 1 groups forced to take down bosses that a casual low end raid force might not be able to defeat.<br />
<br />
An alternative would be to introduce a few instanced raid zones with those type of mini's in them, with the same lockout time of say 4 days like ikkinz.<br />
<br />
Good rant, just unsure to really what is the answer to why they didn't appear with GoD.</div></div><hr />

I would tend to believe this is the correct answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What content have you actually raided?  I see you mention doing PoP and such, is that usually what you stick to? Also, is raiding more for fun or gear?  <br />
<br />
If your level of gear is any indication of regular in in your guild, you could have fun cruising through ToV, all three sections.   4 groups is enough for that, and you can coh.  You can also do the various key dropping dragons.  That way, after awhile you would basically stumble into the ability to raid ST aswell, without really worrying about it much.  Much of Ssra/low end luclin is also doable with those numbers.  You could add all the various wandering dragons aswell, both kunark and velious.  You could really probably take out a good chunk of Velious with 4 groups of Ldon geared people.  And for the most part, it seems usually undisturbed.<br />
<br />
If you've done all this, not really sure what else to tell you.  Personally, I love VP, unfortunately its both keyed and due for a revamp.  So, probably not a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walkka</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what you have raided or not already, here's a few things that we've been doing with 30 or so people pre Elemental...<br />
<br />
Velious :<br />
- AOW : a good challenge very feasible if you have sufficient healers back up<br />
- KT : also feasible<br />
- The Dain<br />
- NTOV : you won't get much gear upgrades there, but it is a fun place to raid<br />
- Klandicar and other ST key dragons as suggested above<br />
<br />
Luclin :<br />
- Grieg Veneficus<br />
- Key for Seru, not sure 24 can do him but I hear it's possible<br />
- Burrower and THO the Deep (also check the one in Acrylia Cavern)<br />
- SSRA work on keys etc...<br />
<br />
POP :<br />
- tower bosses in BOT<br />
- minis in PoTactic<br />
- Paffa in COD<br />
<br />
all that comes to mind right now, but I'm sure there's more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I'd hit GoD a little more than you might presently be considering.  Although raiding Ferubi for random drops (and a few of the nameds should certainly be very, very possible) will provide you with more bang per raiding hour than anything else short of just splitting into LDoN groups.  The biggest problem is that there are less &quot;targets&quot; and more simple clearings.  Still, taking three somewhat independant groups into Ferubi would provide the AAs, the potential for *excellent* random gear and (properly coordinated) the potential for good gear/augs through some of the nameds.<br />
<br />
Sadly, LDoN might be your best progression option though.  Smart players that are undergeared can still mow through LDoN easies or (with some effort) hit up LDoN Hards for upgrades and points towards upgrades.  I'm a pre-elemental Rogue and have pulled a number of LDoN hards as long as there is any CC to speak of (multiple root classes or multiple healers, although ideally a bard/chanter or proper puller is nice) and we've tanked them with pre-Ssra knights comfortably as long as people are paying attention.  I've yet to hear of an LDoN-orientated progression guild but it honestly makes more sense than the old Luclin/VT cycle in terms of RvR these days.  And no, I don't mean the raids at that point in progression.<br />
<br />
Other options include out of the way targets like Korocust or even odd ones like BoT towers (easy with masses I guess but quite doable with strategy and some finesse).  Luclin targets as a whole are not so good anymore imo, given the potential in GoD for smaller forces to at least get *good* gear, even if more randomly.  Ironically, I'd consider Dain/KT/AoW to be better RvR even today than Luclin for the most part.  If you can do NToV, it still offers pretty nice RvR also, although you'll deal with tons of rot and a short raid with in-and-outs is poorly suited there.<br />
<br />
I would avoid the key-and-raid for ST though these days.  It honestly doesn't provide anything of real value anymore, primal included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, not to sound like an evangelist but &quot;Give GoD a chance!&quot;  While Ferubi can be done with one group, taking a small raid there will get you to the named much faster for some nice augments, and probably just about everyone in your guild could use the range item and shoulders off of the yard trash.  Nothing in Ssra is out of your reach with 4 groups these days, I bet you could even get into VT, and if you look around GoD you might find some mini-boss type of raids as well.  I know the events exist in zones like Quinimi and Riwwi  but I don't know anything about them.  From your magelo I'd guess you're sick of LDoN hehe, and obviously you've been doing BoT tower bosses, but I would try some Ssra and explore GoD a bit.  Burrower parasite is a fun event that would definitely be doable and is up a lot.  Some of his loot is crap, but the BPs and robes with FT5 would probably be valuable to some of your members and the priest hat isn't bad.  Most importantly it's a fun event :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wubba Wubba</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I appreciate the advice, I'm not sure if people here understand the constraints on my type of guild.  Finding timed spawns up is very tough for us- say KT.  We only have a 4 hour window on 1-2 nights a week to raid.  The named has to be found and be up at that time.  This is VERY different from a guild that has trackers out all the time and can mobilize 4 groups at any time.<br />
<br />
I may have access to 1-2 rangers/druids to send off to look for things say 1 hour before the raid.  A lot of times I will only have one tracker.  I can check maybe 3-4 possible targets.  If none of the nameds are up, I have to fall back on something else, like blitzing through PoF/PoH for epics for alts.  Most of the high value targets people list are farmed like crazy on my server.<br />
<br />
PoP is great for a guild like us.  One tracker can zone in and check for a ton of targets in zones off PoT in an hour- BoT Towers, PoD/PoN minis, Xenamech trigger, Tactics minis.  But I sense my guild is sick to death of these targets.<br />
<br />
So what have the last few expansions offered my guild in terms of new things to do?  Certainly nothing that is close to PoP Tier 1-3 minis in term of fun and convenience. <br />
<br />
Personally I like GoD for single-group events, and my guild has raided Ferubi several times.  But running in and farming trash for 4 hours in Ferubi does not have much of a &quot;fun factor&quot;.<br />
<br />
I need events that:<br />
<br />
(1) are always up;<br />
(2) take 1-4 hours to complete;<br />
(3) have a short travel time to/from; and<br />
(4) can add late-comers with ease.<br />
<br />
LDoN raids would be perfect, but they are set for 6 groups of VT+.  I can usually only field 3-4 groups of slightly lesser-equipped.</div></div><hr />

No offense meant, but people at all stages of the game at run into &quot;glass ceilings.&quot;  Quite frankly, the game doesn't always challenge everyone every time they log on.  Hell, even ubers pre-GoD were as sick of farming Time as much as many point grinders were of LDoN.  You can try to take the next step and move up, keep things the same, or try to expand what you think is possible with your current force/limititations.  As an aside, I mostly jumped in to reiterate that LDoN should have a lower level of raids exactly for guilds like this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild was alot like yours for a long time.  We've since changed a bit, but we've dealt with the problems you are suggesting.  If you have access to a ranger alt no one uses (or just plevel one for yourself to 15 or so) and park it in ssra.  <br />
<br />
The WW area is a decent mine for that sort of thing.  Does ToV get touched alot on your server still?  Most guilds skip it on mine.  If not, just do a quick check there the night before with a ranger who has 10 minutes to spare before logging off that night.  If its not up, you can always do WW dragons (almost always up) for fun.  Or Zland if hes up, hes a fairly quick trip.  <br />
<br />
My main point is, you know the limitations of your guild.  Those are pretty close to what mine were awhile ago.  I assume perhaps the same work arounds could be helpful to you. Plan your time out before the day actually arives.  This is good because it lets people who will be late/barely on time get there the night before.  You seem to have a set schedule on what your going to do, so this isn't impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very few things are always up and available.  Unfortunately, that just means that you need to get your trackers to do some running until they find something, but as some have mentioned, if you hit some older world content you might have some luck.  There are MANY guilds in the same situation as yours.<br />
<br />
You should easily be able to do the Nadox version of Innurok, and it is pretty easy to see if the Luggald High Priest is up.  You could farm up the pieces to spawn Garudon in Veksar.  This farming would stink, but could be done by a group of you during an off raid night.  Korucust can be fun in SolC for a change of pace, but that can be a pain to check on.  I have not done it myself, and it requires some long camps, but you can also camp the items to spawn the captain in Hate's Fury....that looked like it might be a fun fight.  No idea on teh drops, but it could be different.  I am not sure that there are many drops in there that would be of great use, but most of these have a chance to drop items that someone should be able to use, and if nothing else can be a nice change of pace.</div></div><hr />
