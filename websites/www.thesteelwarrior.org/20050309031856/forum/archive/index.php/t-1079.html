<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in PoN last night with my monk.  We were camping at the dock and I was pulling the Nettlings.  We had a good group: 57 War, 54 Cleric, 56 Shaman, a Mage, a Rogue, and my 53 Monk.  <br />
<br />
After about an hour, the warrior had to leave.  So we had a 54 SK from my guild come join us.  It was a mess.  He couldn't hold agro of anything.  We started asking him what spells he was using.  Turns out he was using his biggest DD spells.  We told him to use debuffs or fear spells instead.  He didn't want to use fear, was scared the mobs would run away and bring a train back on us.  We convinced him to use his lowest fear(lvl 9 or 15 iirc)  <br />
<br />
Worked great.  He would fear on incoming to pull them off me.  The Shaman was landing slow at about the same time his first swing with his sword landed.  And he wasn't losing agro.  We camped there for a good 3 hours after that and never had trouble other than a couple of LDs.<br />
<br />
The only problem is, I helped teach another Knight class how to out-taunt/tank a warrior.   Before the warrior left, the mobs were ping-ponging around bad.  I was staying FD til mobs were at 85% before standing.  1 swing and they would be back on me and would have to flop again.  I mean I'm glad a guildie learned to do something new with his char and he can't wait to do it again.  But it irked me a bit that the Cleric was whining about hating it when she has to settle for a warrior tank if no Knights are available.  She wanted to just sit back and cast her 2 CHs per kill on the tank and maybe throw a celestial on me if I got tagged hard before I FD.  With the warrior, she was needing about a 1k heal for me, 2 CHs for the warrior, a celestial for the shammie, another for the rogue, and one for herself every kill.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I guess I feel kinda bad for helping make one more person better at doing our main job for groups :(<br />

<br />
If anything; you showed Leadership and took control of a situation. Nothing wrong with that; Warriors are always good for that :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You didn't do anything wrong. Like Shik said, Knowledge in insulation will surely be rotten.<br />
<br />
Umm, well....<br />
<br />
Anyway, you did the right thing in helping another player learn an important skill that he had neglected.<br />
<br />
Gratz to you on being a helpful and considerate person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at it this way, every time we teach any member of any class how to work with us not to get aggro, we're also illustrating to them how to make sure we dont get aggro if they don't want us to.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So next time your SK friend is in a group ... have the SK get initial aggro that exact same way.<br />
<br />
But here's a trick ...<br />
<br />
Have the warrior taunt the aggro off of the SK then the SK FEIGNS DEATH. And BAM.<br />
<br />
Warrior has now piggybacked some impressive aggro, by working TOGETHER with the people in the group, towards a favorable result for the entire group.<br />
<br />
This always works best for me when I'm grouping with friends. Why? Because we're friends and we like playing together and working together.<br />
<br />
Pulling this off in a group of strangers is more difficult because people don't know or don't care half the time.<br />
<br />
In regards to the cleric ... if I were you, ESPECIALLY since you're a monk, I'd not worry at all over what that cleric is frustrated about.<br />
<br />
It's ONLY MANA fer cryin out loud.<br />
<br />
They get it back.<br />
<br />
Clerics sometimes feel so put upon when they have to actually do their job in an XP group. It's silly.<br />
<br />
They are a healing class. Worrying about them having to heal entire groups of people is just misplaced worry. Did the cleric have C3? If so ... then no worries whatsoever.<br />
<br />
If not, well, you know the occasional bit of downtime is GOOD because it allows you to TALK and get to KNOW these strangers and suddenly it gets easier to group with them.<br />
<br />
The social aspect of EQ is sometimes lost on people who's sole purpose is to click one hotkey every minute or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love it when people know how, and are willing to, do stuff like that Wu.  The only real problems I see are when there are people who want to play the &quot;look at how uber I am I can outaggro a warrior&quot; game. As if that is an accomplishment.....&quot;Ooooooooh, shadow_knight_01 has mastered how to click on a spell gem...he is L33T.&quot;   But seriously folks, it is great to work with higher aggro melees that know how to help the warrior build inital aggro, there's just too many who'd rather go &quot;Look at me, I'm a better tank than the warrior.&quot;  Sometimes I wonder if it's a pissing contest thing, or if they just dont know how to dump aggro on me.  But again, if you can find that rare pickup SK that will work with you, it's a beautiful thing.<br />

<br />
I was in PoN last night and was 57 then.. but I was at the Waterfall not at the dock..<br />
<br />
Anyhoo since I've started using my GoT (which has actually been atleast a month since I got it) I've been getting compliments in addition to the requests for links about how I can hold aggro. It is sad how much WAR are dependent on their gear, and it is those with bad gear who give Clerics like the one you mentioned the mindset that Knight &gt; Warrior even though they are wrong.</div></div><hr />
