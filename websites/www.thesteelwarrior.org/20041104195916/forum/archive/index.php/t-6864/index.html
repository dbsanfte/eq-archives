<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm semi new to the warrior genre.  I started a warrior long ago and then got side tracked playing other character's that were more helpful to friends at the time (cleric and wiz).  I've just started playing my warrior again and have been having a lot of fun with him.  I would like to get him up in level (50+) and would like to play him almost exclusively but often when I get on EQ if's for short periods of time (hour or two) and  early or late when not as many people are on.  My warrior is going to be 35 shortly as I am soloing spires in SK for decent exp but I know that the exp there will be drying up soon.  I have an almost full set of crafted armor and some decent weapons and my bind wound skill is at about 170.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is some ideas for areas that I can solo in during the times that I can't get a group or don't have time to look for one.  I do not have the LDoN or GoD expansions, but have the others.  Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated. <br />

<br />
i may be wrong but i would think that soloing a warrior with limited time is really going to try your patience</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO Soloing for you is gonna start to become not worth the bother, however, if you are persistant and stubborn enough you may want to consider getting a fungi tunic(if you can afford it) and a couple of bloodpoint daggers (lifetap procs).<br />
<br />
At 35ish I would consider DSP, OT or even CC (this may be a bit easy though. You may be best going to DSP and soloing some of the critters there whilst shouting for a group, warriors really don't work well as a solo class.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taelindar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well i can tell you from personal experiance don't solo its not worth it, but have spent last 30 levels with my wifes shaman and it has flown by.  I did DSp from 31-38 then DL to 48.  If you get in a good group it will fly even faster.  We really arent solo guys, but a shaman DUO works great specially after they get Stoicism heal spell.  Im a wood elf and with carefull gear buying i have 2800 hp and 980 ac unbuffed at 48.  I think I am right on target so far.  Have your shaman slow, and put one dot, then sick pet and you whack and things fall down quick.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can only reiterate what others have said:<br />
I solo'd alot up until about level 45.  My gear was not very good (almost full crafted, dwarven work boots, skull shaped barbute, various relatively crappy weapons).  It was absolutely miserable between level 25 or so and level 45 when the level of gear I had simply did not allow me to solo anymore.  With the right gear it can be done, but at best it will be slow, painful, and many times you'll die and end up losing more xps than you gain.  (this can happen alot when soloing with a warrior)   Your best bet is to duo with a healer, and at your level that will be best done with a shaman or a druid (slows and damage shields respectively), although a cleric is a good option too.  As you get to higher level, the cleric will start to outshine the druid because of better hp buffs and better heals, but shaman will still be the best for stat buffs and more importanly slows (you can easily buy virtue at this point).  I still get a lot of my AA xps duoing with a shaman in lower end zones like PoI or deeper areas of veksar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did ALOT of solo'ing pre 55 becuz peeps told me i couldnt.<br />
<br />
starting from 35 two zones I used that took me to 46 or so.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud and LGuK<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud I solo'd the tribal guys near the Grieg's zone.. (and I was still wearing some crafted)<br />
<br />
LGuK I zoned in and did the entrance there up till just before BR<br />
<br />
basically giving you 6-8 live frogs and 3-4 dead frogs... (bring lotsa bandages) I spent about 2 weeks there getting those levels.. leaving once in a while for DSP...<br />
<br />
once i hit 50-51 I solo'd to 55 (plus a couple of AA) on isabella and the nobles in HK... moved to the bards around 54 for the last bit...</div></div><hr />
