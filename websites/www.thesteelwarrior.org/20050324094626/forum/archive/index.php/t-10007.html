<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kathump</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just a lowbie warrior and have only been playing for a short while.  I was doing really well as a young troll warrior wandering the lands of Norath, until recently.  I used to be able to find groups in DSP, LDoN's and other places but now with the mass exodus from the game I am not finding any groups when I play.  <br />
<br />
So, here is my question.  I am a lvl 30 troll warrior with almost decent equipment and I am going to need to try and solo like I did as a very young troll.  I am currently soloing in Sol A but most of the mobs are light blue and Naggys lair mobs seem to beat the doogie doo out of me.  Is there a better place that a lvl 30 warrior could solo?  Loot is always nice but I am more about lvling my warrior up to maybe one day reaching some of the stats of the warriors on this site.  I usually never have any buffs since I do not 2 box and I am going to post my Magelo so I can get some pointers on what I need to upgrade, you all please try not to laugh as you look at it, and where I can go to solo.  <br />
<br />
I have tryed Splitpaw, permafrost, Sol A &amp; B, and ToFS.  I am going to try to go to CC once I can get some levitation and invis potions.  Any one else have any places a lvl 30 warrior can solo, I dont mind fighting a mob then binding wound for 4 minutes before going to the next one as long as it is good exp.  I am on the sol ro server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please try not to laugh, out loud anyways:<br />

The moor gets alittle tough since I always end up going into one of the caves or the camp at the south.  The adds at my lvl make me run alot.  I will try them again though.  Runeye eye is a joke at lvl 30.  The only hard mobs are the main guys, lord and the caster guy they wipe me everytime hehe.  I have not been to the moor since around lvl 25 and it was before they were hot zones, so I will try that one again.  <br />
<br />
thank you and will take any other advice from the seasond veterans on this site that I admire and hope to be one day.</div></div><hr />

Some things you should try to improve are 1. your AC and 2. regen gear.<br />
A Fungi Tunic would of course be great but it's quite expensive. Maybe you can get a good deal on a &quot;Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate&quot; which has +5 regen.<br />
If you can afford it then use DS potions (Kilva's Skin of flame) to improve your DPS.<br />
Other zones you can try are Netherbian Lair and Dawnshroud Peaks (or Mistmoore Castle if you want to stay in the old world :D ).</div></div><hr />

After that i soloed in The Overthere, the cockatrice's and cactus guys arent bad, i wouldnt try sarnaks till you are like 40 though, hope that helps a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mistmoore would definitely not be a good idea after tomorrow :).  Highkeep or somewhere in Kunark would probably be good at 30.  I would stay away from Luclin for soloing.  LOIO and Frontier Mountains were the big thing when I was that age, and you can probably solo them with your gear pretty well.  I would look for an offhander with a better ratio though.  I don't have anything to suggest, but check the bazaar from time to time, there are tons of weapons out there.  The rest of your gear is probably fine.  Fungi Tunic is the best item you could get, but as was mentioned, it's pretty spendy for your level.  Funny the price on most items goes down hehe.  I bought my Fungi on TM at least 3 years ago for 20k and it's probably worth 100 now :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty good information. Theoretically you could solo until level 49ish in Overthere as there are still blue mobs there.<br />
<br />
To be more specific about the mobs in OT, There are basically 2 types of each mob...<br />
<br />
Succulents - Thorny and Spiked<br />
Sabertooth - Tigress and Tiger<br />
Cockatrice - Stoneleer and Stonegazer<br />
Sarnak (warrior types) - Berzerker and Knight<br />
<br />
Each of the first names are the lower level version of the mob. For instance, a Thorny succulent will always hit less than a Spiked Succulent, etc. At ~30 you should be able to solo the Thorny Succulents, Sabertooth Tigresses, Stoneleer Cockatrices, and Sarnak Berzerkers relatively easy. I started the game before Kunark came out, but did the majority of my leveling in Kunark zones. I was able to solo there using a Mithril Staff and my best piece of armor was an EBCP.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, Sarnak Berzerkers all drop War Braids. Collect 4 of those and turn them into Captain Rottgrime for more EXP and faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kathump</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that with the weapons I have and when I solo that with the platinum plated hammer and the shimmering spear thingy that I kill mobs much faster with that combo then with any other I have.  I constantly hit in the 30+ with both hands and even in the 80's on occation.  I also use a dmg sheild potion to help with my dps.  The frontier mts is not happening, no one there and the exp is not worth the hastles, thank you though.  Since I am a troll with a exp penalty I am trying to stay in exp modified zones.  I liked neth lair except the mobs run and if I dont kill them fast enough I get ganked.<br />
<br />
I would like to upgrade my armor and I have a friend who will craft me some of that rallos zek armor, fierce &quot;something&quot; armor.  I made the choice that I have now becasue I am poor and becasue I like having the high agility/dex, it seems to really help keep my HP up.  Plus if I take the fierce armor it wont even be at full capacity for another 15 lvls, then I can put it on and boot my AC like 100-200 points.<br />
<br />
Thank you all again for all your suggestions.  I am going to try most of them and will take any other info I can aquire from the readers of this board, thank you all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To expound on some comments made; you want to stay away from Luclin primarily because the mobs there tend to have higher ac and hp values, and slightly higher dps output.<br />
<br />
Anything old world will be good for you, because stuff was just easier back then. You say that you are done with Solusek A, but have you tried the Gnomes? They should be good until level 35 at least, and the ZEM for SolA is very high. Basically what you want to do is run through the hidden wall, which is near the wooden bridge guarded by 4 goblins over lava. You want to come out the entrance that has 2 doors and 2 goblins standing in the proceeding room; the door to the left leads to a zone line to SolB. Since you're soloing, you're going to have to worry about runners, so what I would personally do is clear all the greenies/light blues straight and left from the zone in, then hook a right go down some stairs and you'll start seeing gnomes. Pull those back to the zone in, and when they start to run you won't have to worry about adds from runners. Just watch out for the caster gnomes, as they pack a whallop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaknaafein</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo'd a lot before lvl 45. I don't see why you can't buy a temp in pok before heading out, it'll make a world of difference. Also getting a haste is a big help in initially breaking a camp.<br />
<br />
Try staying in sol a and moving deeper to the clockworks. I forget the exact lvl, but i solo'd those a long time after the goblins turned light blue and green for excelent exp. They're a lot easier than the kobolds in sol b. After you break the camp, there's a little alcove just past the bridge that you can pull them into to give you some running room to finish them off as they flee.<br />
<br />
Also Echo cavern's has two sides to it, the lower lvl side being through a doorway to your left as you zone into shadowhaven from the nexus. It's behind a fake wall in that room, pretty easy to solo exp in there and move onto the higher lvl side when things get too easy in there. Both camps are pretty easy for a warrior to solo pull and allow room to kill runners before they can get to their friends.<br />
<br />
If you're strong enough, run yourself berserk the whole time (buying a temp helps a lot with being able to do this), you'll put out a lot more dps, and won't spend as much down time healing. I did it in fierce heraldic armor, no regen items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as gear, cultural will be pretty ok for you as you level, as long as you can arrange to have your non-visible stuff to make up for the differences. Since you are a true lowbie, I'm assuming you don't have a large pool of resources to work off, so make sure you save everything to sell and whatnot. At level 46, consider looking into a pair of Valorium Rings. Mosquito Leg Earring should be relatively cheap by todays standards, and you can probably look into camping a Shell Necklace from Natimbi if you can find a healer and slower to go and hang there with you once you're level 50ish. 15ac 50hp and regen, not a bad necklace. Also look into doing the katta shield quest, the specifics are all over the quest forum of these boards, 50ac 75hp for a quest that (albeit long camps) isn't incredibly difficult.<br />
<br />
As you get some more gear, here's a pretty encompassing experience path that you might consider taking, staying in high ZEM areas all the while:<br />
<br />
Level 30-35 Solusek A Gnomes.<br />
Level 35-40 Difficult choice with the disappearence of Mistmoore for lower levels, you might do ok in Solusek B, you might also consider soloing a little in The Overthere, just stay away from the Sarnaks.<br />
Level 40-50 City of Mist, start at the zone in and work your way deeper as you get stronger.<br />
Level 50-55 Plane of Innovation or Plane of Disease if you can get groups, Velks if you want to stay solo.<br />
Level 55+ Can't really solo much anymore by this level, but you'll probably be able to find some groups at this point. Velks will always remain constant, albeit slow, experience past level 55, but the returns diminish greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, well your gear is okay for your 30s, I think. <br />
I tanked naggy once with the shimmering partisan in my offhand, but it's not your best weapon for offhand work. For offhand, pick the best ratio you can get (shaded dagger is the highest ratio one hander in your bag at the moment, I think).<br />
I agree with Brutal about places to hunt (well, that used to be good, anyway). I'd add the Overthere to your list. Easy to get to with PoK books, you can pop in, do a lfg shout, see if anyone's there. the last time I ran through there on my server, there were a couple-three groups at the skyfire ramp. Perhaps Mseru/dawnshroud would be good as well. Dawnshroud mobs would be darkblue to yellow, i think, and if there are groups there they might need a tank.<br />
If runneye didn't scare you, I'd suggest one solo possibility would be the lizards in Feerott (outside CT). Can be single pulled with a bow, there are lots of them, they do have some level range, and because you're a troll i don't think you'd have to worry about the Ogre guards running around. The lizards drop a fair amount of fine steel (more than the splitpaw gnolls) and you're a short hike back to the PoK book. And you can eat their meat.<br />
but mostly i'd start trying to find some friends. soloing works for now, but in the long run it's slow going for warriors, and that slowing down happens sometime in your 30s. <br />
use the lfg tool to see who is looking and where they are. That might give you some ideas about where folks are hunting on your server at your level. Also, scan /who all 31 and so forth to see where folks are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Don't pick your weapons by how hard they hit.  It's all about the dmg/delay ratio.  Hitting for 80 is fun, but hitting for 45 twice as fast is better.  <br />
<br />
I would be willing to bet that FM is at least as good as NL for exp because the mobs will have much lower AC/hps and you will have much lower downtime.  If you can find a group that is probably better though.  <br />
<br />
High agi/dex does not keep your hps up.  It does next to nothing for you at level 30 in fact.  <br />
<br />
EDIT: If you do wind up in Overthere, be sure to save the sarnak whips to get your outpost faction for the hammer quest (worker sledgemallet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lochr</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in Echo Caverns run. They're pretty hard for a warrior to solo without getting adds. It's a much better place for casters to solo.<br />
<br />
Pretty much like everywhere else.<br />
<br />
I'd go along with the suggestion with the Overthere. It's really a fine, fine place for soloing, and, being a troll, you won't have to worry about the sarnak guards.<br />
<br />
One other option that hasn't been mentioned would be the Tizmaks in the Great Divide. They're located in a cave in the NW corner of the zone. Pretty good cash camp. You start off non-KoS, and can kill a bunch before they turn KoS. Their faction has no use AFAIK.<br />
<br />
An Embalmer's Skinning Knife (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29280) is absolute gold for the soloing warrior. Should be able to pick one up for a couple hundred pp in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level  32 I soloed wolves in Great Divide, followed by Tizmaks and more wolves up until late 30's.<br />
<br />
It is not fast EXP, but it works. And the mobs should be easy with your gear, 2-3 kills per BW session.<br />
<br />
<br />
After those start to green out, may want to look to the north shore in Eastern Wastes. The Uthork there are not hard to solo, and there is a nice long safe spot to the east along the north shore to let them run in if need be. Only down side being no close zone lines.<br />
<br />
And of course CC is a great place to kill Orcs at your level. And the locals make nice guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kathump</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awsome info, thank you all.  As far as my weapons go, I did not know that.  I always thought you should have a high dmg weapon in offhand with a fast/good ratio weapon in the primary for the duel wield check.  So I should have the best raion weapon in my offhand and then a good damage dealing weapon in my primary?<br />
<br />
I havent parsed my logs, dont know how, but I have tried all my weapons in all different combos soloing.  I never realized that the ratio mattered in offhand.  I am deffinatly going to try that.  My platinum re`stek is 20dmg/30delay and my blackened acylia blade is 14dmg/22delay, so I guess I should put the hammer in offhand with sword in primary in order to get more dps with what I have?<br />
<br />
The info just keeps getting better and make me feel more confident.  As far as the friends thing goes all of the ones I had made where basically alts of higher lvl players and most of them moved to EQ2 when it came out, it really sucked.  Plus I play on Sol Ro and it is an old server, from what I have been told, and there are not that many players at my lvl anymore it seems.  Those are the breaks, I love playing my warrior and I will solo for ever if I have to, god I hope I dont have to, I like to group and hold there lives in my ability to tank, I am damn good at it.  I will solo with LFG up until I can find a decent group and I will try those pesky gnomes down in the bowls of Sol A next chance I get, thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As a general rule nowadays ratio is king. If you have two roughly equivalent ratio weapons, stick the faster one in primary. If one has an aggro proc (and you need aggro) put it in primary.<br />
<br />
you might try looking for a reaver or swiftblade of zek, too. might bump your dps a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kathump</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have looked at the reaver and have tried one out.  The argent protector I have always hits harder than the reaver did and even though it was 49 delay instead of 40 I never really noticed a differnece, but i liked the resisits on the reaver.  I will probably never be able to afford a swift blade of Zek until it is no longer a valid weapon for the high lvl I will be, hehe.  Although I always wanted a swift blade of zek in primary and a horn of hsalgra in offhand, hehe, they are pretty outdated now days though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure the reaver will own the argent protector due to it's better ratio. You need to count up how much damage you're doing per second, rather than just looking at how big the hits are.<br />
<br />
you can get a log parser to help you with it, www.yalp.org to download one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hapetsus</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I soloed alot up unitil 50 due to just liking to learn the game by myself, my key little item was the The Gnoll Slayer . This allows for decent DPS+ at your lvl and makes for a TON less bind wound downtime. The quest is easy with a 50+ druid to invis and port you outta splitpaw and it takes less then 10 minutes to complete the quest. Get it quick before they revamp splitpaw!<br />
<br />
Try your hand at Gnolls (fine steel weapons, coin) outside of splitpaw with your pet, the snow cats by the bind site in iceclad (cougarclaw earrings, HQ cat pelts), and the basilisks (eggs for tradeskill) in jagged pine through the blackburrow teleport. Once you can't xp off of these anymore, like you said, the spiders in CC, the spiders and various mobs in CC will feed you well till' you really cant effectivly solo anymore.<br />
<br />
This is all going to take trial and error with the pet till you find out how to pull with it and keep it alive, you can buff it too. I dont recommend using it indoors, could make for adds, but if your surgical with it you can have it pull effectivily for you and turn tail from a distance if it aggros too many mobs. Lastly, learn the art of jousting with a high dmg weapon, its fun and you can xp till 50ish doing it, GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felnar</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few quick things:<br />
1) I see ye have a Bloodpoint in yer bag-use that in yer primary, and if ya can-see if you can grab another for secondary maybe.  For every 1ppm(proc per minute) at 80hps gained per proc that's about 1.3hps/sec or ~7hp per tic &quot;regen&quot; right there.  If you used one in primary and secondary you should be looking at about 2-3ppm(should be 3ppm w/ max dex).  The ratio on it is not that bad especially when you add the DB from primary.<br />
2) Grab 2 Embalmers Skinning Knife (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29280) 's when ya can and start off each session using those(preferably in some newbie area where you can just run around proc'ing/killing w/ no worries) to get a bagfull or two of bandages.<br />
3) See about getting another Velium Fire Wedding Ring when ya can, and replace yer earrings with 2 Black Sapphire Electrum Earring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14701) 's when ya can.<br />
4) I would recommend doing the OT for experience until about 38ish.  No exp mod(iirc) but still good exp, even for a troll, and the war braid turn in's actually are pretty nice exp in addition.  Not to mention the fact that there's a PoK book directly to the zone.  Once there just run to the ramp near the Skyfire zone and pull/kill there.  If the poop hits the fan you can always zone.  Imho this is always a very nice thing for a solo melee that can't heal/fd themselves.  Here's a link to where you can download zone maps (http://eq.mapfiend.net/canondl.php) if you don't have them already.<br />
5) After 38ish can't offer much advise as to where to solo-CoM sounds good as somone previously suggested.  Also, LoY zones should be pretty good exp for ya I think and drops there are nice for cash.  Not sure of the soloability there though.<br />
<br />
Hope these suggestions help ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bobobn</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One good option for you might be the grimling caves in tenebrous mountains. I did these on my warrior soloing from 33(quite hard at that level, they con yellowish iirc) all the way to 45ish. These are even good exp when they are light blue because they are easy to kill.<br />
<br />
There are two types, and then one roamer that ill discuss later. There are orefinders which are pure melee and hit around 65 with about 1200-1300 hp. THen there are geomancers who have less than 1k hp, hit the same, but cast nasty spells. If you make good use of the slam ability(since you are a troll) they shouldn't be too much trouble. <br />
The roamer especially, and all other mobs in that cave have a chance of dropping acrylia. Acrylia doesn't sell as well as it used to, but its still a viable way of making money - bring bags.<br />
<br />
Another plus to this camp is the gem drops and windstones, which sell nicely.<br />
<br />
I did the cave right near katta castellum, and your very close to a town to sell. *Just thought of this* I think you might be dubious in katta, so you may not be able to sell there, but I'm not positive. <br />
<br />
Good luck =)<br />

P.S. I hope this info is still up to date, I'm going off memory and its been almost a year since I was there.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. Just wanted to add that the above poster mentioned using bloodpoint. Iirc, that doesnt proc until level 51, so that might not be the best choice.<br />

A spot that no one has mentioned is the beach in gunthak, you can bind / sell at the lighthouse and the mobs are still mostly blue at 43, have some hp and hit for up to mid 70's, drops lesser gems and up to 4pp, the undead are sweet since they don't run, been killing here since lvl 40, at that level i made 2% per kill and with temperance i could kill 2-4 mobs before needing to sit and heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
iirc, most mobs have around 1-2k hp at max which is low for that level range.  Loot's not too shabby either.  Decent gems from time to time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another place that I soloed was the giants in GD in my low 40s.  DS potions go a long way here.  As was mentioned earlier, the drakkal wolves aren't too bad in the 30s.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns is another decent spot if you have a snare proccing weapon.  The velium sells fairly well too.  Further in, the spiders are decent XP, and everything you need to make vials of velium vapor gate potions can easily be obtained within the zone.  There are vendors you can sell at too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Highhold Keep is another decent spot.  The XP bonus is especially nice.  The Guard Room is fairly easy once you break it.  Plenty of time to bind wounds and rest up for repops.  The warrior and raider rooms are a bit harder to break.  You don't really want to start messing with those till your in your high 30s for soloing.  Being a troll, you might want to return here in your late 40s and early 50s and do the guards and such upstairs.<br />
<br />
South Karana gnoll spire is another decent spot.  Very easy to get singles and if things get hectic, you can always zone into Paw and patch yourself up.<br />
<br />
Mid 30s, to 40, the Yeti cave in Dreadlands is a decent spot.  They have a tiny aggro radius, so single pulling them is a no brainer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sow potions, and cloudy potions (for invis) go a long way.  You'll find them to be very handy.<br />
<br />
Late 40s, and early 50s, you might try Sea Furies in Ocean of Tears.  They've got around 5k hp or so, but they don't hit very hard at all.  It's not uncommon to see shaman and druids out there who might not mind a partner.<br />
<br />
In your 50s, it's hard to beat Velks for soloing.</div></div><hr />

I will eventually get the other bloodpoint, i only got it to keep up my piercings skill.  I have max skill for all my weapons, excepet h2h which I dont think I can train, at my lvl and I just keep switching out my weapons and maxing  them all out at every lvl.  Thank you for the log parser link, I think that will be very handy when I get home to download it, it will help me decide on what weapons to use and let me know which are the best.<br />
<br />
I like the soloing zone ideas.  I  tried the OT and I got better exp at this lvl in sol a killing the gnomes, thanks for that info earlier by the way, then I do in the OT.  I think it is becasue I can kill alot more in sol a before breaking to BW then in the OT.  I am deffinatly going to Gunthak around lvl 35ish and I really want to try the caves that are talked about in the tenebrous mts, do the mobs in katta see invis?  I think the residents dont like evil characters, or is that seuru?<br />
<br />
As soon as I get some money, yea money thats the ticket, I will try to see about getting those bandaid procing daggers talked about, I will never run out then.<br />
I looked last night in the bazaar and i saw a reaver and a, I think, wideblade great sword.  They were similar in price but the later of the two has a lower delay, 30 i think, and the same dmg.  Would that be better then the reaver, I cant buy them both and use the parser, so just wondering.<br />
<br />
Thank you all again, very, very useful info in this thread for me.  I cant believe the trouble now with finding a group at such a low lvl.  Damn you player stealing EQ2, hehe just kidding thanks again guys.</div></div><hr />

I like paw but it is such a PITA to get to as a Troll.  I have been there though, and killed a few gnolls but that zone is getting ready to be revamped and no longer a mid lvl zone.  Plus more than one on me and I am almost guaranteed to be a dead troll.  <br />
<br />
CC is a fun place, I have never been to the bottom but the guards up top can do some pretty decent dmg, and there is usually no one there.  As soon as my little gnomes and clockworks go light blue I am either going to CC or to the tunnels in the TM.  I like the idea of the yetti caves in DL because I think there are usually alot of groups in that zone.<br />

I was doing really well as a young troll warrior wandering the lands of Norath, until recently.  I used to be able to find groups in DSP, LDoN's and other places but now with the mass exodus from the game I am not finding any groups when I play.  <br />
<br />
So, here is my question.  I am a lvl 30 troll warrior with almost decent equipment and I am going to need to try and solo like I did as a very young troll.  I am currently soloing in Sol A but most of the mobs are light blue and Naggys lair mobs seem to beat the doogie doo out of me.  Is there a better place that a lvl 30 warrior could solo?  Loot is always nice but I am more about lvling my warrior up to maybe one day reaching some of the stats of the warriors on this site.  I usually never have any buffs since I do not 2 box and I am going to post my Magelo so I can get some pointers on what I need to upgrade, you all please try not to laugh as you look at it, and where I can go to solo.  <br />
<br />
I have tryed Splitpaw, permafrost, Sol A &amp; B, and ToFS.  I am going to try to go to CC once I can get some levitation and invis potions.  Any one else have any places a lvl 30 warrior can solo, I dont mind fighting a mob then binding wound for 4 minutes before going to the next one as long as it is good exp.  I am on the sol ro server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please try not to laugh, out loud anyways:<br />

try going ot the shroom house in dsp. just past me zone in.<br />
as they get lb move to small if db in con then up the zelnak scale( when fighting the zelnaks would be a good idea to go to the field straight out and right a tad from netherbain zone in. then wolfs after zelnaks are lb zelnaks are great cause they are none social cept for the semi named ones that spawn randomly.<br />
but should be good with a few bags of bandaides and some buffs<br />

  this was 4 years ago , using mith 2 hander , the BoX , and Ex axe notice all two handers for DPS and fbss , added for fun SSB , and fungi tunic (swaaped the mith two hander for the Box when it appeared  ;) and a snare whip and bloodpoint .for when the gits started to run away ,<br />
  the best thing about Highpass keep , highpass hold whatever ya wanna call it , was that i could solo almost the entire keeps population of gobbies <br />
  the trick being the fungi tunic <br />
  to prevent boredom i would invite any one other person of almost any class to join me and duo , but i wish i'd been able to get someone to invite me aong to a cleric rage kill to get the plate arms with the inbuilt DS buff,<br />
  i remember being once told by a rogue in WR that i wasn't welcome in his group because my gear was crap and i didn't do enuff damage ,and after the rest of the group over rode his objections (with the exception of the fungi i was still using the crafted stuff i managed to blag when i was level 25 ) He had to admit that he didnt know what a warr's job was , IE tanking , <br />
  i spent many a happy hour in there, cos the vendors are so close as are the guards, got to be the safest place to EXP at that level in the game especially if you get bound behind the bank <br />
<br />
  well i wish you luck bro , and there is a HUGE deficit in Cons once ou get to about 50 and its then a pain trying to solo untl you have loads of AA , at 60 with SS/ HOT quest gear and a 32 % haste plus 'Stone bladed axe of dismay 'i was at last able to solo again for EXP albeit not a lot in Velks :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was soloing at lvl 10 in ot with a shaman, not very fast but doable :)<br />
<br />
Think i will take my druid to crystal caverns now that it is a hotzone, broken bridge room might be doable at 30, could be that i need more levels but hey worst that can happen is that i die :)<br />
<br />
I have the widebladed sword on Dacke and while i have a feeeling i critted more with the sword of the crypt keeper the speed on the widebladed is a lot nicer, the lifetap proc on the crypt keeper sword was nice enough though.<br />

If you look at my magelo some of the items i found in bazaar rather cheaply, the fierce heraldic stuff was not all cheap though at 6k each  :(</div></div><hr />

Right now u can farm the orcs will be tough cause they run but u can go to the dwarf city side and run to gaurds if they get away from. But kill orcs and keep doing it till u get faction. Even without faction i beleive u can bank there. Farm the acryllia ore they drop even at this late stage of eq folks still use acrylia for trade skills. Put the acrylia in the bank and transfer it to a alt to be your trader in bazaar. (wish i would of been able to do that when i leveled in cc) As u advance in levels u move to other side of dwarf city and start killing stalag mobs and spiders. Crystaline silk would still be sellable to tradeskillers. Finaly you end up in the geo caves. You can kill them and gain decent xp till you are level 49 ( by no means good xp past 45) but as u kill them u loot gems which now that u have faction from killing orcs you can sell right there in the dwarf city. <br />
<br />
Bro u realy need to find you a healing partner. A Shaman or Druid and you could easily get level 45 pretty quick and make some nice pp. Otherwise try to get a stun proc or snare proc weapon no matter the ratio so you dont have as much problems with mobs running and aggroing others. <br />
<br />
That is the best advice i personly have to someone truly new to the game. CC can be very rough zone though you very well might be better off soloing in the Kunark zones and only going to cc when u have that healing partner. It is also a zone that can be difficult for a warrior to learn as invis and lev are almost a must have to get to dwarf city. <br />
<br />
Good Luck to you<br />

I also like the fact that at every lvl I also gain more HP and Attack and maybe AC, not for sure though.  Sure I like to stop and smell the roses, but I am a warrior and I long for battle to progress myself to an extreme.  I am hoping that I can get to around lvl 50 in the next few months, doubt it by going solo as a troll, but it would be nice.  It has taken a month or two to get this far so I am guessing it will be even longer for the next 20 lvls.  <br />
<br />
I enjoy the fact of going head to head with a mob that is probably going to waste me if I am not aware of what is goin on, makes it interesting.  That is what it is about, keeping things interesting.  So far everything I have tried so far in this game is just that, interesting.

Doh-yer right...just looked it up on Alla's...doesn't proc until 50.  Sorry about that Kathump.  By the time yer 50 they probably won't do ya much good either unless yer killing lb cons.  So...changing my advice on weapons to be the best ratio 2h'er you can find/get.  If you can afford one, a Reaver would probably be a great way to go-no recommended/required level on em, unless it's been changed which I doubt.</div></div><hr />

In the context of a discussion about High Keep, WR= warrior room, a place in the zone where warrior goblins spawn, and a good place for a group to set up camp. Another spot is the RR or raider room.<br />
You should go there, just so that you've been there (but be careful of the guards if you're a troll; they won't necessarily like you right off the bat). When i first hunted there you had to wait in line for openings in groups. Heh.<br />

I do an alright amount of damage, but it takes a long time to kill a mob. Adds are hell for me. I never twink, I just don't (though I'm getting close to it, heh). My weapons are A Sarnak Warsword, Iksar Berserker Club, A Weighty Polearm, and Soldier's Pike.<br />
<br />
Clearly not very good.<br />
<br />
KB is hell for my warrior, because the only people who are left either solo or two box, so I'm left with the first option. In OT, I don't get too bad exp per kill, and downtime isn't bad, but at level 26, I tend to spend more time LOOKING for mobs than killing them and regening combined. I tried to go to Netherbian, but I kept getting adds, and I eventually died and lost all the exp I had gained hunting there. I killed a hopper in MS once, was pretty nice, but I fear adds, heh.<br />
<br />
Well, on my SK, I hunted HSM. I think I'll try that on my warrior as well. He solos better than my SK at the same level (go figure). SolA is a problem because I constantly get adds, there's no avoiding it. My BST barely survived there with a druid healing, as the adds were so terrible. In fact, my BST did die there.<br />
<br />
I think I'll solo HSM till maybe 30, then head on in to OT and solo near the Skyfire zone-in.<br />

<br />
Don't solo.<br />
<br />
Seek out a guild with lots of chars your level.  Get in tight with a group of friends with similar playtime, play with the same group every night.  Stick together and 6 months down the line you'll all be 70 and accomplishing things you currently can't dream of.  This game is centered around grouping, and while possible, it is generally neither practical nor desirable to rely heavily upon soloing for a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzen Whacksem</div><div class="date">12-25-2004, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Restating some of what has been already pointed out --- <br />
<br />
It is good to see questions from all levels of warriors on here, not just the big boys!<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ for a while at a laid back, non raiding type of pace (work schedule, type of gameplay desire, and PC gear some of the hardcore raiding issues) and since September of 2000, I am now a level 65 warrior with 37 alternate advancement points and counting.  Guess what ---- I can still solo for xp (aaxp now)!!  Some of that is stubborn, hardheadedness on my part because I like doing things a bit differently and some of it is just because I don't try very hard to find groups.  I don't turn down groups, just don't often try to find them.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back to your question about soloing as a young warrior........<br />
<br />
I think the absolute key to soloing as a warrior (and warrior excellence in general) is learning.  Learn the types of mobs, spawn points, do they run at low health, innate procs / ds / casting, how hard and fast do they hit, etc.  After you identify this information (through in-game play, your mates here at the steelwarrior, various web sites and such), you then need to figure out how to best equip yourself to beat them down before they send you on that free port to bindpoint.<br />
<br />
Some of the best soloing tools are still either beyond your resources or level for procs - (Truncheon of Doom, Silken whip of Ensnaring, Bloodpoints, fungi tunic, etc).  This makes things harder but not impossible.  You might give Allakhazam a whirl and do some searches there for weapons with slow / snare type procs, as well as gear with self buffs especially damage shields.  Find things that could be attainable in the near future and make you a list of goals.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, here are some actual spots to try  :P<br />
<br />
Again, in FM -- goblins near The Mines of Nurga (SEish corner) and the entrance to the Temple of Droga (NWish corner).  Not sure on level range, since they have been green to me since I remember.  Decent cash, up to 5pp and low end gems possible, xp, and most importantly ... FACTION and faction turn in items (green goblin skin and Mountain Death mineral salts).  There is a mob inside the tunnel complex near the Burning Woods zone (goblin traitor) to check faction against.  The faction to note is the Brood of Dizok.  This applies to the sarnaks inside Chardok, a dungeon reached through Burning Woods.  A very handy ring to be had as a result of a quest starting here.<br />
<br />
In Timorous Deep, you could check into the ogre island in the NW corner of the zone.  The Great Oowomp is a resident here, too.  He might be a bit tough for a solo warrior in his 30's however -- darn shammy / necro NPC's are mean.<br />
<br />
Unrest Estate might be too green for you, but worth checking into.  Many mobs here don't run at low health, because they are undead.  Not running at low health cuts both ways --- they keep swinging at you until one or the other is dead.<br />
<br />
Lizards outside of the Temple of Cazic Thule (in the Feerot) might also be worth checking out, as well.  PoK book right here in zone, as it is in The Overthere.<br />
<br />
If you have Omens of War, always try to keep a task going.  The xp and cash rewards for those aren't bad for the risk involved.  I get just over a yellow aaxp from medium tasks now, as well as 116+ pp -- and can solo many of them.<br />
<br />
Finally --- make friends!!<br />
Even though I don't raid much, lots of people I have met in the game do.  As they come across gear that no longer fits them, many will send the old equipment to their friends as gifts or at steep discounts from market prices.  The vast majority of my gear has come as discounted hand me downs from friends or as a result of saving coppers and frugal shopping in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />

It's been said before, and is showing itself with the &quot;exodus&quot; BACK to EQ 1, we're going through the same holiday attrition we go through every year, augmented just a little by WoW and EQ 2, then supplemented by the onslaught of people who hate Everquest and the people who play it so much, they refuse to believe their game didn't kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LordRahl86</div><div class="date">12-26-2004, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried HSM on my BST (solos about as well as my warr), and it was pretty nice. First of all, someone left the zone a mess, as the Sonic Wolves and the Owlbears are still fighting (Grimlings are completely awesome for exp, because they're so darned easy to take down). I went a little too far in and got about 5 or 6 adds... guess I know not to pull from the housing area, eh? Heh.<br />
<br />
I've always found it hard to do any sort of decent DPS on my warrior, merely because I always search for armor first, and forget the fact that I need better weapons. Being an Iksar, it's hard to find quests that I can do without MAJOR faction fixing, and even then, there aren't a lot of quests at my level that would produce decent results.<br />
<br />
The stuff in the baz is... pitiful, at best, for the price they ask for it. I've only managed to scrounge one decent weapon out the bazaar for the prices I can afford.<br />
<br />
It's not that I don't save up. All my money goes in the bank. It's just that I can't get a decent weapon for several days of hunting on my warr.</div></div><hr />

I'm now hunting in Stonebrunt, and it's going quite well. I can easily solo everything that's blue to me (sometimes even 3 at a time) with temp (still not terribly difficult to get). At 27 the exp is still good and as an Iksar I can regen the hp lost fairly fast, though I never have time to get to full health before I find another mob to kill. It's a lot faster than trying to find guys in OT ::sigh::. Anyways, I hunt here for a bit over an hour and a half, then I come back to PoK to see if anyone's selling temp. They usually are, and the loot here is good enough that you should have more than enough to donate for temp.</div></div><hr />

I've been skimming rather than reading the  meat of every post so this may have been stated previously, but if you're gonna solo, get a slow proc and a snare proc.  ToD and silken whip are the two that come to mind most readily.  Those 2 items are a huge boon to a solo warrior.<br />

-Beo</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kathump</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks again for the info.  The shimmering partisan is a nice dps weapon, but i upgraded to the platinum plated resteck(sp) for more dmg.  HSM is still a bummer for me and I get three times the exp solo in SolA then I do there.  I am almost to lvl 34 now with just casual play and I am getting ready to try SolB again.  I find that by soloing near the zone lines I can take up to 4-5 adds, if no casters and 3-4 with 1 caster.   I am starting to love Sol a, it is just hard to get in deeper before the mobs repop and I get a hella train, hehe.  I think I have only died in there once because I got trained by a lvl 54, nice of him, but no biggie warriors die and die well.  I am starting to see more people my own lvl and have even been able to get a group or two, but usually there is only someone else in there PL one of there alts, some are even nice enough to buff me.  Good hunitng and thank you all for the uplifting info, makes it fun to be a warrior again.</div></div><hr />
