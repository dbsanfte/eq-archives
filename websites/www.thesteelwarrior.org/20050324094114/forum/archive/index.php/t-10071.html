<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought so but when I went to get mine I didn't get one.  I figured at the time that it was because I hadn't finished the PoS quest.  Since then I've completed the BoT key but have yet to receive the AA.  I would also like to see an answer to this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">same exact thing for me heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittme</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No new zone accessed by that flag ---&gt; no AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kesk Choktau</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has always been my understanding that you need Agnarr, MM, TZ and VZ for AA and charm upgrade. While many say that a new zone opening is what gives it, this is not true.... HoH Trials open HoHb but give no AA or charm upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC, you get aa/charm upgrades for accessing these new zones:  PoV/PoS, CoD, PoTorment, HoH, BoT, PoTactics, SolRoTower.  You get charm but no aa for PoF, PoW/A/E and Time. <br />
<br />
You get nothing for &quot;b&quot; zones as in HoHb, PoNb, PoEb; except the oppurtunity to progress farther from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No AA for EP or Time eh? Well that explains a lot &gt;&lt; Been wondering if it was a bug, because I was SURE I hadn't recieved one yet =)<br />
<br />
Guess I was right.  Honestly its kind of stupid that you don't considering as those are the hardest steps to get to. /shrug, what do I know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrtiz</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only zones one will get an aa for are the zones accesable for everyone with a certain lvl.<br />
<br />
PoV, BoT, HoH, CoD, PoS and PoTorment...<br />
<br />
Friend of mine got EP acces without doing any aa xp and ended up with 6aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the AA were put in as a reward for actually doing the flags, after they opened the zones up to everyone.   The reward for EP flags is access to the zone hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting, I didn't get an AA for finishing the PoS quest that grants BoT access.  I am positive of this because I remember thinking that when I finished it that I should get two AAs (one for PoS quest, one for Aggy), and I received none.  I have checked all the hailing and the seer tells me that all is well, any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Did you actually go and talk to the dwarf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teegar</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I found is that you need to make sure you go through all the prompting accurately.  If you miss one thing, its a pain to figure out what that was.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that when you say quest you got the giant head, sash, beard and bone from the POS giants.  Then handed them into Askr the lost in the tunnel in POS.  Then you get the bag for putting the medallions into.  Combine the two meds in the bag and give them to Askr the lost.<br />
<br />
When you do this you should get the character flag.<br />
<br />
Then you have to enter BoT through the tornado area in POS.  <br />
<br />
Then go talk with the dwarf in POK Gram Dunnar that gave you the charm and say, &quot;Tell stories&quot; that should get you the AA.  If you don't get it.. then something didn't go right in your POJ Trials and you can check that by going to Seer and get it straightened out.  She should tell you what is needed.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bushinda</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also wouldn't receive your flag or aa if you hadn't completed PoJ trials, which is a prerequisite for any PoS/PoV BoT/HoH flaggings.</div></div><hr />

I did all of the above in that exact order.  Yes, I have had PoJ trials done forever now.  I've checked my hailing personally and with that tool I've seen on the boards (the one that you use a text dump for) and all of it checks out.  I suppose I'll go check it again, but I'm not terribly pressed about it to spend any more time with it, its only one AA.  Thanks for the help though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigdung</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same kind of problem here. Finally got MB beat and after getting my character flag my charm didn't gain any stats. I got the AA but no increase on charm. Yes I have a POJ trial done.</div></div><hr />
