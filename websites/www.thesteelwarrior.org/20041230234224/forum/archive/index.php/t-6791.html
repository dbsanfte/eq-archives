<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using the leadership AA Health of Target's Target for a few weeks now and I am noticing something very odd.<br />
<br />
For those of you not aware of what HoTT is, you see what person the mob has targeted at all times (who has aggro).<br />
<br />
I have observed many times mobs turning and casting malo or tash on a groupmate with me having aggro the entire time. How is this possible? And has anyone else experienced the same thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, casting works odd mob doesn't have to target you to cast on you. some mobs will tash a whole group befor moving on to melee and other stuff. meanwhile you have agro the whole time.<br />
<br />
kinda freeking but saves taunt flailing while the mob casts on people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I have observed this for some time. <br />
<br />
Mobs will tash/malo etc most people in proximity normally. It has nothing to do with who is on top of the hate list. I used to constantly be doing a /assist when I saw stuff like this to make sure I was still the focus of the mob's attention. <br />
<br />
I can remember a lot of times before I had this when people would claim to have snagged aggro, when in fact they had not it was just the mob debuffing them. Totally normal. :)<br />
<br />
Health of target's target rocks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just the caster AI.  Often they will malo / tash, and try to root.  Basically trying to CC you heh.  Great thing about HoTT is that you know it's just a debuff going, and you didn't lose aggro, thus no using taunt.  Spell awareness also shows that it's just a debuff / root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, it's like this:  mobs who have crowd control spells will cast them on people who are further down on the hate list.  This makes sense if you think about it, because the purpose of those spells is to handle multiple enemies. :)<br />
<br />
Lots of spells fall in this category: malo, tash, root, snare, charm, slow, mez, fear, feeblemind, dispel, dots - just about any crowd control spell you can think of.<br />
<br />
You'll also see mobs turn away in order to cast beneficial spells upon their friends (heals, dispels, and occasionally buffs).  Again, the HoTT window will still show you as being targeted.<br />
<br />
HoTT is a window into the mob's hate list.  All of the mob's direct damage spells and melee will fall upon the person targeted.  The other people on its hate list receive crowd control spells.</div></div><hr />

Basically it implied that the mob debuff order was rather like Rampage order and was set based on order aggro and not on the current aggro person.  If anyone knows what I'm referring to post a URL please...</div></div><hr />
