<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question pertains to the movement reduction on the Frostguard proc. Since hamstring is a greater movement reduction than the Frostguard proc, if you have a mob hamstringed, does the Frostguard proc stack or does it not even stick? I know that Frostguard proc also has an attack speed reduction, so does the proc stick and only the attack speed reduction work? I'm just curious how hamstring and the Frostguard proc interact. <br />
<br />
Also, what about Icy Chill? Does anyone know the % movement and % attack speed reduction from Icy Chill, and the duration? How does that proc interact with the Frostguard proc. <br />
<br />
I am thinking a Frostguard with Icy Chill would be a nice combo because it could result in the target being slowed a fair amount of the time and it's movement speed reduced, but if it doesn't stack with hamstring that is a bit of a detraction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;When it comes to move speed reducs the most damaging % reduc buff is the one that stays. For example shaman cannot Frost Shock and earthbind to make someone have 0% move speed. These two override each other depending on which was cast last. &quot;<br />
<br />
I know the PH overwrites Hamstring, that's why I'm wondering if Hamstring overwrites Frostguard proc.  Also you can't hamstring a mob slowed with PH, which would seem to indicate to me that the Frostguard proc may not stick to a mob that is hamstringed.  I really don't know though...  Guess I'll find out when I make one.<br />
<br />
Anyone know the details on Icy Chill proc?  Been thinking of trying it out.</div></div><hr />
