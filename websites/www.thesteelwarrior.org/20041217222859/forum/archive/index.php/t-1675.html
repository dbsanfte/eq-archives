<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another question on that then<br />
<br />
So if 100% is max for me till 60, I would have to really wonder is it worth spending an Extra 30K on a CoF over a SBC to get that extra 10% Haste when with the SBC you get<br />
<br />
26% + 70% (Wonderous Rapidity) = 96% haste <br />
<br />
Only 4% shy of the 100% max for 30K less Compared to<br />
<br />
36% + 70% = 106% <br />
<br />
6% of the extra 10% is getting wasted of the 30K you spent.<br />

SBC = Sibilisian Beserker Cloak (Spelled Very Wrong)</div></div><hr />

<br />
how much + dps are ppl doing with a bard? is the haste cap still 100 at 65?<br />
<br />
<br />
ive seen good amount of testing prove the haste cap at 60 is 100 without a bard. i searched several class boards to see if it went up at 65, but never found anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider this, Grav.... in most raid situations, you don't get WR cast on you due to its shorter duration and lack of a group cast version. You're working with Speed of the Shissar or Speed of Vallon (66 and 68 percent if I remember correctly), so it's a good idea to get at least a 31 percent haste item.<br />
<br />
And it's helpful to reach max haste with just shaman in the group (Swift like the Wind, 60 percent) in exp groups, which is a nice motivation to get a 41 percent haste upgrade from raids :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocaly</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also keep in mind that most of the sub 31% haste items are droppable with crappy stats you will need to upgrade at some point, so don't settle for those if you can help it, get a good haste item cuz you will be using it a long while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I am looking at now, is just getting something affordable, <br />
<br />
Would love a 41% haste item, but dont see that happening anytime soon, only Mob Guild I am in is trying to kill that drops one is Doomshade and the Earring<br />
<br />
With the 26% haste I save like 30k that I can use for other Upgrades till I get a Better haste item or better other Items, is what I was figureing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the poi dragon(slowable) would be easier than doomshade(isnt slowable), just another option for haste and gear in general. the spiders in the factory are easier than the dragon and also drop decent items, but you need to kill him first to get inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really<br />
<br />
I have always been told the Dragon was harder and takes alot larger Force<br />
<br />
Our Guild for raiding is like<br />
<br />
30 Members Average Level 59<br />
<br />
Ocassionally we Break 60 (All Depending on what Members we have on at the Time.)<br />
<br />
We are more of a Famliy Guild that Likes to Raid, so Dont get Max Participation for our Raids.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that Force could Drop Dragon or not,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoI dragon is very easy actually. He's slowable and doesn't have that many HP. All you have to do is get him slowed quickly and you are gtg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boub</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is a 46 pct haste item in PoTime, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep your eyes open for both those 41 percent items, they're nice :) Personally, I still haven't managed to snag one at the right time (using 34 percent - spiked seahorse hide belt. Just barely enough to max haste on raids).<br />
<br />
I would say Doomshade is much easier the the PoI dragon, even with his unslowable rampaging. PoI dragon requires your healers to have a pretty decent mana pool (CH chain not an option with his hard to resist quick stun AEs), and enough dps to drop him before they run oom. At an average level of 60 ish (with an MT of level 65 and decent hp / ac), I'd guess a raid force of 45-50 would be about right for your first kill. Think we did him with as little as 30 or so once we had the encounter down to a routine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, relative difficulty, Xanamech is much tougher than Doomshade, slowable or not. The AE's and fact that he maxes for 1290 may put him beyond Gravdiger's MT and thus his guild.  I would equate Xanamech more in line with Sontalak: if his guild can kill Sonti, they can proabably whack Xana.<br />
<br />
There is a world of difference between what 3-4 groups of well equipped 65s can do vs some up and coming 60s...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strikingone</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xana is WAY easier than Sont..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DS doesnt rampage, he flurries and puts out some nice dps, the dragon is a joke slowed. comparing him sontalek is just way out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soulscream Belt.<br />
<br />
31 percent Haste.<br />
<br />
31 + 70 percent (speed of Vallon) and BAM, you're at 101 percent haste.<br />
<br />
You want to talk EASY?<br />
<br />
Veksar mob that drops the belt is EASY compared to Doomshade, Xanamech, Dozekar/HoT quests, even freakin VOX/Gorenaire/Sev are harder than this mob.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

His belt is like 36% isn't it?  He's not too bad, a group of 65s can do him.   Also, you may be able to do Greig, the Belt of Virility now has 37% haste on it, plus 20 stamina and 75 hp.<br />

We do him regularly with 12-14 people.  Once he is slowed he is easy as pie.</div></div><hr />
