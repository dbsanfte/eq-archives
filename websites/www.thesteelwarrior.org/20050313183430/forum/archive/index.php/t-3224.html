<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Monk in my guild has been doing extensive parsing. What seems to be the case is that one avoidance mod works well, but that they do NOT stack. This holds for these parses done on avoidance mods, and appears to hold true for accuracy.<br />
<br />
Did a 5 hour log the day before getting chest. 4 hour log the following day with chest (woulda been 5 but we went to go kill VZ =) Both in Earth, NE area (near zonein). <br />
<br />
Chest gives +8% block, +15 avoidance, +15 flying kick dmg. <br />
<br />
Without chest <br />
<br />
defensive skill triggers (block/dodge/riposte) - 16.80% <br />
hits evaded (enemy misses) - 35.66% <br />
flying kick max dmg = 306 <br />
flying kick ave dmg = 91.90 <br />
<br />
<br />
With chest <br />
<br />
defensive skill triggers (block/dodge/riposte) - 20.60% <br />
hits evaded (enemy misses) - 43.06% <br />
flying kick max dmg = 321 <br />
flying kick ave dmg = 107.99 <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusions <br />
<br />
+8% block mod may have some minor effect...is worthy to note I bought double riposte 1-3 about halfway throught the second parse so it's kinda invalid (sue me, I hit 30 saved AA again, had to buy something ;) <br />
<br />
+15 avoidance mod certainly seems to work, with an 8% increase in misses overall (again, this is just miss percent, totally ignoring block/dodge/ripo). <br />
<br />
+15 flying kick dmg mod gives exactly 15 added dmg to every FK. Bumped up max and average by exactly that.<br />
<br />
Did another ~4 hour parse today in earth. <br />
<br />
defensive skill triggers (block/dodge/riposte) - 19.81% <br />
hits evaded (enemy misses) - 42.67% <br />
<br />
Got two avoidance mods and one accuracy now: <br />
<br />
With chest and bracer (+15 avoidance on both, +15 accuracy on bracer) <br />
<br />
hits evaded (enemy misses) - 41.95% <br />
<br />
average crush dmg - 238.95 <br />
hits landed (my attacks) - 65.75% <br />
<br />
<br />
Without chest or bracer (no mods) <br />
<br />
hits evaded (enemy misses) - 36.44% <br />
<br />
average crush dmg - 234.05 <br />
hits landed (my attacks) - 65.64% <br />
<br />
<br />
I also parsed with just bracer to check on stacking: <br />
<br />
With bracer (+15 avoidance) <br />
<br />
hits evaded (enemy misses) - 42.05% <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusions <br />
<br />
All numbers agree with my earlier findings. <br />
<br />
Most notably, avoidance mods do not seem to stack. Will try to parse more to confirm this. I don't have multiple accuracy mods, but I'm real curious to see if they act the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">judor</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for all the feedback so far, the monk information is pretty good. Would really like to see your results though koguin, have heard there are fairly large difrences between the monk and war gains from this mod.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KoGuiN</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did the test with 15 to avoindance for 2 hours then 2 hours without it  // with 1959ac.<br />
Log isnt on this computer so i'll just post the results real fast:<br />
<br />
With avoidance mobs missed 47.63% of the time.<br />
<br />
Without it mobs missed 39.48% of the time.<br />
<br />
I do not posses one of those avoidance items so soon as i can i'll be going to my friend's and have a longer parse, maybe he'll been gotten an another one to see if it stacks.<br />
But from what i see there's a little under 10% more misses coming from mobs when you have one on.<br />
<br />
I'll come back with a more solid parse tho next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can we get some more information from this parse Demorgoth.<br />
<br />
Was he tanking the entire time.<br />
<br />
Yes it seems obvious that he would be, but for some obscure reason some monks are bringing that into question since he doesn't specifically say he was.<br />
<br />
Ask him if he will post ALL the information from that parse.<br />
<br />
How many hits vs misses.<br />
<br />
What conditions.<br />
<br />
What buffs.<br />
<br />
Was he tanking the entire 4 - 5 hours.<br />
<br />
The more information we have about the parse, the more confidence we can have in it.<br />
<br />
At the moment we only know 4 or 5 hours worth of killing in PoEa Corner.<br />
<br />
Now I have tanked that corner and I know its possible if your gear is good enough, hell I duo'd it with just a shaman its easily doable.<br />
<br />
Some are going to bring into question the validity of it until we get more information, so if you could push him so we can find out for sure if +avoidance stacks that would be great.</div></div><hr />
