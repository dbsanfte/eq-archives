<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have done Thunderclap and other tower named mobs. The first time i tanked Thunderclap i used /def. This last time I was told to use evasive. I did but it seemed that i got hit more often and for more. What is the advantage to using evasive? Also wich disc would you all use?<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's a thread with the info you want:<br />
<br />
Library link to Uber mob tanking (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=13) <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the mob in question is listed, but if it isn't, parse it the next time you fight him.  If the DI is high relative to DB, use defensive - otherwise use evasive.  (defensive seems to be best for most - but not all - PoP mobs listed in the linked thread)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Uhm, if I recall correctly all the tower nameds except north wing have a rather large dd/stun... believe east wing is 500dd/stun, west wing is 1000dd/stun, and south wing is 1500dd/stun.<br />
<br />
In addition to being very hard (in case of South Wing completely impossible) to resist, these can cause huge damage spikes that take you from half health to dead in the matter of a blink of an eye.  Since mob innate procs cannot go off on a miss, the theory is that with Evasive up you'll get hit less, thus getting procced on less.<br />
<br />
I must say, I was quite the defensive goon back in the day. and after making the transition to evasive I am really pleased with it.  You get hit for full power, but the number of misses on you truly makes it worthwhile in many circumstances.  In EXP groups and on mobs that have any innate proc, I always use Evasive unless specifically ordered to do otherwise.  It can truly be the difference between life and death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you both. Also yes Grendon thats what i was told. That it makes the DD miss. I had never herd of this till our other tank told me. Heh that 1K DD hurts and will  kill you dead rather fast. We only use 2 clerics when doing this mob. With one cleric or druid on the Rampage tank. Normaly I am the rampage tank and the ogre wich has  just a few more HP than me. (he is full ornate and i still use vindi BP and some other older world gear.)  But with the cornering bugs he has to be in gnome form inorder to corner. For some reason I dont. So i get to tank just for that reason. I used to be the guild MT but he bought some PP and got the gear so now im mostly the second tank. Once i get anger3 on both my wepons i will be MT again i am thinking. <br />
   Also where can i find the stuff for parcing. I have herd of them but have never been able to find the stuff to do this.<br />
  Thanks again</div></div><hr />
