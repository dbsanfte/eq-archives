<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Granbalken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, looking for any info you guys can give me on Lord Seru himself, and the encounter in general. Trying to gauge whether he is within our capabilities before starting the key quest :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you can offer,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You cant melee him (other than MT) cause his small range AE eats everyone in a short period. You NEED Alot of wizards that are good at nuking at the edge of agro. Seru basically can be done with 1 tank 6 wiz 4 clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can melee him =P  Learn his AE.<br />
<br />
But yes, he can be done now with a fairly small crew, it just ends up being a very long fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">His AE is like a curse that lasts 3 hours, nasty dot but its RC2 or RGC able easy.  Best to use one SK or Paladin MT to hold good agro, if you don’t bring Baned rangers or like 15+ nukers it’s a guaranteed 1 hour fight. We did him Saturday afternoon and it was about 45 mins with 4 wizzies, 2 mages and no bane melee.<br />
Place him in any corner in his room and have your raid sit in the center area but more towards edge to be in heal range. Make sure no one runs around and agro’s adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do bows work on him? Like can melee stand at a distance and plink him the entire fight or is he immune?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they have bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you don’t bring Baned rangers or like 15+ nukers it’s a guaranteed 1 hour fight.<br />
<br />
 That's a bit of an exaggeration=P Last run we had I think 0 rng and 1-2 nukers. It was a 45 min fight(20ish people). But no guaranteed hour.<br />
<br />
 Oh and yeah Bane bows work for all. But your non-rangers will do a lot more damage whipping up a 2H and meleeing between curse casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You just leave on tank on him forever? What type of melee/AE damage are we talking...I will divine number of clerics from your response :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He's grummus slowable now, probably 2 clerics could keep a well equipped tank up, but you could run a 4 cleric rot with just about any tank.<br />
<br />
Melee is 795? i think, flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He did him with 5 clerics,3 wizzys, and some rangers.. I got lucky and got his Pimped ass BP....That guy is mucho thanks for farming him for phat loot..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't even know there was a bane bow....<br />
<br />
Lol, I guess I am trying to size up Seru and see if we want to try him with just nukers and clerics.<br />
<br />
I have a 51hp nuke bracer! Go go melee nuker!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">literally took like 38 mins on log with 4 lvl 65 wizzies , 3 mages and whoever extra thrown in this was saturday pm. 4 clerics stayed 90% mana entire fight looping max hit is like 750+ or close and flurries. Hes totally MR also. Just keep melee awake to kill roamers that path into room</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">red epic works if you have no bane, 100dd proc gets resisted maybe 40% of the time, i was in a fight with red epic main and primal offhand before i had bane<br />
<br />
also sence you can proc on misses 2 EB weps can wold aggro pretty well, or most do EB main bane offhand to keep aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heyas-<br />
<br />
Couple tips for the fight;<br />
1). his stun proc sucks, bigtime.  check is vs. MR, and even with 500mr it'll stick a lot.  <br />
2). fairly risky with only 1 tank- strongly suggest a DI chain and high cha if you try that.  Have a backup tank clone aggro periodically perhaps, just in case.<br />
3). use some instant aggro stuff to build up some hate during the pull; snare glands or sticks, root webs, etc. all work very well.  Plan on being stunned a LOT, if it happens early your clerics are gonna get eaten.<br />
4), massive DSes are good, may end up being your primary source of DPS during the fight if you don't have a decent crew of high FT and/or clicky nukers.<br />
5). GRC or equiv needed for mt for sure, also for others that screw up and accidentally get dotted.  Low health aggro WILL pull seru off the MT.  Adds (if any) will also SUMMON the MT if he goes low health, pulling seru into Bad Places, so beware.<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. EB shield seemed to work well too; slams didn't do dmg, but did seem to generate some aggro anyway.  Wonder what limit: effect 999 is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're really worried about agro you can just run 2 ch chains on 2 diff tanks fulltime, one will be stunned while one isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grobble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Farming banes is a pain, so if you do it at all just get bows for your rangers.  It's a relatively long fight no matter what way you look at it, so bring all the nukers you can.  Wizards are great if they know what they're doing.  <br />
<br />
Also great for this fight (as with many luclin fights) are necromancers.  A necro with seduction of saryrn (their highest level lich spell) can keep several dots on seru for the entire fight without worry of going oom.  Their best dots are fire based, disease based and poison based and usually land 100% of the time.  Also, with FD, they should have no problem with aggro.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure our necros outdamage our wiz on seru pretty easily.<br />
<br />
As was stated it isnt very hard to keep a tank up against seru, his melee is &lt; 800 and the dot is only about 300/tick iirc.  Adds really aren't much of a problem and if you get them, you'll have plenty of bored melee around to take them out.</div></div><hr />
