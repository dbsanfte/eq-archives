<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So we've been debating how good/bad the changes in Ikkinz are. Most people have said that they hate the change, but not many alternatives have been posted.. So......<br />
<br />
I started thinking about how they could retune the encounter so that, warriors could keep defensive, yet still have knights be able to tank the boss. I thought about the &quot;raid encounters&quot; that knights can tank, and had this idea.<br />
<br />
When a Knight is in a group when the expedition is created, it creates a named that has a chromatic resist fear proc every tick. This would make a warrior fairly useless because - we can still be feared, whereas Knights are immune. It would make a warrior a poor choice to tank that version. If there are no knights in the group, then we you get the pre-patch version. Warriors can then useless defensive to tank in their version, which would be too difficult for a knight to tank, and the knight version would have an effect which would be too difficult for a warrior to tank.<br />
<br />
That's my first idea. What are yours? <br />
<br />
Please keep this thread to *ideas only* - leave the debating of the change to the other thread please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having different versions based on what tank is in the group was stongly disapproved by the playerbase when asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps a heavy single target endurance dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I understood the problem was that the knights didnt want a &quot;kiddies&quot; version of tipt/ikkinz. The idea here is to create an alternative version that would be just as difficult for a warrior to tank, and in fact make knights a preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Perhaps they could make the boss mob challanging to Knights (and therefore fairly trivial to Warirors) while mobs on the way gate, need to be snared, tend to pull two at a time, etc. A trial is not just the boss mob. One trial (Vxed?, I forget) doesn't even have a boss mob.<br />
<br />
It's silly to design a trial where Knight advantages and Warior advantages aren't fairly balanced.<br />
<br />
And we do have two versions of the trials right now. In one, Knights have the same use as everywhere else of their capabilities, In the second, Warriors lose a class defining ability.<br />

<br />
you understand we don't want to ride the short bus through the trial, but you don't care your going to propose we do anyway?<br />
<br />
this idea was thought up, rejected by everybody.<br />
<br />
the trial is fixed now, sucks that you guys got nerfed in it, but you were unwilling to compromise..<br />
<br />
2 kids sitting in the sand box, we got a stick, you guys had a pail...we asked for a smaller pail so we can play in the sand too...you guys refused to share, so the grown-ups took away your pail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree battleblade. Since warriors don't bring crud to the fight up to the boss, who cares if it's easier to tank it as a warrior? Thats all we're good for, so if we can make it there, it OUGHT to be easier. <br />
<br />
Heck, make more of the trash stunnable (AND FEARABLE or something for the sk's) if getting through is too tough for knights. As I see it in a 2+ hour trial with repops behind, etc, knight utility is pretty valuable anyway. Given they tend to tank lower level stuff very well, they are probably at an advantage as it stands anyway. I know my 8kish warrior ass gets handed to me nasty style by the trash even with cleric+shammy heals and fast slows, so it's not as if gimps are just gonna start sailing through without some serious effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you understand we don't want to ride the short bus through the trial, but you don't care your going to propose we do anyway?<br />
<br />
The thing is ari, now everyone has the short bus version. The named doesnt churn out the same DPS he once did. So you got it anyway - as well as asking for a nerf. The single greatest thing that pisses warriors off, is that paladins wanted defensive (&quot;defensive lite&quot; shall we say) but without giving anything up  - all for essentially two encounters. The kid who represents the knight in your anecdote wouldn't give up his stick to get the smaller pail.<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the main purpose.....I'm suggesting that there must be a way to keep the level of difficulty challenging for all *without nerfs*. Remember how Sony says that they can't possibly test for all bugs, because there's far more users than there are testers? Well, there's far more of us than there are deveopers, and I'm sure there's some people who can come up with alternatives that sony haven't thought of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We fling out ideas like a shotgun. With so many ideas, one is bound to stick. But frankly it doesn't much matter. I'm certain developers and designers when confronted with a situation like this list all of the possible fixes, the pluses and minuses of each, ease of implimentation, do an informal poll, and decide a course of action.<br />
<br />
We can suggest, in case we think of something that might not occur to them (there are a lot of us - a bigger group mind) and we can react when they do something we don't like.<br />
<br />
To be certain Paladins would be happy with the so-called Baby Trials advance notice was given. Given a negative reaction they were scrapped. To avoid Warriors having a say, they just implimented the 2 trial Defensive nerf without prior notice.<br />
<br />
I'll give you a good example of how powerless players are -<br />
<br />
SoE, please no more one-group content unless you embrace a philosphy that the challange is what it is and should only be adjusted if a class flat out can't do it. All four tanks don't have to MT all one-group content equally well as long as there is a variety of challange types, ways of meeting challanges,  and no one-group content is needed for flags.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They should just leave it like it is, except for 1 thing.  Anytime a Knight uses a spell in those trials an AE Deathtouch should go off, that seems fair to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;snip&gt;<br />

Posts like this really tick me off.  Screw you too Ariakkas.<br />
<br />
edit:  I have nothing against knights in general and if you look at my posts I have even supported potentially giving them some kind of short term mitigation ability, boosting the spell book, or doing something to make the classes (all classes) more enjoyable to play.  My comment was directed entirely at Ariakkas's comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ariakkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i agree, we're all on the shortbus now, but at least we're ALL on the shortbus.<br />
<br />
it's not like we're riding on the shortbus and warriors ride in the limo anymore.<br />
<br />
i didn't ask for warriors to be nerfed, and neither did any other knights, but you guys were unwilling to accept *anything* that was proposed. IMO, you guys got yourself nerfed.<br />
<br />
add to it the fact that some people predicted this months ago, and i do find it hilarious.<br />
<br />
and only now after you guys got nerfed are you willing to try and work out a solution to unnerf yourselfs, and i gotta say, thats pretty funny too.<br />
<br />
but in seriousness, i think it should jsut be left alone, we don't have any sort of advantage over warriors what-so-ever. you guys can expend all this energy on teaming up with SK's to defeat the evil power hungry paladins who only want to take over the world...~~growl!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, since you and others were determined that either Defensive was nerfed or Knights shared it, I hope y'all have a great time in two zones that only EP players are going to be frequenting because PoTime+ players have been done with them for months.<br />
<br />
Going to work on getting named Sand Giants to drain endurance next?<br />

That's true but there seems to always be someone coming back from inactivity who needs a flag here and there.  <br />
<br />
I find tipt harder than the ikkinz single group trials (with the exception of #2's double bosses).  Seems like an unnecessary reverse bottleneck especially since tipt is required by everyone for KT access while ikkinz 1-3 only needs 1 person to get thru it to request raids.  Since KT isn't entirely a 'raid zone' (ppl exp there), it should stand to reason that it's not as hard to get thru Tipt than Ikkinz, because logically you'd think that primarily only people interested in raiding (or a well-geared group in search of loot who don't mind the risk of a +end aug dropping after a lot of work) would be keen to complete all 3 of them.<br />
<br />
On one hand we have the knights gloating that defensive has been taken away, yet it's counterproductive because to progress in the game people need to work together.  Then again, these gloating folks are probably nonraiders who bitterly compete for slots in PoV.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />
