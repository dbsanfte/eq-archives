<br />
I asked someone online in the game and they replied with something about our triple attack at 60th increasing to a quad attack with the primary hand at some point between 61-65.. someone else mentioned our Strength cap lifts 5 per level and stacks with the planar AA skill that lets it go higher.<br />
<br />
Can anyone comment on this or list everything we gain from 61-65? I am a 60th Dark Elf Warrior, on Firona Vie and not in a -uber- guild or anything so im wondering if I should stay 60th for the time being and EXP in what rare groups I find or continue on to 65 which I assume would limit where I can go by alot.<br />
<br />
Thanks. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
All stat caps increase at a rate of 5 per level 61-65.<br />
<br />
Your damage bonuses go up - it goes from 11 to 13 for 1h, 2h bonuses go up as well, but I didn't really track those (since they're dependant on weapon delay).<br />
<br />
You don't get an innate quad attack... though you can potentially quad with a 2h and Punishing Blade AA (or potentially hit 6x with PB and Flurry)<br />
<br />
Leveling opens up some AAs which you can't get at level 60 or even level 64.<br />
<br />
Levels really are &gt; all. That's not a myth. Take an identical geared/AAed/etc level 60 and level 65 warrior, the level 65 warrior will own the level 60 at both taking and dishing out damage.<br />
<br />
*However*, it may be beneficial for some people to stay at level 60 and AAexp/plat/gear farm for awhile (people who have leveled beyond their gear - ie level 60 warriors with 3k even or less hps). One added benefit of level to 65 is tier2+ AAexp is well... damn uber compared to how AA exp was in the Luclin era, but you really have to be up to par gear wise to take the beating from mobs that often hit for 550+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My equipment is below average for my level.. I have maybe 1140ac or something like that, but then again I am on Firona Vie with the trivial loot code so that does not make farming items for money to get upgrades very easy.... and since a low green monster beats me up when soloing its a little tricky. *grin*<br />

I think I will continue on to 65... ! ;)</div></div><hr />

PoP was great for melee.  I had the first level 65 wizard and 2nd level 65 warrior on my server, and I certainly don't feel my wizard got more from this expansion than my warrior.  If anything it was the other way around.  Of course it probably helped knights a little too much...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before PoP, everyone was killing low dark blues for the best exp.  The exp change might have occured a few weeks before PoP, but PoP was the reason for it.  That did more for warriors and clerics than anything.<br />
<br />
A few weeks into PoP, we were doing the AoW with 3 groups due to in large part to the AC cap removal.  People think (or used to anyway) that mob atk in PoP was low, but in fact its because of AC.  A warrior's job is to tank, and my ability to tank went up a great deal.<br />
<br />
You must also consider the equipment dropped.  My BoW upgraded my DPS a shit load.  My warrior outdamages my wizard in most of my exp groups.  Melee dps makes for the best exp groups now a days, not AoE groups like in Luclin, (save for very few exceptions) and not caster dps.  This is true only in high uptime groups, but if your group is good, you'll have high uptime.<br />
<br />
Of course Sony also put knight on just about every damn piece of gear we use, so the gap between knight and warrior in terms of hp, ac, and dps went to absolute shit...  But thats us vs. knights, not us vs. casters.</div></div><hr />

Then your wizard is not casting any spells at all during those groups, because there is no other explanation for the warrior to be doing more DPS than your wizard.  Because if your wizard was actually casting spells it would not take much to out dps the warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The highest Wizard nukes are 2000-2400 with a 7-8 second cast.  That's nearly 300 dps.  The mana is 500-530 per cast that's 70ish mana per second.  With FT 15 / BOT9 / C5 / Self buffed / MC3 is close to 55ish mana per tick standing no horse.<br />
<br />
A wizard with spell casting haste, mana pres, nuke furry, and scm3 can easily sustain a higher DPS then a warrior, no questions asked.  <br />
<br />
Wether the warrior can keep agro is a different forum topic tho :P<br />
<br />
/gets back on topic<br />
<br />
But ...<br />
<br />
The question was &quot;if I should stay 60th for the time being&quot;<br />
<br />
The question has been asked an answered a thousands times by high end folks and non high end folks. <br />
<br />
The answer is not easy.  <br />
<br />
The gain of 65 vs lvl 59 mobs is incredible.  If you fight mobs that are 58-61 then get lvl 65.  If you fight mobs lvl 51-56 then IMHO the AA exp gained at 60 &gt; being 65 vs those lvl mobs.<br />
<br />
Determine were you fight, what lvl mobs they are and wether you want AA first.  If you want to go fight in PoP (mobs 58-61 normally) then get 65 asap.  If you enjoy the older zones were mobs are generally alot lower, then you will get alot more AA exp.<br />
<br />
This is just my 2cp</div></div><hr />

I can assure you that I've outdamaged the best time equipped wizard in my guild in exp groups with a non-time weapon. (BoW)  Wizards do not have infinate mana.  Fight with 90% uptime for longer periods of time and you'll see what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Believe it or not, a wizard using Imp Dmg IV, Iceflame of E'ci (a self focus buff) and level 60 cold nukes can sustain DPS longer than those level 65 nukes (Strike of Solusek, 2740 dmg for 650 mana) people point to as being over powered.</div></div><hr />

You can also be choosie about the classes in your group such as having both a shaman and cleric.<br />

In addition, try to put your own groups together and try to play at set times.  You will collect friends that will ask you to group if you have had a good group with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Woah, wait a second there.<br />
<br />
You're mixing up your expansions, imo.<br />
<br />
XP changes that debuted before the planes of power was released directly affected classes that could solo in a far more positive way than classes forced to group.<br />
<br />
The nature of the expansion, also, with the higher damage output of the mobs forced the classes forced to group into even smaller boxes.<br />
<br />
While classes that could solo sort of went nuts (i.e. Bards maxxing out their entire AA board in a short period of time using Halls of Honor swarm kites or running rampant in Valor, or Enchanters using charm to take out nameds in BoT for great XP and at the time rare, expensive tradable loot).<br />
<br />
The XP change I'm referring to was the shift from bottom feeding on blues to killing high blues, even cons and yellows/reds for BETTER XP gain.<br />
<br />
It was just recently, as in BEFORE LDoN went live, when the actually BENEFICIAL XP change was put into place ... the nerfing of solo XP rate, and the increase in GROUPED XP rate.<br />
<br />
This finally completed the task of making groups more desirable.<br />
<br />
Be careful. Try and keep the timelines straight. When PoP debuted, and for its first 3 to 4 months, solo classes, like wizards kiting in Tier 2 and beyond, had a huge advantage over warriors, who needed the other two members of the holy trinity to even engage mob in PoP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XCrovax</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a wizzy and a warrior.  The warrior isnt expected to do big damage, its not his job. So I hope that the following doesn't come off as a bash on warriors but as a defense for Wizzies.  <br />
<br />
I am sorry but there will never be a day in hell cold enuff to allow a warrior to outdamage a wizzy given a bunch of equals (65th level, aa, gear, etc).  Lets keep in mind that not only can we drop a single nuke for well over 3k but that nuke will crit one in 5 shots hitting for over 6k.  I guarantee if the wizzy crits even once any warrior will be hard pressed to even hit a fraction of his dps.  And folks saying that a wizzy will go oom on any kind of uptime is ridiculous.  A wizzy gets 2 Harvests, a Flappy, and a force skin that all have very nice mana regen.  They are also likely getting outside mana (Kei, Mod Rod, BstCrk, 9, bard song).  Assuming high end they also likely have fairly good FT and a mount.  At 65 with 100+aa and bazaar purchased gear I can honestly say I cant remember the last time I went oom on my wizzy unless there was a rez involved.  And believe me when I say his reputation is sound as a DPS machine.<br />
<br />
But the topic is AA or level.  I think level.  Because once you hit 65 the AA will come much faster.  If it takes you 5 hours of grind for 1 AA at 60, it will take 3 hours for AA at 65.  So basically its more efficient to level first imo.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Levels &gt; AA IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply because when you are lfg no one asks you how many AA you have.<br />
<br />
Whether its actually the most efficient path for tanking I do not know though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're mixing up your expansions, imo.

<br />
No, I'm not.  The exp change just before PoP went live made Veeshan's Peak the best exp spot in the game.  This made warriors/tanks/clerics much more valued than before.  IMO this change was the best thing to happen to EQ in years.<br />
<br />
Wizards may have had a fun time in Valor and Tactics for awhile, but that was quickly nerfed.  The demand for my warrior skyrocketed after PoP, to tank quad 650 hitters.  Later everyone wanted me to tank quad 980 hitters in fire.  Meanwhile the wizards in my guild can't get a group to save their lives.  The 17 minute caster solo AAs thing is a myth.<br />
<br />
Btw, if your wizards arn't going OOM in exp groups, then your groups have very poor uptime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XCrovax</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, lets try this again.  I have a 65 wizzy with 103aa who is rather well off yet far from Uber.  Not even elem flagged.  He ranks somewhere in the top 50 or so on server according to EQ rankings.  So please bear in mind that a better equipped/guilded wizzy will have my advantages and then some.  I have at my disposal a green flappy, forceshield, 2 harvests, MP3, ID4, SH3, SCM3, SCF3, SCFM3, FT8, mount, and a mana pool of somewhere shy of 5k.  He seldom goes anywhere without VoQ and he quite often is buffed with SD, Pot9, and/or holding a mod rod.  He will also quite often find himself grouping with Bards and/or Necro's for obvious reasons.  Note:  I also have a mana robe but haven't had much use for it lately so its irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Lets assume an LDoN adventure (normal). Nothing shy of a named will ever see me hit it with 2 SoS (Strike of Solusek).  The first SoS (non crit) will take the trash mob to less then 50% so I can usually finish off with something no bigger then a draught.  1 in 5 of those SoS shots will crit and take the mob down to approx 35% making it possible for me to basically sit out the rest of the fight.  The nameds are a bit more costly but I can usually get away with casting no more then 8 spells on any named I have ever encountered.  Now with this in mind it is damn near impossible for me to get lower then 50% while fighting the trash mobs.  The nameds may get me as low as 20-30% but a few harvests and I am back up to 50% and GTG.  Very few of these adv's last for more then 45 minutes.  Not spectacular but still pretty good as far as uptime is concerned.<br />
<br />
Now lets assume something more of an xp grind like say 1 of the BoT camps.  I might have to let loose as many as 2-4 SoS (depending on crits) and a random concussion.  But again, I will show up as buffed as possible and have access to my own mana regen (including my mount) which is considerable.  I have yet to be in a BoT camp where my mana didn't outlast the clerics or chanters.  9 times out of 10 if I get a med break its because someone else in the group called it.  In this scenario I can grind out an AA every 2 hours or so.  Not spectacular but still pretty good as far as uptime is concerned.<br />
<br />
Now there are places I have never been (LDoN - hard, elements, time) where mana may become an issue again.  There are mobs that can drain my mana.  There are bad pulls where it becomes neccessary to dump my mana pool.  And there is that terrible empty feeling after a rez (aa flappy and aa harvest helps).  But as you can see any moderately geared 65 Wizzy with a decent amount of aa, who knows how to play his class, should seldom find himself OOM under normal grouping conditions. <br />
<br />
Heh, kk so I am passionate about my wizzy.  But just think, I am playing a war now!!  Wait until I see them damned wizzies talking bad about warriors over at Graffe'.  :p <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix EnObelix</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not a matter of going OOM, it's a matter of what you can sustain over a long period of time.  If you have 100% uptime, then a caster's mana output is basically limited by his mana regen.<br />
<br />
Using your numbers though, we're looking at a mob having 20k hp.  3k puts it at 50%, 6k at 35%, which, which means a starting point of 65% when the nuke hits, 5% = 1k of damage, so 20k hp.  Some have a bit more, of course, the charmable mobs in particular.<br />
<br />
With a crit nuke, you're doing 6k, 20% of the time.  With a non-crit, you're doing 3k + 1100 or so, 80% of the time.  So 4480 on average.  4480/20000 is 22.4%.<br />
<br />
And how much sustained DPS are you doing, if you had no downtime?  Average time from killing one mob to killing the next, from adventure start to finish...<br />
Kill per 60 seconds: 75 DPS.<br />
Kill per 45 seconds: 100 DPS.<br />
Kill per 30 seconds: 150 DPS.<br />
Kill per 20 seconds: 224 DPS.<br />
<br />
In most pick up groups, I've found that 30-45 seconds per kill is about the norm.    Assuming you fall into that category, taking 30-45 minutes for a slaughter 60...<br />
<br />
100-150 DPS, just 22.4% of the damage contributed by you, out of 6 people, 2 of whom are likely to be support classes, 1 of whom is a tank, in front of the mob.  Not exactly the percent one would expect from a supposed DPS class.<br />
<br />
In a group with low downtime in LDoN, give me melees and pet classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XCrovax</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, you are about right on the money when you say in LDoN I am dropping about 150 dps (maybe less, maybe more) overall but keep in mind its not possible for me to drop out more using the same spells because the mob is dead before an additional nuke hits.  Bare minimum its hp is so low that a big % of my damage is wasted into negative hp.  Now 150 is low in comparison to the 200 that most high end wizzies are looking to achieve.  It is possible for me to up my DPS but its done in a way that I dont really care for.  Max sustained DPS by a wizzy is achieved through constant draughts, very low mana to damage ratio.  But draughts don't put up the big numbers that SoS does and I made a wizzy to blow stuff up.   My greatest pleasure in life when I play the wizzy is to imagine my non wizardly counterparts pissing they pants when they see me hit for 6k.  Now my burst dps on the other hand, say for example on a named is much higher.  Its very likely that I am doing well over half the mobs hp all by me lonesome.  And depending on how many names show up in any given adv my sustained dps should show a noticeable increase.  Also, there is the xp grind example where the mobs generally have much more hp and it gives me the freedom to really let go.<br />
<br />
Now that being said my wizzy is still experiencing near 100% uptime while keeping my mana within 30-50%.  Were I to switch to the draught line I would sustain a higher DPS over long periods but I would also most likely be spending more mana overall and regenerating less due to lack of sit time.<br />
<br />
Thanks much for doing the numbers though.  Thats one aspect of the game that I would just assume not know how to do.  :) <br />

Which is why the change was far better for soloists than it was for warriors and clerics and the like. The changes were only HALF done.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizards may have had a fun time in Valor and Tactics for awhile, but that was quickly nerfed.&quot;<br />
<br />
If by quickly nerfed you mean, left to linger for months on end, while the elite few who had the flags and access to the zones racked up obese amounts of AAs, then yeah, it got nerfed real quick.<br />
<br />
&quot;The demand for my warrior skyrocketed after PoP, to tank quad 650 hitters. Later everyone wanted me to tank quad 980 hitters in fire. Meanwhile the wizards in my guild can't get a group to save their lives. The 17 minute caster solo AAs thing is a myth.&quot;<br />
<br />
The 17 minute caster solo AA may be a myth. But the 30 to 35 minute caster solo AA is not. And that seriously outdid the rate of XP that most groups could muster.<br />
<br />
Casters could even solo parts of the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
The playing field was far from level, until SOE finally went in and made group XP bonuses and NERFED solo XP.<br />
<br />
Then the job was complete.<br />
<br />
But this didn't happen until right before the release of LDoN.<br />
<br />
Which makes sense since LDoN is the group centric expansion, and to drum up more interest in the expansion, they had to shift the game dynamic back towards grouping.</div></div><hr />
