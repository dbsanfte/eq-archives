<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackmoonx</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just picked up a DBotW+anger3 aug (guilds first) and was contemplating picking up one of the Furious Blow 7 shields out there. Shield of Strife or the GoD FB7 shield. And was wondering if anyone knew how well it would hold agro?<br />
<br />
Seems to have a definite advantage over 2h weapons with more AC and HPs and an advantage over duel wielding because of less riposte damage.<br />
<br />
Comments? Or know where I can find data?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious Bash is ass, right now.  Bash produces negligible aggro by itself.  Enhancing 1-2 by seventy percent doesn't make it 400.... it makes it 2-3 if you're lucky.<br />
<br />
That's a mild exaggeration.  A FB7 enhanced bash produces about the same aggro as a single non-proccing swing from a Darkblade.<br />
<br />
In situations where you aren't competing with any DPS classes, it's a decent combo.  Any time you will be the ONLY person on the mob for a substantial amount of time, it's fine.  It'll out-aggro a chain, no problem.  It wont out-aggro that monk over there, or that rogue who skipped one Evade... or that paladin sitting in the corner who just sneezed, and hasn't turned on attack yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are quite useful.  Less so now that /shield has been 'fixed' so it doesn't work when either person is using a disc.  But shields are still useful.  I only have an AoE, but I use it a lot and with DBotW+Anger3 I can hold aggro just fine.  Sometimes if I'm worried, I'll start out the fight with a 2h or dual wield and then swap in shield.<br />
<br />
FB doesn't really do much of anything, but DBotW aggro is just so good that you don't need another source of aggro in many/most situations.<br />
<br />
Just last night I tanked Bertox and RZ with shield and in the past I've tanked most all of Time w/ shield on np.  The only one that I really still use 2h on is TZ because of the slow and needing as much aggro as possible.<br />
<br />
Like the last post said, they are best for when off tanking (tanking adds) since you can hold aggro just fine with it and likely are only going to get patch heals or druid heals etc, and the extra AC/HPs helps.  Which makes it really useful for Tier 1 Time.<br />
<br />
I don't have a Raex BP, so I figure tanking w/ a shield will be even better once I get that.<br />
<br />
Should mention that I also use SoPM.  No VoT tho, we have no SKs in guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd wager an augged DBOTWL + Shield + Spell Proc (SarynRange/AHR Gloves) would be a pretty viable combination now with WA5 + Incite (Yes  I know WA5 doesnt effect Spell Procs) and the added AC (and lesser Degree HP) would be a definate bonus....<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I have no real experience with this combo, but from posts on this board, pre WA5, I think it was Furor who said that DBOTWL+ SHield is about equal to augged BoW aggro?... And that was pre Incite/WA5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the combo just fine in the situations I use it. Once you've got agro lock, you won't lose agro unless it's to another retard Warrior with agro weapons out.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I have Anger III, Anger, Call of Fire and Raex Chestplate firing when I have my shield equipped. I am always Voice of Thuled.<br />
<br />
The agro is nowhere near as good as when I am dual wielding my Dbotw and EoE though. Not even close.<br />
<br />
Edit: When tanking some big shit, I quite often use dual weild to build massive agro until defensive/stonewall fades, then I switch in shield.</div></div><hr />

one person needs trial 7-9 of kod taz completed to activate it for your raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kurghann</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think we all agree to say that shield isn t aggro as much as dual wield BUT ... shield is less riposte tho SO MIGHT be a good off hand in situations when your main hand only will be enough to hold aggro ( if you have a DBoW or so aug is about the same as having an ok 2 hander bow or sews )  then shield will add ac hp effect it can have and so on and is fine . <br />
i don t see shields as a bonus to aggro but a good way to get less ripostes and more ac hp than usin a 2 hander in some situations when you are 100 % sure that you r main  hand will be enough aggro ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackmoonx</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice guys. I will probably start tanking with a 2nd ragex2 weapon at the start of the fight and switch to shield quickly after building agro.<br />
<br />
As far as that pally in the corner.....he is gonna crap a brick when I start bidding on his shield. *evil grin*<br />

<br />
SK will gain DPS (needed)<br />
Pal will gain DPS (needed)<br />
Wars will gain Agro (Tradeoff for lost DPS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charnondall</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest in my opinion, having a shield available while having a Darkblade is priceless. I've got WA 5 and Anger 3 auged on my darkblade and in time I use it mainly for tanking like Inny / RZ / Quarm. After say a min or so of dual wielding with DB/Eoe I have proc'd enough and built enough general aggro to freely switch to shield. <br />
Not to say that the shield needs this initial build-up of dual wield procs to hold aggro sufficiently, as the Aug'd Darkblade on its own along with WA/Combat Effects/Incite has enough potential to hold aggro on these mobs np itself with the shield.</div></div><hr />
