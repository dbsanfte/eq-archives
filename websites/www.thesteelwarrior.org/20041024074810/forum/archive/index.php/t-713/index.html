<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im in the midst of doing my epic and figure i need to line up a raid to try and get my fear ball next.<br />
<br />
I was wondering - my guild is mainly 60-63 atm, so whats the minimum safe force needed to get to the golems?<br />
<br />
Also, does one need to clear the whole of fear before you can get to the golems or once youve broken in, can you head just straight to them. If so, roughly how long from breaking in does it take to get to them? as i need to work out the best day to do the raid.<br />
<br />
Drop rate wise - assuming all 3 are up, ive read posts where it said the ball doesnt always drop off them, although im not sure whether its classed as common or uncommon. Is it likely that ill have to do fear a few times before i get it? how many times did you guys go before you saw a drop.<br />
<br />
Similarly, i also need my blade from Plane of sky. I was wondering - assuming 24 peeps of 60+, how long do i need to time to get to the island? can it be done in one longish session of say about 5-6 hours or will we need 2 days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont have a ton of time for this one but.....<br />
<br />
1. Minimum force to get to the golem = 4-6ish people, minimum people to kill the golem? 9-12ish people? (You cant really head straight to the golems or you are risking some major adds during the fight. You must clear there) AE groups are fastest, but if you are doing really well, call it an hour per trip to the golem.<br />
<br />
2. The golem ball can be a pain. I would say on average you get one for every 5 golems or so. (in my experience)<br />
<br />
3. 5-6 hours in Sky CAN get you there, but if it is your first time or have not done the loop before, your people will most likely want to never see Sky again by the time you get past horses (Island before Lord) There is an artificial time block built into island 4 anyway where you have to wait an hour after the trigger horse is killed to get the Boss Mob to spawn Sirran and move on...<br />
<br />
People will like you better if you let them camp after Horsie island (Just my opinion)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kahomn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just my 2cp on fear, we did fear last night and you have to spend alittle time on clearing the way to Fright, Clearing the scarlings, and Frightfinger towers and most of the shivarbacks... If you go in with 3 groups and have each group take a mob and mez/stun the rest of the pulls, you can easily pull fright under an hour.... we cleared the entire plane in under 3 hours with 30 people (avg raid level was 62) including 4 minis (fright,dread,terror and dracolich) and got 2 slime bloods and 2 balls of everling golem.   Best we found is to send out 3 bards and get agro and bring what they can back and we deal with it....a few times we had to send the rangers to get the DT victims but didn't slow us down... since the rangers brought trains back with them.  <br />
If your groups are 60+ in level, this is gonna be easy aslong as everyone assists and don't kill off the enchanters. Let the enchanters finish thier casting then taunt.. i have seen too many enchanter get the thing mezzed and brokened without a taunt because everyone is hyped with all the killing going on....<br />
<br />
As for sky, I haven't seen may guilds (on my server) get to Spiroc island in one night... just alot of energy is used to get through the horses, like Jakle says... your just too exhausted to clear another island and take the DTs over and over again to get 1-2 blades for all that trouble. Plan for a weekend where you can camp and come back and be refreshed, farm a few blades so you won't have to come back in the very near future (you may or may not get the support from the key classes, people can make themselves scarce) and its a good funding item to pay for raiding fundings like dots, plane stones, and the inevitable coffin run.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for the info. another guild is actually building a bridge to 5th island so i think i can skip that whole clearing thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Howdy all.. I'm also looking for information on PoA/S as well, as the Spiroc Wingblade is the last piece I need for my epic.  Allakhazam's is somewhat thin on info for here, EQ Atlas had zip, and I haven't been able to find a lot of info on it.  Could anyone possibly point me out to any walk-throughs that are available ?  It would be greatly appreciated !  Also... I've heard about what the poster above me said; something about using a &quot;bridge&quot; to the Spiroc Isle, by having a necro tag along with someone else's raid, and then camp out ??  My question is, what class/lvl of char is needed for that ?  Getting my guild together for a minimum of 4-5 hours, just to get my epic piece, would be pretty tough I think.  If I can do something to minimize that time, it would be awesome.<br />
<br />
Thanks much :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are some great guides around to Plane of Sky. Aadawens (http://members.cohesive.net/~rtaylor/EQ/skyguide/)  is one Catranizi's (http://www.geocities.com/lordhong/sky.htm) is another.<br />
<br />
Using a Bridge requires a class that can summon corpses, Necro or SK with them being able to use the small coffins as a bonus, and someone who can Rez, camped out in a non aggro spot on one of the islands. The general strategy used is to log them in, port the raid to Isle 1, use an Eye to get a target on the Isle they are on somehow and group them with someone on Isle 1. Or alternate is to have them duel, cleric kill Necro, wizard meet necro at his bind, group together, then cleric rezzes necro back.<br />
<br />
Now ya have the bridge. Next you invite folks to the bridge group one at a time, have them attack the Key master on Isle one and die. Dueling on first Isle can cause wierd aggro sometimes, and duel corpses have a real short re rez time. Then they get rezzed back to Isle 1, corpse gets summoned, get a second rez and they are there. Do the whole raid that way, being sure to leave 2 clerics on Isle one till last so they can rez each other back, and ya just saved a day or two of raiding the way there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks muchly! :) I've just been spending some time reading thru <br />
Aadawen's guide, and it seems quite thorough.  And thanks for the explanation of bridging !  Just trying to get it all figured out in my mind.<br />
<br />
-edit- Ok, I THINK I have the bridging figured out.  So you need either a necro/SK AND a cleric camped out on your target isle, or just a necro who can summon, with an essence emerald to rez a cleric, something like that ?<br />
<br />
-2nd edit- If say I had a necro camped out on isle 5, would it be very difficult  to get an eye over to that isle from isle 1, to get the necro grouped ?  Or is it not too bad ?<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />
<br />
Zito</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We always used a necro with small coffins and essence emeralds, and any miscellaneous alt that was level 46 or higher.  The necro, camped on spiroc island with the alt,  would group with the alt...the alt would jump and group up a wizard and a couple clerics, etc..and then that group would port up to PoS.<br />
<br />
Once there, a cleric would duel die, get rezzed..get summoned to island the necro is on and then be necro rezzed.  After that you just did the same for the rest of your raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As for the eyes, I wouldnt even know how to run em, im a warrior :)   But twice recently we have had Mages manage to target one of the Bees on Bee Isle, then bind sight it and use that to target the SK camped up there. If I remember right, focus items to make the eyes last longer, and SoW on the eyes may help.<br />
<br />
Now if I just hadnt got the wrong Bee targeted when they aggroed early on me, then when the first Bixie popped tried having it offtanked and taking out a second string of them for more keys, we would a got to Drake Isle for the much wanted Mage crowns. I just hate them days when everything seems to go from bad to worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">aaaaaaaack yup I hate those days !   Sorry to hear about your bad luck up there.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info, I think I have this more or less figured out; now just have to get a bunch of ppl talked into going, and we'll see what happens, see if I can't finally finish my epic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldnt do golems with less then 2 groups only cause 1 AEs 1 or 2 DT every 30 sec and stuff<br />
<br />
As for Air I hate this zone with pation. Would take about 6 - 7 hours to get to spiroc I'd think</div></div><hr />
