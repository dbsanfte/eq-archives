I got sent to China 4 months ago for work and can't play anymore but don't want my toon to die. I cancelled billing before I left, anyone know how long SOE gives you till they wipe all your characters from the server?<br />

<br />
they *claim* chars are deleted, but i think its more of a scare tactic than anything. to be safe i'd have a relative register a card if its more than 3 months</div></div><hr />

The 3 month period is just a &quot;cover their arse&quot; policy in case they needed to make room on the servers, imo.</div></div><hr />

I quit EQ once for 13 months once.  Came back, all characters intact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">soe has only wiped level 1 characters that have been unused for Long periods of time only once or twice.<br />
<br />
<br />
in other words  yer level 70 tricked out character will be untouched forever.   so long as eq exists.<br />
<br />
unless at sometime after i make this post soe makes some policy changes.   which i doubt  being that the cost of storing the information for 100 years has allready been paid many times over by getting that character to level whatever.</div></div><hr />

I cut off the billing for a year once and came back with chars intact.  They can if they want but i don't think have ever done it really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A while ago (probably a couple years) some SoE type posted that they had never deleted a character higher than level 1.  This could have changed, and they do only guarantee them for 3 months or whatever, but it is reasonably safe to assume that no matter how long ago you canceled your account your characters will be there.  It sorta makes sense, hard drive space is cheap, and people will be much more likely to come back to your game if they know that their characters are still there than if they have to start over from scratch.</div></div><hr />
