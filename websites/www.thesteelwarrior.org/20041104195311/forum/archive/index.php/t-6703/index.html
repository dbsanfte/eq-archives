<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I was doing some serious reading in the library and &quot;warrior soul searching&quot; (what weapons do I wield that most scream out -me-?) and I noticed that weapons with +magic damage and the like drew aggro as if it was actual weapon damage. <br />
<br />
Some other discussion was given towards bane weapons, but no conclusion was given to whether or not that bane damage would apply to mobs that aren't affected by it in aggro terms alone.<br />
<br />
Would a Thelin's Dagger draw the same aggro as a 16/19 LDoN 1Hs'er? Or does the game actually distinguish the aggro from the bane portion? I would think it does, but seemingly because the damage and aggro are on entirely different formulas, with the aggro formula being seemingly based off just the numbers possible, it leaves me curious.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think the bane damage is even a factor until the pre-requisite is met.<br />
<br />
With Thelin's Dagger, unless you're beating on TT herself, it's basically a Lammy.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, even if it did count the bane damage for added aggro all the time, why not just use something with a proc?  CHoS &gt; Thelin's Dagger even with it's full ratio in terms of hate.</div></div><hr />
