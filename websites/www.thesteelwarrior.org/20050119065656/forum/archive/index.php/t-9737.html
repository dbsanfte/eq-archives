<br />
It has 36% haste<br />
<br />
Restrictions are: Head,back, range and waste.<br />
<br />
It fits type 3 slots.<br />
<br />
I don't know now what it will fit on...I have a royal Attendant bracer of Sand and tried that. It has a type 3 slot. I had figured it would work on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I screwed and need to sell back to merchant at a loss or is there some viable option I have available still? I have fairly decent equipment and am at about 9200hp buffed out. around 6750 unbuffed. Hoping I can find something that will work and not diversely affect my HP/AC.<br />
<br />
Please help, and any is very appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You can sell back augs for 3/4 of whatever they cost.  I know most people just go for the grey flesh belt to put it in if you wanna try that.</div></div><hr />

You'll have to buy some LDoN gear for the slot it is suppose to fit in.  Can't see your magelo, but buy the Nro Helm or something and through it in there.  That means grinding more points if you don't have any left :(.</div></div><hr />

Wrist slot isn't one of the restricted slots you can use.<br />
<br />
The few people I'm aware of that have augment haste, have it equipped in an LDoN bought belt.</div></div><hr />

I have Helmet of Rallos Zek so I wont be replacing that. What point level is that grey flesh belt? what camp is that purchased from?<br />
<br />
And the restrictions do say Waist, does'nt this mean, I cannot use on a belt?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any information.<br />
<br />
Right now I use a heavy rubicite girdle, and wasting alot of tribute for the 41% haste currently.</div></div><hr />

Here's where you can find a list of all the LDoN gear (http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi) which is buyable with AP(Adventure Points).<br />
<br />
The best belt in my opinion is the Foul-Smelling Gore Belt (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=43237) from Guk for 1492 points.  You could stick yer haste augment into it as well as two 10 ac augs from MM.  That would make it a 34ac belt with 36% haste.  I was wanting to go that route myself, but I'll probably go with one of the new OoW augs for 40% haste, as well as say +12 stamina or something else.  Here's a link to the OoW Augmentation Generator (http://plurpage.com/everquest/aug.php) I put in another thread.  Btw....these are all actual augments that can be made now with high JC, Smithing, and Poison or Potion making skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The restrictions on augments are the only slots it can be used in. So that augment can only be used in head, back, range and waste and only fits in slot 3 which is pretty much only ldon bought gear.</div></div><hr />

You can never put two of the same augment on the same item, if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />
