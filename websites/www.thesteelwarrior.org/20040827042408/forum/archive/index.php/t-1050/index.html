<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a curiosity post really, but is your warrior your main?<br />
<br />
If not, what is?<br />
<br />
Even if your Warrior is your main, do you play (or have) any alts?<br />
<br />
Donnel is my main, but I have EQ Attention Deficit Disorder, which explains why I only have a level 39 even though I have played since Dec 2000. <br />
<br />
My Alts:<br />
25 Chanter<br />
24 Monk<br />
22 Necro<br />
21 Cleric<br />
20 Shaman<br />
20 Rogue<br />
<br />
As you can see.... no hybrids, all three melees, and alot of casters. In fact, I deleted a 16 mage to make Donnel (Donnel is actually the last char that I have rolled, but he is now my main LOL)<br />
<br />
The Monk was my first character past level 10. The Cleric the first past 16, and the Chanter was the first to go past 23.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">62 Cleric is my main, my warrior is my alt. He's lvl 60. May seem wierd , but when i got burned out on cleric i wanted to make a melee with no spell casting ability at all. Grew to like the warrior a lot, so I got him to 60 :) Now I can pretty much fill in either role for my guild as needed, but recently we fell short of clerics so I can't play my war much lately :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My first character main was a ranger - this was pre kunark. Got stuck at level 7 couldnt progress past the trains in BB.<br />
<br />
Stopped playing EQ and started again in velious and started a druid. Got him up to about 40 which took a while, as this was in the hell level days. Couldnt see me taking him all the way to the end game and got tired of playing a caster. <br />
<br />
So decided on a warrior and haven't looked back since. I play him constantly, except when Im bored or cant find a group then ill go quad kite with my druid for a little bit. I think it helps to play some other classes as you get a feel for them and their abilities.<br />
<br />
A few months ago i decided to start a new twink project and made a rogue but got bored after getting him to 25. I dont know theres jsut something about just being pure melee damage and not having to tank pull etc which i found a bit limiting.</div></div><hr />

Due to balance issues that I've been annoyed with I only log in for raids now.  Personally I don't see much hope for warriors coming from SoE.

12 Necro(For those nights when its been group full of Ebayers after group full of Ebayers and ya just wanna kill something without wondering what n00b in the group is gonna pull the half the friggin zone on ya and get you killed.)<br />
<br />
My first char was a Ranger, he made it to 26 or 27.  Had a Pally who made it to 30.  A Rogue who dinged 12, died and undinged to 11 and got deleted mere minutes later.  Had a kitty Shaman that made it to 13 I think.  An Ogre Beastlord that got to lvl 12, dunno wtf I was thinkin' that day.  A Dark Elf SK who could barely(and I mean JUST barely) wear his newbie armor and a few bags before he was encumbered.  I think thats all of them.  The only classes/races I haven't tried are Mage, Troll, and Dorf.  But that could change some day....<br />

<br />

58 High Elf Cleric (1 aa)<br />
40 Halfling Druid<br />
<br />
On a side note, I actually played before we got our accounts on my friends account.  I started playing some at home on his account cause he had 2 accounts, and the wife started scowling at me.  Soo, I talked her into watching me play one night and after a few hours of her watching she got interested.  So I bought her an account and me one ( muahahahhaha) and she's been hooked every since then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">55 Warrior - Main, first character I made in 1999<br />
40 Shaman - Play when I get sick of grouping<br />
31 SK - Created when hybrids got boosted to near warrior combat ability and no xp bonus.<br />
25 Wizard - to get a feel for int casters<br />
25 Monk - to see that even post nerf they were still powerful :)<br />
27 Rogue - Just to get a feel for the opposite end of the melee aggro spectrum - IE, have it and dont want it, as opposed to my usual want it and dont have it :)<br />
<br />
I think if you at least play a variety of classes up to the mid twenties it helps you understand how you complement other classes abilities. (The rest you learn from teaching your daily clinic on aggro management to your pickup group) :P<br />

Loved the shaman and got him to about 25 then got bored and felt like trying a big race so made an Ogre warrior. Loved playing him so much the shaman was sitting at 29 for over a year.<br />
<br />
Then when War was 59 I got a second computer so transfered the shaman to a new acount and PL'd him to 39. Then started 2 boxing and though I still consider the war as my main, I usually run them both. <br />
<br />
Course it is discouraging some days that the shaman is always getting tells asking if he wants a group when he not even looking for one, usually in the upper tier planes that he isnt flagged for.</div></div><hr />

60 warrior, 61 shaman and a retired 60 necro that's been 60 since kunark.  He's my tradeskill bitch now due to the high INT and the dabbling I did in all tradeskills before I got real serious about the game.<br />
<br />
Even tho I 2 box the warrior and shaman now, I leveled them both up before I got a 2nd computer and transfered the shammy to a 2nd account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Erudite wizard at launch to level 14 or so, played in Misty (loved the run from Odus to Misty at L4!) for a bit and grouped with a ranger who just had this magic radar to find mobs...<br />
<br />
Ranger from 1 - 50 got discouraged at the post launch changes to other classes.  (I was MT for our xp group of warrior, ranger, wizard, druid, druid, druid because I had higher AC as the warrior was a prom queen loading down on stat gear while i went ac and hp)  Went on a Fire Giant raid and got no where fast till an enchanter showed up then did great till enchanter left and realized how powerful the enchanter was so...<br />
<br />
Enchanter from 1 - 50 pre Kunark, dinged 49 and had to go to fear to CC a break in, prolly most fun ever.  Got bored with the lack of content pre Kunark and left EQ...<br />
<br />
Cleric from 1 - 60 dualboxed with Enchanter 51 - 60 came back after Kunark and guild was short clerics so PLed one from 1 - 48 for a hate raid later that week.  Had a druid, enchanter, monk, and my cleric hydraed by myself :)  Eventually got bored again after hitting 60 and not much to do...<br />
<br />
Warrior PLed from 1 - 60 in mid Vellious as a tripple box (Warrior primary, Cleric 2ndary, Enchanter 3rd), kept that for awhile till moving to DAOC, moved back at time of Luclin and haven't quit since.  Stopped playing Enchanter 3 months ago except as an out of group buffer/nooker in xp groups.  May change that if the xp change goes in.<br />
<br />
I keep looking at a bard but realize I'd have to only single play to be good at it and not sure that eq can keep my interest as such... *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am prolly one of the only ppl here that has a warrior for both his main and major alt.  Knord was my first character, a barbarian warrior, created the Saturday before Velious went live.  I had a bunch of friends who were already in their 30's and 40's at the time, and my main goal was to level up as fast as I could so I could play with them, so I ended up doing most of my time in the big grind spots of the time, IE LoIO, DL, etc.  I caught them at around lvl 50, and I ended up passing most of them because I played so damn much lol.  Knord is now 65, with 21 AAs, and MT for a NToV-tier guild on Tribunal.<br />
<br />
Sslarr was created about 3 weeks after Knord was, when he was about lvl 8 or so.  I wanted to see Kunark zones, and Knord was too young to make the trip, so I made an Iksar.  Because at the time all I knew was warriors, that is what Sslarr became.  I never really played Sslarr much, off and on when I wanted a break from the higher game, got him to lvl 8 somehow.  About 9 months ago or so, a bunch of the same RL friends I had been trying to catch up to decided to make a twinks group night, the idea was to start at lvl 20 and hit the areas we all missed the first time around and lvl  at the same time.  When I came into the discussion the group had everything but a tank.  So, I got a PL for Sslarr from 8 to 20 (druid DS + fiends in Paludal = 12 lvls in 3 hours).  We've been playing pretty much every week, just one night a week since then, and we are all in the mid-40's now...Sslarr is half a yellow from 46.  He is insanely twinked, and I am using the lessons I learned from mistakes made with Knord to make Sslarr a better tank than Knord was at that lvl.  Now that he is approaching &quot;raid lvl&quot;, it's been useful to have him around, since I use him in places I can't use Knord for faction reasons (Knord is ally in Chardok, so Sslarr goes on royals raids, Knord is KoS to CoV thanks to NToV raids, so Sslarr can scout ToV/WW and be a CoH anchor).  I get funny looks and comments from ppl when I say I have a warrior alt, but I have a blast with Sslarr....plus I never really had a lot of luck with casters.  I have a 22 Necro that is a week younger than Sslarr, that I actually try to play on occasion, and a 13 Wizzy that I got spoiled on c3 and AEing in Oasis that I can't play otherwise at all.<br />

I have to be honest, i seem to enjoy playing my warr more than any other character, this is probably why my alts are so low and never get above lvl 20. :)</div></div><hr />

Kiya is my favorite character by far, however, it gets frustrating looking for group.  Because of that, I paid to move my then lvl 40 cleric on to a 2nd account and began to 2 box.  I've also been known to take Gam out for a spin by herself, and I'm not ashamed to say I'm a damn good cleric. =p  <br />
The druid is for when I'm feeling anti-social, tracking and general port bish duty.  The enchanter was an experiment, I'm still not sure what to think of it.  Same goes for the bard.  The beastlord is my current alt of choice when no groups are to be found.</div></div><hr />

Twinks:<br />
65 enchanter 15AA<br />
49 Monk<br />
47 Druid<br />
30 Cleric<br />
<br />
My warrior was my 3rd character created on current server(druid was first, enchanter 2nd) but has been my main pretty since that day - Druid was 20 and enc was 13 at the time.<br />
<br />
My enchanter I levelled up to 49 so I could enchant my own Adamantite cos back at the time a few pieces of the original smithed cultural would have been an upgrade for my warrior, ofcourse by the time I had the level and the smithing skill to attempt making armour there wasnt any I would have considered wearing.  Then once people settled into grouping in PoP and the cool kids (clerics and slowers) decided to invite knights to partys while warriors had to sit at the zone line and mind the LFG tag I would log to an alt after 30mins or so of LFG and found amazingly that enchanter get groups! like often before I'd even put LFG on or announced I was LFG.  So 3 months later I have a 65 enchanter with 30 days played.  Go figure.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse my warrior is still my main and always will be.  The groups are fewer and further between, but when you raid 90% of your online time and can almost always find something to help a guildie with the rest of the time, anything is better than the stand - tash - slow - sit combined with haste me - crack me that enchanters have been reduced to courtesy of charm nerf + single pull outdoor wonderland zones of PoP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>daoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">my official main is my 52 woody druid.<br />
<br />
ironically, i started the druid to dual box with my 19 necrognome.  this was pre-luclin when ports and transportation was a concern.  when i rolled the druid, my wife was looking over my shoulder and said she wanted to give it a try... so she made a highelf paladin.  the two of them (druid and paladin) pretty much duo'ed up to 52.  Sometime in the past, i had rolled my warrior as our guild was low on tankage (we actually had a 55 ranger tanking in kael one night....)  Well after takeing a couple of weeks off from eq, i decided to play the warrior.... did a level a day for a week in OT, currently he is in DL working on 42.<br />
