<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnawbone</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think my profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=478130) is still a little weak, but assuming I'm with a crew that knows what they are doing, can I tank some of the sewer trials in GoD?<br />
<br />
The people I play with generally are pretty intelligent about aggro control and I hydra my cleric well enough in Hard LDoNs that it is becoming pretty easy to breeze through those.<br />
<br />
Still, I don't want to be the gimp part of the group and we'll be completely inexperienced with the trials. Any other suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes with trouble, but my regular group gets by little by little.<br />
Take them one at a time and get the drops each provide, that way your group will be a little more ready for the next sewer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You *may* (depending on your group) want to look into getting some sort of aggro on your offhand -- some of the bosses hit somewhat hard, meaning your group is going to have to go all out on him (fast heals, chain nuking, etc).  You'll want a little bit more aggro than that (even something as simple as Ykesha/Anger augging your dagarn's tail, or getting a CHOS from Droga)<br />
<br />
Other than that, though, you look good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnawbone</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the CHoS for offhand in one of my bags (sorry Magelo got hand updated after I got the tail so doesn't show it.) <br />
<br />
My groups are usually pretty good about mixing aggro control and dps though, so the extra tanking power of the 25 AC on the tail comes in handy, though I'm still sorting out the appropriate times to use. I've noticed a bit of aggro loss during hard LDoNs and will probably switch back for those.<br />
<br />
Good to know I'll want max aggro on end mob though, I'll keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But 1st sewers is the hardest (mob hitting wise), so if you are having some problems with it .. if you can get by 1st, the rest hit for less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, taking them one at a time in order is kind of a cruel joke~  In my experience, order of difficulty from easiest to hardest is: 4, 2, 1 &amp; 3.  That's ummm...pool, crematory, plant &amp; lair.  Getting the drops to go from one to the next is also a cruel joke.  There are no trials in sewers which guarentee any drops, nor does the gear really &quot;improve&quot; from 1-4.  Although killing Kril`Vak a few billion times for a Wailing Coral Staff would make you the coolest kid on the block.</div></div><hr />
