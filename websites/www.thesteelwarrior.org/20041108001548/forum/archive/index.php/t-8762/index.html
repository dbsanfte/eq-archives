<br />
Level 66: Aura of Runes Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6191&amp;source=Test) - Duration: 1 minute, reuse: 15 minutes - Adds a proc that gives a 400hp rune. Timer 4, which places it on the same timer as Spirit of Rage, Fearless, Resistant, and Healing Will. (I'm assuming unknown 155 is the timer, as it's the only one that matches)<br />
<br />
Stacking rules place it in conflict with other right-click proc buffs, but being a discipline I don't know how this works out.<br />
<br />
Level 68: Savage Onslaught Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6192&amp;source=Test) - Duration: 30 seconds, reuse: 15 minutes - Someone will have to correct me, but it looks to be making you cripple instead of crit even without being berserk, increased chance to crit, and increased damage on crit.  This is on Timer...5.  I guess they decided to put in a 5th timer.<br />
<br />
Level 70: Shocking Defense Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6190&amp;source=Test) - Duration: 1 minute, reuse: 15 minutes - no clue...  However, this one is on Timer...6.  Interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like it adds this stun effect as a defensive proc on you: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6202&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
My guess is that it will then trigger whenever something hits you. Or have a chance to trigger anyway. Potentially very nice if it will trigger with every hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They look pretty nice if the descriptions are correct, we should get a new disc every level though not every other level.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt Shocking defense discipline would go off every hit though, that would be way to overpowered and exploitable.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if they added some discs with unlimited timers that just drained endurance if theyre never going to add some melee abilities / special moves etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, there's no way they're going to let us totally stun-lock something for a minute hehe, but it sounds interesting.

<br />
Mighty strike berzerked already stun locks a target assuming you dw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was thinking more along the lines of it being coupled with AE taunt, I seriously doubt locking down 5+ mobs while enchanters casually mez them over the course of a minute is whats intended with the skill.<br />
<br />
Granted we could only do it once every 15min but it would still step on to many toes and trivialize bad pulls imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Think about it... if it stunned every hit, it wouldn't be stun lock. If it is a 2-second stun, it would just make it so they only attack every 2 seconds. They have to hit you for it to go off. Not stun lock at all, just effectively slowing the mob(s) that are attacking you. If it stunned every hit I don't think it would be overpowered in the slightest, especially considering that many mobs are completely stun-resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice to see some additional warrior only discs like this, but I am still worried about the sheer drop in raw tanking vs knights usings shields.<br />
<br />
I don't think the new incite will fix the problems with initial engage (after an arrow of course) and even if it does, if they don't add 9 endurance regen, you are better off usings the 65 incite (69 incite requires 9 more endurance regen to maintain the same time between &quot;incites&quot;)<br />
<br />
Maybe they can make &quot;weapons&quot; like shield of the slain unicorn that are good ratio weapons with innate anger type proc, an augment slot (type 4), and count as a shield?  So we could gain the &quot;shield block&quot; AA bonus while not losing hate from the offhand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very concerned with the shield AA's also. I dont want to be forced to use a shield and knowing sony thats exactly what will happen, I'd rather them take it out completely for warriors or let us use a buckler in our left wrist slot the way they were intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The idea that a discipline could enable a class to have a stun proc'd onto a mob when it hits you (actually a chance to proc) isn't alone in the game.  Clerics and Enchanters also receive an AA that does essentially this, so you could probably say they receive this discipline, except as an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't think the new incite will fix the problems with initial engage<br />
It's pretty obvious that SoE intends Warriors to &quot;have some challanges that make the game more interesting&quot; (translation - be broken in some areas).<br />
<br />
Taunt has a lower chance of success vs. the more difficult mobs in the game. Our tanking advantage increases (at least for 3 minutes), but taunt becomes less (ahahahahaha) reliable.<br />
<br />
As mobs get more challanging, Anger procs are more generally resisted. Often in the very same expansion you acquire an aggro weapon the proc is resisted - how's that for fair?<br />
<br />
Warriors are masters of all weapons. So:<br />
<br />
starting in PoTime, where are the high quality Warrior 2H aggro weapons that can keep up with augmented DBoW/EoE in DPS and hate generation?<br />
<br />
Where's the high Damage/Delay ratio 1H high procmodrate aggro weapon that makes shields as attractive for Warriors for holding aggro without negative consequences as they are for Knights?<br />
<br />
Let's not kid ourselves. Some of these things are intentional design - obtaining aggro with a level 9-15 spells who's mana cost are now repaid before the spellgem refreshes is for Paladins only<br />
<br />
But others are an attempt to put the best spin possible on bad design.<br />
<br />
It's programers who invented the phrase, INABIAF - It's not a bug, it's a feature. And it's users that often correctly observe INAFIAB - It's not a feature, it's a bug.<br />
<br />

<br />
I know you're talking about anger, but EB isn't resistable, and even if anger is it's generally assumed you still get the hate from it.  This is hardly a area to complain about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's the high Damage/Delay ratio 1H high procmodrate aggro weapon that makes shields as attractive for Warriors for holding aggro without negative consequences as they are for Knights?&quot;<br />
<br />
Isn't it DBoW?  it's basically a BoW held in one hand, actually it's better.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far from the warrior perspective, everything is pretty balanced now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Please pardon the brief derail :(. The important concept was meant to be my assertion that aggro is intended to remain a challange to Warrirors - we won't get a permanent solution in a box.<br />
I know you're talking about anger, but EB isn't resistable, and even if anger is it's generally assumed you still get the hate from it.<br />
Actually, I'm &quot;complaining&quot; about 3 things:<br />
1. The Warrior only LDoN Anger augs are fairly widely resisted at higher levels. Are we really positive a resisted proc gives exactly the same hate or is our only source of hate proc augs at least partially resistable?<br />
<br />
2. With historical access to weapon procs with a stun component that actually stunned (Gnollhide Lariats, Yaks), this ability was quietly taken away. Even EoE vs. mobs at that progression level has it's procs resisted and &quot;laughed&quot; at by mobs. Sorry Warriors, you only get broken procs.<br />
<br />
3. Concidering procs are random in the first place, ~2 procs a minute seems a little weak with a bow. There are a few bows that have a proc with a stun component. You'd think Warrios would go ga ga over them. But nah ah - they are teh useless.<br />
Isn't it [....high Damage/Delay ratio 1H high procmodrate aggro weapon that makes shields as attractive for Warriors....] DBoW?<br />
<br />
Warrior 1H high DPS aggro weapons for use with a shield<br />
DBoW - 38 DMG 35 DLY<br />
Fleshbiter - 34 DMG 30 DLY<br />
Brutish Blade of Balance - 42 DMG 31 DLY<br />
<br />
Knight 1H high DPS weapons for use with a shield (Knights generate aggro with spells)<br />
Hopebringer - 41 DMG 25 DLY<br />
Cudgel of Venomous Hatred - 45 DMG 28 DLY<br />
Flanged Prayer Mace - 54 DMG 30 DLY<br />
<br />
I merely pointed out that at the same progression level, Knight 1Hdrs have a better DMG/DLY ratio than Warrior 1Hdrs. This imposes, double penalties (tm Arbosch Phrasemakers, LTD) on Warriors when using a shield - a loss a a minimum of offhand aggro augment buffs and weapon buff procs and a narrowing of the Warrior *cough* 20% DPS advantage.<br />
So far from the warrior perspective, everything is pretty balanced now.<br />
Well, if for all practical purposes having the master of all weapons confined to tanking while DWing, not finding a 2H aggro weapon very worthwhile from PoTime forward, and having double penalties compared to Knights when using sword and board is &quot;balanced&quot;, I guess yer right :D.<br />

  Now, make a different thread if you wanna bitch any more BB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kaesorn,<br />
One possibilty is that Shocking Defensive might increase the chance of Kick and Slam to stun. As I posted a bit earlier in this thread (and in threads months ago), Warriors used to have weapons that actually proc'd stuns, and unless we get stun procs back, we are a little hopeless versus mobs that gate unless Kick/Slam stun is enhanced. This might be intended to address this deficiency.<br />
<br />
I'm speculating, but perhaps just increasing the chances of Kick and Slam to stun, even for 0 Sec., all the time wouldn't work since Warriors might just mash and as a consequence mob casting would be diminished greatly. And of course SoE is probably quite leary of built-in stun weapon procs that actually stun.<br />
<br />
Fitemore,<br />
Thanks so much for finding this change on the test server. Hopefully it will go live.<br />
<br />
Sorry if you think I was bitchin', I was merely calling attention to things, one  was sufficiently wrong to be addressed at least on test - glad it wasn't my hyperactive imagination at work here and there WAS in fact an issue.<br />
<br />
Lokkak posted in this thread:<br />
....but I am still worried about the sheer drop in raw tanking vs knights usings shields.<br />
I'm also glad I'm not the only person in this thread to think there might be legitimate issues and discusing them might get them addressed.<br />

<br />
Note the Unresistable tag.<br />
<br />
Anger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3624&amp;source=Live) (DBotW) can be resisted, Anger 3 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4394&amp;source=Live) (LDoN augs) cannot be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">BB, I don't know anything about what the Disciplines might do other than what I get from Lucy.  The effect states &quot;Defensive Proc&quot;, and has a number that correlates to a 2 second stun.  It just might end up doing something like what you said.  <br />
<br />
Someone mentioned that it might be an ability that procs a 2 second stun (up to level 70) onto a mob that is hitting you.  The phrase &quot;Defensive Proc&quot; makes it seem true.<br />
<br />
I recognized the setup, and made a mention that Clerics and Enchanters are receiving a similar ability in an AA (Divine Retribution and Color Shock, respectively) in OoW, so the idea of a proc from a mob hitting you is definitely possible.<br />
<br />
After further looking, I think the earlier suggestion is exactly what the ability does.  Both Divine Retribution and Color Shock use the phrase &quot;Defensive Proc&quot; as well.  All three abilities correlate to the exact same thing (a 2 second stun up to level 70).<br />
<br />
Even more interesting, is that all 4 melee classes are receiving something like this.<br />
<br />
Rogues receive a Ranged proc (with damage increase) that does a 300hp/tick DoT for 5 ticks.<br />
Berserkers receive a Defensive proc that increases their damage by 50% for 5 ticks.<br />
Monks receive a Defensive proc that slows the mob by 25% for 5 ticks (Unresistable, that'll be interesting).<br />
<br />
It has a 15 minute reuse time, and it's on it's own brand new timer (Timer 6)<br />
<br />
So there it is... ^_^<br />
<br />
(I made this a separate post because the last post put me at 666 posts...I'm normally not superstitious, but I'm erring on the side of caution here =P)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Forgive me. I allowed myself to get confused. My criticism was as originally stated -<br />
As mobs get more challanging, Anger procs are more generally resisted. Often in the very same expansion you acquire an aggro weapon the proc is resisted.... <br />
DBoW Anger procs being a good example.<br />
<br />
My point was - SoE seems to intend that Warrior aggro control be capable of being one of our &quot;challanges&quot;.<br />
-------------<br />
Back on the dang topic (the derail was ALL my fault, sorry)!!!! ehehe<br />
<br />
The &quot;Stun Defense&quot; ability has me baffled as well. I'll resist the temptation to criticise. One thing worth keeping in mind is that we are not privy to SoE's thinking on what issues exist in the game. They are capable of addressing an &quot;issue&quot; that wasn't really on our radar. Or as Frodlin has observed (paraphrasing) providing a &quot;fix&quot; the way they believe it must be done rather than the way that we think at first blush it ought to be done. Their perspective and ours are very different.<br />
<br />
For example, consistant with Kaesorn's speculations, it's possible that SoE has observed with Warriors not having a 100% aggro lock (aggro being intended to always be a battle factor) those that get aggro briefly from GoD type hard-hitting mobs end up at low HP aggro super fast and are basicly killed before anything much can be done to save them - it COULD be (or could not be) this that they are addressing. <br />
<br />
Rather than tightening Tank lock (a bad thing), one consequence of less than 100% lock is perhaps being addressed.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Another oversight that you seem to have made, BB, is here:<br />
<br />
Warrior 1H high DPS aggro weapons for use with a shield<br />
DBoW - 38 DMG 35 DLY<br />
Fleshbiter - 34 DMG 30 DLY<br />
Brutish Blade of Balance - 42 DMG 31 DLY<br />
<br />
Knight 1H high DPS weapons for use with a shield (Knights generate aggro with spells)<br />
Hopebringer - 41 DMG 25 DLY<br />
Cudgel of Venomous Hatred - 45 DMG 28 DLY<br />
Flanged Prayer Mace - 54 DMG 30 DLY<br />
<br />
If a knight is generating aggro with spells, he is casting...if he is casting, he is not meleeing, and thus his delay goes down, most likely to a ratio that is quite similar to warrior 1h weapons.<br />
<br />
The trade-off is that Knights can choose not to generate aggro, and their DPS goes up.  We, on the other hand, can choose that we don't want to wield a shield, and our DPS goes up.<br />
<br />
I truely feel that the shield changes are not going to be too bad in this respect.<br />
<br />
As for the original point, I think speculation will be fruitless -- let's wait until some hard facts come out about the level 70 discipline before we get in a huff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Daabu,<br />
Not the appropriate thread, but - the answer is probably to just do standard parses. Warrior with DBoW, Knights with their best damaging 1Hdrs. Weapon buffs and appropriate augs, etc.<br />
<br />
I agree with your last paragraph wholeheartedly. Progress level, equipment, levels, and AA have enough effect that unless SoE does something waay off the wall, changes are things stay somewhat the same.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bergard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok, what about the fact that warriors have triple attack and double attack AAs that work on 1h weapons while knights are left with double attack AAs that only affect 2h weapons?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bergard, those things are meant to distinguish warrior DPS from knight DPS, not make up for a deficit in weapon quality.</div></div><hr />

Conclusion? You guys need a little bit of help when you go into absolute turtle-mode, assuming that one hander + shield eventually shows significant benefits. I would suggest damage or accuracy+ AA that only kicks in when using a single one hander. Or make this an innate part of the warrior shield block AA. All this, of course, assumes that shield block will be a major advantage: I'd guess that it's more than likely going to be not much more effective than the -1 DI.<br />
<br />
In any case, current knight one handers exist for the sole purpose of giving us a 'defensive' combo that is not completely blown away by dual wield. You'll note that until dualwield is taken out of the equation, Brael is doing approximately 75% of the warrior's pure melee damage, a number not exactly out of line. Because dual wield has always been designed as one of the major DPS seperating tools, and knight one handers are designed to keep the disparity of dual wield from getting completely out of hand, any warrior mainhander must be designed with the idea that you can grab an offhander and almost double your DPS. Any DPS increasers for the tortise-warrior, then, must be skill or AA dependant, and not an issue of itemization. We're already only 80% as effective as you with an identical weapon: It's not needed to drop that like a rock with dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">With the upgraded flurry AA, we'll be quite competitive with Paladins and SK's at similar levels, particularly considering that we produce all of our aggro with attack on at all times, whereas that's not the case with Pal/SK.   We end up outdamaging SK's and Paladins by about 15% at the Time end with Darkblade vs Hopebringer vs. Cudgel.<br />
<br />
While I believe that lower end warriors will suffer due to the nature of their weapons (13/20 copper hammer with a shield is a joke), the answer may very well be in simply making a decent 1h slower primary only weapon with a nice aggro proc available to warriors at the lower end.</div></div><hr />

The first step may be to recognize there is a difference in Warrior and Knight 1Hdrs in the first place.<br />
<br />
Then perhaps the question can be asked if Knight 1Hdrs are good enough that they don't use them only when MTing. Perhaps they are also used:<br />
<br />
when rampage tanking<br />
<br />
because weapons like Hopebringer, Flanged Prayer Mace, etc. have a beneficial effect<br />
<br />
to reap the benefits of using a shield with good stats or focus effects<br />
<br />
becase an FB shield allows Knights to INCREASE their aggro generation without the loss of offhand procs, etc.<br />
<br />
DPS can't be assumed to be only while stunning. Nor can shield use be seen as only for MT purposes for Knights, although using one may increase their ability to generate aggro rather than reduce it..<br />
<br />
As things stand now, experiance groups understandably comment if I equip a shield. They do not say a word when I'm playing a Paladin and use a shield. Do you suppose there might possibly be a reason for this?<br />
<br />
As Frodlin points out, at the lower level game there's a fair amount of difference between a CHoS and Mace of Dark Glory. It's not just PoTme+ and level 65's only.<br />
<br />
The &quot;problem&quot; with fixing it with skill or current AA abilities is that these tend to increase DW DPS and not just effect sword and board mode. Nor should Warriors who have completed their defensive AA's and moved on to offensive AA's be the only one's able to mitigate some of the inequity.<br />
<br />
It seems pretty obvious to me that Knight 1Hdrs are designed with the fact they can't DW in mind. It's equally obvious that Warrior 1Hdrs are designed with the fact they can DW in mind. In two years I haven't seen a well equiped Knight bid on a Warrior wieldable 1Hdr.<br />

Well, since this is on the Warriors issues list, perhaps SoE will take a look at it. Or maybe shields are intended to be a greater advantage for Knights.<br />

Furious bash hasn't worked on spell hate for a long long time, it was changed to bash damage only when the &quot;glowing red&quot; text was added in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">here's a real derail...warriors should be able to wear all WAR usable shields in the back slot :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I wasn't suggesting FB operated on spell hate. Rather, when using a shield Warriors give up offhand Weapon procs and get FB if the shield has it. For Warriors there is an aggro trade off. Knights don't give up aggro events and gain the FB effect - a net aggro gain.<br />
<br />
One obvious &quot;fix&quot; is to create Warrior only FB shields with an offensive &quot;focus&quot; effect. I think it's an oversimplification to say Warriors and Knights get the same benefits from shields (no change in any &quot;balance&quot; characteristic), there can't possibly be an itemization &quot;issue&quot;, any &quot;problem can't be fixed by itemization or conversely can't be fixed with a Warrior ability - say Level 52 +2 damage to weapons when weilding a shield.<br />
<br />
I think it's a question worth asking SoE to examine as reflected by it's mention on the Warrior's issue list (if it's still there).<br />
<br />
To my mind enhancing shields is much like enhancing bow proc rates and chance to crit - it would be a benefit to all Plate Tanks, but unquestionably much more of a benefit to Warriors.<br />
<br />
Ya, Warriors ought to be able to wear any shield on our back - we're much more likely to use one there than in our offhand  :D.<br />

I've asked and brought this up via several other venues as well, so let's hope something comes of it.</div></div><hr />
