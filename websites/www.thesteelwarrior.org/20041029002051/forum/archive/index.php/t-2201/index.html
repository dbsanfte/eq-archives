<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been exping in PoTactics pit lately so we've killed the named wraith, frenzied intiate, enraged war boar and sometimes the named piglet that runs with the stampede. I also know where Glykus and I think the Overseer spawn. But I don't know where any other named spawn and was hoping someone could help me out.  Guess it's mainly the Supplier and Armorer that I&quot;m looking for. Just getting tired of the pit and want to kill in a new location while trying to get some drops for my group.<br />
<br />
I also know of the named towards VZ and TZ, but those aren't really worth the effort with 1 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Armorer and Supplier spawn in the middle of what I call the mess hall.  It's the room with the long benches and tables just off the long stairway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh have you ever seen armorer and supplier there?  Because we camp him at the end of the hallway, quite a little ways past the mess hall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yah, its the next  4 intersection past the messhall where ya would set up camp in either the left or right room. those 2 have phs unlike glykus and overseer who are 3 day spawns it think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">overseer and gylkus are like 12 hours, others are purely PHs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go past the dining room, take a right, there's a 4-way there.... if you look to the left there's a room with crates and such... in that room, in the far left corner spawns the Supplier (or his PH) if you look to the right you see a door in the hallway... enter that door and you're in a small room filled with armour... at the back of that room (suprisingly) the armourer will pop, or his PH. I have not ever seen armourer or supplier pop in a different location, thou people tell me the supplier can pop in the dining room too... If you camp in the armourer-room, you can clean that room, the room to your left, the hallway and the room to your right (supplier) be4 re-pops start and you start the cycle over. The PH/named span is random thou... sometimes you don't see a named for hours.... sometimes they pop back to back.</div></div><hr />
