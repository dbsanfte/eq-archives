<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nirfindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all!<br />
I have a few noobish question for you guys.<br />
<br />
I have 3 different weapons to choose from when tanking: Copper Hammer of Striking, Blade of Carnage and Great Blade of Storms.<br />
<br />
What setup would generate most agro?<br />
<br />
Is it true that GBoS is better agro than BoC?<br />
<br />
Hope you guys can answer this  - thank you in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Enraging blow is more aggro than the proc on the GBoS. The GBoS will out-damage the BoC in mainhand, but that's not really important. The Copper hammer of striking isn't in the same league as boc/gbos, sell it. Mainhand the BoC and offhand the GBoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i agree with neksnappa. Boc is better than gbos. Although you might find a few grouping situations where you can switch to get alittle more damage, but your agro will go down some. The both have normal proc rate. The stun will generate 450-500 agro per proc. 700 for the boc. Those that tell you a gbos has the same or better agro than a boc are trying to justify the fact they want to pretend they are a dps class, or just heard lies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, Blade of Carnage in Primary and Great Blade of Storms in Secondary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agreed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have to agree with everyone else here. BOC main and offhand the GBoS is best agro setup of those weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">gbos and boc defintly even though gbos chos have same proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nirfindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you all for your answers!<br />
<br />
I sorta thought that BoC and GBoS would be close to eachother agro-wise, but I wanted to be sure that I wielded them right.<br />
<br />
BoC will be primary (I love that Lammy look - makes me all nostalgic hehe) and GBoS will be secondary for my agro setup - switched around for my uber DPS setup :p <br />
<br />
Thanks again guys - nice to get so fast answers  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the main reason to keep BoC primary is GBoS will probably proc more in secondary than BoC. I have yet to get my GBoS but BoC can be extremely random</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the main reason to keep BoC primary is GBoS will probably proc more in secondary than BoC. I have yet to get my GBoS but BoC can be extremely random<br />
<br />
Not true. They will both proc the same.  The true main reason to keep BoC primary is because it procs 700 hate, and the GBoS procs a dd/stun.  They will both proc the same amount, so you mainhaind BoC to get more 700 hate procs.<br />
<br />
woot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">nothing against ya dobbo, but i'm surprised at these Proccing myths floating around.  i spoke to a warrior who recently sold his BoC and repped it with a CHoS becuase its aggro was better ...  :confused: <br />
<br />
apparently someone told him that it procced more ... so he bought one and thought he noticed a difference and sold off his BoC at wholesale.<br />
<br />
all weapons, unless your sporting a cleric hammer, time stuff, ssra stuff (etc) proc exactly the same.</div></div><hr />

I'll definitly go BoC mainhand GBoS offhand when tanking.<br />
For dps i'll go GBoS mainhand CHoS offhand.<br />
Btw Weapon Affinity will be ur friend on both situations :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are a few weapons that proc more than others, like snowchipper technically has a small proc rate increase. Although I doubt you would ever notice<br />
<br />
Boc, GboS, CSHD, Chos, sotbw, etc all the normal proc rate of 2 procs per minute at 305 dex.</div></div><hr />
