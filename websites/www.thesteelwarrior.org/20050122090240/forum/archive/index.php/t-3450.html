<br />
For a time now, i've been updating my gear as i go, spending more PP then i care to remember and crawling in LDON more then is healthy (or so my fiancee says) (thank god she plays!)<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=680028<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind when going over the profile, that my guild is not capable of raiding the numerious PoP zones yet (expect the Trials which are up for in 2 weeks)<br />
<br />
any suggestions on upgrades?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greug</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seemingly not getting much replies..<br />
<br />
I was hoping for some input on what to upgrade and with what items :-/<br />
<br />
Removing darkfaith earring for a bloodmetal earring of engagement from a friend's chanter (thank god, price isn't so bad then)  what else should i upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeric</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you are doing LDoN I would recommend replacing your bracers/arms/gauntlets with plate armor from Miragul's (700ish points) or the better ones from Takish (1400ish).<br />
Va'Dyn in Akheva drops a nice neck too (Shaderock Amulet: 3AC 10STR 5STA 100HP); should drop him easily. You could also try for a nice neck at LDoN merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greug</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How hard is Va'dynn? i remember several levels ago we gave him a shot with half of the guild participating and we had a whipe due to clerics being lazy :-/<br />
<br />
I'm tryign to save up all my AP's i can to go for the BIG upgrades as you suggested tho, seems quite a long way to go at a 1:2 successrate in Ldon with pickup groups (don't ask, low population server, warriors not in demand lol so i make due with what i can get as a group)<br />
<br />
for the gauntlet, should i go for the LDON one, or, for the Ornate mold? i've been offered a spot by a friend in one our of server top raiding guilds to go with a friend and a couple of friends to farm molds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeric</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say Va'Dyn is usually a 2 group thing (average equipped people mind you).<br />
<br />
If you wanna chose between Mir, Tak and Ornate gaunts, decide if you want the effect on the Ornate or the slightly better stats on the Tak gauntlets. If you have the chance on Ornate I'd go for them cause 1400ish points takes rather long to get.</div></div><hr />

Ornate or cultural for arms and gaunts would be a neat upgrade if you can get those.<br />

<br />
avg guild lvl is some odd 57 - 59.<br />
<br />
We yield some 4 groups on &quot;good&quot; raid days when people don't have RL coming up (we're not a hard core raiding guild we just raid for fun and some equipment upgrades) but that might change now we got some more general utility classes in the guild (for some reason, clerics seems to be drawn to our guild due ot the massive ammount of Melee orientated players we field, and a severe lack in casters, only one wiz, and one mage :(((  )<br />
<br />
Will get back to you after tomorrow to see how Davy went, if our monks are back out of vacation and our Sk's :p (hate later summer!)<br />
<br />
Will have to go with the ornate's i think, (Agnostic, due to me starting my warrior when i was a true newbie, and my friend who got me hooked never correcting me on my mistake in the early lvl's)<br />
<br />
will have to look on our bazaar, Venril Sathir's pretty messed up economy imho, with prices going wacked off, and not that much to offer cause there aern't a lot of players (population went up a little tho recently, so hopefully there's betterment incoming ehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dreadx</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a Cloak of Greater Pernicity may be a good back upgrade it will max str and add some nice sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like from what I see, the biggest upgrade potentials are your neck, hands, arms, haste, and offhand, probably in that order.<br />
<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace is a good, and fairly cheap neck solution. <br />
<br />
For Hands and arms, looking for something with AC and HP is a good idea.  I'm sure you can pick up a Champion's MQ for cheap, or even drag your guild to Kael for a few plate cycles.  On FV, the corroded plate gauntlets (droppable there) sell for around 200-300pp.  For a nicer option, your guild is probably approaching HoT potential (if not there already).  Picking up some Gauntlets of the Myrmidon (27ac 90hp 8dex) would be nice.  <br />
<br />
For your haste, a Soulscream Belt (9ac 9str 10sta 30hp 31% haste) should be trivially easy for you to get in Veksar.  Not a huge upgrade, but it's free and not difficult to get.  And who can complain about more haste?<br />
<br />
You might want to check out adding a Sword of the Bloodsworn to your weapon setup - Stats aren't all that different from your current offhand, but it adds a proc for 75dd + 0.0sec stun, so it'll improve your agro.<br />
<br />
Those should keep you busy inbetween LDoN trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greug</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Champs MQ sell for some odd 5K/piece (dependant on which piece, 5K is cheapest) due to not much farming going on on the server.<br />
<br />
we're currently doing a regular plate cycle in Kael, but most of the time the drops are for chainsypansies and leatherlovers (don't ask me how, still don't get it)<br />
<br />
But yeah, got my friend's necro permaparked in Veksar to farm the soulscream, till now still none dropped tho or i'd have updated my slot allready.<br />
<br />
Arms, most things that i would concider an upgrade on our market sells for 30K, a bit out of my range till sales pick up again<br />
<br />
i'm browsing the bazaar like, 10 times/day looking for gear, saw something for neck that'd be an upgrade, Velium spicked etc, or the wolf tracking collar (but less)<br />
<br />
ARgh, decissions, decissions.<br />
oh well, at least made 64 last night :)<br />
