May just be a rumour started by a few sad individuals, but would be very nice for a new elemental+ zone to be added.</div></div><hr />

Personally I like that idea.  It's a beautiful zone and is really underused for how nice it is.</div></div><hr />

It's too bad, in a way ... I was looking forward to our wee guildlet getting in there and looking around some.   But if the tweaks go through as rumoured, it will be out of our league long after I've moved on to another game.  But at the same time, every other zone revamp has been a win for me, and building a few new sandboxes for more powerful toons than I am is a good thing too.  The population is getting a little top heavy after all ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And CT is now almost back to where it was prior to the upgrade.  Maybe one group in zone, trying to farm slime boots...</div></div><hr />

I always wanted to see it but could never find anyone who would go there.  Hopefully all they change is the loot tables and the mob difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this sounds real fun. Better than having a dead zone sitting empty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT still has events people do ring of slime is main one (usually a one-group -two group farmers) or escort gnome or ring of fear, or dragon fight.  people still do that, but that zone since pop has been empty for expers.</div></div><hr />

Fungus grove, velks, KC, and seb are mostly empty aside from the occaisional farmers since PoP as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CT after revamp absolutely OWNED :<br />
- Insane XP mod<br />
- Moskito Earring x 2<br />
- Lizard Bone Earring<br />
- Badass DD150 Axe<br />
- FT 3 Boots<br />
- Amy Mask<br />
- ID4 Helm<br />
<br />
And i'm still forgetting some of them.<br />
Of course it was a fucking dangerous instant wipe place.<br />
But it was always full with a hundred people long list.<br />
<br />
Slowly the novelty wore off, beeing so remote ment less people went there.<br />
The loot became less appealing ... The farmers took over (since there was no one else).<br />
And now its deserted just like 95% of EQ zones.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 ways to make an old zone appealing : Loot &amp; XP<br />
CT had both of them (somehow it got deserted).<br />
Velketor still has both of them, and is still packed.</div></div><hr />

CT was THE level 60 group xp spot until PoP came out.  Everywhere you could put a group was camped pretty much 24/7 on BB.  Within a few weeks of PoP release, people realized it wasn't the best xp anymore and moved.  Tier 1 xp was better then anything before and once people hit tier 2 the old world was dead.  Also, don't forget when PoP came out most of the old world went light blue which also affected CT.  <br />
<br />
I really liked CT when I was 60.  It was a challenge with good xp and the occasional nice drop that was actually an upgrade for a lot of the people who xp'd there.  IMO that was a great revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope they don't revamp VP.  My group has gone in there for the challenge of one grouping silverwing.  It's a challenge to go in w/o a cleric and see how well we work together.  The exp is not outstanding but you don't have to compete with a bunch of other folks either.<br />
<br />
The reason so many zones are empty is everyone rushes to get to pop where the exp is killer.  Unless you actually need anything in a specific zone, why go there?  On the other hand its nice to find a quiet spot out of the way to farm/multi-box where you don't have to worry about trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT only needs an Exp boost to make it popular again.<br />
<br />
If they wanted they could raise mob dps a touch buff the drops a touch and give it an exp mod like earth and you'd see people there.<br />
<br />
If they were to sit back and revamp all the zones you'd see people moving all over. Make all the zones for 20-30 equal, 30-35 equal, etc etc. Touch up mob dps and abilities and buff loot where needed. Same exp mod for all dungeons, same exp mod for all outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
In doing so then people would go where they want to. If they really wanted a piece of loot from xyz then they'd head there and it wouldn't matter vs zone abc because the exp mod was the same.<br />
<br />
In VPs case I think they should buff it a tad, not much just a little and buff the loot a bit. Also put the trash back the way it was. Then smaller guilds could key up and go there. It'd be challenging but worth it.<br />
<br />
If all exp zones were created equal then they could look at building a true teir system for raiding starting at lvl 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, CT's exp modifier was nerfed the day POP was released.  It is now similar XP to Chardok but more difficult, which is why you still see people exp in Chardok, but only go to CT for loot.  If CT had not been nerfed, then it would probably still be almost as popular as ever, and places like POJ would probably not be as popular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree what has killed many of these old zones is the ZEM game SoE plays.  With PoP SoE adjusted the ZEM to encourage PoP.  Then it was LDoN.  Now it is GoD.  The problem is that while this encourages use of new content it damages the value of old...you wind up spreading the same amount of  peanut butter over more bread....if you live in the new content yer happy fer exp and you only visit old content for farming and quests. <br />
<br />
As SoE can't charge for revamps of old content it will always need to offer carrots to have peeps go to its sexiest/new release (cha-ching).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sold mine when I saw people were paying 50k+ for them again.  :p  (not like I was using it anymore except for the occasional clicky heal when the healers were oom during downtime)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went 2-boxing in VP last weekend, and was surprised by the amount of XP I was getting.  Generally 3%/kill/character in a duo, which for level 60 mobs is quite high.  The mobs were ridiculously easy, and in an hour I crawled from zone in to just before the pool room.  Didn't see any of the newer rare named mobs.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the pool room is Silverwing's lair in the current version of VP?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that Silverwing is not a feasible target for a duo.  (I think she has too much regen, and also can charm? That would be bad.)<br />
<br />
It's a shame if a small group can't go past the pool room.  I would think that some of the upstairs dragons would be killable by a VERY small group.</div></div><hr />
