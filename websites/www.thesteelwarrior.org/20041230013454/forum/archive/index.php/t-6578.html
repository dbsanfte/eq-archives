<br />
Unbuffed Stats:<br />
5400 HP, 1400 AC, 1250 ATK<br />
<br />
Gear:<br />
Full ornate, PoP Jewelry, 41% haste, etc.<br />
BoC &amp; CHSD for aggro;  GSo4W for DPS<br />
JBoots, 8th ring, Bracer of the Hidden<br />
<br />
AA's:<br />
Run3, Regen3, CA3 &amp; LR5, CS3 &amp; ID5, PP5, SE3, TM3<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than the obvious ND3, PD3, and Sturdy 2, what do I need to get now?  Also, FR has been my bane since creation - how high do I need to get it to be able to XP in PoFire comfortably, and what can I afford to give up to get it there?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chammy</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on what your role for your guild is.  Assuming it's the traditional MT then I'm in agreement with Gasmaster you need to work on your HP.  <br />
<br />
Farm Agnarr and get his , Crystallized Rain and his Stormrriders Gauntlets if you can; finish your 10th Coldain Ring; get a Black Basalt Band and other various goodies from PoTact.  Lose the Lodizal Shell Shield and get a cloak with more HP... okay with SOME form of HP lol :)<br />
<br />
That should get you started, but bottom line is you need more HP :)  The AAs your on the right path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er, why Planar Power, tanaan crafting aa's, and TM before finishing ND3/PD3?  Well anyway get those and sturdiness 2 before you try PoFire I'd say.  You don't need to get your FR up though for xp mobs at least.  First castle is pretty gimp and good xp, stuff hits for like 700 but has pretty low atk so once you're done with those aa's you could give it a try.  If anything there's some cleric/enchanter/wizard mobs(chaplain's and djinn type models) who cast mr/fr based stuff but it's really not a big enough deal to sacrifice hp/ac gear for.<br />
<br />
As for equipment why do you have the shawl quest done?  Seems like a lot of investment for something that really isn't that good for pure melee but I'm guessing by your aa's you just enjoy tradeskilling.  Get rid of the lodi cloak asap, get something like crinose whatever cloak from ldon(12ac 80hp)  If you have a fair amount of cash or can go kill vhashiz(sp) get hornspiked pauldrons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is the case, where you are MA/SA. You are not ready gear wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really clear what your referring to on last post, if it's directed towards me or the original poster, but i'm not MA/SA on most raids for my guild, i'm probably only 4th or 5th in terms of HP/AC, but for i've tanked just about everything pre-elmental with few problems. My guild has only been elemental for 2 days now, and were still backflagging people so we've yet to do any elemental raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can main tank rallos zek the warlord, you can main tank the first few nameds you meet in the elementals, which will provide you with the elemental molds you need to gear up to fight the harder mobs deeper in. Start with PoF nameds. Go from there. It's really about your guild and what it can do. You're just one piece of the puzzle. <br />
<br />
A good barometer of your ability to take a beat down will be Reparm. Survive his smack down and you won't need to ask this board if you're good enough. You'll know you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slovack</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked out your magelo. I dont see how your HP is only 5400 unbuffed? Unless you've entered some info wrong somewhere along the line.<br />
You have WAY better gear than i do, leist i think you do, and im at 6100 unbuffed with just a few more AA's than you. My magelo is correct to +- around 20 HP and 15 AC ( just havent took the time to twink it so its exact)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He doesn't have any hp aa's, probably a big part of the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP aa's make a huge difference, just from ND3 and PD2 I gained ~500. Don't put them off any longer!!!! Get those up and your hp should be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason your Hps are very low.  My guild just broke into elemental planes after farming luclin type stuff for a while and I would say that we have 2 tanks at 10K buffed and 3 more at 9500-10K buffed.  Im like the 3rd tank in the guild with like 7140 or so unbuffed hps and I only have sturdiness 2.  I would advise you to do everything you can to get more hps, train the HP aas like ND3, do LDoN for 40 hp augs, train up the group leadership aas for 90 more hps whatever you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got done checking your magelo and I would venture to say that your guild skipped all of Luclin and ssra and VT?  You are hurting very badly in many gear slots.  Ornate armor with 50 hps or so per slot (other than BP and legs) basically won't get it done for MTing in elementals IMO.  In order to fill in some gear slots try Hard LDoN with a tracker.  The named in there drop 100 hp items for most slots, all of which would be big upgrades for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read the post over.  He's just asking about xp but anyway get those hp aa's and you should be okay for first castle xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reparm will rape a 5.4, DI or not. As for other stuff, I'm not quite sure. Field one should be no problem, nor should c1. Ugib and c3 tho heh, I don't think so single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if XP's all he's asking about ... yeah, he can XP group tank with that setup. Hell, I can XP tank PoF mobs with 4400 unbuffed.  Not all that efficiently, but then again, I have mitigation issues beyond my control.<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh xping?  Yeah xp mobs in elementals are pretty weak as long as you aren't xping on the crabs in water or something.  I have done earth many times without even a slower in the group.  You will be fine for xping</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can tank PoE exp easily (which will generate obscene fast AAs rectifying any HP aa concerns).  I wouldnt worry over much about your gear if you aren't stepping into MT role in ellies.  Odds are you will see some nice mold drops after your MT's get it and a little Raex here and there never hurt anyone  :)</div></div><hr />
