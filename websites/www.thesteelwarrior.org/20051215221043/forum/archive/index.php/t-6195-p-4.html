The Fabled Garnil Rucksif in Unresy is super easy to solo. Cons light blut at 65, hits max 298. Just open with furious and a high dmg 2hander and he will kill himself basically. I killed 10 times and he never got me below 50% health.<br />
<br />
Fabled cloaked dhampyre is a bit harder, hits 268, but is a sk ans HT right off the bat, has a few more hp. <br />
<br />
Fabled maid issis is fairly tough. Hit me for 326 max (triples) and casts/summons. Had over 32k hp and I needed 2 druid 5k heals to take here, even with dmg shield up.<br />
<br />
fabled reclusive ghoul magi hits for 181, easy.<br />
<br />
fabled undead knight of unrest hits for 183, easy.<br />
<br />
fabled undead barkeep hits for 171, easy.<br />
<br />
The tough fabled you will run into are in solb and lguk.</div></div><hr />

Fabled Screaming Mace and Fabled Dragoon Dirk I believe.</div></div><hr />

I camped my FJboots 11 hours before I got it; I was 9th in line when I started and we went through a few hours straight of not a single pop of her.<br />
<br />
Yes, I was able to tank and kill her solo, I did most of the killing as alot of those waiting were either asleep (this was at 3 in the morning!) or casters.</div></div><hr />

I hear they had been dropped now but have not verified yet.  Anyone know if it's true?</div></div><hr />

On the bright side, now I can wander around looking for Quillmane once in a while without 10 trackers in the zone with the same idea.  Buying lev potions is getting so old. =x</div></div><hr />
