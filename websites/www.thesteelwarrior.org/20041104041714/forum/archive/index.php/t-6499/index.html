<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was camping my Seru reports the other day and I discovered something that bothered me.  Was doing the eye building, and before going in I pulled the see invis mean guy (Percontorius Salnu) out so we could kill him.  Since he has a ton of HP and we were low on DPS I hit defensive to save on heal mana.....problem was, defensive had no effect.  As in, he still hit for the same amount.  Rather confused and annoyed, but figured it was a fluke.  Until I was pulling the Vigilum Cohortis from upstairs.....and I got Redeemer Balakaz.  Once again, defensive had no effect....and this time we wiped to him and the 2 adds I got.<br />
<br />
Anyone ever run into this?  Is this new, or has it always been a &quot;feature&quot; of Seru?  I'm sensing it's part of what I call &quot;DX 9 Land&quot;, which is where walls mean nothing, elevators only take you up if you are leved, zones have intermittent &quot;pauses&quot;, and mobs don't let you get the benefits of your discs or EB procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where you out of endurance? Defensive will shut off if you don't have the endurance to sustain the upkeep cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, defensive was running, it just wasn't having any effect on the hits that were landing.  I even got the &quot;you return to normal fighting&quot; message half way thru the fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like to see some logs first.<br />
<br />
If I recall Seru named have very small range of hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, RZ is a good example of a mob that defensive barely touches. It only lowers his max hit by 200ish? I don't remember exactly. Defensive doesn't decrease the mobs hits by a set percentage, but is based instead on the DB/DI of the mob. I misremember which is which, check the Library for more info on defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rallos Zek is actually a very good target to use Defensive on even though his max is something like 1000 because he procs Sedition which trashes your AC.  Defensive is good when you're getting hit for near max.  <br />
<br />
An example of what's not good for Defensive would be a Custodian of Righteousness (at least before revamp) which has something like a min of 1300 and a max of 1400.  You might as not disc if you used defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My point was just that RZ's hit range is minimally affected by defensive, not that it was a poor choice. Compared to most mobs, his hits LOOK like they're barely changed when defensive is activated. I'm guessing that it's the same with the Seru mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The bosses of PoJ trials hit for nearly max with defensive too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am surprised there is a question on this.<br />
<br />
If the DI of the mob is small, you may want to use evasive.<br />
<br />
So on mobs that hit for 100 to 3000, use defensive.<br />
For mobs that hit for 1300 to 1400, use evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After reading the replies, I went back and re-read the post on  DI and DB....I had read it before, long ago (actually skimmed it) but I hadn't yet run into a situation where it really meant anything to me ie using evasive or defensive.  Still didn't mean a lot to me without numbers, so I decided to run an actual test in game and parse the results.  I used Percontorius Salnu as my test subject, cause I can easily pull him single to the zone.  Ran a full 3 min run of defensive, then zoned out and pulled him again and did 3 mins without defensive.  Max hit without is 370, with I saw a max of 315.  Min hit without was 260, with was 257.  Worked out that his DI is 6 with a DB of 254(!)  normally.<br />
<br />
Another thing that I saw in looking thru my log with YALP that sorta surprised me is that defensive doesn't seem to effect kick or bash damage taken at all...Percontorius Salnu kicks and bashes for about 255 both with and without defensive, making him a pretty mean customer. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I learned something today that I prolly should have known before.  Actual in-game experience with stuff helps it sink in better for me I guess.<br />
<br />
Anyone happen to know the DI and DB for Ta'Grush the Abomination (named on the way to Saryrn)?  I know his range is huge, max hit I saw when I got riposted once without defensive was nearly 3500,  minimum was about 300 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't recall exactly for Ta`Grusch, but his max hit is nearly halved with defensive, so he has a very very low DB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">these mobs max at about 540ish a hit and min 240.  The effects of defensive are virtually nonexistent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you remember, evasive is superior to defensive for pretty much everything in Luclin.  Mobs of that era had very low DI's.  It's not until PoP that defensive regained it's supremacy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reason defensive doesn't affect kick/bash is that kick/bash is a DB + DI of 1 hit...  can't half 1 and get a meaningful number :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A side note... you really need to move that guy out of the way and sorta sneak past him... it'll take you forever to kill him with one group.</div></div><hr />
