edit: or use AE taunt. I think taunt and ramp have the same reuse timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the case of a monk or rogue or someone else with no PBAE spell/ability, you can just have them pull, as the puller gets all of the faction hits as well.  There are PBAE proc weapons, which isn't ideal but could work if you can get a proc off (assuming the stuff is low enough that you can tank it for a few seconds before rampaging, probably not possible in DS).</div></div><hr />

Blazing Vambraces or Ring of the Crimson Bull are two good examples of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That will get you some hits for sure.  I haven't had good luck with using buffs or heals to get faction hits though.  It gets some hits, but not all of them usually.  Better than nothing though.  Seems that the only way to ensure that you get all the hits is to be the puller, or do something detrimental to every mob.</div></div><hr />

This is how people used to get faction from an AE wizard in Dr0gA (sorry I had to) back in the day.</div></div><hr />

sorry if this has already been answered, but did you pull everything in DS or just the mobs up top near BF?  a little clarification would be greatly appreciated.  :)</div></div><hr />

I havnt done this yet but Im thinking start the pull at BF zone, run down past the NC zone, and pick up all of those along there, and then circle it a bit in the middle of the zone to pick up some more, and to clump them, then either fortitude and let them clump before you blast, or have someone else pull who wants faction hit, and have them train right over top of you...<br />

The more is better? ;)</div></div><hr />

It is actually easier to do when you pull more.<br />
If you dont pull enough, your hosed.<br />
If you take too much damage on pulls, your hosed.<br />
Takes a little practice.<br />
<br />
So far it has been best when pulled by a bard.<br />
But a lot of people complain if you keep the zone empty.</div></div><hr />

I tried this last night and only ended up with about 30 mobs... some of the guys dont follow me, and then i lose some since i only have sow and cant stay close to each group... plus slow wears off before I get them all grped up.</div></div><hr />

I have pretty decent success in draniks scar  pulling 7-10ish yard trash to the bloodfeilds zone/tunnel,  while clearing all the spawns in that courtyard and out front, 2 boxing this druid:<br />

With just steeloak and whatever buffs fly/by groups are nice enough to hit me with in passing, the DS alone usually gets most of the mobs to 75%ish (around 100ds worn) before  I have time to cast a few roots and snare and swich mobs. Morri inevitably gets agro from heals/etc. and usually I have time to root/snare and back up (didnt buy the damn 107k droggy for nothin /grumble heh). Sometimes I have 2-3 mobs hitting her at once and do fine, as you can imagine ae taunt is rarely up =p but it also works when i dont have it, it's just a little harder.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a melee with decent hp/ac could survive a few rounds in DS, as the druid only buffs to around 4.5k hits without auctioning for buffs heh.<br />
<br />
This is my personal experience, I'm assuming similarly geared people could hold the same camp down easily, so pulling for faction is working nicely for me. <br />
<br />
I still seem to be stuck in amiable /grumble</div></div><hr />
