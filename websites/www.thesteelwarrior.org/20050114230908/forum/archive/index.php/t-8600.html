<br />
I am wondering if a lot of shaker's are going to go for AA first before they go to level 70 or if a new spot with higher level mobs will be found for exp....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would assume that people with an earthshaker would probably go for lvls over aa's. Most warriors have had their shakers for awhile and have gotten their critical aa's already. Besides, I doubt lvl 70 will make places like PoFire any less attractive to a group of warriors looking for aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly I dont have PoF access.... also it would seem impossible to solo PoF (warriors have solo done the first field in PoN, kill like 90percent of the mobs). <br />
<br />
Well the new OoW AA might be costly and I am sure there are some that warriors will want/need. All other things being equal I would go first for levels also but would be nice to know of a place I can access that I can get shakerpaging exp at level 70.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoFire field 2 + castle 2 + shakerpage = probably still decent xp in OoW era (would be high blue mobs at 70).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you either need a DA puller or to wait for fortitude to refresh for PoF though. I've done field 1 before with 3 warriors, cleric, chanter, shaman (enc and sham for slows, cleric pulled), i'd imagine if you could somehow pull all of field 2 and field 1 together 1 warrior could likely kill them himself (with a slower), but it would be tricky and risky, unlike PoN.<br />
<br />
if you want a safer place, try to figure out a way to pull enough mobs in sol ro to shakerpage them =P other than that, i don't really see any zones, other than possibly some in OoW, that are shakerpageable for exp. the only zones that are really big and open are tier 1 and i bet theyll be all low blue or green at level 70.<br />
<br />
how about...............................................grouping for exp once you hit 70? it's not like shakerpaging is even very much faster if at all, just somethin' to do for fun, to show off, or to get some loot =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for me the exp is by far the best, cause I dont have to wait for foritude to refreash. I can do all of the PoN easy side cause I have 3 wiz, 1 chanter (color cloud locks the mobs down) and cleric for group heal (although like you say a DA puller would be very effective also hummm). Wonder if tactics can be pulled with DA puller - its the DT's that are hard there. Maybe if the cleric were to stop a way's away from the warrior (so the DT not hit warrior) and then the warrior runs into the mobs and rampages..... <br />
<br />
Maybe GoD can be cleric pulled if the warrior is invisible until he rampages.... Although it seems that summoning mobs would be hard to pull that is not the case, its just they summon the warrior during his rampage which goofs things up.... <br />
<br />
Well I don't know I just might do 100-200 AA in PoN until I level to 70...</div></div><hr />

Most of the people that did field 1 used 3 warriors.  You won't be able to do any tougher mobs at 70 than you can now, so it probably won't be worthwhile at level 70 anymore (some would say it isn't at 65 but to each his own).</div></div><hr />
