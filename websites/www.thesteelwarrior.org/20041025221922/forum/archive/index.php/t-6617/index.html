<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A thought creeped into my brain.   One thing we're learning about GoD is the value of AC is significantly higher than it had previously been.   We also know that affecting a hit value of 100ish can have a dramatic result on durability.<br />
<br />
So here's the issue:<br />
<br />
We kind of tend to have a lot of kneejerk reactions to a lot of things, chief among them is the importance of adding hitpoints.    Well, in this game there's some tradeoffs, and one of the possible tradeoffs is Shield of the Arcane vs. Focus of the 7th.<br />
<br />
Focus of the 7th is 544 hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Shield of the arcane is 300 hitpoints, 36AC and 30 stackable MR.   <br />
<br />
The &quot;hp to ac&quot; calculation cannot remain stagnant from Velious to now with the DI of mobs getting into the realm of insanity, and therefore I would think that the old values of 5-6HP/AC is outdated and it's more along the lines of 10-12hp/AC if not more.   Knowing this, it seems to me that Shield of the Arcane may actually produce more benefit to us than Focus of the 7th (which adds useless stats and pure hitpoints).    <br />
<br />
I think it's testing time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Of course you could always just con your guild into getting you a girdle of living thorns from tunare, and get the AC and HP  :D <br />
<br />
Actually with like 5 time geared groups, you can simply clear any mobs near the spot tunare is rooted at, and kill her quickly before the mass of mobs joins in.  Luckily for me, she dropped it after only one kill, because its rather difficult to get people to go more than once.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think 10-12 hp per AC is rather extreme.  Imagine losing 1k hp for 100 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do consider that shield of the arcane adds 36 visible ac, which is the equivalent of 20 equipment ac. So for the 6hp = 1ac calculation, shielding comes up as 420 vs 544. For them to be equal, you'd have to be using a 12.2 hp = 1ac formula. I'm personally unsure of which IS better, because the 6hp = 1ac formula has been around longer than I've been a warrior. Times have certainly changed, but how exactly was the original formula derived? How should we go about finding out a new one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moozilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like he said, tunare belt clicky and focus is the way to go  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm...<br />
<br />
Hit Tunare.... wait, wait, wait... multi warrior shakerpage... PoG = cleared.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Until Ail the Elder joins the party, silences you, and you all do a whole 1% damage to every mob when you rampage because you can't proc =P That, or you all get charmed by the wisps. I'm sure it's possible but it'd be tough for sure, and involve a certain amount of luck with resists.</div></div><hr />

That silence won't hit any well equipped tank.  Or even anyone at all with a bard.  It wasn't too long ago that I tried ail with an enchanter and cleric.  In fact we killed pretty much everything except tunare with ease.  Took forever htough.  =P<br />
<br />
Biggest problem with rampaging it would be getting all the mbos together.  Maybe a bard could do it, but they like to cast spells and the mobs move at very different speeds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haha, what a derailment. I think the real question isn't just FoS vs Shield of the Arcane, but what's the tradeoff between ac and hp now. 100ac for 1000hp? Seems a bit high, but is it? Currently we're using 100ac for 600hp... Not that far off. Dunno, whatcha all think?</div></div><hr />

there's only 2 earthshakers on stromm anyway, they took yael out pretty early in the life of our server, only me and creamo have one ;/<br />

when did di join our guild ;0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The rule of thumb that I use if 1ac = 5 hps.  I noticed Brael thought it was 8 hps in the GoD trials thread.  Would be interesting to hear what other people use if anything.  Back in the Velious days when we were just figuring out the AC soft cap, most people, myself included, considered 1 ac = 10 hps.  AC was everything for warriors back then.  We had to completely change our thinking with the AC soft cap, but those days are gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personaly I used 1 ac for 10 hp when I first joined my current guild with an ac under 1700 once I past 1700 I started to use 1ac to 6 hp, when I cross over to 2kac (soon  :D ) I will use 1 ac to 5hp.<br />
<br />
When we move on to GoD I think that I may revluate the ratio I use to a higher ac formula, mabey as high as 1/8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">don't you have to break into the next 50 or 100 ac though for there to be a mesurable effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not quite, Moktor. You have to reach a break point to go to the next column of the combat tables when comparing your mitigation and avoidance ACs against the mobs attack rating equivalents (Shall we call them Accuracy and Penetration?) in order to provide massive difference. Mobs, for reasons of programmer convience, have round attack values... at least until we start mucking with them. Consider that your extra 27 points of AC might push your relative difference vs a mobs attack into the next column after a cripple or a Torrent of Hate, and suddenly, things are just a bit brighter for that 27 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nice post and a good question.<br />
<br />
I've spent most of my Warrior career focusing on HP's. Only as I approached 12k HP's have I started to re-think.<br />
<br />
I got a Platinum Cloak of War and put a Brilliant Blood Ruby of Prowess (10AC) on it giving me (leaving out less relavent stats) a 50AC, 185HP, +10 Avoidance<br />
<br />
Ignoring that there are better AC augs. Is this the right kind of choice? I wanted the +10 Avoidance, HP was OK, and I bumped up the AC. Good or wacky?<br />
<br />
Even more exreme. I looted a Band of Primordial Energy. 35AC, 185HP, and a 54AC self-buff. With that buff (and giving up a buff slot) it's an 89AC ring! There are other rings. In fact I want a Glyphed Prayer Ring badly. But what's good and what's not?<br />
<br />
What's the right choice once you near 12k HP?<br />
<br />
Avoidance, AC, HP, Shielding, Spell Shielding? How much AC do you need after 2000AC buffed to notice a difference?<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyone do some follow up parses on ac? Anyone think of a really good conversion of average mitigated damage via ac compared to raw hp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The rule of thumb that I use if 1ac = 5 hps.

<br />
Would use 1 ac for 10 or more hp, personally I don't even look at hp on items anymore as long as its semi comparable to other items that can be obtained, nothing can really compete with AC for improving your tanking ability other than shielding/avoidence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RhaamanNoodles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The more I play the more I feel like my old &quot;AC is king&quot; mantra I use to live by back in the day was correct.<br />
<br />
Anyways if 1ac = 6hps why are the 40hp augs so popular? The 10ac from MM would be better.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The 10ac augments from MM does not fit on all of your gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant in slots that the 10ac could fit I see more people with +40hps generally but im not elemental yet so that might have something to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>goobayouface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">the slots that 40hp merchant augs go in, the 10ac merchant augs, do not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">10 ac goes on shoulders, belt, cloak, mask, and necklace.<br />
40 hp goes on bp, legs, boots, arms, helm.<br />
However, some people do put the 20/20/20 augs on ac slots, which makes absolutely no sense in my mind.  In GoD, I'm back to the ac is king thought process heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Adding HP is instantly parseable.  Lack of HP is instantly parseable.  Adding AC or not having AC isn't as parseable and has to be periodically re-evaluated.<br />
<br />
That said, I would be interested in seeing some of those xegony style AC parses done with some GoD mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">On top of the whole +40 hp augs don't go in the ac slots, HP still is gonna give you a big bonus.  For time guilds and EP folks you're generally still dealing with AE damage... Fennin, Rathe, Quarm, a lot of EP minis, ect all come to mind almost immediately.  AC dosn't help mitigate AE damage :D.  The more I've been upgrading lately I've been noticing how much AC is infact king however HP is still probably the most important stat in the game, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What the fuck ever happened to the good old judgement call? Look at two items. Think about it. Which would you rather have? Screw this 'ratio' shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Yeah, but that doesn't work. You don't have to follow a formula if you don't want to, but for someone who wants to maximize their character a formula is the way. Subjectivity leads to problems, like people thinking BoCs having bad proc rates, or Jboots getting nerfed every patch. Eyeball nothing; parse and analyze everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Moozilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've been wanting to go back and tank Xegony with my 2800ac, I have extensive parses of tanking her at around 2100 and 2300ac...the difference between 2100 and 2300 was rather large on average hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm I thought they overlapped on a couple slots. <br />
<br />
Shows you how much I do LDoN I guess =P</div></div><hr />
