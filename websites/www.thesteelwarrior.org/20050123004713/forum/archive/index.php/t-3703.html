<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall, I think you're doing pretty well. Just shooting from the hip here, the more experienced gear gurus will be along shortly.<br />
<br />
Haste. You're going to want some haste, soon and badly.<br />
<br />
Weapons. You're going to want to get an aggro combo, as critters are doing exponentially more damage than they were just a couple of levels ago and that means splattered casters. For your level and whatever plat you state you have saved up, the gear gurus will point you to some fair aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
Cultural. Since you worship the Tribunal, you've got access to some of the better +HP armor out there. Save up and snag a few pieces of it, you won't be sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyynde</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the reply Uhrlik. I do have an FBSS that I use depending on if there is chanter or shammy haste available and if im Main tank. I also have a couple weapon sets I use too. These are in my Bags.Venomus axe and Barnacle axe for Aggro,Wurmslayer and Sharpened Mining Pick for High dammage,<br />
2 CoT's for 1hb to practice with. Stormwood BattleStaff for 2hb until I get 55 and can use Great Staff of Thunder:D:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, cool. I didn't see the weapons in the bags. The Venemous and Barny are good weapons for your level. They should take you to 55 when you can use the GSoT. <br />
<br />
As far as haste goes, the FBSS will stack with chanter/shammy haste providing you with even greater speed. So, I would recommend always wearing your haste item.</div></div><hr />
