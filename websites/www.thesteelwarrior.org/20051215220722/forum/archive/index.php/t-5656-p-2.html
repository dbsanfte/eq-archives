Have a couple of necro's and SK's handy to keep it feared of course!  Actually I have no idea how he did it.  Has anyone done a parse of WA5 using a 2hander?  Also am I reading it right that it will effect weapon innate procs over auged procs?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Innate&quot; procs, such as imbued procs are NOT affected by weapons affinity, as has been stated 10000 times.  If by 'innate' procs you mean the innate procs on a sword (like a BloodFrenzy's Enraging Blow proc) the CE will increase both the innate proc and the augmented proc by the same % *.<br />
<br />
The reason is that several high end warrior weapons, have a 'raised' proc rate, and as such while the % of Anger and Anger 3 procs stayes the same, the number gap widens, because multiplying two numbers by the same amount increases the difference between them (aka if  X &gt; Y, then AX &gt; AY if A &gt; 0 and (AX - AY) &gt; (X - Y) but AX/AY=X/Y )<br />
<br />
Mearis<br />
<br />
*<br />
The * was added because two procs cannot go off on the same swing, so the math is very slightly different, because adding an augment, takes away some 'potential' double proc rounds, and as such the proc rate will be slightly lower.  This effect is magnified by WA, but the math behind it is slightly more complicated and not worth going into since the perturbation is quite small.</div></div><hr />

Thats what I meant.  Thanks for answering it so quickly.  I am already working WA and this just helped cement my decision.</div></div><hr />

Mmmm, a weapon's delay would not affect the time gap in between procs, only its natural proc rate, and things that affect proc rate (Dexterity, WA, CE)</div></div><hr />

So which is it?  You can or cannot double-proc?  <br />
<br />
You cannot double proc on a swing.  You can double proc in a round where you swing multiple times.</div></div><hr />

A higher delay won't affect the overall procs per minute, but it can create more noticable gaps or &quot;dry spells&quot; of procs.  The more you swing, the smoother the distribution should be.</div></div><hr />

You cannot double proc on a swing.  You can double proc in a round where you swing multiple times.  <br />
People have asked for proof that you can proc more than 1 effect (as in an innate and an augmented proc) per swing.  Logs are worthless and getting a screenshot would take quite a long time to get because of how rare it is.  I'm going to ask people for proof that you can't.<br />
<br />
It's true you can't double proc the same effect on a single swing, if that's what you meant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that is not the question.<br />
<br />
--I'm going to ask people for proof that you can't.--<br />
<br />
How can you prove that something won't happen (short of showing the programming code that disallows it?</div></div><hr />

statistical significance in an immense sample.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I should restate that.  What proof could you provide to show that over long periods of time it has never happened.  Even logs and parses cannot show this to any degree of certainity.  It would be much easier in this case to prove that it can happen than to prove it can't.  I don't have augs on my weapons yet, so I can't say one way or the other, but I've seen no proof either way, either.  Alot of people seem to be convinced that it can happen and alot are convinced that it can't.  I'm just curious if anyone has proved either way yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By using empirical data, which is the reason for parsing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Link of a thread where a dev made a statement on the topic, perhaps?  I'll take a SS of it the next time I see it, but that'll be a while due to:<br />
1 - rarity of it occuring<br />
2 - actually noticing it when it happens through the rest of the battle spam<br />
3 - remembering to SS it before it scrolls off the window<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to why you're so sure it can't happen if you don't even have augmented weapons with innate procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaiel, maybe you should reread my posts.  At what point did I say that I believed it couldn't happen?  I flat out said (in the same sentance where I said I don't have weapon augs, even) that I don't know and was wondering if anyone had proved it either way yet.<br />
<br />
Let me say it again load and clear - Does anyone actually have any proof or has anyone seen any proof that it can or cannot happen?<br />
<br />
Why does everyone assume that because you are asking the question you are convinced one way or the other?  I'm asking because I don't know.<br />
<br />
PS - none of the parses I've seen here say whether procs are happening at the same time, just the amount of procs.  Is there a way the parser can tell?</div></div><hr />
