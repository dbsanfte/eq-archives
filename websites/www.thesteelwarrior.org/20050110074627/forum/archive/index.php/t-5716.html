<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild leader is frustrated with 1017 affecting people who raid on prime time hours.  He proposes and i quote <br />
<br />
 I've grown tired of the current instability issues with the servers. They always happen at peak time for ALL American players. Specifically those that play from 2:00pm to Midnight Pacific time.<br />
<br />
Sony has once again released an unfinished product. The new zones are buggy, the content is incomplete, and on top of all of that it's impacting the rest of the game. We have had to cancel raids because people were losing connection followed by numerous 1017 errors before they could get back in. I set a Guild MOTD, and it took nearly 20 minutes to go through.<br />
<br />
It's time to put a stop to this.<br />
<br />
What do I propose?<br />
<br />
A walk-out. Yes, a walk-out. This walk-out would be scheduled for Friday, February 20th, at 5:00pm PST. You can participate very easily whether you're able to log in to EverQuest or not. At 5:00pm PST on Friday, February 20th, 2004, CANCEL your account, and leave it cancelled until Monday, February 23rd, 2004 (or permanently, if you're so inclined).<br />
<br />
What will this prove?<br />
<br />
It will prove that you are what you are. You are a paying customer, that pays for a service and product that is not working. It doesn't matter what the EULA says about warranty. Your payment comes with no warranty of any kind either. So, speak up where it counts.<br />
<br />
If you support this effort first E-Mail me at daevin@cox.net and cancel your account on Friday, February 20th, 2004 at 5:00pm PST. All responses I get through e-mail will be forwarded to the appropriate individual(s) at Sony in such a way that will not disrupt their service. We do not wish to be like terrorists and bombard them -- we simply wish to have a voice. This compilation will be sent in a professional, and tactful manner.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take a lot of effort to protest something when you've been given a lemon. I don't know how people can sit idly buy after paying $13 ($40 for Stormhammer) plus the $30 for the expansion. I'm tired of it, but I'm only one person that they really could care less about -- I submit feedback daily. Do your part, and participate in this effort. We can get their attention! Just ask the warriors.<br />
<br />
Copy everything above and post it to any EverQuest related message boards that you frequent. Do not become a nuisance with it... if it's already posted, don't post it again. If you read this on a thread somewhere respond to that thread with &quot;I AGREE&quot; -- do not debate, simply voice your support.<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe this might start communication with sony or might not. <br />

<br />
Once again, nice try, but all it really proves is that you're not willing to cancel, and they've got you right where they want you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
somthing tells me that the motd for that guild is &quot;Friday 5pm pst cornav raid.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niev</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass is right, it doesn't mean jack shit if you cancel for a couple days since you can keep playing up to 30 more. <br />
<br />
What's all the bitching about anyway? A couple days of server instability isn't much to complain about.  So you can't raid one or two nights.  Get over it, it's not like they don't know there's a problem and aren't trying to fix it.  New expansions are always rocky, but they have improved.  Give them time to sort it out ffs, it hasn't even been a week.<br />
<br />
On a side note...Why aren't we allowed to post that we disagree?  Can't handle a differing opinion?  Afraid to find out  not everyone agrees with throwing a hissy over a little server lag?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I figured if i didnt post the whole thing, people will visit the site and flame that i didnt paste ALL the information.  Its really not a matter if you agree or not or if you can play for 30 more days or not.  IT gets flagged in their system that people have canceled and if enough people do it, they will notice something is up.  Its really more about the lack of communication between sony and its player base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the bitching. about 99% of the time, EQ runs just fine. The 1% it's messed up is when all the idiots hit the chat saying &quot; OMG I WANT A REFUND!!1!&quot;. Seriously, if it's such a thorn in your side, quit.<br />
<br />
I like EQ and enjoy my time online. Is it frustrating? sure it is, but it's not like Sony is purposely causing lag so they can watch thier customers act like idiots in chat. I know i wouldn't want to cause more headache on myself and those i work with by causing slow zone times.<br />
<br />
Shit happens. Shit happening on a weekend is even worse since they aren't at work. How would you like if you were home on a three day weekend and sunday night you get a call saying servers are fubared? <br />
<br />
My guild has it's time rotation this weekend. We haven't beat Quarm or Inny yet and we were close to winning last night on Inny when this shit happend. It's annoying as fuck because last rotation the zone crashed while we were tryin to kill him. Bad luck? ya. Annoying? hell ya, but all the days before that were just fine so why bitch?<br />
<br />
I've played this game for close to 4 years and nothing comes close to the enjoyment 13 buck a month  i've gotten from this game. Even with the small glitches here and there. If there servers are screwed up fora month, then i would bitch but 1 or 2 days, that's a bit much for flying off the handle.</div></div><hr />

They're worthy of going &quot;Hey guys, you know there's an issue, get it fixed&quot;.   It was only super bad last night, which pissed me off, but prior to that it wasn't so bad, so give em a break, they actually have pretty reliable servers for the most part considering their usage.   <br />
<br />
So, it needs to be fixed obviously, hopefully by tonight (for selfish reasons), and while SoE is at it, they should put a big popup window in front of every cleric in a raid that says *** DIVINE INTERVENTION IS DOWN ON THE MAIN TANK... CAST IT WITHIN 10 SECONDS OR BE EJECTED FROM ZONE***<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about other servers, but Veeshan has been struggling with the server shit and 1017s for most of the last week. You can tell when its bad because the server population goes from the top half dozen to the bottom.<br />
<br />
I don't think this is &quot;walkout&quot; worthy but it does get old in a hurry. Hopefully they can fix this soon (some of what I hear is that it is alternately related to GoD or that fucking casino that they can't get to work). After the recent spate of &quot;smooth&quot; launches of expansions we had to know a clusterfuck was coming our way sooner or later...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamce</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with previous posters, not worth a walkout.  I just wish SoE would realize that when it happens to as many people as this batch of 1017s that it is not all on our computers or our ISPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't play on Fridays anyways, and depending on the bender I go on I may not be back before Monday. Does that count?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's a good reason, but it's obviously not thought thru far enough.<br />
<br />
Cancel at 5pm?  Okay.  I'll bet those SoE fucks are out of the office by noon on fridays.  They aren't even gonna notice until Monday morning when you all reactivate your shit.<br />
<br />
Net result = Zero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would rather see a petition passed around that supports opening additional servers and/or splitting existing servers to spread out the population.  <br />
<br />
They're gonna fix the bugs (at least the more egregious ones) regardless of whether we cancel our accounts, and likely at the same speed too.</div></div><hr />

This is probably one of the best made and worked on expansions in a while, it's normal to have server lag for new stuff.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">legends does not have this problem. also, pvp servers dont. i speculate that the problem is the sudden influx of people logging on more and lvling a berserker or going to the new zones. basicly, where guild_001 use to take a night off from raiding after clearing time they are now raiding in GoD to crack the strat on the new content. or, &quot;i'm not raiding tonight, i guess i'll log on my berserker, and my 2-4 alts to PL him.&quot;<br />
however on low population servers, ie stormhammer, rallos, TZ, VZ, SZ, the problem is none existant. aslo, i noticed that my zone time it over twice as long (if i even make it zoning) on bristlebane as it is on SH or SZ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nord</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the EQ Tech Board - <br />
<br />
Hello everyone,<br />
Like many others, my wife and I were forced into a cycle of 1017 errors tonight after zoning into/out of GFay on Solusek Ro.<br />
<br />
After much frustration, I hit upon a potential workaround. Now this workaround does not stop you from crashing while zoning. It may, however, get you back in the game MUCH faster than waiting for the server to boot you.<br />
<br />
1. Restart EQ (and/or get back to Server Select screen). <br />
<br />
2. Rather than selecting the server you were just booted from, select ANY other server and hit the &quot;go&quot; button (&quot;enter world&quot;, whatever, you get the idea).<br />
<br />
3. A message window should pop up telling you &quot;You already have an active character on &lt;your server name here&gt;! Would you like to continue playing as the active character on &lt;your server name here&gt;?&quot; And it will give you a YES/NO option.<br />
<br />
4. Tell it that you want to play your active character, and it *should* start loading that character. Worked for us anyway.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps get some of you back in the game quicker.</div></div><hr />
