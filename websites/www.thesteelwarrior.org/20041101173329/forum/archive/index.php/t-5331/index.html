<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vendak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not quite sure what I should invest my 330k into to upgrade my warrior.  I've been pondering more ornate and a Stonewood bow.<br />
<br />
Going price seems to be ~100k for ornate bp and ~45-50k for gauntlets, ~35k for bracers, ~90k for boots, legs are almost never avail, as with helms.  Probably can get a stonewood for around ~120k,<br />
<br />
Any advice on some gear in addition to some of those, or in place of them to upgrade my warrior?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With a Vindi BP, I wouldn't even think of spending money on an Ornate BP mold.<br />
<br />
With that kinda money to spend, and stonewood bows going for 120k on your server, that would not be a bad option.  Not having to switch in a bow for your range item, and the poor availability of good hp range items, especially one with AoB, I would buy one.<br />
<br />
See if you can find a crystalized acid bracer, or a steel ring of earthen resistance, amygdalan's chain mask, or even a helmet of rallos zek for sale.<br />
<br />
Other than that you are looking good already for purchasable gear.  Ornate is not that big of an upgrade for someone who can wear fierce heraldic, especially considering the price if you are going to buy the molds rather than camp them.<br />
<br />
But those are just my opinions, others may say I am crazy or offer better advice ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are often playing with no shamey or beast lord the clickey 36ac/300hp buff from the BP would give you more hp from a single piece than perhaps any other piece you could buy and a signifant AC boost.<br />
<br />
If you dont have a clickey haste item the ornate gaunts would provide you with a minimum total haste of 61% (unless I am mistaken).<br />
<br />
On my server a while ago when I purchased a bow I got an alternitave bow, I got a featherwood because I needed the AGI and RM that it provides more than the bonuses the stonewood would give and it was about half the price. The featherwood also has teh same 10 sta and 100 hp.<br />
<br />
The helm of RZ would be a nice AC boost and 40 extra hp the only bad thing is that it will take most of your pp.<br />
<br />
Most ornate is such a minor upgrade thats it is better not getting it and saveing for better items or doing LDoN missions for the nro armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you buy this plat or what?<br />
<br />
You've got a greatblade of storms, you're obviously geared well enough to just camp the ornate, why even think of buying it?<br />
<br />
Get a AoW helm and call it good.  Spending money would be a real waste considering that what's droppable is campable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I fell into 230k myself the other night (sold old livestone greaves).  I'd advise that whatever you buy make sure its droppable.  Why? Becuase as you upgrade via LDoN/the odd raid you can then turn around and re-sell the item.  Your gear as such becomes a store of value.<br />
<br />
Ornate in my opinion is the LAST thing you should buy.  Basically you are destroying your pp.<br />
<br />
In the line of thought I would suggest:<br />
<br />
1. Black plated collar<br />
2. Stonewood bow<br />
3. Amy Mask<br />
4. Barbed Rubi Pauld<br />
5. Boots of Storm<br />
<br />
Obviously you can't get all of them (or maybe you can I don't know yer server).  Also remember with GoD coming out that generally with the release of a new expansion that generally you see price deflation as new substitute items are introduced into the market.  If you can hold onto yer pp til then it may go ALOT farther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Helm of RZ.<br />
<br />
It's really hard to surpass the quality of that single item, and it's usually ~300k on most servers.<br />
<br />
It's like putting a level 30 warrior on your head.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My megelo is basically &quot;best of bazzar&quot;, well at least on SZ where we dont have any of the higher end smithed items.<br />
<br />
Thats an interesting theory about not getting ornate because you cant resell it. Its true enough but at some point you start using no drop items, and have to, if you plan to improve. You can do it with ornate or wait.<br />
<br />
My theory is basically get the ornate in the slots where it has good effects. The BP is a nice self shield and the legs are also good if STA is not maxed, I have those buffs up all the time. Those of you who dont have a pocket chanter might go for the gloves.<br />
<br />
I think Iv spent like 1.2 mil on stuffs and I have 200K in bank right now and there is just nothing to buy anymore on my server.... <br />
<br />
Looking for belt of raging nature but never seen one for sale...</div></div><hr />
