<br />
I am level 52 I have a dex of 110 unbuffed<br />
<br />
WHich weapon should i put in which slot.<br />
<br />
Right now I have frosty in off hand, but then some said it may not proc as much (on allakhazams)<br />
<br />
But I also read i want the faster weapon in primary to increase off hand swings<br />
<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A weapon tries to proc whenever it tries to swing. So being in the offhand only limits procs based on how often your Dual Wield kicks in.<br />
<br />
*But I also read i want the faster weapon in primary to increase off hand swings*<br />
<br />
This is not true. The DELAY of the off hand weapon increases off hand swings. Each hand works seperately.<br />
<br />
Since you don't get a damage bonus in your off hand, I always try to keep the best ratio there, or put the proccing one in the main hand (so I don't have to rely on dual weild to get in a decent proc rate)<br />
<br />
Hope that gives you some idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if im not mistaken the guard mallet has a ratio of 18, so standard wisdom would put the mallet in primary and the frosty in offhand as it has a overall better ratio and to maximise dps.<br />
<br />
do that and see how it works. if you find your not holding aggro so well, then put the frosty in mainhand.<br />
<br />
another alternative is to rotate during fight by hotkeying the primary and secondary slots. put frosty in main and rotate it to secondary once it procs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Put Frostbringer mainhand and mallet offhand.  The ratios are almost the same.  The Frostbringer will proc more in onhand because onhand swings more.  The 60DD proc from the Frostbringer should make up the miniscule edge the Mallet would have in DPS at 52 without procs.  Also, more procs = more aggro = better tank.<br />
<br />
The reason it will proc more in onhand is that onhand always swings when the weapon delay is up.  Then a double attack check is made to see if it swings again.  In offhand you have to pass the dual wield check (which I am swagging at 50-60% at 52, no data to back it up).  If successful it tries to check double attack.<br />
<br />
If you find you don't want aggro I would suggest you bag the Frostbringer for a 2 handed weapon without proc's or another procless weapon like the mallet.</div></div><hr />
