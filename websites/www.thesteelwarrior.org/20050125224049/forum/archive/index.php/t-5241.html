<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deathdealer</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing alot of LDoN since it came out and I've had tons of successful adventures in BBM (and alot elsewhere, but the majority have been in BBM). I am nearing 1150 BBM adventure points and I noticed a nice haste aug that will be available to me soon. It's the: Gravestone Fragment of Flailing Dead (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24132). I am interested in this item because I'm thinking about attaching it to a Formed Sand Sculpture (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25636) and selling my Custom Cowl of Mortality and using the cash for an upgrade to a better helm. I'm thinking about an ornate helm and I'll most likely have some cash left over for other items that I've got my eye on as well. One thing though, I am currently level 59. So - <br />
<br />
Since I am level 59, and the recommended level of this item is 65, how will this affect the haste on the LDoN haste aug (36% haste on it)? Will there be a drop in my haste percentage? If so, know how much?<br />
<br />
Also, what are your opinions on this haste item, ornate helm or better? Is this a good idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

This will give you a better helm than ornate and let you put a better item in your range slot. This will also save you a lot on the ornate helm on top of cowl. You could put the money toward an elemental bow at 61 and you'd be hooked up.</div></div><hr />

Until the wayfarers set up a returns counter i wouldn't spend a 1150 point aug on a 200ish point item. RA Helm is something that can last you quite a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Why buy a sub 30% haste item when he can get a 36% haste augment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well because<br />
1) You can get a better item in the current slot<br />
2) You can get a better haste in another slot<br />
<br />
In which cases you dont get a refund.<br />
<br />
Beeing 59, it also means that he will make a total gear change at 65.<br />
Thats one 1500AP item that will be lost. And 1500AP aint cheap or easy to get.<br />
(Ac7 sta5 36% range is Piece of Shit at 65, and you also lose the bow).<br />
<br />
Now 36% is a lot better than 28%, but with ench haste, that difference is minimal.<br />
(Both DPS &amp; Agro wise, with shaman haste there is a small difference).<br />
<br />
Good LDoN haste items cost over 4K AP. And are 65 to use.<br />
He's thinking about putting anger3 on a SSoYkesha<br />
Bad bad idea. Specially if you look at it on the long run.<br />
<br />
If you really want to make a LDoN haste you have plenty of choices.<br />
But putting 1150AP on an item with 7ac 0hp is stupid.<br />
That item will become useless very soon.<br />
<br />
Now cloack/belt/helm all have pro &amp; cons for LDoN haste items.<br />
<br />
My advice would be to either get :<br />
- Seb Berserker Cloack<br />
- RuneBranged Girdle<br />
- Soulscream Belt<br />
<br />
These are not the best haste around, but you have some flexibility.<br />
And above all you are not tied to a shitty range item for your haste.<br />
<br />
Edit PS : Takish Helm + Haste is a VERY nice idea.<br />
(Leaves room for a decent cloack &amp; heavy rubicite girdle).<br />
But it also means saying no to AoW helm on the long run.<br />
And these arent too hard or rare if you ever enter a raiding guild.<br />
(Good legs are impossible to find btw /hit ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your not in, or planning to be in, a raiding guild you still &quot;in theory&quot; could get a Helm of Rallos Zek at some stage (lucky ornate drops or something for bazaar).  <br />
<br />
While a Tak bp would be near irreplacable ?<br />
<br />
And I wouldn't put the haste item on a 7ac item, it has to be something thats going to last...</div></div><hr />

If you're going to spend a lot of points in an augment, put it on something with good stats. Also range item haste is very annoying when/if you need to use a bow for pulling or whatever.  If you're worried about points, you don't really have to buy takish armor.  You wanted an ornate helm...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent some time lately debating between Miragul's and Tak armors.  And I've been coming down pretty hard in favor of Tak.<br />
<br />
I originally purchased Tak because I hope someday to tank Hard adventures, and felt I needed every advantage I could eke out of my visible armor slots (I'm not in a raiding guild, nor do I have time to be at this point).  Additionally, in order to get the AAs I need to tank Hard adventures, I'll end up doing enough LDoN runs to afford Tak armor.<br />
<br />
But looking at the difference between the Tak and Miragul's armors, I realized something else; if somebody offered me a Type 1 augment that provided 4 AC, 15 HP, and 6 to any stat or resist, I'd gladly pay 732 AP for it.  And that's what the difference amounts to.  <br />
<br />
Admittedly, I wouldn't buy that augment right away.  Given the option, I'd buy full Miragul's armor, and then upgrade to Tak armor as I could afford it.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
But while &quot;twice the points for 4 AC and 15 HP&quot; sounds like a lot, &quot;732 AP for a type 1 augment for 4 AC, 15 HP, and 6 to any stat or resist&quot; doesn't sound nearly as bad.  At least, not to me.<br />

If you are a raider that is using LDoN gear to fill in weak spots until you can replace them with raid gear, I think Miragul wins out.<br />
<br />
Something to consider is whether you are actually going to get all that tak armor.<br />
<br />
1492 x 8 slots = 11,936 points = 234 normal adventures.<br />
<br />
If you're averaging 10 a week it will take you 6 months of LDoN to get a full set of armor, and you haven't augmented it yet.  By then there will be 2 new expansions out and who knows what kind of gear you will be able to get.<br />
<br />
I'm tellin you, anybody that says Tak armor is unfair to raid people don't know what they're talking about.  Gearing up in LDoN takes a LONG time.</div></div><hr />

Now 36% is a lot better than 28%, but with ench haste, that difference is minimal. <br />
<br />
8% is a large fraction, which I would not consider minimal, personally.<br />
<br />
Good LDoN haste items cost over 4K AP.  <br />
<br />
The best LDoN haste item costs 1140AP, about three weeks of dungeon crawling for me.<br />
<br />
And above all you are not tied to a shitty range item for your haste. <br />
<br />
LDoN Gravestone Fragment of Flailing Dead will go into Head, Waist, and Back as well as Range.<br />
<br />
A free 36% Haste augment makes considerable sense to me, especially when installed into a free Helmet of sterling quality, leaving two more aug slots available to further improve the Helmet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best LDoN haste item costs 1140AP, about three weeks of dungeon crawling for me. <br />
<br />
The reason it costs 4k for a good LDoN haste item is that you have to buy an item which has a slot 3 that goes in one of the 4 slots that this augment can fit. Range is kind of out of the question since you can do so much better in other slots. So this leaves 4 haste options really. Tak Helm, Mir Helm, Guk Belt, Tak Cloak. Fully augmented Tak helm costs 3.8, Mir Helm 3k, Guk Belt and Tak Helm 4.3k. The best of those options being the belt and cloak which cost over 4k. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think the Cloak is the best item to put that haste augment into, however, the helm seemed to fit into the original poster's plan better. I think the question on the helm comes down to play style. If you think you will get a RZ helm at some, don't get a LDoN hrlm. If you don't think it will happen, that helm is about as good as you're gonna see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutul sez:<br />

<br />
Mmmm.  It's for precisely that reason that I'm augmenting a few slots fully before buying all slots.  And why I bought Ornate where I could afford it and it made good sense (both wrists, for the Vengeance; the boots, if they ever come down below 100k).  It's hard to beat fully aug'd Tak armor short of VT or the elemental planes, but it's pretty easy to beat (or at least match) unaug'd Tak.  <br />
<br />
Actually, with GoD coming out in just a few weeks, I'm buying nothing (neither with AP nor with plat) until we see the effect of GoD loot on prices.  Consider what happens to the price of a CoF, for example (which has held its value quite nicely for the past few expansions) if there's a good single-groupable 36% haste item in GoD.<br />
<br />
Speaking of haste items, ShaikYerbooty says:<br />
&gt;Originally posted by EmiliaEQ <br />
&gt;&gt;Now 36% is a lot better than 28%, but with ench haste, that difference is <br />
&gt;&gt;minimal.<br />
&gt;8% is a large fraction, which I would not consider minimal, personally.<br />
<br />
Mmmm.  Careful, there.  8% greater item haste does not mean 8% greater damage.  You've got your base damage (100%), your enchanter haste (68%), and then your item haste (28% vs. 36%).  Total damage is 196% vs. 204% of base damage.<br />
<br />
Although this may be wrong, the sources I was able to find indicate that the haste cap (modulo bard songs) for level 65 is still 100% haste.  So it's actually &quot;Total damage is 196% vs. 200% of base damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is only a 2% increase in damage.  While noticeable, it's certainly not the 8% you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Note that this (the haste cap) also implies that a 32% haste item is just as good as a 41% haste item in any group containing a 65 enchanter.  Kind of useful to know, given how much easier it is to get a 32% haste item than a 41% haste item for us non-raiding types.</div></div><hr />

CoF for example (which has held its value quite nicely for the past few expansions) <br />
<br />
Off topic, but it's amazing how a few items have remained good through an incredible amount of mudflation.  I am personally going to wear a cloak of flames into the elemental planes, and there are a few items like that.  When you compare it to the other old world items, which are generally sold to a vendor these days, that's pretty amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sony has always had a bizarre relationship with haste.  Think about the weapons that were top of the line when the CoF was new.  7/28 with a proc?  From Nag himself, a 9/25 piercer with a summoned-only proc?  9/25?<br />
<br />
Consider the difference in DPS between a rogue wielding a 9/25 and a rogue wielding a 17/19.  It's not just twice the damage or three times the damage. <br />
<br />
Now imagine a haste item that would provide the same advantage.  A 120% haste item?  Maybe 130% haste?<br />
<br />
Availability for haste items is bizarre, too.  9/25 piercers or better now drop regularly off Luclin trash mobs.  Imagine if 36% haste did the same.  Nobody would bother killing Vox and Nag at all, because there'd be no market for their loot.<br />
<br />
Haste items have not been subject to mudflation because Sony has not used them as the pull to make people buy a new expansion.  They've used new spells, new AAs, new levels, new weapons.  But they haven't used haste.  Mudflation happens for two reasons: an economy where no money or items ever leave, and SOE's need to have each expansion be slightly more powerful than the last to draw players in.<br />
<br />
If Sony ever needs to sell an expansion that nobody wants to buy, all they'll have to do is put 36% haste, no drop items on trash mobs at the zone-in.  They'll sell one copy of the expansion per active EQ account.<br />
<br />
I hope they never get that desperate.  It's nice to have at least one kind of item in the game that's still a challenge to acquire.  On the other hand...it's more than a little silly to have the best haste you'll ever need dropping from mobs that I could solo without breaking a sweat.<br />

It appears to me that the new Tribute system is designed to siphon a lot of money out of the system.<br />

Will be interesting, maybe even amusing, to see what happens if people really buy into the whole Tribute thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, an LDoN hat with a haste augment looks very nice, and as a bonus you could go sell your CoF for plat to buy something else.<br />
<br />
However, as a night-blind barbarian, I do love my ornate hat.  Plainsight rocks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't tell ya, never seen a haste item with a reccomended level on anyone under 65, and I don't know what the effect of it would be.  I know that the solstice earring has a reccomended level, but the FT1 effect starts working somewhere below that level, even though the stats aren't maxed out yet.  Not necessarily meaningful, but it's the closest thing I can think of.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry too much about it though unless you are planning to take a really long time to get to 65.</div></div><hr />

Actually that is very nice... Being type:any, you could put it on any belt - LDoN or otherwise. It bums me out that no one ever seems to want to waste time or effort on opening chests and things.</div></div><hr />
