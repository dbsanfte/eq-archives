<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoedog</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
I play on a PvP server and was fighting a ranger and a shaman.  Im lvl 65 with all skills maxed.  For some reason I was being disarmed every 10 seconds or less using one or two handed weapons while I couldnt disarm the ranger once.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of some disarm trick thats out there?  Its rather frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just know from playing around in a PvP area, disarm works pretty well on other PCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoedog</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ranger disarm skill caps at 55, warriors at 200.  I was disarmed at least 5 times in the brief fight; I disarmed him not once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play on a blue server, but duel a lot, and I can say for certian that disarm works about 50% more often on PC's then it does on NPC's.  It is a very useful tool for dueling and PvP and I use it every chance I get.  Nothing is more annoying then having to look trough a bunch of bags for that weapon while your snared and still getting beat down :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, i didnt know rangers where capped so low on the skill.  Beats me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disarm is worthless IMO.  Even if it works 50% more on PC's for PvP, its still the second most retarded skill we get right after beg.  I have maxed out my disarm and I can go up to some level 30 npc (the ones on the druid hill in EC work well as an example) and sometimes have to hit disarm for like 10 minutes before it finally works.  That is just rediculous for a skill it took forever to max out.   <br />
<br />
Anyway, I find it very hard to believe the ranger could have disarmed you every 10 seconds without somehow cheating or being the world's luckiest person.  Its just not likely IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarn_Rider</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Tested this on my Ranger Main(65 Ranger), against my Warrior friend(65 Warrior)<br />
<br />
I wanted to see if it was really worth me, as my warrior, even bothering with this skill.....<br />
<br />
We stood in the bazaar arena for a while.... and attempted to do nothing but disarm one another for a while, maybe 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Not once did it work for the Ranger, dozens of times tried, all within range and such....he got his to work not once on my Ranger, but I did see him do it once to a monk, from behind....<br />
<br />
Worthless skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On mobs disarm is almost totaly useless because a mobs weapons do nothing out side of procs or a very minor decrease in delay if the weapon is faster than the mobs normal delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe you can disarm magic weapons from NPCs any longer as well, hence the reason almost all weapons on NPCs are magic flagged even if they are vendor trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note: when mezzed, you can still disarm. Much to the chargin to the enchanter who strayed too close to me when we were playing around with a duel. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember reading that disarm adds a small amount of aggro.  Is that not true?  If not, I'll remove it from my &quot;Big Taunt&quot; /do ability series hotbutton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoedog</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So no one knows of any hacks in existance for disarm?  Cause it sure seems one must have been used on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PinaduzRZ</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I PvP a fair amount on RZ server.  Disarm is an essential skill in PvP here.  Sometimes it takes players a minute or more to realize they're hitting you with no weapon in their main hand.  Disarm is especially useful if the other player is considerate enough to stand toe-to-toe with you, much more difficult to use if jousting.  Kick/stun also works in PvP.<br />
<br />
My experience has been that disarm generages a small amount of aggro, but will certainly not taunt a mob off another person.  I use it primarily on mezzed mobs, along with taunt and/or incite.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only time I've seen disarm be useful or 'to be avoided' is when you wanted to disarm a fine-steel dual weilding Djorn in Sky...  and not useful when fighting archers in echo caverns (they hit harder when you disarm their first bow).<br />
<br />
It does have some taunt value associated with it...it's not large...but you can pull with disarm, even if it fails, so it's got SOME aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know disarm will make a mob agro you, but I don't believe it adds to agro after that from my experiences. I don't even hotkey it unless I'm in the arena messing around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dissarm is far from useless in PvP<br />
Its actually one of the main utilities we warriros get against other mele classes and even disarming caster had advantage of decreasing their stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for disarm aggro:  It will make a mob aggro you, but it does not give any real hate.  Varaho did some tests, which I confirmed with my own, that show that if you are on the mobs hate list, you get nothing in the form of aggro from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was playing around with disarm trying to keep agro with just disarm while a cleric was CHing me.  While it wasn't quite enough just by itself I distinctly remember pulling agro off of the cleric after disarming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoedog</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, there IS a disarm hack out there.  My lvl 18 rogue was disarmed numerous times fighting other players.  Even with in 5 lvls of me that means a lvl 22 disarmed me.  No classes get disarm that early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cant disarm a NPC with magic weapons (which is like 99% of the mobs I fight) and sometimes, disarming them is even worse, because their h2h ratio is higher :p<br />
<br />
On PvP I did it many times, I used to play around with my druid friend and I disarmed her and she nuked me.... funny good ol times...</div></div><hr />
