<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xiphos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My magelo is current. I'm looking to be able to tank WoS content at level 66. Thanks in advnace for any assistance.<br />
<br />
Big areas I'm looking at changing are BP, Leggings and Face slots.<br />
<br />
I'd like to fill the BP and Leggings slots with ornate, but should I fill in with something else untill I have the cash? (leggings are 50k, bp is 120-160k on my server)<br />
<br />
Was going to do Magnetic, but since it's a filler item, I'd like something sellable when I'm done.<br />
<br />
Also, do you guys suggest me completing my Strength of the Elements quest to replace the Mantle of Distraction? I've got several pieces already. Biggest problem is the Annimated Construct flanking the Guardian of the Seal. Normal group can take the construct, but not the guardian. Since the one I need is the cleric (guardian's right hand side) it's hard to single. We can single the wiz spawn easily, since he corpse camps.<br />

Stonemite Carapace Mask (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26082)<br />

Legs and BP are fine till you get better. Main thing i see is AA's are needed. Also when you start exping in WoS when a named drops nothing but a Lore Nodrop item with no stats roll on it. It makes very nice armor for you. Quest can be found somewhere on here. I think Brutull started it. BP piece would be off of Velitorkin and Legs piece is off of that red demon looking raid encounter in Velitorkin. Pyrique Redwing or something. Keep an eye out for open raids on em for chances at the quest piece. The armor is very worth it for you level of content. Better than ornate a little less than Elemental but has nice ac which should be your main concern at this point. <br />
<br />
Also keep an eye out for Discordant Scoriae and attunable augs and Slugworms. Get all these and get a GM Poisonmaker or Alchemist friend to do some combines and you can get yourself a 40% haste aug and ditch that Seahorse belt. <br />
<br />
I agree with Bruenorg get some Horn Spiked Shoulders if you can. its &gt; than SotE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes the horn spiked are better. Also look at the Loyalist Sheild Quest. 50 AC back slot.</div></div><hr />

You can single pull the construct with a necro or using a shaman's pet.  If you pull him down the same wall ( near the invisible doorway, but not too close or you'll get adds) you can fight him there and echo and GoTS will not get involved.</div></div><hr />

youve got to have REALLY high pottery for that quest, im not lookin into it for a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klopo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">youve got to have REALLY high pottery for that quest, im not lookin into it for a while<br />
I did it with 122 pottery, which is not very hard to get.  The combine was not trivial and i failed once or twice, but you do not lose the main item on a fail and  the other pottery supplies can be bought right in katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The result for the pottery wasn't no drop when I did the quest either.  Had a friend do the combine since I didn't have any pottery skill at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spockmaster,  I paid someone 200pp to do the combine for me.  You don't need much of a skill like the above poster said.  Loyalist Shield is fantastic upgrade.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;youve got to have REALLY high pottery for that quest, im not lookin into it for a while&quot;<br />
<br />
I did mine with skill at 15 bud.  You always get the sketch back so just try till you get it...think i failed it like 10 times then got it. And if i remember correctly the last combine is no fail.<br />
<br />
Even so, Pottery is cheap to raise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">nm then heh...everyone ignore me! :p<br />
<br />
i think i WILL look into it then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got my shield with a pottery skill of 1, it raised to 2 when I got the successful combine. Getting the ashes is the only hard part of this quest the rest will take you &lt;3 hours even with a pottery skill of 1 :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>arganax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye I did the loyalist shield quest with no prior pottery training.  The only thing that isn't returned on a fail is the vendor bought stuff which costs like 4sp or something ridiculously cheap like that.  I agree, only hard part, heck, I bet the rest of the quest could be soloed by a 65+ warrior (I duoed the quest with a cleric friend because we both wanted it.)  However, do not underestimate how much of a pain in the ass getting those ashes is.....</div></div><hr />
