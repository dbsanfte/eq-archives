<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please see my magelo.  I am usually about 7500/1500 when tanking for my group, level 65, 25 AA's, CA2, CS2, ND1, PE.  I play with the same four folks.  Cleric is also level 65 at 4600 hps, 1200 ac, 4500 mana pool, FT6.  Shaman and enchanter are level 65 geared similiarly, slightly larger mana pools I believe.  They all also have about 20-25 AA's.  Of course our dps is somewhat low, but we can add a fifth or sixth to our group, we oftentimes group with a couple wizards and/or a paladin.<br />
<br />
Should we stick to other zones and gain some level's and AA's or are we ready to progress to RCoD and start gaining some of the gear that is available there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spaztic</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do it.  Did it at 65 with 12 aa with about the same hp/ac as you (actually less).  Go try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruenorg</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't consider going anywhere near the place without having all of the essential defensive AAs done (LR5/ID5 at the least).  If you can consistently do hard LDoN's successively then the trash might be doable if you're all on your A-games but expect lots of medding inbetween.  The named will likely tear you a new one in short order.  My advice would be to stick it out elsewhere and get those defensive AAs done.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What named are you planning on tanking?<br />
<br />
You could probably handle Murkglider Deathsting (quad 900), but not Souldrainer (triple 2560 + 750 AE). The named and their abilities vary widely in this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spaztic</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't wait.  Go do it now.  Whats the worse than can happen?  You die..big deal..try it a few more times and if its just to rough, go back to wos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RCoD names comes in two flavors.  The first flavor is like the regular mob with more HPs/damage that'd be appropriate for being slightly higher level.  If you can XP there you can tank those.  The second flavor hits in the range of 2Ks and tend to have powerful AEs and significantly more HPs.  You'll obviously not be able to tank those.  I don't have an exact list of what's what but if the named is red to 70, chances are it's the latter type not the former.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking along the lines of Bowhound that drops nice caster ranged item and Granitesmash that drops nice caster ear I believe as well as a +10 AC aug.  Another mob, Opal something or other, that drops a nice caster ring.  I already have a BBC, so no need to go after that named unless it has other drops that are good for our group.  I'll look at some of the other mobs also, but curious about those ones specifically.<br />
<br />
I thought WoS was actually harder than RCoD, is that incorrect?  I haven't spent time in either zone, have spent quite a bit of time in NC, HS, and in BF, and some time in the instanced zones...  but haven't spent any time in WoS or RCoD.  To be honest, the crowded nature of WoS really deters me...  but if it's easier and we can get some nice upgrades there I'm up for giving it a try.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice.  There's a few other drops we would like to get from NC and from HS, so maybe I'll try to finish up CA and get a point or two into LR then move into WoS and RCoD, or maybe I'll just give it a try now.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do instance in Dranik's scar, should be better for you.<br />
But honestly, if you're mainly looking for exp, I think you would be really fine chaining BoT or Tactics...<br />
<br />
Would be a good idea to finish your defensive aa before getting more lvl, but that's up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that WoS is easier than RCoD in general. The harder side of WoS is a little harder than the easier portions of RCoD but RCoD ramps up to be pretty nasty as you get away from the central area.<br />
<br />
With your stats you're going to spend a lot of time cr'ing if your group isn't really on the ball. For whatever reason, attempting to group in RCoD ends up being a trying experience for even much beefier groups just because of the fast running mobs, roamers, trained named mobs, and frequent LD's.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm sure you can handle the trash, and the easier named as described by phantron, as long as you can keep control of your camp.<br />
<br />
I'd say go for it and see if you like it, cr'ing RCoD isn't generally a big deal, and at least your cleric won't have to run through nobles causeway naked :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcast12</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game isn't hard, go there and try it, you will die a little more than normal but if you use defensive on the named you'll be ok. Start with Granitesmash and Foul camp (easiest - 800 hitters but they cast a lot), then move to Labourer, Ungi, Bowhound and Bowguard (average - 800 hitters). I doubt you could handle Stonetooth or Deathsting (tough - 950 hitters), forget Tiorpat and Souldrainer (very tough - 2k hitters). The problem with RCoD is I have never seen someone get a group, everyone there brings a group as the &quot;ubers&quot; use is as their plat farming ground.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend you some more AAs, they really make a big difference. RCoD is not the zone to start exploring OoW IMO, especially if you dont have all the Defensive AAs. The mobs there quad frequently and the spikes can be very nasty.<br />
<br />
You can try hunting the entrance, there are golems and Nocs, I would bet the Nocs might tear you up. Our group has 2 warriors, my friend which is lvl70 and like 400hp over me, and me, I get to 9300/1580 or so buffed. We noticed the difference between the Nocs and golems, they are a harder cheese, not sure the deeper mobs yet since we didnt go there much.<br />
<br />
I would recommend you to do Dranik Hollow expeditions, if you can tank the Hard ones (lvl68 ones), then I recon you could try RCoD. The expeditions have nice loot and runes if thats what you are after, and you can camp the nameds without anyone bothering, great to oil up the cogs of your group and get your cleric the new heals, makes a big difference :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arnie</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 9200/1604 buffed (no pal/bl buff), and I've tanked all the &quot;normal&quot; named in RCoD (this excludes SoulDrainer and Ukun Fleshhunter, whom are pretty tough).  The main thing was getting used to CHing at 50-60% instead of 30-40%.  The damage is pretty spikey.  I'll stay at 60-70% for 6-10 seconds, then take 4K in just a few seconds.  HoT spells really help until the mob gets slowed (partial slows on all mobs there)<br />
<br />
The first four named (Granitesmash, Dragorn Laborer, Bowhound, and Ornia the Foul) are all very doable, and always single pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOW has followed a very very very nice choice (and really wise towards pal/sk) for the named :<br />
<br />
MOST NAMED ARE NOT HARER THAN TRASH  (just have a bit more hp in some cases).<br />
<br />
Which means that if you can grind there (or survive) you could tank a named.<br />
Disc makes it easier &amp; safer.<br />
<br />
So far i have killed named in : WoS MPG Rift RCoD and havent found them harder than trash.<br />
<br />
PS : There are some exeptions, beware :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you should try it.   I'd recommend a cleric that you know and a backup healer like a shaman or druid.  I'd say it wouldn't be &quot;easy&quot;, but it's also not going to probably be the hardest thing you've ever done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would stay out of Ruined City of Dranik for a while.  Lots of other good spots for you in OOW.  The trash near zone in and a little ways in towards middle are not hard and yes, the lower named are similar to the trash in difficulty.  You probably could tank these mobs most of the time.  However, I have found that the damage is very spikey and you will find yourself porting naked to your bind point on a regular basis..<br />
<br />
I  have camped the center part of zone several times (underneath the big bridge, not  far from where warrior epic quest mob spawns).   Some mobs it seems do not even hit you, then you get a trash mob of the same type you have been killing and it just rips through your hit points.  <br />
<br />
That said, I think this is a spot where how well your group works together, and how balanced it is, is very important.  Mobs run up at Sow + speed and your group has to be able to handle the incoming mobs without slowers and mezzers dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendler</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do it.  I did it at 65 lvl 7700 hps and 1400 ac.  I helps to round out your group with a druid for heals.  Get a good puller for singles or you will wipe for sure.  Go do it but don't be scared to do osme cr's.  Its more fun to be on edge than sit there falling asleep.  Make sure to get your healers to start early at first so they can get the hang of it.<br />
