start redoing xegony again, and maybe get her to farmstatus mode.<br />
<br />
We wiped 3 times to &quot;Prismatic Gardian of Xegony&quot; agroing.<br />
<br />
The weird thing is, they did not agro PC's, they assisted wave bosses.<br />
Which followed a &quot;non normal&quot; pathing. And sometimes warped. <br />
(At least thats what the 6 SoS rogues &amp; 3 monks that were<br />
ther scouting party said).<br />
<br />
Has the pathing is the lair ben changed ?<br />
Has it happened to you ?<br />
Do you think its &quot;working as inteded&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

Before when you'd agro them they could only come out the front, and would generally sit and spin in place. With some of the pathing changes they'll come right out now if you get close enough to agro them.<br />
<br />
Seems like they can get some social agro too from the waves pathing through the center.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A week or so ago we had the same issue. It seemed Xegony's Guards were assisting the bosses of each wave. After the first wipe we just ended up killing them each add. I think it happened on 3 waves of the fight. Just make sure you can keep the guards out of your MT camp, and its not really too much problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Fixed a bug with the Xegony encounter in Plane of Air.<br />
<br />
I thought for sure they mentioned it again with regards to pathing changes but after looking through the patch messages was unable to find anything. <br />
After this change it took a couple of attempts to nail this encounter down again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you figure out how to beat the pathing changes, the entire encounter from pull to finish will take you less time than it does to run the entire Fennin script.<br />
<br />
Its brutal on the clerics to count and press a button for 40+ minutes, but I consider that nothing compared to what we are looking at for the Rathe encounter.  And for the non-clerics, it actually a lot of fun.  At least I think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kildace</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The adds pathing was indeed changed, nothing to do with Xeg herself tho.<br />
It takes a little fine tuning. And it makes you hate the fight even more :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah they looked like they might be having a good time - all I know is I got to stare at the chat channel for 20 mins &amp; press ch really really fast a lot.<br />
<br />
Probably the luckiest guy is the bard playing manasong at the clerics - he can start it up after pull &amp; go watch a movie!</div></div><hr />

For the non clerics and non tanks you mean :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You no longer get as many Prismatic Guards adding.  For a while it seems like 3 of them would come with every wave.  They can still come, but usually in manageable numbers (1 or 2).</div></div><hr />
