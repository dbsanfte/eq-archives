<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We beat it a while ago, but the final Noqufiel event seems much much harder now after last patch and we are having trouble reflagging it. Anyone beat it in its current state?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We've done it twice since the change...First the day it was swapped and again last night. We haven't had any real problems with it -- It's a bit harder, but it's a good fix to the gimping of splitting them and telling them apart. They were never meant to be split the way people were doing with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finally got reflag over with. I was starting to think version 2 would be impossible to us, but we got it done with a new strat. First time I have seen people cheering like that in /guildchat cause of a reflag hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The new version is overkill imo. As an isolated raid the 2 noqs are probably fine, but the event comes AFTER 2 (at least for the raidleader) very demanding parts(stonemites+cursecallers). By the time you are at noqs some people are already dozing off.<br />
<br />
We tried it today with like 10 apps and 10 botted people. Ran out of time before we could finalize a plan for the new version since we used alot of time explaining tactics on stone mites and cursecaller events. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I think they should make 2 changes:<br />
<br />
1) Remove the summon ability from the Noqs so you can pull/place them without getting totally fucked up by summon. Kinda sucks agroing one Noq, then getting summoned by his linked buddy.<br />
<br />
2) Make them immune to root(you have to do that if you remove the summon ability).<br />
<br />
That way I think the raid would be just a tad more fun, and less chaotic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Headboss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We beat it, few days ago, its hell lol. But it really tests your entire guild + tanks + attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We beat it, few days ago, its hell lol. But it really tests your entire guild + tanks + attention.<br />
<br />
Ditto, and indeed it does, lol never seen so much chaos, but thats what it was intended to do from the developers mouth  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think its a bit overkill too. You could remove or change a couple of the features of this particular fight and still have a pretty challenging encounter. But at leasts its doable. First time you see it, I think you will get another impression  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rampagious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We downed this guy a few nights back. I admit, at first i thought he was impossible  but after much strat revision and a for freakin ever long fight we managed him. I like challenges but feel this event is unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The event is as it should be. Hard as hell. We beat Noq on our third try at him ( this was after he was made harder also).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the event is fine.  and they shouldnt remove the summon ability from those mobs imo! <br />
<br />
I hope they dont nerf this event &lt;3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Beat it again last night. Other than the fight being longer (hence more of a drain on mana) there wasn't much difference from before, since we didn't know about sploiting/splitting them anyway heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got our first win on it tonight, great fight once you get the strat worked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Triangle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">how do you tell the two Noqs apart?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There's no way to tell which Noqufiel is real.  If there is, it's not intended.<br />
<br />
That said this doesn't stop people with coming up with theories on how to find the right one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Midasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is the most fun event in the entire game, and it should be hard.  It requires a lot of teamwork by tanks, as mentioned by someone in the Uqua thread.  And at least backflagging isn't as much of a dreaded task as it was in POP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What scares me with this event is the fact that they seem to love banishing mobs a bit too much (see Txevu too). Banishing mobs aren't fun. Banishing mobs that banish every few seconds are just plain retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">AAaaaaand its been gimped hardcore now. Grats whiners!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">AAaaaaand its been gimped hardcore now. Grats whiners!<br />
<br />
Care to explain? It sure didn't seem 'gimped hardcore' last night...  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh, it's gimped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shrug, imo its perfectly tuned now. <br />
<br />
Hard enough that event 2-4 in combination will keep non-txevu ready guilds occupied for several weeks or more. Easy enough that doing the monthly reflagging wont be a total pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
Dubb: AE range was changed from 150-something, to 80. And a small subtle change to the Mirror image when it appears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Detonation range is 80 now.  I didn't notice anything special with the mirror image.  Noqufiel seems to have less HPs overall which is actually a pretty big deal given his regen, and I don't think giving more HP makes him more challenging.  It just means the battles drag on way longer due to his already considerable HPs (probably 20 mins fight even now) on top of his regen.  It's not like the fight changes whether it's 20 mins or 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">his regen seems faster now.  maybe lowered his hp, but kept hp/tick regen the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">His HP is less, his regen is less, the ae is smaller.<br />
<br />
He is gimped.<br />
<br />
The fight is VERY VERY easy now.<br />
<br />
What a joke. Barxt is a tougher fight IMHO now. No contest. We beat this last night and it was so easy I got bored &gt;&lt; This fight used to be an edge of your seat true challenge to the best guilds in the game. Now its a snooze fest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Andrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The regen isn't any less dude.  You are mistaken on that one for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Its less simply due to the fact his HP is less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gundahar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can't say it's simplified now. We killed him yesterday in our 4th attempt, needed maybe 2 weeks at all due to the lockout time. So from first to fourth one was no really difference. This event is more a matter of teamwork and the strat sorta simple: be fast, keep your tanks alive and let noone die. I guess this also works if he would have more hp, considering the clerics don't run oom. Well and for the ae range, we had eat a lot of it but its's nothing which makes the difference between victory or defeat.<br />
<br />
All in all it's a great event and I'm looking forward to Zum'Muram.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFLMA what?<br />
<br />
Come on, less HP, regen lowered to compensate for that lower HP, AE range on mirror reduced.........<br />
<br />
How else could of it been nerfed?<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate to break it to you, but yes, its a pathetic fight now vs how it was before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The regen is faster, his hp is lowered. I believe they upped his damage spike as well, all in all it seems to be about the right difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fight was never about hard / easy anyway, it was about control. I shouldnt have to fight for 90+ minutes to gain access to a new zone, was it fun the first few times? Sure, but albeit very time consuming and retarded for a fight to be that long after the first couple of attempts. I wouldnt be opposed to them upping his HP to make the fight right about 40 minutes but anything past that is just too repetitive. <br />
<br />
The fight as it stands now is 20-30 minutes depending on if you need to recover. Otherwise leave it be.<br />
<br />
Besides, the changes to the other events should keep those that are not ready for Txevu out of it for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Friend of mines guild got him 20% on their first attempt at him ever last night, sorry thats too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Andrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Seems about right now to me. And yes, my guild completed it before and after the latest change.</div></div><hr />
