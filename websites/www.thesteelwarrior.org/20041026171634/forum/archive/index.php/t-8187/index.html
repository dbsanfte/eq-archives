<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K I'm realy beginning to hate shrimp.We get the ae waves down pretty well,although, some minor problems with nameds entering the ae camp during these waves occur.The root group often seems to get beat on a bit.When you guys pull the named after ae waves  are down do you bring them single or split tank?<br />
<br />
Also,when we charge Corinav were not dealing well with the hordes of respawn at his location.Do those adds start to respawn as soon as they are put down or when the last named dies?The last time we went we had suffered too much loss in dps prior to engage and with local respawn during fight  got punted at 30 pct.Today we paused longer after last named and when we engaged were engulfed by the mother of all trash armies and wiped... :confused:</div></div><hr />
