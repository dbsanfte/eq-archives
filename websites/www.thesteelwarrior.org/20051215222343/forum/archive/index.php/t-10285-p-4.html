Big fun. Or when im stuck in the looting position for another 30 seconds. I can move around, jump up and down, all that, but I stay in the kneeling position till it releases me and says I cant loot that even though its my kill. Then I just click on it again and loot it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, Blizzard is doing a much better job of it than I ever saw from Sony.  Are they doing a perfect job?  Hardly.  Could they do better?  Of course.   But from where I stand, given the choices in the market, I'll gladly take a couple of days of credit on my account over some jackass like Smedly posting somewhere saying &quot;Oh ya...we're real sorry about that.  Uhh, we'll look into it.  Or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sounds an awful lot like &quot;I'd rather have my left nut cut off then my entire torso.&quot;  To many folks this isn't about making the best of bad choices.  It's about analyzing the individual product, World of Warcraft, on it's own and noting where it's deficient.  Right now, the game is fucking deficient with respect to server stability.  Doesn't mean I think its better or worse than Sony/EQ (although if you want my opinion, it's way fucking better, both in terms of content and customer service - although I don't personally remember having 2-month periods of time where server stability was an issue with EQ). <br />
<br />
I am happy that Blizzard has made some of the choices that it has made.  For instance, holding back additional copies until the server issues are fixed and allowing one-time free character transfers to less populated servers.  Of course, this also means that I have friends who are trying to get copies of the game and play with us who simply cannot right now.  If this continues they will either grow bored and utterly exasperated with the wait and move on or they will purchase the game eventually and be deeply disappointed when they are level 1 and the rest of us are level 60.  In other words, I think the right choice was made but I am still not happy that a choice was required in the first place.  Better if they could get their act together and have things working as smoothly on the server-side as they are on the content-side. <br />
<br />
In this post you recognize there is a problem, you just think its better than when we were living with Sony.  Well, Haass, I don't think comparing anything to Sony is a fucking compliment, regardless of whether the game wins the comparison.  Compare it to our best expectations.  Right now, the server stability is lower than my best expectations, but better than having my torso removed.  Get it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that EQ set the standard, I think it's more than fair to say that it is the best expectation, and that's where we disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My server seems to be fixed. Color me satisfied! Seriously, can you name a single game that DIDNT have problems on release? /hears crickets chirping. I didnt think so. Why should WoW be any different? At least they move fast to fix the problem, and make up for the lost time by extending our subscriptions. Thats the sign of a great company imo. There is no such thing as a flawless release, shit happens, get over it. As long as I see blizzard working hard to fix the problems, im personally more than willing to cut them slack.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and of course right after making that post, they take down my server for a 2 hour patch, then run into a problem that kept the server down for at least 3 extra hours. Not sure when the servers came back up, at 1 am I went to bed. Ah well.</div></div><hr />

At least 1/3 have quit from every server and some couldn't afford to lose that many. Go ahead and anty up that $75 for a server transfer if you wish to play EQ though and on an empty server. Sony wants the $$ without providing the service.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me I remember this happening to Karana back in the early days too.</div></div><hr />
