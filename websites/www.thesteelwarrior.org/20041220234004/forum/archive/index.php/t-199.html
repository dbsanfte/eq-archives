<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dusting off the old warrior and I need to get him some upgrades. I am trying to get him PoV worthy asap with a combination of level + gear and I know I can buy gear faster than I can level. Know the next 3 items I buy are going to be clattering bone neck, forged shoulderpads, and heavy rubicite girdle.<br />
<br />
I have pretty good rings and earrings, a Windblade,  and CoF for haste so that leaves me mostly with armor upgrades.  Dwarf and Dragon faction is shot and I really don't want to do the faction switch thing again. Warlord's MQ is rarely on my server so that is pretty much out.<br />
<br />
What upgrades am I missing? I have seen Brellium for sale from time to time, but it doesn't seem like as good an upgrade as the FH armors. Ornate molds are ungodly expensive and I would rather not spend that much. Any tier 1-4 tradeable items that I can get with a single group? It seems like I will be going with Brellium legs, bracers, and boots, but I want to make sure that is the best path before shelling out a bunch of plats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh Well....maybe next game :D  I'm sure you'll make out okay !!</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately the Brellium stuff is the best bang for the buck that we get.  I bought it just until i could get better stuff.<br />
<br />
With your current gear/aa you might have a bit of trouble at 60+ tanking there, but after your upgrade path you should be ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might want to sell your Windblade, and Cloak of Flames for some spare platinum, you will want HPs in every slot, as well as another 100 AC or so.</div></div><hr />
