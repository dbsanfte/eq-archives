<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Beta for OoW is open guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh only open to those who have pre-registered and received their account keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Given how past open betas worked, that is probably a bug and will be resolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or, not a bug, but &quot;open&quot; beta closed and could be a way for people who preorder to join at any time?<br />
Just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Creatuure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Signed up, they sent me an email on how to log onto beta server and what not.<br />
<br />
:))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The form did not ask for OoW account keys the first few hours, so if it does now, its probably intentional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ashrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shrug I was able to log on last night to the char select screen  But I haven't been able to log onto the forum yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have pre pregistered but got no CD-key. Is that a bug or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone have the link to the signup page?  Must be blind or something, I've checked the eqlive and OoW site and I'm not seeing it... <br />
<br />
*rubs eyes*<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ashrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it's closed now remf<br />
Apparantly it was only open a few hours.  I got lucky and got in but i guess they hit their target number pretty quick, cause it was closed only a few hours later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Keep in mind that you signed an NDA when you entered the beta, and thus you will post nothing here that you saw in beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ashrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ummm yeah....<br />
I'm not even a warrior, but I was a little surprised it wasn't posted on here to begin with, which leads to the question of if an appropriate number of high lvl warriors made it into the beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am doing beta, and I'm sure the number of warriors is proportional to any other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd wager the lack of much news fanfare is they're doing it LDoN / GoD style - as in nothing but betabuff people who don't know what they're doing, with 1% actual testing playerbase sprinkled on top. Same old, same old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You lose your wager.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I made it into the beta, along with a number of my fellow guildmates. Of course there are loads of beta buffs on there atm, and will be until they copy characters over, which Im not sure has happened yet (havent logged into beta since opening night). Ill likely wait until my warrior is there before really taking a good look around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Keep in mind that you signed an NDA when you entered the beta, and thus you will post nothing here that you saw in beta. <br />
<br />
Which will lead to the same craptacular results other &quot;black outs&quot; have had.<br />
<br />
Quality issues will always result when they limit conversation's by a larger audiaence before hand.  Yes I know this is the same post I made before PoP, LoY, LDoN and Omens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scurian Toanfro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Speaking of the NDA, in the light of Sony's new emphasis on player relations, I'll really be interested if they'll keep the NDA in effect until the day it ships like they did with GoD.  I swear, I should have seen the writing on the wall and realized there was a reason they did it.  I think if non-raider would have known what GoD was all about (especially at release) a lot of people wouldn't have wasted the money.<br />
<br />
Yes I realize they've done quite a bit to make GoD more non-raider friendly but even given the recent improvements I still wish I hadn't been mislead into thinking GoD was for everyone.  And I do feel I was mislead.  I know I for one, and I'm sure there are many more like me, won't be so fast to go out and buy an expansion where I won't be able to even sniff over half the &quot;content&quot; unless I'm a raider (and yes that goes all the way back to PoP).<br />
<br />
I know, it's all been said before in several other threads and I just caught myself thinking I'm really going to get slammed for this post but oh well.  I appologize for possibly derailing the thread. <br />
<br />
Getting back on topic, in the end it really doesn't matter to me either way, just a curiosity really.  I have to admit I don't have any intention of buying OoW so the beta being open to preorders doesn't really help sway me in any way.  <br />
<br />
The one thing that could possibly sway me to think OoW may be worth buying would be if Sony were to lift the NDA a couple of MONTHS prior to release or *gasp* not even have an NDA AT ALL.  THAT would tell me that Sony really wants to open up the lines of communication with the players.  If they keep the NDA on until just prior to release again, the only thing I can assume is that they're again trying to hide what the expansion is all about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">a staggering number of my guildmates are in the OoW beta. The weapons they gave rangers on their are lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ashrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah when I made my betabuffed froggy paladin (waiting for my paladin to be copied over) and logged it on I was a little surprised at choice of weapons.  2 of them were ok but one was just ... bleh.  I guess it's all ok stuff with the beta char's .  I don't think this is violating NDA either as it's known there's a /betabuff command and that it was used a lot in the last beta.  I dunno I guess the setup for the beta char's is better this time around.  You don't have time equipped beta buffed 500+ aa chars with no exp testing content.  At least to me from what I read about last beta and this one that basically most of the beta char's are at least avg chars that you could expect to see running around on a live server.  /shrug<br />
And as stated before I don't think any of the above violates the NDA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ashrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wanted to add, that without violating NDA, I will say I've seen guildtags on the server, one of these guilds is high end and relatively known.  So they do have some high end people there to test also.</div></div><hr />

I second that :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many &quot;uber&quot; guilds had invites extended to every member to come and beta test.  Cats in Hats have a strong showing atm, as do a couple others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wanna know what's funny?<br />
<br />
I'm in the OOW beta and didn't even apply.  Just got an e-mail saying &quot;Hey, congratulations, come test our crap.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's quite the screening process they got there.</div></div><hr />

They are and they wont lift the NDA.  The NDA is supposed to be to limit &quot;competitive risk&quot; by not allowing functionality to be seen by competitors.  <br />
<br />
SoE distorts this by using it to hide the flaws in their games from their general user populace...a very deceptive tactic.  They limit their financial risk of people not buying the expansion because of &quot;quality craptacularism&quot; by just squashing the truth under the guise of NDA.  <br />
<br />
This has been proven by the PoP, loY and God release and the realtive POOR quality that was hidden from the general EQ player by this process.</div></div><hr />

Yea, and they nerfed Slay Undead!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I got into the beta at the last minute.  Didn't everybody?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I try to /betabuff warrior 70 .... broken.<br />
<br />
So I /betabuff warrior 65 ... it works.<br />
<br />
So I log onto my big fat stoopid Ogre Warrior ... he's wearing a full set of Kizraks.  /sigh<br />

The resident uber-guild of Drinal, btw.  fwiw.  ymmv.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's also got a Dain ring, a 17/20 offhand, anathema, and fucking 1400 atk unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Also, all of the beta buff toons i tried had more AA's than me, but less useful ones overall, so I really don't have any desire to play them.  (warrior has no LR, ID, or SE, Shaman doesn't even start with fucking Run 3, SCM, SCR or any healing aa's...wtf)<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm bored with it already and I don't give a fuck, so won't be doing that.</div></div><hr />
