<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fieldweeble</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing a bit of research on the beg skill, and have discovered that beg ticks mobs off. Begging from guards will occasionally stack up enough hate to the point that they beat you down. Since then, I've added a macro that goes like this:<br />
<br />
/attack off<br />
/useskill (beg #)<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
with my usual set of keys. It may not seem like much, but every bit helps. Any other warriors out there use beg along with taunt to keep the mobs angry at you? Perhaps some feedback on the real effects of beg? I'm not sure really, so responses would be appriciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyxander</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I read something about this on eq.castersrealm... but it was written in the type of poor grammar and D00d this is 1337 phrasing that makes me doubt if it works for sure.<br />
<br />
But that guy also mentioned sitting down for a split second while begging.  <br />
<br />
He called it ghetto taunt.<br />
<br />
I doubt it works, personally.  But I have no data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">generates VERY SMALL aggro on failure.  As you do it however, your skill goes up and you fail less.  It's not an answer for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I understand when you beg one of 3 things can happen<br />
<br />
1) You beg succesfully and get a few coppers.  No agro / taunt is generated<br />
<br />
2) You beg unsuccesfully and get no coin and no agro / taunt is generated<br />
<br />
3) You beg unscuccesfully and critically fail.  You get no coin and some small amount of agro / taunt is generated<br />
<br />
The bad part is the higher your beg skill becomes the less often you will critically fail so the less often you will generate any taunt.  In summary beg seems to be worthless for taunt</div></div><hr />

Wheeee!</div></div><hr />

No real difference with our without it in my taunt hotkey that I saw.</div></div><hr />

Beg is probably more useful as a pulling tool than a taunting tool.  Actually, never mind, it's just useless.</div></div><hr />

After reading that, I decided to run some tests.  I had 2 chars, warrior and rogue, mob is a guard in EC.  Warrior pulled with prox aggro then ducked for the remainder of the test, rogue meleed with no main hand (non weapon in main) and empty fist in offhand.  After a few punches, rogue had aggro and ducked also.  Warrior taunted until he had aggro, rogue hit again to grab aggro back (one hit, so he was a tiny bit higher) and ducked again for remainder.  Warrior then proceeded to beg (0 skill for the entire first test).  After 40 begs, mob was still on rogue, though at beg number 23, the guard did give an aggro message.  I then did the exact same test to a scarab (just to do a test against a mob that you can't be successful on), and I had the same results, minus the aggro message.  Though I did get skill raises up to 4 on the scarab.<br />
<br />
My conclusion would be that the only critical failure on the first test was number 23, and the rest were just normal (non aggro) failures.  Basically, 40 tries, at the beg skill level that is most likely to get you a critical failure, and the mob didn't even glance at me over a rogue who was only a tiny bit higher than me in aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting test, Hussar. I think maybe it needs a little tweaking to be definitive, but it's a good start. If you decide to test it more thoroughly, maybe we could put it in the Library so we can point to it when people ask about beg aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I once begged a copper from Lucky the Begger in highkeep.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, the very rare critical fail begs are worth like 1 agro max. You have to turn off attack to beg. If you miss one swing every 100 begs you're losing more agro than you'd gain. Stop begging, it's pathetic and stupid=P</div></div><hr />

Thank you.  <br />
<br />
One of us should have done this one a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Delete that beg hotkey and make room for something useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;/ooc Can anyone give me some plat, PLEASE?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not that I doubt your test, Hussar.  But begging generates ALOT of aggro from me...<br />
