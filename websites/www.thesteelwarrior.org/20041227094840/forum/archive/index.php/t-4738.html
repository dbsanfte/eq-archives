<br />
there is slot 7 of  FT, Regen, Vengance...<br />
<br />
Does anyone see any other obvious missing augments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
+DMG augment for the type 4 slot.<br />
<br />
Procs are all well and good, but I'd love to see a +1 or +2 DMG augment available to be put on ANY weapon.<br />
<br />
Cheaper versions of the meat and potatoes stats boost augments.<br />
<br />
Howbout a 200 or 300 point +10 hit point augment that you can put in any slot? The casual players would love to see something like that implemented. And the hardcore players, well, they'd load up on a few 10 pointers here and there but still spend time grinding towards the 40 pointer.<br />
<br />
On the upper end, I'd like to see better augments too. Like a 50 hit point augment.  Obviously it'd be expensive.<br />
<br />
Armor Class augments.<br />
<br />
There are some. But they're pretty restrictive. The idea here is they should be more flexible.<br />
<br />
A nice 5 AC augment you can put anywhere.<br />
<br />
A cheap 3 AC augment you can put anywhere.<br />
<br />
Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Give people more choices on how they go about augmenting their gear.<br />
<br />
And of course, I'd LOVE to see an INCREASE in the drop rate on the dropped augments in the adventures themselves.<br />
<br />
I've seen ONE +12 HP augment drop in about 50 adventures.<br />
<br />
ONE? That's pathetic.<br />
<br />
I've seen maybe 3 STA augments.<br />
<br />
I've gone three or four adventures without seeing ANY augments drop.<br />
<br />
These are all no-drop. Why keep them at a trickle? Let us have FUN augmenting and re-augmenting our gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about a plate armor set that's warrior friendly? Maybe 150hp/ 0m on the bp instead of 100hp/100m. And what's up with zero dex on the entire suit of Royal Attendant? <br />
Since the LDON armor is bought with AP, not dropped; there is no chance of it rotting. This should have been a perfect oppurtunity to add more class specific armors. Instead we got the same old one size fits all, War Pal Shd Cle Brd/ All crap that is a huge reason for the narrowing ac/hp gap between classes we have been complaining about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about good 2handers?<br />
<br />
Actually looking at most of the differances between EF armor and Myrmidon (HoT armor) and the fact that for warriors only EF is inferior to Ornate, we do take in the shorts on the one plate fits all armors in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Still have to grind 10 more wins out of NRo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obvious augments that Sony missed ?  How about no-fuckin-mana required HP augments?  I HATE the thought of having to save up a shitload of AP, just so I can blow them on HP augments that have equal amounts of mana, which I will see zero fuckin' advantage or benefit from, while damn near every other class in the game will.  For a number of slots, HP/Mana augs are the only HP augs available.  That's bullshit, and no issue concerning LDoN has pissed me off more; not even the all/all armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to see a few class specific augments for all classes.<br />
<br />
Like, Cleric should have access to a good improved Healing augment that is cheaper than the ne for all the classes, since it's their prime focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taliefer</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree, paying for that 20 mana on the 20hp/mana augments piss me off no end, its pretty retarded imo, there should be 20hp only augs for a couple hundred less points imo.<br />
<br />
meaning: 20/20 aug for 1150, 20hp aug for say somewhere between 700 and 950. i dont see anything tremendously wrong with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Type 7 waist augments drop as loot and inside containers.  Normal adventures drop 31% haste, hard adventures drop 36% haste (at level 65 of course).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chests always have seemed to be more of deathtraps... of course most warriors use the Absor-Smash technique of opening them.. :D <br />
<br />
As to what I would like to see in LDON, specifically off the merchants... <br />
<br />
It only seems like a natural progression...<br />
<br />
<br />
Type 7 - Haste 21%   510 pts (all non-armor)<br />
Type 7 - Haste 26%   760 pts (all non-armor)<br />
Type 7 - Haste 31%   1150 pts (all non-armor)<br />
Type 7 - Haste 36%   1492 pts (all non-armor)<br />
<br />
Type 7 - 10 hp  340 pts<br />
Type 7 - 20 hp  510 pts<br />
Type 7 &amp; 8 - 30 hp  760 pts   (ARMOR SLOTS ONLY)<br />
Type 7 &amp; 8 - 50 hp  1492 pts (ARMOR SLOTS ONLY)<br />
Type 7 &amp; 8 - 60 hp  1492 pts (WAR ONLY, ARMOR SLOTS ONLY)<br />
<br />
Type 7 -  5 AC   340 pts<br />
Type 7 &amp; 8 - 10 AC  510 pts<br />
Type 7 &amp; 8 - 15 AC  1150 pts (PLATE ONLY, ARMOR SLOTS ONLY)<br />
Type 7 &amp; 8 - 20 AC  1492 pts (PLATE ONLY, ARMOR SLOTS ONLY)<br />
<br />
I cannot see how any of these would be over powering at all, considering you have to choose between one or the other.<br />
<br />
Along with many others, I really think that making melee classes buy hp/mana augments is a slap, especially with how expensive they are...<br />
<br />
I would also like to see the rest of the focus effects Level 4 put on augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i heard a rumor that a 5ac 20hp aug was gonna be implemented during the melee patch to make up for the 20/20 aug now. Not sure how true that is, but i'm holding onto points atm just in case.<br />
<br />
now, personally, i like not having a purchaseable 41% haste aug. There should be some sort of reward for those of us who spend countless hours raiding.<br />
<br />
i mean, if you could just buy all the best stuff, why even make high end content?<br />
<br />
i do think they should add other fun items in the game such as illusions but only as a one time deal. since illusions are already common to get, what harm would it be for someone to pick one race they wanted and spend some points on a clicky buff or worn illusion item. i'd be willing to spend points on that. hehe<br />
<br />
or maybe add particle effects to our weapons. BoW w/ druid leaves! hehe<br />
<br />
there is alot of potential for augments really and i just hope they get a bit more creative with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An augment I wuold dearly like to see, would be one with Shrink (worn)<br />
<br />
Oh, and some 2H slashers with same ratio as the 2H piercers that are already in, would be sorta nice, since warrior Pierce cap is lower than the rest.</div></div><hr />
