I am saving my points for this BP and was wondering what the current thinking<br />
re Augs<br />
<br />
Slot 1      10 AC<br />
<br />
Slot 2      40 HP<br />
<br />
Slot 3      Veng 111<br />
<br />
I could swap the AC aug for Sta aug but am usually maxed with buffs<br />
any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thx all<br />

I would prolly go resists or a stat that you are really low on for the slot 1.</div></div><hr />

TY looked it up AC np go for chest<br />
so will add other stat<br />
also what about dodge aug? is it worth putting it in?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dodge aug (I think its modifier is 8%) is probably worth it more than vengence 3 aug.  If I was doing it I would put the dodge aug, a 40 hp aug, and perhaps a +10 charisma aug if there is one since you will probably max out the melee stats with high level gear eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dodge mods have been shown to be almost unparsable, such a minimal effect as to almost be able to attribute to the RNG.<br />
<br />
Also, all the augs from Tipt are ALL slot, thus usable in slot1 for LDoN pieces.  Theres 30hp/end, 30hp/mana, and AoB.  Looking at your gear you probably won't be seeing Tipt anytime soon, but something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binbar</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK <br />
Thanks all <br />
thats what I was worried about with dodge aug <br />
if difference was noticeable<br />
and Jaqyl I wont be seening Tipt for a long time lol<br />
but I can always upgrade Slot 1 then<br />

<br />
What about the 15 AC augment from Ferubi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 15ac from Ferubi isn't slot 1 so it too can't be put in the purchased LDoN visible armor.<br />
<br />
I think the best bet is just use one of the +6/7 dropped augs until you get to tipd, as far away as it may be. Spending points on +3 to a stat just isn't worth it imo.</div></div><hr />

1) Buy a LDoN BP<br />
2) Put the 40hp Augment into Slot 2<br />

3) Go To Barindu &amp; Farm Tipt Mama Lizard<br />
4) Add &quot;Gem of Bolstered Power&quot; (30hp 30mana) to the BP<br />
5) Add &quot;Sparkling Gem of Protection&quot; (30hp 30end) to the BP<br />

TADAAAAA ac69 200hp LDoN BP.<br />

Ps : 6K+ minimum to even hope surviving vs Tipt Mama Lizard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true.  You can farm the maternal cragbeast with four people, three if you have balls.  Enchanter, Ranger, Healer, Tank would do fine assuming the tank can handle trash mobs.  I'm using Healer and Tank as nonspecific intentionally, they don't have to be a cleric and a warrior, though that would probably work best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. +7 agil aug (hey it was gonna rot so why not loot it and stick it in till i have something better)<br />
<br />
2. +40 hp aug<br />
<br />
3 +8% dodge aug<br />
<br />
Ok, sure I could have gone regen or atk on the 3rd slot but ya know, I am sometimes MT, sometimes ST sometimes RT and oftentimes offtank for my guild so I guess those negligible misses will add up someday  :p <br />
<br />
...I hope<br />
<br />
Anyway, its a nice placebo, and I like to attribute the occassional OMG I'm still alive after the mob misses me like 3 rolls in a row while a late heal is coming and my Furious and Def disc timers are down and boom heal hits and i'm still in it :) to my combined avoidance abilities<br />

How to farm the Enraged Maternal Cragbeast<br />
Group:<br />
1 bard<br />
1 cleric<br />
1 enchanter<br />
3 &lt;insert class here&gt;<br />
<br />
SoE was kind enough to put a pooka at the base of the hill just before the mama lizard ring - this is the key to winning. The trick is to get an instance that has as few dogs as possible before the bridge. They are the only mobs that see invis before the bridge. Get a good bard to pull any dogs that are in the way and kill them at the zone in, any good bard can cherry pick single mobs easy. Once the dogs are dead invis up and run to the middle of the bridge and kill the wanderer golem. Then clear up to the lizard ring, don't forget to charm the pooka. When you trigger the mama lizard, have the bard preslow, then send in the pooka. Loot, leave expidition, rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />

(and just put the aug drops from adventures in the slots for now)</div></div><hr />
