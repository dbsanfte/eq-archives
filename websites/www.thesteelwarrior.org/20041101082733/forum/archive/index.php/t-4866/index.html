<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i have my gut but wanted some feedback on what to aug.<br />
<br />
Current setup:<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
BOC with anger 3 primary, SOD with anger 2.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
Needless to say Im happy with my agro atm but, here i am with <br />
enough points for anger 3 again.<br />
<br />
Here is my thoughts my epic 2hs is bagged atm, but its the best one i have besides a silly GSOT for 1k.<br />
Im elemental atm but no one has BOW yet and im way down the line to get one, if ever. MAYBE someday id get a shot at a SEWS, but I'm not a fan of rune agro for snap agro anyways, though its a nice piece.<br />
<br />
  I miss 2hs but, epic dont hold agro the way I liked in the past.<br />
With new incite skill who knows give it a 2nd chance?<br />
<br />
Option #1<br />
Destroy current anger 2 on SOD, to put anger 3 on it and be an agro demi god and tell the noobs no agro for jooo for life?<br />
<br />
Option #2 hold out for Bloodfrenzy or Hategiver for the<br />
ultimate agro ( dw 2 eb's with anger 3 on each ).<br />
<br />
Option #3 slap anger 3 on epic<br />
<br />
Option #4 Hold out for a (LONG) time for a good 2hs to put it on.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it depends what your tanking. for exp groups and ldon, i think your fine with boc  &amp; sod with your current augs as they are, plus our new hate toys.<br />
<br />
however i dont think you will be tanking stuff in ele and up much longer with a DW setup. so i would save the points for a good 2 hander and slap anger 3 on that.<br />
<br />
if your looking for a decent 2 hander and cant wait for bow or sews maybe pick up an ornate greatblade or something like that.<br />
<br />
as to whether you should put in on epic i guess its down to preference. your gonna lose a bunch of dps doing it though and i cant really speak for resist of the epic proc in ele planes. for pure aggro you may be better off auging a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take 2 groups and kill General Druav Flamesinger. He is very very easy to kill in PoF and drops a very decent 2HS ( Ornate Greatblade).</div></div><hr />

Hahahahahahahahahaha<br />
<br />
Good luck on ripostres with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't aug an epic.  It's sad that a 100p bazaar weapon is superior in dps and aggro, yet it's true.<br />
<br />
There are tons of 2h out there. . .35/24 from saryn's bird, the greatstaff of 4 winds, obsidian greatblade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25997) from solro tower, ornate greatblade as listed above, etc etc.  If it were me, i'd go for the obsidian greatblade or the greatstaff of 4winds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What the hell is the deal with this &quot;snap agro&quot; crap people spout? Either you HAVE/GET agro, or you DON'T. Rune3 on the SEWS does produce a decent amount of agro. I have a SEWS and would NOT trade it in for a BoWar because of the damage absorption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rune is more of a small area effect agro while anger III is direct hate. You can't really compare the two, as said above the rune also mitigates a bit of damage per proc.<br />
<br />
As for original q, save your pts till you get something better or start HP auging your gear / buying out tak armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get a Greatstaff of the 4 winds and Anger aug that sucka!  I only have Heated Blade on mine and I LOOOOOVE it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Riposte damage starts making a very noticable difference without parsing starting in tier 2 and higher planes, so you'll want to be using a 2 hander unless you particularly enjoy needing a cleric CH chain following you everywhere just for XP groups. :P<br />
<br />
I've got an un-auged GSoT right now, and I'm happy with it. I'm considering saving up for a ykesha proc so I'll have a good XP group weapon, but the dual stunning/knockback procs probably wouldn't be good for raids :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Riposte damage starts making a very noticable difference without parsing starting in tier 2 and higher planes, so you'll want to be using a 2 hander unless you particularly enjoy needing a cleric CH chain following you everywhere just for XP groups. :P This is simply not true. The riposte discussion has been played out several times and the only time that there is a significant amount of riposte damage is on high end boss mobs (2500+ hitters). Otherwise, the actual increase in mob DPS is no where near as high as people make it out to be and certainly not enough to make a significant difference in healing. My warrior tanks tier 3 just fine with BoC+GBoS and he doesn't need an extraordinary amount of healing, and he has relatively low AC (1400ish).<br />
<br />
As for what to augment, I would wait until yuo got a suitable weapon to augment. Your 1h set up is fine, replacing Anger 2 is not going to make a very big difference. I would assume you have recently gotten in to the elems, give it a few weeks. If you don't get a SEWS, you will certainly have an Ornate Greatblade forced on you sooner or later. No point in wasting the points with vastly superior weapons in your grasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd like to go full time 2h, don't get me wrong. Just an aug'd bf + boc &gt;&gt; aug'd bbb for agro generation. I haven't worried about ripostes in an xp setting since.. never really. More agro output = faster shit dies = overall damage alot lower then riposte hits (in an xp setting of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">seriosly...wait for a BoW then aug that sucka....what u got for agro should be fine for now....specially if you're not #1 tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I tank EP bosses fine generally with duel wield setup; Riposte might make a small difference on mobs like General Reparm, but it is exaggerated imo. <br />
<br />
When you are not MA ing, try fighting a mob from the front and see how many ripostes you get, it really isn't that many. <br />
<br />
If you really want to get down on ripostes on bosses just don t kick or slam and/or replace SoV with say ornate gauntlet haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jesus Christ is Riposte over-rated. Seriously, do you people really believe that you need a BoW to tank EP crap? There's warriors in PoTime tanking without 2H's(pre-DBotW).<br />
<br />
Riposte. Is. Not. That. Big. A. Deal.<br />
<br />
 Please stop talking like DW is akin to suicide. It's really really really really stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Only thing I will say w/dual wield is...<br />
<br />
Don't use charge while dual wielding and at 35% life when a mob is about to enrage...<br />

*ouch*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We used to have a lot of warriors that dual wielded in our guild. . .*sniffs*  They're all dead now!  *bursts into tears*<br />

DW will always be viable; however you had better have the hitpoints etc to deal with those ripostles.  The people who are complaining about DW ripostels &quot;typically&quot; (at least in my experience) don;t have the hp's defense ac whatever to absorb the damage anyhow.  I fall into that category myself.  There are many warriors who do have the hp's and defense to deal with this damage and for them DW works fine.  <br />
<br />
DW or 2h doesn;t really matter it's all where you fit in and where you are comfortable.  One thing is for sure your guilds clerics will let you know if you would benifit from 2hs or DW becuase they can;t keep up with healing you.  <br />
<br />
I prefer 2h on LDoN simply because usually casters kill DS well after i announce them in chat, enrage sucks, LAG kills, and lastly i seem to get better aggro waking mobs with 2hs.  Your experience may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As luck has it, I recently was awarded a Ornate Greatblade.  <br />
<br />
Funny how life is, guild is going through a regroup phase.<br />
<br />
So now its the only 2hs I would use low agro dps for raids when im not tanking.  I'll Hold out for a sews or bow to aug a 2hs.<br />
<br />
Sigh, so I decided to re-aug the sod anger 3, poof done, having said that it's that much easier to lock down agro in any situation with my d/w setup. <br />
<br />
Someone once said there is no such thing as to much agro,<br />
and I agree.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the imput all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GroovinFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok, after reading this and several other threads I'm STILL not sure what would be a good 2HS to aug with AngerIII.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I am on Firiona Vie and can buy almost anything.   I am also far, far away from EP access.<br />
<br />
Here is my question - Would an Ornage Greatblade with AngerIII be a good aggro weapon, or would a BBB from Seru be better to throw AngerIII on?  <br />
<br />
I am thinking of aggro lock (insomuch as that is possible) for raid encounters.  Heck, I'd probably use it in XP groups too, no reason not to.<br />
<br />
What do you all think?  One of these two, or look for something else?  I have a GSot4W, but it seems to me I could aug something &quot;better.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Any input appreciated!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ripostes are a MYTH<br />
<br />
90% of warriors will not be affected by the &quot;riposte nightmare&quot;.<br />
<br />
The reason is simple, 90% of warriors will rarely encounter <br />
situations in which you will get killed because of that riposte.<br />
<br />
Ripostes become really DANGEROUS when you reach a ratio<br />
that is clearly above 15 % of your current hp.<br />
<br />
Max hp / Mob max hit = Ratio<br />
<br />
If you have 7khp and fight a mob that hits for 700.<br />
You are not in real danger. <br />
You will very rarely see CH for over 6K.<br />
That extra one hit from the riposte, will very rarely kill you<br />
<br />
If you have 10khp and fight a mob that hits for 3000.<br />
You are in really big danger. <br />
You will see MANY CH for over 7Khp. <br />
And if you get a riposte on one of those 7K+ CH ..<br />
You're probably dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to go back to the question :<br />
Keep your current weapons.<br />
Dont even bother with new augments.<br />
<br />
Wait for BF/HG (if possible)<br />
And try to get a sews/bow (even more important).<br />
<br />
If you cant, well dont worry, just get a shield out when disc drops<br />
on some really really hard hitters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">BBB would be best with anger 3 if both are available to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">keep your current combo and stop thinking about augemnting shit you wont ever use...<br />
<br />
Untill you get an upgrade in either DPS aka a good ratio 2h or agro aka EB procer dont spend points. As others pointed out dualwield will do just fine anywhere. You'll be just taking a little bigger risk with it on hard hitters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As you can see I have 2 Anger 3 proc and a EB and a proc close to EB (obsidian shatter - I would take a complete wild guess and say its like 500 points compare to EB 700).<br />
<br />
I did lose agro to a warrior with BoW but his DPS was a LOT better then mine (I have 50ish AA he has 300ish and elemental gear and a lot more ATK).<br />
<br />
I go DW all the way, the wepons give you more stats, look way better and no doubt between comparable toons the agro is way better. <br />
<br />
You did the right thing to A3 ur SoD (or you could 12-18 raid and get the Obsidian weapon I have).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Small question sam....<br />
<br />
Why did you raise offensives AA on your warrior ?<br />
Specially with defensive ones not finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">All the offensive skills are to make EarthShaker (I have two of them LOL - selling one for 700K, no takers yet heh.. ) works better... havn't used it but really want to be ready if I need to. I have color cloud on my chanter, and with 3 wizards and the EarthShaker I could pull 30-40 mobs in LDoN if I could figure out how to pull them... have to come up with some kind of stratagy, havent really had time to work on it though, just doing LDoN's normally right now, warrior almost never loses agro to my wizards.<br />
<br />
I'm working on maxing STR and STA right now, cause I have the augs for them. Then Ill concentrate on Defensive unless I decide to really get into the EarthShaker then Ill max the offisive necessary to make it go off more.<br />
<br />
You are right number one is Agro Generation, then go for Defensive. But keeping in mind that DPS itself generates agro if you go offiensive for agro purposes that kinda makes it more important then defensive. I really need to get to LR5 though...<br />
<br />
Also with three wizards and chanter nuke and cleric nuke LDoN easy mobs die in 2-3 casts (12-18 seconds). I dont even bother to slow mobs anymore they die so fasts. So really defensive, right now, is just not all that critical. So my CH heals for 3000 points instead of 2000 .... Naturally when I start serious tanking of boss type mobs Ill have to get my defensiive up but for Blue LDoN mobs its not a big deal.</div></div><hr />
