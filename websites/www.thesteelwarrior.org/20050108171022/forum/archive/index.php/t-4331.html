<br />
There is almost nothing that SOE can tell me about this up coming (eventually) change that will make me feel better about it.<br />
<br />
Because of 2 interealate issues that SOE/VI have a prooven track record of getting wrong.<br />
<br />
1) They dont' have a deep understanding of the combat system. They have a ton of good intentions..but they have been afraid to substantically change the combat system since they added defensive. So they have the experiance in tweeking combat that they do in in tweeking magic. <br />
<br />
2) We players do things differently than expected. A lot differently. We camp, we don't crawl. We come up with the 1 defensive tank strategy when defensive was supposed to be the warrior answer to gate, ie let us survive the run to the zone.<br />
<br />
The 2 most likely out comes (with dealing with the even scarier thought of mobs using this new combat system) are:<br />
<br />
1) They blow up balance by not allowing the knights (and other hybrids) enough access to it and we end up in a kunark like state.<br />
<br />
2) They blow up balance by allowing hybrids too much access to the combat system, completely screwing pure melee over.</div></div><hr />

Would you prefer they not touch anything, and let things as they are?<br />
<br />
Whatever happens, it'll be better.<br />
Now, melee problems are becoming the center of attention. They won't be able to let go too easily...<br />
The only question you should be asking yourself is, <br />
will it be a hell lot better? or just a tad bit better? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bunnie, it can get worse.... a LOT worse (hihi defensive knights~).<br />
<br />
And with what we've seen of SOE, it will be worse, at first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merc</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really hope they up our damage mitigation.  That way Knights can still tank xp mobs, only we'll tank them alot better.  And while the DPS classes may be screaming for the group to &quot;grab that knight&quot;, at least the clerics will be voting for the warrior.<br />
<br />
The only issue I see with this is trivializing large sections of the game.  Anything that can be done with warriors in their present state will become that much easier if our damage mitigation is increased.  Perhaps large scale raid encounter mobs could be reworked to account for this change but that would require alot of effort.<br />
<br />
I worry about an increase in our ability to hold aggro as &quot;the ultimate solution&quot;.  DPS classes use abilities and spells to reduce their hate as is.  They are restricted from going all out by the limits of the tank.  If the tank suddenly becomes better at holding aggro the DPS classes will just up their output to compensate for this fact.  So rogues evade less, the ranger jolts less and the wizzie casts concussion fewer times.  Again this could lead to the trivializing of certain mobs, or at the very least make them noticeably easier.  Either way, they'll be back to stealing aggro off us in no time, only it may take a few more rounds of combat.<br />
<br />
I for one like the fact that warriors, because of their present state, aren't being chosen by every wanna be 12 year old power gamer out there.  I remember Kunark.  I remember how many knights I saw back then, it wasn't alot.  Now that casters and hybrids are so powerful they seem to be everywhere you turn.  While this melee revamp may be a good thing for us in the short term it may come back to bite us in the ass down the road.  However I do agree something should be done to help us have a more definable role in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that forced that type of strategy was respawns. Notice in LDoN, with no respawns, people actually crawl?<br />
<br />
&quot;We come up with the 1 defensive tank strategy when defensive was supposed to be the warrior answer to gate, ie let us survive the run to the zone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nah, that wasn't defensive. That was fortitude.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

Ever notice how you can run full speed, even with 1% health left, while in defensive? <br />
<br />
Though Thaak, when SOE does something, they usually overdo it.<br />
Right now theyre changing our class... at some point, we'll probably be overpowered :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Ever notice how you can run full speed, even with 1% health left, while in defensive?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bah. My smart-ass-o-meter is going off like the batphone and I must respond!<br />
<br />
Ever notice when RUNNING from a mob, your back is to it, and thus you get STUNNED more often?<br />
<br />
Ever notice that when stunned you don't run fast?<br />
<br />
Ever notice when in a disc like Voiddance or Fortitude you don't get hit no matter what way you are facing to a mob?<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Ok, Smart-ass-ness is back in the box where it belongs.<br />
<br />
On a serious note, I never noticed you could still run fast at 1% health in defensive. There's a variety of reasons for this ... primary being my warrior doesn't have defensive yet. Heh.<br />
<br />
But I have noticed that at low health, feign death works better than running. ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are right. Defensive was designed as a form of 'escape' discipline.<br />
<br />
Funny, I know... sad, tragic? Yep...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boofus</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hellz yeah, I remember using defensive to run for the zone line in Karnors quite a few times.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
But they already have designed these encounters.. <br />
With the Vie line of spells that give defacto defensive to knights...<br />
<br />
And so they make mobs like 'Rapeass' who proc such rediculas high DD spells that raids already default to warrior tanks just because they hope the extra 300 hps will keep them alive. Or there are continuous AoE effects that constantly to a drain of the melee hps.. <br />
<br />
increased mitigation is VERY easy to compensate for on boss mob encounters and scripts.  With the current dev boss design tactics, no ammount of mitigation increase would make a difference on raids to such an extent as to &quot;break&quot; the game. What it would do is help us immensely in exp groups.</div></div><hr />

Well, make every melee round triggered, like in Ranged Combat.<br />
<br />
At least then there wont be any taunt mashers left, because they dont have the time to mash taunt anymore .)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That wont be happenin, as they have already listed plans to make ranged damage do more aggro, and make ranged attack stay down and grey out on rangers once they get EQ.  Seeing as they are moving rangers from mashing the key, I doubt they would do such a reverse of things to other melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand the concearn here.  At least from their standpoint.  Whatever they design, pulling it from scratch, we're going to do it different.<br />
<br />
First rule of pen/paper GMing.......no adventure can survive intact, after first contact with live players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I won't believe they designed defensive as an escape disc. Not the way it works now. If they wanted it to be an escape disc, they'd have made it so the warrior can generate like 1/5 of his agro without it and his dex goes down by some 150 so he don't proc worth crap, and then people wouldn't use it to tank, right? Not like it's a big imaginative leap to do it this way.<br />
<br />
Divine aura is designed for escape, with it preventing attack/spells and making the caster practically non-agro, after all.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they did that miss the call on defensive.<br />
<br />
OMG - you are so not allowed anywhere near that chat :eek:.<br />
<br />
LOL! I am so with you on that :D.<br />
<br />
Heh, I like being able to type some between taunt presses (as I lose agro) and would hate to be turned into a bard in all but name becuase of button pushing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest concern is that their going to do a complete overhaul of the melee system and not only are they not going to adequately test it, they're not going to even listen to their most knowledgeable players who will accurately predict all of the problems this will create.<br />
<br />
Any balancing of melee at this point might improve the balance among the classes but only at the expense of changing the balance between the players and the game.  Either this will trivialize current content or they will have to rebalance all existing content.  If they choose to rebalance existing content a) they'll get it horribly wrong and b) I bet any money that they only adjust the high end (elemental and up) content.  This means that guilds still progressing through lower end content will do so that much faster and the upper end game will be that much more crowded.  New expansion, anyone?</div></div><hr />

The class action lawsuits to replace worn out keyboards would bankrupt them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read another option that someone had proposed, which was that they'll add a sort of specialized combat attacks a la DAoC and FF XI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Wild slash<br />
<br />
20 stamina cost, +5 damage.<br />
<br />
Or, more specialised attacks like:<br />
<br />
Backstabishdontknownamebutitsdaoc<br />
<br />
Must be in targets back, +20 damage, +2 bleed.<br />
<br />
Or even worse:<br />
<br />
Devastating return blow<br />
<br />
Can only be used after a sucsessfull wild slash, and a parry, +40 damage, 10 bleed, target snared with 60% .<br />
<br />
Copied from the original post, since I've never played either DAoC or FF XI.  Seems like (using that model) they could take combat abilities and make them click-activated (spell gems which use stamina instead of mana).  Melee could either click the gem to activate the ability for a set duration, or allow tanks to weave them like bards do with their songs.</div></div><hr />
