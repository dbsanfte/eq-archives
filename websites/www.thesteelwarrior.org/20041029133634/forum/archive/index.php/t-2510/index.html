<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, this sunday our guild will move on to HoT. I'll probably be 63 by then as well. In officer chat, we pretty much agreed that HoT armor alone is not worth the effort getting there, so we want to give Dozekar a try if he is up.<br />
However, I've got no single clue about him except that his AE is dispell + 400 lure AE. How many hitpoints does he have, how long should I expect the fight to last with like 25-30 people average 58 and what is his melee like. Would I need CH rotation, can he be slowed? <br />
I have a rough clue at least how we should position him though :) <br />
thanks for any other info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dozer gots lots of hps, is slowable, you will need ch rotation till its slowed most likely (depending on number &amp; level of healers), possibly afterwards depending on your hps, etc.  Since you never been to hot before i'm gonna guess that your gear isnt too good - I'd plan for something like 3 second rotation till slowed then 6 or 7 afterwards, that should keep you alive even if you have pretty crap gear, can adjust from there as you see fit.<br />
<br />
Prolly wanna pull him up &amp; fight at firepot area since you havent tried him before - will make for ez cr if you have issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he does not see invis, that should make CR fairly easy<br />
<br />
and are you sure I need a CH every 6-7 seconds on a SLOWED mob ? what does he hit for around ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dozekar quads for 900.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doz quads for 700s or so.  Picture vindicator that can be slowed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can do all kinds of bad stuff to him though if you just keep that MA alive for the first 20 seconds or so....<br />
<br />
OOS<br />
Malo<br />
Tash<br />
Malosini<br />
Slow<br />
Cripple<br />
<br />
etc, etc...<br />
<br />
Then you just need to fight an endurance match.<br />
<br />
The good news is you can actually get him all the way up to the regular fighting spot just inside the door and easily hide casters from the AE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He hits for around 950ish around 600 or so in Defensive.  Getting him slowed asap should be your top priority.  Make sure at least the MA has a clickie or all the buffs will go bye bye which will make it harder.  Once slowed he isn't that bad but he does have a lot of HP not sure on exact amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guess would be about 250k, he's incredibly gimp but be sure you have enough healers to keep your melee alive if they dont have a clickie.  Have someone Call AE and be sure casters hide when called.  Its something like 30 seconds...  The suck part is pulling him, if you pull him to pot he will sometimes get stuck at the bottom of the stairs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">http://www.beepworld.de/memberdateien/members54/dtf-mcbain/doze.jpg <br />
so green dots casters, blue dots healers, red dots melees, red square me and that thing Doze for positioning ? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is that an AFK bard? :)<br />
<br />
Position looks okay, but I would put the casters a little closer to door so they can run in and out easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The AFK one has to be a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No reason not to fight doze at the hot ent, you can AoW corner him on the right corner - the firepot on the other side is closer to the wall. Clerics can be round the corner by the door,and melee run no risk of getting ripostes. And obviously when fighting at ent to HoT - no respawn to own your unprepared ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What is AoW corner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Loosscru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The key to doze is insta clicks.  He AE dispells the first buffed slot and he does it often.  So just keep your buffs up and tanking him is easy.  We always pull him to the HoT entrance just like any other AE HoT mob.  He is so close that it isn't a hard pull.  Depending on the mana pools of your clerics and their AAs even one HoT level equiped Cleric can heal a HoT level tank.<br />
<br />
I did my first doze at 60 with about 6k buffed and we had 3 clerics.  The third cleric got so bored that he was meleeing and nukeing.  The hard part is that it can be a long fight, doze has allot of hp and some nice regen.  Good luck.<br />
<br />
Oh, and AoW cornering is when you back the MT into a corner so no one else can get riposed.  Not realy needed on doze because your rangers will likely be blocked on arrow shots because doze is small enough to get wedged behind the fire pot.  For this reason we always fight him in the open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">http://www.beepworld.de/memberdateien/members54/dtf-mcbain/doze2.jpg<br />
Is what we are going to try then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Trondir,<br />
<br />
You have to be very careful with that last situation. That is how my old guild used to do it, but it is very important that you control the push of Doze. Rogues only should be on his ass end, and all of the other melee should be at his side pushing him directly into the wall. You definately dont want Doze being pushed into the line of sight of the casters.<br />
<br />
I know rangers will be bitching about this, but I personally would sacrifice a little dps for some positioning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GroovinFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">put it this way...back in the day, i tanked him as a 60 shm for a minute by myself one time when i charged in early.  i got lucky and slowed him before he got to me, then i just kept myself alive with torp for a good minute while the rest of the raid decided what to do.  you should be fine once he is slowed :).  <br />
<br />
and yah....the benefit you get from positioning is worth a dps reduction.</div></div><hr />
