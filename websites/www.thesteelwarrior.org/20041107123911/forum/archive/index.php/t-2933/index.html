If bind wounds got upgraded so strongly that it was better than CH, and my warrior was invited to be main healer for a group while a clreic went LFG, and the cleric complained about the situation, would the cleric be considered to be &quot;whining?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree with Wych in that we don't want to end up with Kunark Ranger (or knight) syndrome where we whine that we suck so much that all other classes believe it.  We don't want to get 6 months down the track and find that warrior LFG jokes have replaced ranger paper tank jokes.  <br />
<br />
(Although this kinda worked well for knights as while they were pretty muched balanced during Luclin they continued to get upgraded vs warriors due to lingering perception that they sucked.)<br />
<br />
With that said though, this is the warrior community board and the place to make rants about how pissed off you are when a 62 pally in bazaar gear gets a group ahead of a 140aa 65 warrior.  When we post here we aren't crying out to all of EQ that warriors suck, we are sharing frustrations with our peers etc.<br />
<br />
If I get sick of reading warrior rants then I'll skip this forum :p cos theres a place to post them and this is it, if I came across a warrior whinging about not getting groups on some other board like PoN though I'd prolly tell them to stfu~</div></div><hr />

I run a guild, and I have access to many many characters, all 60+.  62 cleric, 63 chanter, 65 druid, 65 shaman, 60 rogue, 60 monk, just to name the ones that i'm on the most.  Also, there is my 65 warrior with 116 aa's.<br />
<br />
The ONLY character that I never get tells from random people asking if I want to join X group or Y group here or there is my warrior.  <br />

Nice Iskander.  If you have a problem with me, why not just come out and say it.  No need to beat around the bush.<br />
<br />
The asshats who continuely whine about how they can't stand the whinning gets on my nerves.  It's not okay to whine about how the class needs adjustments, but it's okay to whine the whinning.  Talk about the definition of hypocrisy.</div></div><hr />

Also, call it hypocrisy or whatever justifies your crusade to you, but the difference is continued vs. constant. We know warriors are imbalanced. So does SOE, despite what you may think. Do something big about it if you're so fervent.</div></div><hr />

They have every right to express their feelings.  I have every right to tell them to go to hell.  You don't get to have free reign to tell people to shut up unless you're willing to hear in response: No, why don't you shut up?<br />
<br />
/shrug, I just thought it was funny. I don't have a problem with you per se, but your nonstop whining annoys me a little, tis all.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, what annoys you is extemely important to me Iksandar.  Because of course you've been one of the primary movers and shakers in all things good for Warriors.  Or have you?  Actually, it seems that you haven't done much when all is said and done, except be amused, in your intellectual and superior fashion.<br />
<br />
SoE has yet to admit that Warriors are imbalanced, despite your claim to the contrary.  In fact, Absor, their representive, has said he personally feels that melee in general aren't very much out of balance.  Now, you're telling me that Absor has it wrong, but you've got it right?  Uhm, okay.  I'll disregard the representive of SoE who has come right out and said that they have been &quot;too busy&quot; to even begin looking at the problem.<br />
<br />
Now, as far as doing something big about it, why don't you lead the way and demonstrate to the rest of us what the proper course of action is, since you seem to have the answers?  We've been blown off by SoE's rep, we've been told flat out not to expect LDoN to address class balance, we've been told flat out that they haven't even begun working on the problem. <br />
<br />
If I had the answer, you're damn straight I'd speak up.  I don't have the answer.  SoE has basically told us to go piss up a rope, they'll get to it if and when they get to it.  That doesn't mean I have to like it or listen to other people trying to tell us to STFU up about it without responding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Damn, <br />
Glatius your my boy go go go.<br />
Now if we could ever get Absor back to talk, Or to even admit that melee are Fubar'ed. I'd buy the man a beer if he had the balls to post to the tavern about how melee are going to forever be anal probed by anything that can cast a damn spell.<br />
<br />
I'd respect it, I really would and I would be satisifed that they gave us the time of day. But no worries Final Fantasy online will be here soon, and warriors kick much ass there. <br />
<br />
Thats what it comes down to in the end, Your money and how you wanna spend it. But that dosent excuse some lame elemental flaged reject thats crying cuz she has sand in her .....<br />
<br />
Yes Wychamazhe or however you spell your name, You came to the outhouse and posted about whining when most arguements are made out thoughtfully, and intelligently. <br />
<br />
Now I'll admit so are crying games, But damn honey your getting owned hard core here, So why dont you rephase comments about whiner's.<br />
<br />
Because in the end, if it comes to it, I will pull the &quot;class whining skill&quot; out of the cold dead hands of every monk, cleric, and druid that I have to, To see my class get the attention it deserves. <br />
<br />
Kadah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Right.<br />
<br />
I never claimed to be a primary mover/shaker. Unfortunately I don't have the time anymore to even think of being one. I can help a little but big administrative duties would have to fall to others. Perhaps that may change but for now, that's how it is. I am sorry for that.<br />
<br />
You're too smart to fully accept what Absor or SOE officially says. Trust me, they aren't so clueless that they don't realize melees are imbalanced. They either can't work on the problem for resource reasons, or just won't do it for other reasons. If they acknowledged the problem but said nothing would be fixed, that would be an even worse business move.<br />
<br />
When I see constant class balance whines, it just comes off to me as passive-aggressive wishing. You claim that you don't have the answer, but you sure post enough on the subject to imply that you know exactly what's wrong with warriors and how to fix the problems. Even so, many good solutions have been proffered. Pick one, pick several, universal enough to satisfy most and quality enough to give warriors a boost, and throw them at SOE at every avenue, repeatedly. You *might* spend as much time doing that as you do posting here, and I bet you'll feel better no matter the outcome.<br />
<br />
Yah, it's your call, do what you want, but this long-term bitching does naught but make you feel worse, despite an initial catharsis. I dunno, if you're really that dissatisfied with the game but can't contrive a solution and continue to play regardless, I suggest you seek help. Seriously. It ain't healthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I suggest you seek help. Seriously. It ain't healthy.<br />
<br />
So, I should take the fact you find my content a tad on the annoying side as an indication that I need help?  Puuuulease.  If every person who ever annoyed someone was to seek help, therapists would have to go on mandatory over time 24x7.  Or is it only people that annoy you who need help?<br />
<br />
You don't seem to be really arguing that I'm wrong, merely that you find my bringing it up to be bothersome.  Now, you're implying that because of this I should change my behavior.  Who is the passive aggressive in this scenario?  Me, who just want's to be able to voice his opinion thoughtfully and articulately even if a few, or hell even a bunch of, individuals find it annoying?  Or you, seem to feel the need to try and change someone else's behavior that impacts you not at all if you merely choose not to read the message?<br />
 <br />
And what exactly are your qualifications as a long distance mental health expert anyway?  Have you ever heard the old adage, physician heal thyself? Anyway, thanks much for your input, I'll give it all the consideration it deserves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I know we're not in the best shape. I know why. You know why. Stop your goddamned whining about it. You sound like a bunch of crybabies rather than warriors. <br />
<br />
What do you mean we're not 'in the best shape'?? <br />
<br />
So you have a BoW, EP armor, 7385 unbuffed hp and 143 AA's, how nice. You probably exp in PoF or better. IMO you're just concerned that YOUR class should not be joked about in ooc or guild chat. It may be true that YOU are not in the best shape, yeah, you could probably use even a bit more hp and some more aggro generation would be nice. The rest of us non-BoW warriors with less than 5000 hp and no LR ID are in trouble. Enchanters/shamans grouping with us DIE if we don't use /shield. Wizards/Mages get aggro when they are grouped with us and there's ping pong. We do not find groups easily. We sit for HOURS LFG. Knights are preferred over Warriors as tanks when grouping. We're certainly not enjoying the game. You say we should leave the game then or start a paladin? We have spent years playing our toons and working on our characters, sorry we can't just leave or start over. We have the right to whine and cry so loud that our voice reaches SOE. Every other class has been whining about the smallest imaginable thing since the release of this game. You find it strange that we warriors are now finally asking for something? If you dislike whining then why do you visit the Outhouse?<br />
<br />
And you come here and tell us to stop our 'goddamned whining'? And call other warriors crybabies because we didn't spend enough time and effort like you did? You don't represent the average warrior. Now STFU please. All you show-off/selfish people with uber toons should STFU and stay away from the Outhouse please. You have the Overlords Sanctuary just for you so stay in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Marshall. I haven't always been where I am today. I know a lot of warriors who are not where I am today. They don't whine. <br />
<br />
By the way, I do realize entirely that whining about whining is amusing.  While this IS the Outhouse, if you're gonna act like a baby here, I'm damned well gonna complain about it. You're making us look bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Drach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I've played my warrior for a long time, probably as long or nearly as long as the oldest warriors here.  I used to have time to raid alot, but around late velious / early luclin I started not having time.  So for me, what used to be kick ass gear, is now run of the mill.  Utterly average.  I'll never get to the point you are Wychway, because I have neither the time nor the motivation when I do play to be in a hardcore raiding guild.  I've put YEARS into this toon, and all the years playing hime has been put to shame.  Because in 2 months time, I leveled a totally /bazaar bought shadow knight because when I got the chance to play I'd pretty much never get groups.<br />
<br />
So in two months with a bazaar twink, I can now get groups where on my years spent with SS, primal, epics, plenty of AA'ed out warrior I get Jack and Shit.  Jack left town btw.  And even if I don't get a group, I get someone to cast c3 or pot9 on me, and go solo away in HoH or PoV.   <br />
<br />
Even people I've known those past several years, who KNOW I play a mean warrior, ask me to get on my SK when they need a tank.<br />
<br />
Whats wrong with this picture?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Glatius you misunderstand me. I think spending a lot of time playing and discussing a game you are obviously so dissatisfied with, one you think you can't really change for the better, is not healthy, as in it will make you fat and give you ulcers. Mentally, who's to say? Depends on the person. The fact that your class balance posts mildly annoy me is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I know I sound like a mom here, but whatever. =P I'm done here, you do what you wanna do.</div></div><hr />

And there you are, the core of the issue.  If I have a problem with my car and I bring it to the attention of a mechanic, do I expect that I'm going to have to tell them how to fix it?  Do I expect that their counter guy is going to come tell me he doesn't think the problem is really all that bad and I should just live with it?  Do I expect that they'll blow off the repair of my car in order to detail some other schmucks car, not once, not twice, but again and again and again?  Do I expect that they'll come into the lounge to tell me over a cup of stale coffee that they're planning to, eventually, someday, when things aren't quite so busy, to look at my car?  No, I expect they'll fix my freaking car in a timely fashion.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you, if EQ was a car, we'd be getting hella crappy service.  And should by all rights take our money elsewhere.  But the curse of the matter is, there really isn't anywhere else to take our money.  So instead we suffer.  But no one has the right to tell us we have to suffer in silence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Matthias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Incidentally, I feel the need to add (since my post was referenced a few times in replies) that I sat LFG waiting in BoT, watching knight after knight after knight get groups over me even after I started advertizing my AA total till a shaman from the top guild on the server, someone who actually had her head out of her ass, was kind enough to start up a guild group with me. They were damn glad they did for the next 5 hours too. That 62 paladin that got invited over me had 4k hp buffed, I come in at just over 7.5 with LR/ID5 and PE. There is something seriously fucked up when a group would do that to themselves for what they think is the greater good.</div></div><hr />
