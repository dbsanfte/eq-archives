<br />
So far everything has gone really easy and its time for the General.<br />
<br />
Just for fun we have been practicing single pulling all the DE and leaving one for turn-in.  We can do that quite easily.  But we have yet to actually attempt the general because quite frankly Im not sure our group can handle him?<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any advice even if it is...&quot;Gaylon, your nuts thinking you can do General V'Ghera with one group&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Group consists of:<br />
<br />
61 Warrior (ME)<br />
63 Chanter<br />
61 Druid<br />
60 Paladin<br />
59 Rogue<br />
58 Paladin</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tried it with one group not too long ago...a group that looked suprisingly like that.  Given the fact that he's unslowable, and that he procs that goddamned 500 point nuke/tap/whatever the hell it is, your healers generate A LOT of aggro.  I couldn't hold aggro on him over how fast I had a druid and a cleric CH'ing me.<br />
<br />
When i'm 65 tho, we're going back to own that bastard.  We didn't lose by THAT much, but I'd say with 1 group of all 60's, you don't stand too much of a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen him owned by 1 group of lvl 65s, but they had good aas &amp; gear &amp; stuff.  I would think he would totally destroy a group with avg lvl of 60 with mediocre gear - dont underestimate him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, thanks for the advice.  I really would hate for Rogue to lose turn in piece.  Although he would probably be crazy enough to say WTF lets try anyways :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like he will have to wait a few more seasons :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first time we tried for my friend's rogue, we lost because the healers ran dry after V'Ghera's proc fest on my ass.  He redid the entire epic that nite (it's really not that hard), we killed the bitch in steamfont in the morning and then tried the general the next evening.  He wasted us pretty much the same.  I had 7khp, 1350ac or so, 1400atk, and I just wasn't beefy enough at 61 to take the ass whooping this guy deals, and that was with a cleric and a druid healing me.<br />
<br />
We'll try when i'm 65 and I'll let ya know how it goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OUCH, so much for waiting a few more seasons, even at 65 I wont have those stats :(<br />
<br />
Why I continue to fool myself into thinking I can progress in this game w/o guild is beyond me :(<br />
<br />
I think Rogue wanted to try tonight, Ill have to tell him he is gonna have to wait a long time or try to hire out some higher levels.<br />
<br />
I'm really glad I decided to post otherwise we would have wasted time trying this :(<br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would imagine your rogue friend could hire a few healers to help ya out, shaman(extra buffs) and cleric would go a long way. you got 2 paladins there too, so you can really limit heal agro on druid/cleric if they LoH you first. ae taunt would help a ton so you dont lose their dps after LoH. just make sure you fully buff including a rune and if possible a spellshield on everyone. <br />
<br />
doesnt take a guild, 2 groups do it easy, just wait for the right day when your rogue friend can get together a few ppl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I didn't post to discourage you Gaylon, I posted to keep you from having to redo a rogue epic.<br />
<br />
If what everyone says the difference between 65 and 60 is true, then this guy is going down when I hit 65 and finish off LR.  The problem is the goddamned 500hp proc he has...he gets lucky and procs that 2 or 3 times quick and your healers are gonna have a hard time keeping up with just CH, so they're gonna spam short heals and over aggro, at which point they're gonna get mulched, and you're gonna follow.  The fact that he dual wields doesn't help either because he gets a ton of chances to proc every round.<br />
<br />
It's not a difficult fight, but I did it with warrior, warrior, cleric, paladin, druid and an enchanter, all 61, and we just couldn't keep me alive long enough with rune 5 + the healing I needed.  At that point tho, I had a lot less AA than I do now, and I learned a couple more things we should have done differently.  Now i'm certain we can do it when i'm 65 if I use evasive.<br />
<br />
And one more thing -- I progressed quite aways thru the game with not much more than a single group.  I 2 box a warrior and a shaman, my best friend 2 boxes a druid and a monk.  My other RL friends play a warrior, a cleric, and a chanter.   For the longest time, that's all we had, and we did pretty good.  We farmed HoT, we did the monk and shaman epics (could do druid epic, but we killed a lot of halflings back in the day :)), and farmed up enough cash to buy droppable gear to keep us competitive.  We made a few more friends on EQ, and now we've got a guild going with a couple more people...necro, druid, paladin, druid, beastlord.  Just gotta keep plugging away at stuff and keep your sights set on realistic upgrades.  You can do quite a bit in EQ with a single group as you crank out more AA's and levels.  Keep doing what you're doing, make a couple more friends here and there and you'll soon be able to take him down.  I just don't think you're gonna do it at 60, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always go with Runes as well to try and mitigate the Dmg.<br />
<br />
You have to be careful not to agro onto the chanter however.<br />
<br />
There is more than one way to skin a cat. Especially a cat with 32k hps...<br />
<br />
But yes, even one cleric would make all the difference.<br />
<br />
Btw, no one mentioned dual wielding general /shudder....<br />
<br />
Btw...Make sure you have a Big Fat Damage Shield on when you try this. He will spank himself on it big time :)<br />
<br />
I think he hits for around 300 twice a second, but dont quote me on that one. With a minimum 66 pt DS on (Just druid and Shaman Potion), he is doing about 7800 damage per minute to himself on the Damage Shield alone. You can double that up with just one  bard too :)<br />
<br />
You should be able to defensive him down to around 300 DPS without procs. <br />
<br />
Like Haass said though, that Proc REALLY sucks.<br />
<br />
OK, one more thing you can do...worked for me. I reported this about a year ago but they havent done anything about it heh.<br />
<br />
Morin Shortblade the Ranger GM in Kith Hates the General. He will turn the general and any of his cohorts into chop suey without taking more than 5% damage max (which he regens instantly)<br />
<br />
You could always agro Morin and train him through the cabin and die there.<br />
<br />
The general is over level 60 and his corpse doesn't poof.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo. Just saying there is more than one way to skin a cat. Not advocating any questionable tactics :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hire more healers or get a beefed up lvl 65 warrior with aa. Last time I did him, he was a total puss. Didnt have to even use a disc and 1 cleric healed me just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He can be a total puss or a total bane depending on the skill of the group.  The last time my friend did him for his epic, they destroyed the general without any problem with about 12 60+.  However, if you're not careful, he'll eat a tank alive before you even realize it.  I think he does something like 500dps unslowed, on average.</div></div><hr />
