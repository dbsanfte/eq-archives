1. 47% Bush, 51% Kerry, 2% Nader<br />
2. 278 Kerry, 260 Bush<br />
3. Same on battlegrounds except I think Florida will go to Kerry (possibly after some fraud investigation with how much nonsense is going down there though)</div></div><hr />

If you can step back fromt his and look at things objectively, it's gong to be an amazingly close race.<br />
<br />
If both get 269 goes to the House of Repersenatives). <br />
<br />
Partially true ... the newly elected House picks the President from the top 2 vote getting candidates.<br />
<br />
And the Senate picks the VP from the top 2 vote getting candidates.<br />
<br />
With the Republicans only having a 1 seat majority and a total of 34 seats up for grabs this election ...<br />
<br />
Can you imagine having Bush / Kerry or Kerry / Bush as Pres / VP?<br />
<br />
Man, what a long strange trip that would be.</div></div><hr />

Basically, it doesn't matter how many people tell the pollsters they are voting Kerry, the fact of the matter is, democrats are more likely to say &quot;ah, hell, it's just one vote&quot; - Someone who describes themselves as a conservative is much more likely to ALWAYS vote.  It is embedded into their very being, election day is the most important day of the year: they go to the poles and slam down a straight ticket without a second thought.  On the other hand, many people whom would describe themselves as liberal may support a democrat candidate in the polls, but come election day it often is not as big of a priority to them.

Usually thats the case, but alot more people care enough to register etc than normal this year - kinda implies alot more intent to vote.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yup ... and voter fraud is going to happen on both sides of the fence.  Even without fraud there really are too many unknowns to make a prediction.  Rather than making my estimate  I'll just wait patiently for tomorrow night's results.<br />
<br />
That said, bush has more breathing room than Kerry as of right now in the EC.  He can goof in a state and still win ... Kerry has to win all his projected ifs.<br />
<br />
I just hope that no matter who wins the election this thing is not drug out for more than a day or two.  I will lose all respect for the apparent losing candidate if he dosent quietly step down and accept it after recounts etc.  The 20k lawyers on both sides ready to do battle is just fucking ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

It would be interesting to see what our murder rate was excluding major cities.  Rural America has very few violent crimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
According to this we are 24th in the World for murder per capita.  Smaller countries may have less total murders, but they have a much higher percentage compared to their populations.  Mexico, Russia, and Jamaica are much higher than us for example.<br />
<br />
United States is .04 people per thousand<br />
Most European countries are .01 per thousand<br />
<br />
Violent crimes in the US has decreased significantly over the last few years.  We aren't quite the demonic hell you portray.</div></div><hr />

All these pages and you're still quoting &quot;facts&quot; from propaganda films.  This one happens to be true, the US murder rate is higher than most industrialized nations, but you can't quote sources like that and expect to be taken seriously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tis true, and in fact the two polls had coincided, each favoring the winner, for the last 10ish elections until this one, and now they are sharply divided (17 or 18% margin I believe).   Makes it interesting :)</div></div><hr />

This has some interesting info about that issue.  It doesn't give a specific rate, but seems to show that most murder takes place in big cities and is drug related.<br />

Kinda hard since you dont even register for the draft till 18. But he can volunteer at 17 with parents permission, or if he was legally declared on his own(forget law term here)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup.  Can't be drafted at 17 anymore seeing as you don't register till you're 18.  I think Kadah's attack on Spock had more to do with the fact that he's a strong advocate of Michael Moore rather than him being of lowly age.  <br />

Some of the smartest and most intelligent and educated folks I have met so far are/were btw the ages of 16 and 25.  These are also generally the people with the most vision for the future and who really take the time to think things out ... assuming they don't get swept away in the media-hype that individuals such as Michael Moore represent.  Any advice/statements from MM or staunch advocates of MM needs to be taken with a grain of salt (actually more like a bucket).<br />
<br />
Wisdom, on the other hand, takes time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your mostly right tho, I do not think anyone in office would have the balls to do that (and you can't drink til 21 so you can still loose your legs for your country and not get a beer when you come back.)<br />
<br />
Can't smoke until 21, or was it 18? that I am not sure on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I grew up on various marine/navy bases till about the age of 14.  I could be wrong though.<br />
<br />
Smoking age is 18 in all states except for Alabama (that i know of) where the age is 19.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm...Can't speak for now, but when I was in the military(USN '87 to '93), people under the age of 21 could not legally buy alcohal on base(I was of age, so made many many runs to the package store to buy for people).<br />
<br />
I find more truths in the things michael moore says than things that people like bill o'reilly and rush limbaugh say.<br />
<br />
It is important to understand that all these people are payed to offer opinion, not fact.  I enjoy Michael Moore, but that does not mean I believe everything he says.  Saying he is more honest than others who are known to be dishonest is not going to get you very far.<br />
<br />
How the heck are you Spcok? Oh yeah some kid that cant vote. Wait for the other one to drop before you sell your soul to idioits like Moore. Maybe once you get some street smarts and actully are able to contribute to the political elections you may understand things better. But right now your Propaganda Zombie_001<br />
<br />
While I don't always agree with what Spock says, I find him to reasonably intelligent, well spoken normally, and gives me hope for the youth of this country(he actually cares about the political process enough to spend time on it).   The insults you throw out there, combined with your comments in the other election thread(commenting on Hillary Clinton having one of her people murdered) suggest he is not just more knowledgeable than you(despite being apparently younger), but is less influenced by propaganda than you.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
And now on Topic.<br />
<br />
Kerry 51%, Bush 48%, Nader 1%.<br />
<br />
Kerry will get 280 to 290 Electoral votes.<br />
<br />
Not even going to guess on states.<br />

In Germany, you could get a ration card and buy beer at 18 (at least, on the Army bases I went to).  That applied to GIs and dependants.</div></div><hr />

He may check his facts, but he's still only going to tell you half of the story.  Nothing wrong with reading these guys, but you have to keep in mind that they are trying to convince you of something, not just inform you, and you can't just read them and take their opinions as fact.  <br />

<br />
That's what FoxNEWS got themselves into - much like Michael Moore has had to use the &quot;It's entertainment&quot; defense before when people have challenged his facts. (although I don't know if he's used it in a court defense before)<br />
<br />
There's a difference between a lean and straying so far from the truth with your &quot;news&quot; that you have to call it entertainment rather than fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
News services are frequently sued in court for slander (the oral communication of false statements which harm an individual in their reputation or character) or libel (the written communication of false statements which harm an individual in their reputation or character, althougth it can also include non-written communication of a permenant nature such as pictures, graphs, and so forth).<br />
<br />
Of course the truth is always a defense against charges of slander or libel, so as long as the news service can show that there was a reasonable expectation on their part that what they said or printed/produced was based on facts, the odds are extremely good that the 1st admendment &quot;freedom of the press&quot; rights will get them off.  What it amounts to is that in order to successfully sue a news service, you have to show that the news service did not use reasonable judgement and had no reason to believe that the information their story was based on was true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call bullshit.  And we're talking about the &quot;news&quot; portion of their programming, not their opinion based &quot;entertainment&quot; portion.<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think Fox is more biased and untruthful than ABC, CBS, NBC, NY Times, etc.?  Dude, you need to seriously wake up and smell the coffee.<br />
<br />
The NY Times is notorious for covering up and glossing over the slaughter of millions under Stalins rule.  And winning awards for doing it!  Anything Fox could do after that would be like pissing in the wind.</div></div><hr />

If Bush loses all those states I don't think it's possible for him to get 51%.  Too many people in FLA, OH, and PA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bush:  246<br />
Kerry: 207<br />
TBD:   85<br />
<br />
States left are:<br />
Ohio  (Bush leads by 100k votes)<br />
Michigan (Kerry leads by 75k votes)<br />
Wis (Kerry leads by 15k votes)<br />
Minn (Kerry leads by 100k votes)<br />
Iowa (Kerry leads by 10k)<br />
New Mex.  (Bush leads by 15k)<br />
Nevada  (Kerry leads by 5k)<br />
Alaska (no results)<br />
Hawaii (Kerry leads by 15k votes early in)<br />
<br />
My mony is on Bush ... especially since he is leading in the popular vote by ~ 3 million.  In the end, it all comes down to Ohio.  Kerry &quot;could&quot; pull this out of his ass ... but it's looking very bleak for the democrats.  Bush has a substantial advantage over Kerry at this piont.<br />

It really is up to ohio now...kerry is looking to win wisconsin, hawaii and michigan now, so whoever takes ohio will take the presidency.<br />
<br />
Kerry (if wins wis, mich and hawaii): 221 + 17 + 10 + 4 = 252<br />
Bush (if wins nevada + NM + Iowa): 249 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 266<br />
<br />
So if kerry wins wisconsin, michigan and hawaii (the 3 remaining states he is leading in), whoever wins ohio wins the presidency.  It all depends on the number of those provisional ballots.</div></div><hr />

Looks like Kerry is screwed.  Fox called OH for Bush a while ago, which puts him at 269.<br />

Bush is currently leading in Nevada (5), New Mexico (5), and Iowa (7).<br />

That gives Bush 286.<br />

No, that's not what I meant ... let me try again;<br />
<br />
Bush is up by about 125,000 votes in Ohio.  Estimates run from 150k-250k for the number of provisional ballots.  Kerry would need a huge percentage of these ballots to be cast in his favor in order for him to overcome the 125k vote deficit he is in.  That's like an 80% ratio.  It just isn't going to happen, because these provisional ballots are from all over the state, not just the Democrat strongholds of Columbus and Cleveland.  Plus ... the overseas military ballots are still coming in ... and the military traditionally is very Republican, which just adds to Kerry's deficit.<br />
<br />
This is the reason that Fox gave for scoring Ohio to Bush ... the odds of Kerry pulling it out are just too remote.</div></div><hr />

but also a lot of those provisional ballots will be 1st time voters, most of whom are expected to be kerry supporters, especially around cleveland.  and the military may not be as republican as it used to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
precisely.  the enlisted troops (i believe) heavily support kerry.  it is mostly the commissioned troops and officers that are heavily republican, so it will most likely be closer than the bush campaign thinks and closer to what the kerry campaign believes it to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!<br />

OMFG that's too funny.<br />
<br />
Edit:  and Brutul's right, it's a local Fox affiliate and not national FoxNews.<br />
<br />
Holy crap you're a dipshit.<br />
<br />
Read the whole fucking thing moron - it acknowledges in the court documents that Fox upper management told them to either falsify or throw out the report - when the reporters in question refused to and kept insisting on trying to run the article for 2 weeks they were fired. According to the documents from the case UPPER MANAGEMENT in FoxNEWS gave the people that ultimately made their decision the call.<br />
<br />
Yea, it got tossed out on appeal because Fox used the &quot;its entertainment, not news&quot; defense AS I QUOTED EARLIER.<br />
<br />
You said before (paraphrased) &quot;FoxNEWS was never in court for falsifying their reports - I call bullshit on this one&quot;, when the facts are they did - they got off, but they were there. I'm too lazy to go through all the documents on that site, but I recall Ruppert Murdoch himself or at least a representative for him having to show up at that trial - but I guess he's just small potatoes in Fox, right?<br />
<br />
Were they or were they not in court for INTENTIONALLY trying to falsify reports? The answer is yes. Learn to read, then shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
And the parts about the milk was really nothing in the actual court litigation, it only proves that you don't know how to read, or have ADD that prevents you from reading the court docs provided there.</div></div><hr />

Rupert Murdoch small potatoes???  He owns Fox, Fox News, TV Guide, HarperCollins publishing, several big name newspapers (including i believe the washington post, not sure tho...dont remember lol), several international satellite companies (including ones that broadcast into communist China - Murdoch is a staunch anticommunist) and the LA Dodgers baseball team.  He has been ranked as the world's 4th most powerful billionaire by Forbes Magazine (pretty sure it was 4th).  So yea, definitely small potatoes.  :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
Actually, if you want to know the truth ... ALL of the networks go with 2 sources of information; AP projections that come from stringers based in each county or other jurisdiction where the votes are tabulated, and Edison/Mitofsky Research which conduct exit polls.<br />
<br />
All the media networks use these same 2 sources of information.  Each network then has their own &quot;analysts&quot; that decide when to &quot;call&quot; a state for a particular candidate.<br />
<br />
See for yourself:<br />
<br />
http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/misc/projected.html <br />
<br />
So ... Fox has access to the same data that ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN have ... they just have different people &quot;calling&quot; the results.<br />
<br />
Kind of disappointing, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

They certainly aren't more trusted or respected by conservatives, which seems to be about half the country.<br />

Edit:  Seriously, why do you think FoxNews has become so popular in the laste few years?  The conservative half of the country is tired of the liberal spin coming from the big 3 and CNN.</div></div><hr />

I'm amazed that people like Dan Rather and Peter Jennings can sit there, look us all in the face, and tell us they have no idea of a liberal bias at their network.<br />
<br />
They're either lying or they're seriously out of touch.  And they darn sure aren't out of touch.<br />

I'm sure Fox has to go out of their way to tell people how &quot;fair and balanced&quot; they are because we're all so used to the liberal spin coming from our other mainstream news sources.</div></div><hr />

<br />
say? have you heard about the parental consent on abortion initiative in florida? passing by 65 to 35 last i checked. of course we know the courts will overturn it on some obscure reasoning such as:<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Amendment XIV<br />
1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the<br />
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State<br />
wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge<br />
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any<br />
State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of<br />
law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the<br />
laws.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
dont laugh. there was another famous court decision for which this &quot;equal protection clause&quot; was involked.<br />

&quot;Fuck off&quot;?  There is a perfect example of why we have age limits on driving, voting, drinking etc.  Its called maturity.  Call it what you want, and spout off lables like liberals usually do, you know the usual crap like racist, agist, bigot, sexist, its all bullshit anyway.<br />
<br />
Race if over anyway, all I can say is thank God.  Even if the universe had imploded and Kerry had won, I would still be glad this year is over.  The viciousness and the hate spewed by, yes, both sides, yet mostly coming from the left, elite media, hollywood propogandists, UBL etc.. this year has been absolutely crazy.  Though the left will still be pissy since they will come up with something which to say the election wasn't fair or some bullshit like that.  They just need to grow up and move on.  The whole idea of refusing to accept an election just because your guy didnt' win is childish, and it does NOTHING to help the country heal and move on, it just makes people more bitter, which is totally wrong headed.  <br />
<br />
I can see in 2000 why some could have been displeased since President Bush won the electoral but lost the popular.  This isn't the case this time.  The president has won the popular vote by 4 million votes, and also the electoral.  It is time to get on with it.</div></div><hr />

To be honest... they should have the right to their kids body if the kid is not mature... if anything I think a mental evaluation should be done to determine when you are mature enough to drink/smoke/watch porn/abort/drive<br />
<br />
because honestly, numbers are trivial when it comes to mental scars...<br />
<br />
Now if it is to ask consent of the father, I would agree on that as long as the child was not forced on the mother (rape, threats, beatings)<br />

then those california voters just had to pass yet ANOTHER 3 billion dollar bond when we have a 25 billion deficit already. oh well i think it was like 15 billion last election so this one i guess i can pay for more easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd come up with a snappy come back for this, but you're really not worth the effort.  Just because Bush may, and I at this time emphasize the term may get a second term does not mean that he will have the united will of the American people behind him.  He is going to have a divided country, pure and simple.  And he's not man enough to be able to overcome that.<br />
<br />
My predictions if Bush gets his second term?  More budget deficits.  More national debt incurred.  A stubborn refusal to admit that anything at all is wrong in Iraq, while American soliders are brought back in body bags in ever increasing numbers and ultimately accomplishing nothing.  A continued decline of American respect and prestige in the eyes of the world.  An increasing decay in the ability of the U.S. to be a world leader.  Divisive fights over such social issues as homosexual marriage and abortion, which really should not be a primary focus of concern for government while things government should be focusing on are neglected.  A continued shrinking in social programs even as spending goes up and the deficit goes up.  And a slower economy because not only are our resources being squandered, as are the future resources of our children, but everyone is living in fear because of a constant artificial inflation of the terrorist dangers lurking in our midst.<br />
<br />
Has Bush shown himself willing to listen?  No.  Has Bush shown himself able to admit mistakes?  No.  Has Bush shown himself willing to build consensus and mend fences?  Hell no.  Frankly, a second Bush term does not bode well, not well at all.  But then you Bush fanboys wouldn't understand what I'm talking about anyway.</div></div><hr />

Overstating a bit, aren't we?  I've been trying to stay out of the political debates here, but Nazi land...with a different Nazi?  Come on now-that's just going way too far.  Bush may be very conservative, which I don't really care for, but the man's not a fucking Nazi, and it looks to be all but decided that he'll win the election.  Hopefully he'll take the nation in a good direction with his next 4 years.  Only time will tell.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just wanted to add that whoever wins, Bush or Kerry-because it's truly not over til all the provisional ballots are counted, etc, etc.-I hope they make it one of their goals to bring America together on the common ground that most people share.  We are a nation strongly divided at the moment....all you have to do is look at the polls to see that-very tight races in many, many states.  Not a good place at all for us to be with the current state of things worldwide.</div></div><hr />

As to your &quot;Homobuttfucking&quot; comment, I find that extremely irritating.  Are you aware that the only safe sex plans currently endorsed by the Bush administration are abstinence based?  Plans that not only don't cover the viable protection means in place for pregnancy and STD's, but also deplore sex as being immoral and against god?  That's a great fucking strategy there, Einstein.  You're not going to stop kids from doing what comes natural.  The ONLY defense against fucking rampant teenage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, is to educate the children.  Tell them how to be safe and make them aware of the ways they can be.  The future of your administration's outlook is very bleak.  It consists of lots of teenage pregnancy (which can not be avoided, it's fucking biology), and with impending outlaw on all abortions after Renquist kicks the bucket and Bush appoints a new right wing conservative Justice, your teenage daughters will have no choice but to have the child...without a father, often times without support from their family, without an education, and without a job.  Awesome plan you've got going there.<br />

Had to reply to this one as well.  I sincerely hope and pray that Roe v Wade does NOT get overturned.  A woman should have the right to choose-it's her body and her decision to ultimately make(and she also has to live with it the rest of her life-and possibly afterlife-not you)...though I also think it should be done within the first trimester.  I am not for partial birth abortions.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well...<br />
<br />
Damnit Haass, you stole all my thunder.<br />
<br />
Ill refrain from attacking this numbnuts, since you so adequately expressed my thoughts.  Ill just add...<br />
<br />
1.  It is no one else's business what two people do in the privacy of their homes.  (NONE!)  Not the government, not the busybody down the block, not the special interest groups trying to save everyone souls, NO ONE!<br />
<br />
2.  It will be a tragedy if Roe V Wade is overturned.  No person/entity has the right to tell a woman what she can/can not do with her own body, period.  It is her decision, alone.  Besides, do you really think abortions will stop?  That is extremely naiive  There are too many physicians out there who believe in it.  There will still be an underground system for this.  Though, it will be harder to aquire. <br />
<br />
Both of these issues point to the idea that government have too much say in our daily lives as it is.  People need to learn to mind their own business, and not worry so much about what someone else is up to.<br />
<br />
If two men/women want to get married, that is their business.  Does it effect me?  Nope.<br />
<br />
If a woman decides she cannot provide for her fetus.  Then the decision is hers to make...I dont see how others can seriously say it is their problem.  I never could understand this. <br />
<br />
No real closer to this ramble, but that is my opinion.</div></div><hr />

First Ive heard of this.  The military is a cross-section of the US populace.  There are Kerry supporters, as well as Bush.  I wouldnt say one is more supported than the other.  IMO, anyway.

I dont agree with some of the things Bush has done.  I hope his fiscal policy gets a revamp, as I fear it will seriously damage the US.  Hopefully some plan to complete our mission in Iraq and move out.   :(   This would allow us to completely sweep Afganistan and go home.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I agree too with Haass and Ugle but I would temper your points :<br />
<br />
1. &quot;It is no one else's business what two people do in the privacy of their homes.&quot;<br />
 =&gt; WRONG !!! Up to me the best definition or freedom is &quot;YOUR freedom STOPS where other's begin.&quot; <br />
Thus if two person both want to have sex in their closed house they can. but if one want to rape/kill/whatever the other, the first can't. Samely, if someone want to build a bomb in its garage, he can't because even if he doesn't plan to use it his bomb is a threat for his surounding.<br />
<br />
2. well, the abortion is more trickier to respond here. there is different possibility :<br />
a. we can say that the life within her mother has to aggree with his own abortion :) thus no abortion.<br />
b. we can say that a cell-pack isn't  'a being' thus we have to define a step (grown step) before which abortion is legal and after which it's illegal.<br />
c. we can move futher this step to the point where a early birth even with full medical support will end with the baby's death. (idee : if you can't save him, we can accept to help his death. thus it can be used too for eavy deseased person). Thus this step is constantly moving with medecin progress.<br />
d. last year we got a huge debate in my country because of a trial : one night a drunkard crashed his car on side of a pregnent women's car. the baby was killed but neither the women nor the drunkard. few times after the women poursuited the drunkard for murder because of her dead baby. the drunkard got nothing because it appeared that a baby has no 'legal existence' before his birth. thus , from a juridical point of view, the drunkard had a car crash and destroyed a thing that has no more right than a pet thus he isn't a murder.<br />
I think we got an act to change that but I am not quite sure. nevertheless this situation can be applied to abortion : a baby isn't 'being' before his birth thus we can 'kill' it!<br />
<br />
I think that as a dead body isn't 'a being' and can be used for research and medecin, we should define a legal threshold after which a futur baby is a 'legal being' thus it will permit research and abortion before that threshold and not after untill his natural death.<br />
But this raise a new issue. If the threshold is before the baby's birth (which seams obvious to me), then a women that looses unwantedly her bady before his birth but after that legal threshold can be poursuited for murder untill she proves she made everything to keep her bady and that she never did anything that can domage her bady (drinking, smoking, being streessed, ...).<br />
Thus even my opinion is flawed and has to be patched to prevent such behaviour. but still it's better than saying abortion isn't allowed at all no matter what circontences. Because if so then a women that get pregnant and loose her bady, because of a ricky way of living, but before being aware of her pregnancy (most of the time she knows two or three weeks after when she's late on periodes, thus loosing the baby/cell-pack during this time results in an early and abondant period), is legally a murder and can be pousuit for that.<br />
<br />
3. on the homosexual marriage. my first point gives the answer 'yes it can be allowed'. but I don't like it for personnal raison. But this debate reminds me the one about couple's separation. And I think that all of theese kind of debates is mainly based on the fuse of religious mariage and legal mariage in our mind, thus I think that we can rename the legal one to highlight that this one is made upon state's acts and thus can be modified at will to include/remove aspect of it like an age/sex/number/duration limit. This would allow us to think of it differently than a nice precession in front of a priest, because there the state has no right to change anything because of the right to believe what we want the way we want as soon as it doesn't crush other's freedom.</div></div><hr />

I think you actually mean the poverty *rate* is rising.  The poverty level rises bacause of inflation, the poverty rate rises because more people are living in poverty.<br />

<br />
I'm really surprised this is even an issue this day in age.  I tend to lead towards Pro-Life, but i can understand when/where/why abortions may be a necessary thing and understand that the rights of the woment themselves need to be protected.  P-B abortions are a completely different monster though.<br />
<br />
For those of you that don't know entirely what a P-B abortion is:<br />
<br />
http://www.abortionfacts.com/literature/literature_9313pb.asp<br />
<br />
It's a biased website, but they have the procedure down truthfully and present real facts regardless of the intent.<br />
<br />
The baby is kicking and moving up till the point where it is stabbed in the base of the skull with scissors.  Contrary to popular belief, the local anestesia given to the mother cannot breach the blood barrier of the Uterine wall to numb the child.  The infant experiences great pain before it's brains are ultimately sucked out through a tube.<br />
<br />
It's sickening.  at 6 months a Baby can technically live outside the mother in infant ICU.  These procedures usually take place btw the 6th and 7th month on infants ... but you can technically perform one legally on the day of birth.  As long as the baby's head has not naturally left the vagina ... it's fair game.  It's disgusting ... if it's that late in the game deliver the poor child and pass it off to one of the 500,000 couples eagerly waiting for a new-bord child to adopt.<br />
<br />
I hate to take a stance like this ... but those taking part in P-B abortion really will burn in hell (if there is such a place).  I'm not one to condemn ... but it really is an atrocity.  Four inches further out the Vagina and we'd call it 1st Degree Murder.</div></div><hr />

PB Abortions are a bit much for me too.  Im not one who confuses religion with morality, but I have 3 kids myself.  Im a sucker, I know.  I get frightfully protective of children if I think they are in danger.<br />
<br />
It is a balancing act with abortion...but I have to admit I still think it is up to the mother...with the compliance of a parent/guardian if below the age of consent.<br />
<br />
<br />

Thus if two person both want to have sex in their closed house they can. but if one want to rape/kill/whatever the other, the first can't. Samely, if someone want to build a bomb in its garage, he can't because even if he doesn't plan to use it his bomb is a threat for his surounding.<br />
<br />
You are correct.  I wasnt striving to get down in the weeds on my analysis here.  As long as ones actions, in their own home, dont infringe on anothers rights then let them be.  Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

It is democrats that wants your kid to become a fudge packer so they can teach homobuttfucking in school.  <br />

I agree with all the responses to this insipid post, there is nothing more for me to add on this subject except for one thing: i have no recollection of ANY democrat EVER saying they are all for people getting raped so they can go out and abort the fetus.  Please try and filter what comes out of that toxic waste dump you call a mouth and limit yourself to saying things that have at least an ounce of truth or at least make some bit of sense.<br />

<br />
yeah I agree with you.  I think the biggest issue is that the legal and religious aspects of marriage are merged together.  Having known alot of gay couples I can definately tell you they are more like hetero couples (fight over mundane BS just like my wife &amp; I do); hollywood really doesnt help with stereotypes.  Its in the best interests of the country to have stable long term relationships recognized on a legal basis.  However, I think the religious aspect belongs to hetero couples.<br />

I hate to take a stance like this ... but those taking part in P-B abortion really will burn in hell (if there is such a place). I'm not one to condemn ... but it really is an atrocity. Four inches further out the Vagina and we'd call it 1st Degree Murder. <br />
<br />
Apolyon, you and I disagree lots, and I think that there is a stance that we both have here, so I'd like to find it quickly.  Partial birth abortions are no fun.  I agree with that.  But you can't deny that the greater goal of people pushing this platform is to outlaw ALL abortions.  I totally agree that this procedure should be outlawed, but that's not the reason that the republicans are pushing this so hard.  They're using it as a scare tactic, and using it to stir up emotion about abortion that has no business being there.  The VAST majority of abortions are absolutely nothing like this.  This isn't about the few instances where this happens, this is about pushing an agenda to make all abortions illegal.  If you wanna outlaw this, that's fine, but man...IT HAS TO STOP THERE.<br />
<br />
When the election has been decided. <br />
<br />
The voting process, and hence the campaign, is over.  Stop being a dink and cut your sig down to a managable level.  Everyone knows what you think...trust me, there is no mistake.<br />
<br />
Roe V Wade goes bye bye, break out the hangers!!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
And here we see this guy say something intending to be a troll, and actually making a point in the process, just for the wrong side.  Outlawing abortions will change absolutely nothing...except moving the entire process underground, where there is less sanitary equipment, less procedures, and more threats to innocent lives.  <br />

Coat hangers indeed.  This is what you want?</div></div><hr />

Extreme long shot.  They'd have to admend the Constitution to allow it because under Article II, Section 1 it states:<br />
<br />
Clause 5: No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.<br />
<br />
Since Arnold is not a natural born Citizen and was not a Citizen of the United States at the time of the Adoption of the Constitution, he's not eligible to run for President.</div></div><hr />

A recession is defined as 3 or more consecutive quarters of negative growth.<br />

It isnt the military with this problem...its the civilian overlords.  The military infrastructure reccomended roughly 4x the troops we have on the ground now for an occupation force.  They were basically retired.<br />

But something i would like to see changed is that paternal consent also be required for the procedure to take place (barring instances such as rape).

<br />
I agree with that when it's referring to the parents' of a minor.<br />
<br />
Ie:  a woman wants an abortion but a man is not comfortable watching his seed destroyed.  Both consents required or else the baby must be taken to term (once again ... excluding things such as rape).<br />
<br />
I disagree with that.  What could easily end up happening is the woman would still have to care for the child, even though she was not ready to.  Deadbeat dads and all.<br />
<br />
Just as a woman should have a right to her body ... a man should have a right to help in the decision as to what happens to his child.  Inside the woman or not ... that living entity belong just as much to the father as it does to the mother.<br />
<br />
Again I disagree-althought both are required to create a child, the woman is the one who must carry and birth the child, which may potentially put her at risk.  The man obviously cannot say the same-he has no potential hazard to his health.  This is why I beleive in Roe v. Wade-it should ultimately be her choice. <br />
<br />
Also, I have to change my stance on PBA's after reading this (http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_pba.htm).  I still beleive PBA's should be illegal if it is simply an elective process-i.e. the woman just wants an abortion.  However, if it puts her life in danger or puts her at risk for substantial or irreversible impairment of a major bodily function, then I beleive it should be allowed.<br />
<br />
That's it...don't intend on placing any more posts about abortion, as was said prior it's extremely unlikely that anyone will change their stance on it anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see both sides of the argument, as well.  But I don't agree that the father should have no say at all.  She made the choice to have sex as much as he did, and if they weren't ready for the responsibility, they should not have done it at all.  It all comes down to taking responsibility for your actions.  Look at it this way - if the father wants an abortion and the mother does not, the father is still required to pay child support in most states.  Why is it OK to force the father to take responsibility if the mother wants the child, but not vice versa?  Child support can be as much of a hinderance to the father (and over a much longer period at that) as a pregnancy is to the mother.<br />
<br />
I'm not completely against Abortion, but I believe that both parties should have some say in the process.  In the (rare) case where pregnancy may actually cause a tangible threat to the womans health and a physician will verify that fact, I can see bypassing the father.  But those cases are not as common as they are made out to be.  I'm pretty sure having unprotected sex is more likely to hinder the womans health than a pregnancy is.<br />
<br />
But again, this is just my opinion.  I don't like issues like these because I don't really see how there can be a right answer.  All you get is opinions.</div></div><hr />

If all you are gonna do is bitch and moan and complain until you get your way then maybe its better that you arent voting. Instead why dont you work for your issues, convince people with data, work for your local political choices, write members of Congress whatever.<br />
<br />
This whole polarization thing is just waiting to blow this country up. Wait till the tough issues come up like healthcare and social security. Guess what you cant have your cake (i.e. benefits to all guaranteed regarless of situation) and eat it to (high taxes or low quality/availability or both).<br />
<br />
Vote for Bush only because he may attempt to address those 2 issues in the next year before my kids are paying 50% taxes because Kerry and the Democrats wont touch it till it blows up. I could argue the point all day (understanding how these healthcare/pensions impact companies, governments, etc is a key component of my job) but heh I gotta go earn part of that $70 TRILLION+ that we are gonna have to pay to cover these benefits going forward. BTW the US is worth an estimated $30-40 TRILLION so we are technically insolvent (i.e. bankrupt).<br />
<br />
Oh and abortion is okay by me so long as it is NOT a form of birth control. If you could have a law that only allowed it to be done if birth control had been used (or in cases like rape, etc. or if the child was going to be severally impaired) that would be fine by me. That and no PTA unless health of the mother is seriously at risk.<br />

As usual, you've clearly been listening only to one side of the campaign.<br />
<br />
Bush didn't even fucking MENTION healthcare until the democratic national convention and Kerry brought it up, and I don't think he even thought about it in the 3 years prior to it.<br />
<br />
Secondly, your figures are fucking bullshit.  70 trillion?  To provide healthcare for 300 million americans?  That's 250,000 a piece.  I don't fucking think so.  America needs a national health care system.  Every fucking american needs health care.  Period.  The fact that we don't is just ridiculous, and it's a travesty that we're concerning ourselves so much with other nations and can't even get that right here at home.</div></div><hr />

Yeah an endangered breed.  If dont spout hate, mindless neo con garbage you have no voice. <br />
<br />
 Wait till the tough issues come up like healthcare and social security. Guess what you cant have your cake (i.e. benefits to all guaranteed regarless of situation) and eat it to (high taxes or low quality/availability or both). <br />
<br />
1) Social security is needed.  Sorry darwin but without it there is zero social net.  BTW its also widely popular (one of the few entitlement programs I actually support) and a &quot;third rail issue&quot;.  Neither side wants to touch it.<br />
<br />
2) You mean you cant have your cake (benefits) and eat it too (LOWER taxes).  If you decrease taxes and increse expenditures (something your neo con Hero has done) you get DEFECIT.  <br />
<br />
 Vote for Bush only because he may attempt to address those 2 issues in the next year before my kids are paying 50% taxes because Kerry and the Democrats wont touch it till it blows up. <br />
<br />
<br />
What are you talking about?  He has had control of the house and senate for 2+ years now (to be 6), where is the legistlation?  Also do you make more than 200k a year?  Thats whom Kerry proposed to tax.  This would bring their marginal tax rates in line with the rest of the social stratas (equity something most moderate folks tend to believe in).<br />
  <br />
 I could argue the point all day (understanding how these healthcare/pensions impact companies, governments, etc is a key component of my job) but heh I gotta go earn part of that $70 TRILLION+ that we are gonna have to pay to cover these benefits going forward.

<br />
You are confusing valuation with book costs, neither are relevant to the &quot;arguments you can make all day&quot;. Uour statement while inflammatory is just rhetoric and irrelevant, noone measures the US by its credabilty as a going concern (a facet in debt pricing) which is what you allude to in your &quot;technically insolvent&quot; statement.  <br />
<br />
What matters in the case of government is the amount of debt needed, the proportion of capital used by the gov in relation to businesses and the impact that has on interest rates and the crowding out of industry.  If you SPEND more than you EARN then you get defecit.  This leads to higher interest rates. At least a &quot;a tax and spend&quot; liberal would be more stable.<br />
<br />
Damn skippy at least advocate for smaller gov and less taxes if you are true conservative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and he did<br />
<br />
that fact is not lost on me. but we are still a long way from overturning the status quo on a lot of issues. the gains in the senate may be enough to decide a few close votes but with the parties so close to parity they are still snipping at the edges on a lot of policies. there is still debate going on for example whether there will even be another round of tax cuts this cycle. and if there is the tax base will fall by what .. one percent?<br />
<br />
so although you might not like the trend and while i do like the trend i feel im being realistic in saying that any policy shifts will be pretty muted. ill go to work, ill look at my paycheck, and they will STILL take a huge slice out of it like they always did.<br />
<br />
roe vs wade may *possibly* be overturned a generation from now but the chances of it happening in this election cycle strike me as extremely remote. there is not enough popular support for such a ruling and i doubt even the supreme court would have the courage to review the case even if they got a few more sympathizers on the courts. even if it happened it would only put the issue back to the states and i doubt more than one or two states would make abortion illegal again. and when they did their own courts would probably overturn it. no way is there enough popular support for a constitutional amendment to pass.<br />

in short whether you liked or disliked this particular election it was hardly a revolution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Quote a real economics journal if you want some credability on the issue.<br />
<br />
The National Review?  lol<br />
<br />
NR says: 3 members of the National Bureau of Economic Research panel fund creation of their own model:<br />
<br />
&quot;Their memo explained, &quot;The specific series the committee has been looking at is augmented monthly GDP prepared by Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm.&quot; Much of quarterly GDP is published monthly by government economic agencies. &quot;Macroeconomic Advisers aggregates them,&quot; the memo continued, &quot;and then uses a simple statistical procedure to augment the resulting totals so that the monthly estimates for each quarter are consistent with the Commerce Department's official quarterly figure.&quot; <br />
<br />
How about instead report what the ENTIRE panel concluded by looking at traditional GDP models?  This is called research and is non partisan.<br />
<br />
Taking a subset with a fabricated weight model and presenting it as &quot;revised truth&quot; is deceptive. <br />
<br />
How about instead: report what the whole panel (not 3 members) comcluded using traditional GDP models?<br />
<br />
 Q : Does the committee believe that a new recession has begun?<br />
<br />
A: The committee does not forecast or comment on current economic activity.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.nber.org/cycles/july2003.html<br />
<br />
Note that this memo validates the fact you stated regarding the end of that recession trough.  However it ALSO provides context that they will not report on data since that point as it is part of the current cycle.<br />
<br />
also <br />
<br />
 While the NBER has traditionally placed substantial weight on output measures, one could instead define expansions and recessions in terms of whether the fraction of the economy's productive resources that is being used is rising or falling (in which case the behavior of the unemployment rate would be a critical guide to whether the economy was in expansion or recession), or in terms of whether the quantity of productive resources being used was rising or falling (in which case employment would be a critical indicator). Either of these alternative definitions is defensible, and either might lead to the conclusion that the recent recession lasted much longer than 8 months and that it might not have ended yet. But if the NBER adopted either definition in dating the current recession, it would be dating the recession in a way that was inconsistent with the procedures it has used it to date earlier recessions. <br />

 We're *not* still in a recession. And haven't been for 3 years.<br />

<br />
Thanks.  That proves my point perfectly.<br />
<br />
See, here's the deal.  I see it, everyone else sees it.  The economy sucks.  Fuel prices are astronomical, and as a result, they're affecting the way most business do business in America.   My work area hired 60 people in 2003.  They've hired 6 in 2004.  What this means, is 2 fold.  One, my employer doesn't want to risk hiring more full time workers in case the economy doesn't start picking up, and 2, it means that no one wants to quit their job because the unemployment rate is making finding a new job extremely difficult.<br />
<br />
Just because we're not in a &quot;recession,&quot; doesn't mean that the economy isn't shit.  There are A LOT of people out of work in America, there are a lot of companies that can't afford to pay health insurance for their employees, social security is in serious trouble, and this administration is dicking around in Iraq based upon rumors of some possible weapons programs that shouldn't exist.<br />
<br />
If you don't think this has any influence on the economy, that's your perogative, but I'm not gonna be so blind.<br />
<br />
roe vs wade may *possibly* be overturned a generation from now but the chances of it happening in this election cycle strike me as extremely remote. there is not enough popular support for such a ruling and i doubt even the supreme court would have the courage to review the case even if they got a few more sympathizers on the courts. even if it happened it would only put the issue back to the states and i doubt more than one or two states would make abortion illegal again. and when they did their own courts would probably overturn it. no way is there enough popular support for a constitutional amendment to pass <br />
<br />
You miss the point.  It has absolutely nothing to do with leglislature composition.  All it takes is a change of one liberal judge to one conservative judge on the supreme court, and it is a very real possibility.  Renquist ain't doing so well, in case you haven't heard...and guess who's gonna be appointing his replacement?<br />
<br />
After that, all it takes is one dipshit to challenge the ruling and convince the court to listen and we go from 5-4 one way, to 5-4 the other.</div></div><hr />

You lie to yourself without thinking.  LEARN economics before trying to start economic arguments.<br />

 The Bureau emphasized that the second-quarter &quot;advance&quot; estimates are based on source data that<br />
are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency (see the box on page 3).  The second-<br />
quarter &quot;preliminary&quot; estimates, based on more comprehensive data, will be released on August 29, 2002.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, here's the deal. I see it, everyone else sees it. The economy sucks. Fuel prices are astronomical, and as a result, they're affecting the way most business do business in America. My work area hired 60 people in 2003. They've hired 6 in 2004. What this means, is 2 fold. One, my employer doesn't want to risk hiring more full time workers in case the economy doesn't start picking up, and 2, it means that no one wants to quit their job because the unemployment rate is making finding a new job extremely difficult.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone is going to argue that the economy couldn't afford to be better.  But in reality, adjusted for inflation, gas prices are cheaper now than they were in the 80's.<br />
<br />
One reason employer's don't like to hire new employees is that those employees are very expensive.  Salary, medical, dental, retirement, social security, unemployment, etc.  It makes it very worthwhile for companies to hold-off hiring new employees as long as possible.<br />
<br />
That's perhaps the main reson that the socialist countries in Europe have such high unemployment rates ... those socialist, cradle to the grave governments punish companies for hiring people.</div></div><hr />

So back where we started.  You havent proven anything. You havent even admitted its an opinion and not a fact.<br />

Sorry, your timeline is wrong, and explains our misunderstanding.  It actually goes like this:<br />
<br />
1.  I present a dclarative statement.<br />
2.  You point out that you don't like my source.<br />
3.  I present a new source, the U.S. govt.<br />
4.  You continue on about my original source.<br />
<br />
Flair, please check out that last link again ... it's the revised U.S. Gov't figures from Dec '03 ... which still show that the last recession ended in 3Q '01.<br />
<br />
OK, here it is again, just to make it easier:<br />

I think Flair and I may have ben arguing different issues.  How embarassing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see where we are missing each other now man (lets cut the names here).<br />
<br />
Ok: you are using real GDP growth as the measure; yes I can see how you can present that as a fact (you didnt preface your orginal statement that way..although it is possible I missed it?).  By that measure you are CORRECT (got link of BEA article working).  That is indeed what the revised GDP growth chart lists by quarter.<br />
<br />
Now my point: while real GDP is a way of measuring recession as the NBER article stated GDP has increased because productivity has increased while REAL employment has decreased (utlization of productive assets).  They state that by this measure we may still be in a recession.  This means MORE poor bastards out of work and the ones remaining working harder for the same wage.<br />
<br />
They also state that the main reason they dont report this way is for consistency of comparisons to previous historical periods (they are an econometrics outfit after all and comparability is important).  So by this measuer the recession in &quot;real &quot; terms may have not ended.  This is the comment from their report I quoted twice.<br />
<br />
Now as far as my comment about National Review.  This wasnt personal.  I give it as much creedance I do something from the far left (even you must admit it is partisan, Buckley being an avowed Paleo Conservative).  Just saying that root sources (like BEA, NBER themselves) actually gives full context.<br />
<br />

<br />
I missed your argument myself, takes two to tango so aplogogy also offered to you.  Btw I read the National review (hehe).  I just try to WEED OUT all the half contexts I read no matter the source (even Brutul's Economist has them /grin).  I also crossed party lines this election so you get a sense of my frustrtaion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which I certainly can't argue against ... as Haas so eloquently stated, &quot;the economy sucks&quot;.  However, the &quot;official&quot; recession is long gone.<br />
<br />
Now as far as my comment about National Review. This wasnt personal. I give it as much creedance I do something from the far left (even you must admit it is partisan, Buckley being an avowed Paleo Conservative).<br />
<br />
Again, can't argue against that.  But to impugn the conclusion simply because of the media in which it's presented ... well, it feels good to do, but it's not necessarily right.  To be honest, I just went to the first link I found on Google and it happened to be the NR link.  Odly enough it took me quite a lot of digging to find the official government numbers.<br />
<br />
And maybe I am just mising it, but I don't recall anyone flat out actually accusing NR of lying like they do about Michael Moore.<br />
<br />
So much of what we read today is simply opinion dressed up as fact.  Makes it tough to pay attention sometimes.</div></div><hr />

1) Social security is needed.  Sorry darwin but without it there is zero social net.  BTW its also widely popular (one of the few entitlement programs I actually support) and a &quot;third rail issue&quot;.  Neither side wants to touch it.<br />
<br />
2) You mean you cant have your cake (benefits) and eat it too (LOWER taxes).  If you decrease taxes and increse expenditures (something your neo con Hero has done) you get DEFECIT.  <br />

What are you talking about?  He has had control of the house and senate for 2+ years now (to be 6), where is the legistlation?  Also do you make more than 200k a year?  Thats whom Kerry proposed to tax.  This would bring their marginal tax rates in line with the rest of the social stratas (equity something most moderate folks tend to believe in).<br />
  <br />
<br />
<br />
You are confusing valuation with book costs, neither are relevant to the &quot;arguments you can make all day&quot;. Uour statement while inflammatory is just rhetoric and irrelevant, noone measures the US by its credabilty as a going concern (a facet in debt pricing) which is what you allude to in your &quot;technically insolvent&quot; statement.  <br />
<br />
What matters in the case of government is the amount of debt needed, the proportion of capital used by the gov in relation to businesses and the impact that has on interest rates and the crowding out of industry.  If you SPEND more than you EARN then you get defecit.  This leads to higher interest rates. At least a &quot;a tax and spend&quot; liberal would be more stable.<br />
<br />
Damn skippy at least advocate for smaller gov and less taxes if you are true conservative.<br />

#1. Why is it the [governments] responsibility to make sure I save?Social Security was founded as a scheme to get money in the govt's hands immediately, back when life expectency was low and they figured they could make up what they spent years ago by the time people collected. Well guess what, they havent, and people live even longer now. SO when I get ready to collect mine it will probably be bankrupt. Privatising is the way to go, and if you cant be trusted to handle your own finances well then have fun working at Wal-Mart...wait, thats happening now and we have social security.....<br />

#2. I wont go into National Health Care.<br />
Bottom line, the Goverments responsibility should be limited to protecting the borders, managing international trade, and upholding the law. Numerous civic and social out-branchings all need to be exterminated and turned over to private companies or done away with entirely .<br />

While I agree with you that the governments responsibilities should be far less than what we are currently blowing tax dollars on, I do think that it should have some hand in our Health Care system.  There are pros and cons both ways, as with anything.  Having a commercialized health care industry like we currently do (for the most part) means competition, which means better quality and better technology.  On the other hand it also means that many people simply cannot afford it or it is just not available to them.  I've lived under both government controlled and privatized health care systems in my life.  As a dependant growing up on Army bases, I would go to the base Clinic and see a military doctor.  I could just walk in the front door, show my ID card and be seen for whatever I needed.  It was simple and fast.  Now military Health Care is handled by Tricare, which is an HMO.  It sucks horribly.  Seeing a doctor for the simplist thing is an all day affair, and half the time the just refer you to an off-base doctor anyway.  Theres a whole mess of registrations and paperwork just to make sure that if you happen to be deployed your family can get in to see a doctor.  I'm not really sure what any of this has to do with government controlled health care except to say that from my experience our health care system blows and something needs to be done to get it on some kind of sane track.</div></div><hr />

what you are dealing with here is a &quot;local&quot; recession rather than a nationwide recession. i dont know what business your company is in so i dont know if its problems are due to high oil prices or something else. &quot;the economy&quot; doesnt suck, its growing at over 4 percent per year currently which is quite good. the oil shock certainly IS a big problem but you have to be careful what you credit that to. presidents dont just &quot;set the oil price&quot;. its a result of supply versus demand. demand has been extremely strong lately because of rapid industrial growth this year all over the world. china's imports have been exploding recently. supply is another matter. iraq's production has not exactly been stellar lately though it was unimpressive before the war as well. and how does one go about legislating an &quot;increase in worldwide production&quot;? price increases certainly have the effect of increasing the profitability of exploration and development of reserves as well as refining capacity so in the long term its a self-stabalizing thing, yet in the short term what are you going to do really? every country on earth has high prices and are the people of every single country blaming their own governments for their own high prices? perhaps bush can use this time as an opportunity to help us by eliminating gas taxes :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You miss the point.  It has absolutely nothing to do with leglislature composition.  All it takes is a change of one liberal judge to one conservative judge on the supreme court, and it is a very real possibility.  Renquist ain't doing so well, in case you haven't heard...and guess who's gonna be appointing his replacement?<br />
<br />
After that, all it takes is one dipshit to challenge the ruling and convince the court to listen and we go from 5-4 one way, to 5-4 the other.<br />
<br />
in principle you are right and the point is not lost on me. but i still see the chances of roe vs wade being overturned as remote. in spite of the fact judges are in for life my observation of the supreme court over the last 30 years is that they are as sluggish to change the status quo as legislators are. something about them seems to make them very reluctant to give the public the impression that they think the courts ever could have made a mistake so they rarely overturn decisions of prior courts.<br />
<br />
and if it does happen? then it all goes back to the states which so far have shown practically no inclination whatsoever to tighten up the abortion laws. outlawing something like partial birth abortions is something the states rarely even attempt to do. parental consent laws come around once in a blue moon. if they rarely even do those things how likely do you really think it is that the whole nation of 50 states is going to abruptly overturn the abortion on demand system we have right now? i just dont see it happening. you know by now that i would be delighted if they did but ... i just cant see it happening in the near future.</div></div><hr />

There hasn't been a new refinery built in over 20 years, and the ones we have are running at near full capacity with insufficient downtime for PM.  <br />
<br />
Ditto with gas lines: due largely to the regulatiory due to lack of federal laws, its practically impossible to build a new pipeline.  Any pipeline built has to meet standards in each state is crosses, and some states have contradictory rules regarding new pipelines, so they just keep trying to patch the old ones and hope nothing breaks.<br />

This past spring, spot prices for gas in Phoenix broke $4/gallon due to a pipeline rupture.</div></div><hr />

I did a Google search and didn't see anything good on the first couple of pages.<br />
<br />
But I can tell you this ... at one time my wife traveled 100% as an Instructor for IBM.  During a 6 year period she was lucky enough to travel to 50 different countries on all all continents ... China, Russia, Japan, western and eastern Europe, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, etc.<br />
<br />
Hands down, her favorite country was New Zealand.<br />
<br />
According to her NZ has the nicest people and extremely beautiful countryside.  As a socially liberal country with a liberal government it may have the institutions and policies that you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Be warned however ... most of these socially liberal countries have requirements for moving there ... they require you to have some sort of marketable skill or ability.  They don't want you just showing up and saying &quot;feed me&quot;.  Seeing as how you are stil in High School I doubt you will have much to offer them.  It may be easier to become an expat if you at least have a college degree.</div></div><hr />
