<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what forum to put this, this forum, or possibly the outhouse seems to fit best.<br />
<br />
I have two items I would like your opinion on, and they are both related to determining who has rights to name mobs in competive zones<br />
<br />
1.  When in a zone such as Wall of Slaughter with multple groups going after named mobs, what etiquette, or rules of engagment do you follow in regards to deciding if you or another group's puller have rights?  If I am pulling, I usually let whoever agros the mob first get it.   Normally this is easy to go by, but in WoS, many many times, mobs will pop right between two pullers, and a agro tug of war often follows.  If I have HoTT, I look at the HoTT window and go by what that says.  If I appear in it first, I go after the mob and will take it.  If other puller is first in HoTT window, I back off.  <br />
<br />
2.  HoTT window target delays.  I am now questioning the accuracy of using the HoTT window.  I am convinced that there are delays in it, or that it may show different people different targets due to timing and delays.  Below are two examples where I think the HoTT window method of determining who gets named did not work well.<br />
<br />
A.   One evening in WoS, I was playing tug of war with another puller (a bard) for many trash mobs.   I  would tag mob, I appeared in my HoTT window first, and then bard appeared in HoTT window, in these cases,  I usually tried to get mob back, and often did.  The bard was geting quite upset with me thinkng he had rights to mobs.  Later I explained to him I was appearing in HoTT window first, and he essentially called me a liar.  Later on a named mob, same thing happened, I ended up getting mob, then he got so upset, I think he trained our group.    My first reaction was he was just lying, and upset because he was pulling slow.  Ater further argueing with him, and thinking it through, I think he honestly believed he agroed those mobs first.<br />
<br />
B Last night in WoS the opposite happened.  A named mob popped, I shot it with an arrow, but another puller appeared in HoTT window before me.  I backed off and let othe group get mob.  Then, the MA, and cleric of the group that got mob died, and I think one other person died also.  I then got summoned by the named mob into the other groups camp.  I was shocked that I was that high agro list that I got summoned into camp (I was far away too).  For me to be high enough on agro list to be summoned before half the other group, I must of had first contact agro.  I cannot imagine one arrow putting me that high on list.  I do not believe it was rampage agro, but cannot say for sure.  I believe this is a case of the HoTT window showing other puller agroing mob first.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I would like your thoughts on this.   I try to be civil when I pull, but like most players I want what I think is fair.  Very often if I am not sure, I just back of to avoid controvesy.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't speak to the mechanics of the HoTT display and delay, but I have had the same thing happen to me as you describe in B above so its entirely possible.<br />
<br />
As far as the rules of engagement in WoS go, at least on our server its the Wild West. First come doesn't necessarily mean its yours. Don't count your named until they are in camp and dead, hehe. Do I agree with this sort of game play? No.  Do i think it will change? Not really.  But i wouldn't spend a ton of energy trying to identify the problem as being related to the HoTT window.  The problem, as usual, is us players, hehe.  The wandering named and the amount of payers there have made this into a fairly lively zone though. Can be fun, but can be frustrating too.<br />
<br />
Fortunately there is a solution. It is called Ruined City. And if your server is like CT you will frequently be the only group in the zone. Much less crowded, good fun, great chance at runes and sellables, better faction icreases for Omens armor quests.</div></div><hr />

I've been in WoS and seen people run the raid bazu's onto groups just to steal their named afterwards (bards w/ fading mem)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felnar</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't been to WoS yet, but from what you're describing it sounds like it could easily be compared to Rathe Mountains.  I know there are other zones like that, but I had a good bit of personal experience pulling there about a year/year and a half ago while playing my druid.<br />
<br />
In a zone like that where it's first come, first served, I would say just try your best to be fair.  If you see a mob aggro someone and start running after them, back off.  If the mob is just standing still or wandering around at their normal pace, plink em with an arrow and pull away.<br />
<br />
There's always going to be a gray area in pulling in a zone like that due to the fact that not everyone's computer/connection speed is the same.  On your screen it may look like you've aggro'd first, but you really didn't due to lag.  The same could be said for the other person of course.<br />
<br />
As far as named mobs go....again, all you can do is try your best to be fair.  Technically you cannot &quot;camp&quot; a named.  The first person(s) to engage has(have) the right to attempt killing the mob without others interfering.  Of course, imho at least, it's always best to respect others' camps, as that is no doubt what you would  like if the situation were reversed.<br />
<br />
Basically, it just comes down to the most basic principle in life(at least it's the most basic principle by my way of thinking), which is to treat others as you would like to be treated.  Do your best to be fair-that's all anyone can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use the hott method when i pull, and i dont see any delay with it, infact it appears quite accurate.  i usually dont pull my groups however, i use bard/monks.  Today for example, in wos, i was using a badass monk puller and 2 druid to play radar, we were getting rare after rare . . . and i gave monk explicit orders to only pursue a mob if HoTT showed him first, which he did.  However, and this is off topic, because he was pulling so many rares, yet not breaking any EULA rules, other pullers got very frustrated and trained our group not once, but 4 seperate times, by 4 different bards.  Back ON topic, i /reported each of the bards and petitiioned 'em for training and attempted KSing (they played the tug of war game a lot) and i said &quot;Our puller is only pursuing &quot;when HoTT says it is his mob, ie he is first aggro&quot;.  GMs suspended all 4 bards for 1 week.  That said, Even if HoTT is delayed, which i dont think it is, GMs seem to like the fact that pullers use it to determine aggro, especially in clusterfuck zones such as WoS.  Anyway, thats my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard was running around with a/e songs on. When I have a bard in group (quite often now) the mob always swaps to him when it gets to camp till I pop furious. Tell bard to learn how to play his/her class. And since they called you a liar I'd tell them to kiss your ass as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Platinia</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy thing  i dont group in WoS as it is like BoT in old Days. Prefer to open a Tial in  Darnik or so. More relaxed and no stress with  Camps   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just something I wanna share with everyone. I figured this strat out and discovered it worked wonders with our ranger puller at that time. Basically, the moment I see the mob that was inc, I shot an arrow and SAT down. This strategy is almsot 100% guarantee that swaps the mob's target (via Hott) to me. And when the mob is nearly on me, I just Incite, since it works like a spell when determining whether auto-stand works or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOS is dog eat dog.  Personally I dont like it and the childish OOC so I go to MPG/RS.  The guy who cracks me up on my server is the one who six boxes in the field below the &quot;hill camp&quot; day after day.<br />
<br />
Suurge: HOTT is not accurate in some high latency situations and/or with some caster mobs (pretty well documented a couple months back); its possible that could have been part of the orginal posters issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never had any issues with HoTT not being accurate.  If you're pulling with low aggro stuff, which is all bards and warriors are capable of, it is pretty likely to get swapped around in place without noticing.  Then again, even if for some reason you can generate 1000000 hate on incoming people can still say they saw the mob first and you steal it.  My suggestion is just make sure you really saw your name up first and stick to that.  If people want to steal your mob after you aggro first send someone who can actually generate aggro on incoming (Knights, most casters) to pull.<br />
<br />
A Mob's HoTT window will not update while it is stunned or mezzed, but that doesn't sound like what you're describing here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be summoned you only have to have 1 hate on a mob below 96-98% health. Being within melee range of a mob puts 1 hate on you whch would be why you were summoned. <br />
<br />
As for WoS names I don't go there. Pure and simple too much training KS bs for me to deal with. If I need runes I load my 5 accounts and go clear Solro tower and buy them for 30-45k same idea with the item drops. Rather buy items then spend 2 hours of the night in PoK cause newb_01 trained me for the 12th time.</div></div><hr />
