<br />
The recommended level is probably 50, so at 48 you won't have long to wait.  It's the level 5 zerkers with them that will have to suffer through an extended period of non-uberness.  What a tragedy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's the level 5 zerkers  <br />

Well maybe there won't be a 15-20 line list now waiting for this and other fabled items.<br />
<br />
Level 10 casters in line for the Paw robe is silly , imho.<br />

<br />
Because that just isn't how the vision works. It's not like they could sit down and decide what will be going in, and discuss all the minor details. They just let Tony the intern bang out some items and let her ride. Now, after a few posts have been made on the topic and a dev or two has been alerted it's time for crowd control. Aka, the patch for the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;poor level 10 'zerkers with krappy axes. my heart bleeds for them. really&quot;  No, I don't think they should have been allowed either. The problem is not whether or not they should be able to use them, but the fact that a lot of people wasted a lot of time to get these weapons that they rightfully believed could be used by their lower level alts. Whether or not they should have &quot;known better&quot; is beside the point, SoE should have not let it go this long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt that the level requirement will stop twinks from camping these items, especially considering they will only be dropping for another week.  Anyone who thinks for 2 seconds can see why people would still want to camp them even if they can't use them right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been the MO for YEARS dude.  <br />
<br />
Every time they come out with something new, it's fucked up for the better in some way, then they come thru and nerf it down.  Remember all the shit in luclin that dropped for a week and then no one found again?  How about the Gem Encrusted Ring and the Blade of the Black Dragon Eye?  This is just standard operating procedure....get a lot of people spending time on something and then turn it in to wasting time.  It helps the longevity of the game if you can have people doing tasks that help them in no way, shape or form.</div></div><hr />

With run3, they are still useless. I can run nearly as fast with run 3 .<br />

Anyone else having this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zaknefein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The problem with SoE adding level requirements to items is that they usually put rediculas level's on lame items. I've seen some weapons from lots of LDoN adventures that have something like a 56-62 level requirement on it that I wouldnt put on a level 45 toon. I dont think they should have any requirements over 50 and recommended level shouldnt be over 40.<br />
<br />
Most of the other weapons that you wouldnt want in the hand of a newbie are no drop in zones you have to be flagged for or a certain level for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">the FJboots are faster than run 4 and slower than run5 <br />
<br />
Actually, I'm pretty sure they're both 50% increase to run speed. SOW is 55%.  I understand making the boots self-only, but taking the extra 5% away wasn't really necessary. They're no better than original jboots now, just another instant outdoor-only clicky, useless for anything other than a low level twink.<br />
<br />
Not that it matters, I run at about 50% slower than original level 1 noob runspeed with the framerate I'm getting post-patch, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Getting stuck on geometry has definitely been a problem.<br />
<br />
And the zone-out tree in fire didn't work at all for at least a week on Test, but I thought they had it fixed.  Might still be a little harder to click than usual.<br />
<br />
On a good note though, I found myself in the middle of 80 people last night with all models on and particle effects on and had zero lag, which is unprecedented.  Running a GeForce 4 and 500 MB of ram, so it's not a supercomputer.</div></div><hr />

But the lag in Ssra when we went back to whack XTC and HP and the lag in Tactics were much better.</div></div><hr />
