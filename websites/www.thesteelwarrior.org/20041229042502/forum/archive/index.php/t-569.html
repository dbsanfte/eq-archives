AA is a very structured idea. To give it away for free would go against the purpose of AA.<br />
<br />
AA is designed to keep you playing, and keep you levelling. They will NEVER give you free AA.<br />
<br />
If they do, I will be very very surprised.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thought was that a flag would give you a small XP bonus in the zone that you are flagged for.<br />
<br />
It would seem like the easiest way to &quot;reward&quot; someone for doing the work without worrying about one class bitching about the reward being unfair.<br />
<br />
Although they might just make it so unflagged you only get 90% XP, and if flagged you get full, something stupid.<br />
<br />
Just thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Their best options for &quot;reward&quot;<br />
<br />
1.  AA points.  Whatever you may think about it, AA points are a good reward they can give without being too unbalancing.  The only people this reward would really suck for are the people who have so many AA points they have nothing useful left to spend them on.  This definitely would not apply to most people.  I could see the give a certain number for the easier flags, and a certain number for the harder flags.  Maybe 3/5 or better.<br />
<br />
2.  Loot.  For a guild where the members are in mostly Elemental armors, ornates won't cut it.  Some classes would require different kinds of loots than others.  Also, there are 8 flags total that they are talking about.  How do you differentiate for each flag?  I have no idea how they could do loot outside of dropping plat on us and that wouldn't be bad, but it certainly wouldn't be my idea of a reward.<br />
<br />
Outside of that, I cannot think of any reasonable reward they may give.  Maybe they will be more creative than that, but AA seems like the best reward to me, but it can't be just 1 AA per flag IMO.  However, I will take anything they give me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no idea what they are going to do but Im almost 100% positive it won't be even close to a shred of work we have done on flags. Think about it for a sec. How can you put a price on something so huge. Can you sit down and calculate how many hours it took to gain flags, all the failed attempts, all the times you assisted others get their flags? I know when I was bored and couldnt find a group I helped people in PoJ get their flags. How can Sony put out a sizeable reward when they cant even begin to measure the amount of work some of us have done.<br />
<br />
Lets also think about Sony's power, how much they do care, and what they can and wont do.<br />
<br />
I dont think they can give exp, aa's, or any kind of character advancement bonuses. Thats just not in the cards imo, and it would defeat the whole purpose of people playing EQ. Why take that away? People want to advance. <br />
<br />
Items: Maybe they will offer some cheap item to keep us all happy. Something most of us will never use and will collect dust in the bank since we have long since had better. <br />
<br />
What would be AWESOME would be if they gave everyone who is flagged a PoP charm, and it gets stronger for every zone you are in that you are FLAGGED for. That would be sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skycrasher</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM's give out AA points all the time on SH for doing quests / events / BOTB tournaments. It's not too far out of their reach.<br />
<br />
Besides, how much time did we spend on getting our flags? Remember having to do MB cuz you didnt get CC right down on the first try? Or Terris Thule cuz you didnt have enough tanks to tank the golems? You could have gotten at least 5+ aa from the time you spent raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this god-forsaken system goes into effect, three things need to happend:<br />
<br />
1) Every encounter in Plane of Tactics needs to be reworked simply due to how easy it is to blow guilds miz VZ/TZ and esp. RZ.<br />
<br />
Rewards:<br />
1) 10 AA per flag completed, excluding PoV/PoS. Basically, if you've completed PoNB, TT, MB, Grum, AD, Bot, you get 60 aa.<br />
<br />
2) Guild-static flags. If at least 70% of your guild has completed at least 3 of these flags, any other flags that guild has attained become static. That means simply, every member with that guild tag automatically receives any other flag which the guild has completed. Example, if your guild has killed AD, MB and Grummus and Terris at least twice, and have also killed Mithaniel Marr, Rydda (HoH-B trials), Bertox VZ, TZ and Saryn, then every member in your guild automatically receives these flags. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing short of the above demands would adequately reward the guild who have spent tens of hours failing, wiping, clearing, kiling and re-killing these crack-ass no loot-dropping encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nord</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it'll be something zone-specific, like an xp modifier or a charm.  It can't be something like AA, since in their message they don't specify that they'll be removing the flagging process (eliminating trials/quests).  It'd be too easy for someone to run through the Trials just to pick up a handful of AA points.  The reward will have to be something that would benefit not only people who already have their flags, but act as an incentive for people to continue to do the flagging trails/quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I envision happening:<br />
<br />
1. SOE will upgrade the loot tables on mobs such as AD, Grummus, Behemoth.<br />
<br />
2. It's possible they'll make this &quot;free flagging&quot; thing a lot like the &quot;key quests&quot; in that they flag you for exp-only.<br />
<br />
But I gotta agree with Spine, not much can really compensate for the time spent flagging people.... more importantly, *helping others get flagged.*<br />
<br />
I don't think they'll give out free AA's, btw.  It would be nice if they did, but I really think they'll want to keep as many timesinks in the game as possible.  AA = timesink.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if they put in a boosted ZEM for flagged people while reducing non-flagged exp (to 80% or so).<br />
<br />
Off-topic:  There are more of us females out there than you might think :D   Probably about 20% of my EQ friends are also female.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;What would be AWESOME would be if they gave everyone who is flagged a PoP charm, and it gets stronger for every zone you are in that you are FLAGGED for.

<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
That's an awesome idea. Something reasonable, and something they can actually do within the framework of the game without being unbalancing.<br />
<br />
But, alas they may not do this, because some people may be Flagged out the whazoo, and still not have LoY and thus not have a charm slot.<br />
<br />
Then again, this might boost sales on LoY if the charm were worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Again, very very interesting idea.<br />
<br />
Probably the best suggestion I've seen offered.<br />
<br />
AA's simply aren't gonna be the reward.<br />
<br />
But a charm might.<br />
<br />
My best idea was, everyone gets a free chain bridle or big ass drum of their choice so they can have a mount. Or can just sell the mount for plat.</div></div><hr />

(melees first in line plz!!) my thoughts on the charm idea is on the next page, like the charm idea in general</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the charm idea alot, maybe even a charm that casts 6 levels of a new buff line, each one for a differnt plan, maybe completeing nightmare b would grant fearless and BoT would grant storm strength and magic resists</div></div><hr />
