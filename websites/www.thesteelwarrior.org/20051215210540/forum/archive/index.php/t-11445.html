Just how is one group supposed to handle Arcane Torrents that chain lightings for 800-900 every 3-4 seconds. There was about nothing I could do. Or is the Madness Within a only leet need apply quest now?</div></div><hr />

If you hit them hard and fast, they don't get their can of whipass out on you (IE, the thunderstorm), and you win.  The little ones are just annoyances, another melee in group can tank them, or you can after you get the big one hurt and otherwise engaged so it won't/can't cast.</div></div><hr />

bring a warlock, banish the big one, remove the others<br />
<br />
have the warlock use a felhunter to curse of tongues and counterspell the mini-supreme mode of these torrents. then they're pretty easy, you need a good warlock though, not just some random Imp-Gimp.</div></div><hr />

If you don't, the big guy is more threat than all the little ones in the group combined.  The best way sans banish is pwning him.</div></div><hr />

Always make sure you're the only one in the mobs frontal arc. If it's not turned away from the group that can be painful for chain lightning, if it is turned away it's just a 1shot for 700ish.</div></div><hr />

Good to know, I wasn't about to test and see if it was direction after getting ripped the first time by one. ^^</div></div><hr />
