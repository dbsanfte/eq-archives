<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had my 66 shaman and 65 warrior in fungus grove last night PLing my bot afk cleric to 56 (we were doing the caller cycle with an earthshaker). I had been constantly clicking my 5 line /pause x, /cast x hotbutton on the cleric to raise his skills. The zone was empty for at least 4 hours when all of a sudden &quot;sentinel soandso&quot; turns up, he looks at my cleric for a good 2 minutes then leaves without saying a word. <br />
<br />
Did the GM show up because I was using the earthshaker, because my cleric was leveling so fast (43-56 in 4 hours) or because I was using the hotbutton macro?<br />
<br />
I'm confused, don't really want to get banned lol, I'm beginning to think it was the earthshaker?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think he was just checking if you were mq'ing or not. Did you catch his/her name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, Earthshaker is illegal.  You should have swallowed it, remove the evidence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">most likely, since you were using the same in game hotkey, they thought you were mq'ing...<br />
<br />
When they showed up, and you turned to them, they problably realized you were not, and left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never heard anyone say shaking was illegal.  Iv done it a lot, never seen or heard anything from a GM..<br />

Fixed that for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea, I'm thinking they thought you were using macros.  Some system of their's probably flagged the cleric because it was using just one command over and over and it was leveling pretty quickly.  Likely a small combination and they just came over to see if perhaps someone had left it to sit there and macro for a while.</div></div><hr />
