It might be removed soon, because it might start a FLAME WAR!!! muahhaha :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The folks at PoN are mostly reasonable and thoughful people.  Trolling in the attempt to start a flame war with them only makes you look like a jackass.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Ditto what Grimmlok said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: Although I do feel somewhat bad....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While I agree that trolling and starting a flamewar was not a good thing to do, I also agree that the one jackass who said all we need is to buy an EB weapon and that he spent a comparable emount of money to that on spells should have his balls ripped off with some rusty pliers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How many EB weapons are buyable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, you have Barnacle Axe, which doesn't like to proc for me, and only is a 100 aggro, and you have the Blade of Carnage, which you can own for only 249.99 USD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I assume then that it is a Blade of Carnage? <br />
<br />
Judging from the Paladin's post.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just looked at Lucy. 5 Weapons with EB. 1 of which is droppable. Only 2 of the 5 are Warrior only.<br />
<br />
And that Pally says I should just get one to make aggro fixed?<br />
<br />
Feh.</div></div><hr />

they cry like sissies i tell ya; everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Klanghin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That post on PoN was uncalled for, even tough some pallies might be jackass the PoN Community at least tries to work for us too, the pallies are not responsible for our maybe weak position, it is SoE and with bashing the pallies for it we won't move forward anywhere (not that i see us moving anyway, but still).<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the little proof that PoN does want to help us somewhere:<br />
<br />
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=442.topic<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that the pallies were once much weaker than we were and are now stronger than we are, doesn't change anything as well, they asked for improvements and got them, while we didn't get any, maybe we should have asked for more back in the days, maybe we need to get more organized, who knows /shrug.<br />
<br />
<br />
To summ it up flaming pallies because of our position is kind off stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">whoa whoa whoa who said anything about flaming pallies? I just wanted a honest question to an honest answer. If it caused said flame war, I wouldn't of posted it. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have been flaming hybrids since i started playing 2 and a half years ago...... It's funny and i have *cough* Paladin friends who also think it is hilarious. So beyond flat out attacking someone personally i say flame on brother warriors keep the spirit high</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Baiting people for flames usually gets you a warning on a board, as most admins or mods don't want to waste personal time and resources moving / splitting / deleting said threads. Others just ban you and be done with it :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ayup but if you'll notice i have yet to ever start a thread anywhere but my guild site sooooo...... This is no applying to meh!</div></div><hr />

Do us all a favor and don't post on the pally boards again. We hate it when some jackass &lt;insert class here&gt; comes and makes a BS post here and I am sure they feel the same way.</div></div><hr />

We all hated that moron pally troll because he came here looking to start flame wars.  Our own 21,857 threads on paladins/stuns/aggro are bad enough, starting something on other boards is just uncalled for.</div></div><hr />

They have posted several well thought out posts to Sony regarding Warriors, asking Sony to improve our Aggro generation up.  They are going to bat for us and we act like fucking three year olds.  <br />
<br />
Thanks to Brutul and Glatius for posting apologies on behalf of Warriors.  <br />
<br />
I bet I get less xp groups because of Warriors' current rep for whining then a lack of aggro.  I never have an issue holding aggro, but ppl I group with say they get tired of hearing Warriors whine.</div></div><hr />
