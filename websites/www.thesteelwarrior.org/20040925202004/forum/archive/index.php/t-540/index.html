<br />

*logs pally alt*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm level 53 with no AA yet.  I've only grouped in PoP a few times.  One night, I was in a grop with a chanter, shaman, cleric, and a 58 warrior. I was the lowest level in the group.  Gloom nightmare resists tash, shaman doesnt realize this and casts slow.  Nightmare resists slow, aggro's shaman, reduces shaman to a green smear on the ground beneath it's hooves, aggro's chanter and cleric, 58 warrior finally gets a few procs and gets aggro.  After about 5 Cheals, timing is missed and unslowed nightmare pastes 58 warrior, turns on 53 warrior(me), 4k hp just just under 1100 AC buffed.  Nightmare beats me down so fast even after I go evasive, that the cleric thinks I kept attacking through enrage (which I didnt btw).  We do rezzes after the cleric and chanter zone, things go smoother after that.  (Shaman only dies 2 more times).<br />
Second time around. Guild group. Not an ideal class distribution, and all low 50's.  Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Ranger, Wizard, Me.  We figure if we do single pulls we'll do ok as long as the cleric and druid are quick with the heals, and everyone works to let me keep aggro.  Zone in: cleric having bandwidth problems and is last to zone in.  Spider and raven trained to zone exit in building next to graveyard(unannounced, from what I gathered after the fact).  Ranger leaves GY to enter building and see for himself the zone exit, 5 seconds later dead ranger.  Spider and raven leave building and come to GY, aggro ranger 2, cleric has zoned in by that time, heals ranger, gets aggro, I tell the group to zone. Cleric dies,  I go evasive until everyone else can zone. We heal/med back up and zone in for rezes.  Move to open area on zone wall, ranger pulling, accidentally gets an add on pull.  Half group dies before evac goes off.  Wizard, druid, and one ranger live.  Start doing rezzes at GY with wizards cleric bot.  Massive train kills wizard, cleric bot, druid, and ranger.  Get rezzes for all, quit for the night.  <br />
PoD.  59 druid, 53 rogue, 62 Mage, 58 cleric, 53 war(me), 54 wiz:<br />
Druid pulling rats and flies, doing fine.  2 wizards, each quadding flies cross eachothers paths,and aggro a highlevel necro fly(exact name of mob escapes me), wizards train group, die, flies wipe half the group.  Rez, get some decent xp, wizards come back, lose control of quad again, almost wipe several members of group, good teamwork saves us.  Wizards come back, lose control of quad, anger killer necro fly again, train all on group, kills melees, casters evac and go back for rez.<br />
Based on these experiences, PoP needs some serious reworking. From my own experience, and from what I've read from others, pure melees are either ineffective or a complete liability, crowd control classes are death waiting to happen in groups, and some classes can still solo with relative ease. Basically from what I can tell all PoP did was not only demonstrate the class imbalances, but actually made them worse.  Not only that but it tougher to find a group in the zones that are still good for balanced groups to xp in.   Sorry for the rambling and ranting, but from my perspective all PoP did was make it easy for me to travel, and harder to xp. (and it's always been tough for a warrior to xp; at least as compared to most other classes)<br />
