<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mightie Gnome</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm most likely going to get my epic (after aquiring me green scale) and I know that's the red blade is pretty good aggro, but due to being a little on the slow side many people put it in the offhand.  I'm looking for a goodmainhand aggro weapon (with a proc).  I've heard frostbringer and wave crasher, frosty is still a little on the slow side, and WC has gotten mixed reviews.  <br />
<br />
I've got about 150k to spend on a weapon and was wondering if I should just save up 350k-400k for a BoC.  Or should I just wait until I get into a guild that is going to be able to get me high aggro weapons?  I only play for 1-3 hours at a time so I don't raid often.  <br />
<br />
There are a few fast weapons that don't have an aggro proc that I could get, swiftblade of zek, fleshgrinder, etc.  However I don't see the point of 1 handed DPS weapons when a windblade does so much more damage.  It seems kind of strange that the best aggro weapon that I can get only costs about 4k (frostbringer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think your best bet is to keep levelling for now and get into a guild that is progressing through the mobs that drop the items you want...sure you can buy a BoC or some other insane DPS/aggro weapon; but half the fun IMO is killing the dude that carries it.<br />
<br />
overall; i'd go for the frostbringer if you &quot;need&quot; that boost in aggro ( proc-wise )..as you level more into your 60's there will be a whole new set of items that are no drop that make the velious weapons looks silly by comparison.<br />
<br />
and if your heart is set on it; get ye epic. unless you're a full time raider ( which you said you really weren't ); the epic in both versions ( 1H and 2H ) will get a lot of time in to go barsh with and will fill the necessary roles.<br />
<br />
As a comparison; i'm almost level 62; closing in to the playfield of VT; and still my epics do their job well but mayb raid as much as you do ( if maybe an hour more if that )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At your level, the red epic mainhand and blue epic offhand are fine.<br />
<br />
The ATK boost of the blue blade is nice.<br />
<br />
The dex boost on the blue blade helps the red blade go off.<br />
<br />
I kept my frostbringer once I get epic, but have yet to actually NEED to use it.<br />
<br />
Though I have had to go Velium Battlhammer/Blue epic to keep from getting aggro.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that at level 51, 2hs still isn't all that much better DPS wise for you than dual wielding.  Unless you're swinging something better than Windblade.<br />
<br />
2hs really starts to kick in around level 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if i was in your shoes .... 150k to spend, and my epic.<br />
<br />
Id prolly drop some cash for a fleshgrinder, and bank the rest, or buy top end HP upgrades (Bloodmetal Earrings, Amy Chain Mask, Farwater plate stuff)<br />
<br />
But holding off and just savin is always a good idea as well, prices will only drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mightie Gnome</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice!  I'm also going to be upgrading to Bloodmetal earrings in the near future and going to be able to get into a decent guild by level 55.  I want to be able to grind with a bunch of RL friends and being able to hold taunt while our shaman slows is big.  I guess I was right all the big aggro weapons are no drop or are 300k+ (SoD and BoC).  I guess I'll see how well I hold aggro once I get there, I just don't want to come out light on aggro, I suppose I'll just stick with frostbringer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO, Blade of Carnage isn't 300k ... it's free.<br />
<br />
By the time you need a BoC, it's to fight the types of mobs that you're going to be in a guild MTing for. And thus, one of those targets is the Avatar of War, and well, you see how that all works out?<br />
<br />
&quot; I guess I'll see how well I hold aggro once I get there, I just don't want to come out light on aggro, I suppose I'll just stick with frostbringer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your epic will not leave you light on aggro. It's just fine for fighting those mobs that drop the BETTER hate proc weapons.<br />
<br />
Get your epic, and you're going to be just fine aggro-wise.<br />
<br />
And if you really REALLY want a toy for aggro and DPS and all that other jibba jabba ... there's always Windblade. The most cost effective DPS a warrior can get.</div></div><hr />
