<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haites Nocturnal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild Emeritus is currently recruiting on Lanys T'vyl.  We are a guild that is playing using an era-progression methodology.  For instance we are starting out only utilizing only old-world and Kunark zones, and limiting equipment to old-world only as well as capping lvls at 50.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to revitalize the older content as well as have fun experiencing the progression all over again.  We will be progressing through the end-game for each era in order starting with &quot;vanilla&quot; or Classic Everquest and finally ending up with the Velious expansion.  As we progress new items, zones, and levels will be unlocked.<br />
<br />
We are looking for dedicated and talented players who are tired of playing in the never-ending ratrace that plagues the current game.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or if you think you would like the chance to go back and have a lot fun doing it all over again, come to the board and submit an application.  <br />

Half the fun of EQ was finding new shit, and you probably won't find anything new now.</div></div><hr />
