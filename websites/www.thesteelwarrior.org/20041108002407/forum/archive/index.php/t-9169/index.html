<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well at least ours glows...just proves you can have a crappy graphic but if it glows it will look good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I prefer much more the wiz one.<br />
it's nice to see that the SK and Pally go better with particles, but are still under ranted than their epic 1.0.<br />
Warrior's one doesn't improve that much : there isn't enougth light to cover the rust... EQ gave us a blue, a red, and a purple lightsaber in epic 1.0, now we have a rusty red floating-light saber ~&gt; yahoo :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wiz and necro ones are pretty bad ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looks like the particle effect pulsates/moves on the warrior epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wrathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it also looks like theres a little whirlwind type thing that goes up the blade for the warrior as well. The overall graphic is still ugly as sin though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WOOT we have a lightsabre again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The overall look of the sword is kinda blah, I still feel our epic 1.0 blows this one away graphics wise. I mean... mini dragon heads on the hilt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ganeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Our blade isn't even pointy!  <br />

Come on SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree, give it a point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kokonut Pye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Would be nice if they made it swirl red and blue like the two handed 1.0 epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Extremely lame imo.  We already have a red darth vader blade; we don't really need a second one.<br />
<br />
If the warrior designer was fixated on a red particle effect, they should have given us rivers of blood seeping down the edge. Now THAT woulda been fine, even with the plane jane look of the blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ive heard that the 2.0's have specific attack animations.<br />
<br />
Not that that's much consolation, but it could be fairly cool.</div></div><hr />

i say we write an angry email to sony...and send it every day so that they cant ignore us!  WARRIORS MUST BE LISTENED TO they keep giving us crap</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">well at least ours glows...just proves you can have a crappy graphic but if it glows it will look good.<br />
<br />
True enough. <br />
<br />
I agree, give it a point.<br />
<br />
But a point? What are we pig-stickin stuff? As far as I can recall hack and slash doesn't need a point. Hell, for that matter, killin doesn't need to have a point either. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">2,000 posts :)<br />
<br />
anyhow our epic should be the first to have a &quot;real&quot; metal graphic, it should be all shiny or bloody.... not rusted or tarnished.<br />
<br />
I've used a real sword(and busted 2 of my own from overuse) and you can do the most damage with the part of the blade 2 inchs from the tip, or the tip itself, that said it is much more damaging to have a sharp tip than a rounded one... a sharp tip used to slash is how you rend something (that or a jagged weapon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ugle Smashur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/agree<br />
<br />
<br />
The tip always beats the edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Wrathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Lol, going through the files, they havnt even made the cleric or ranger epic 2.0s yet lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>qxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I mean, these are supposed to be exciting and flavor up the way we look a bit. Everyone gets something new and hip and we get (basically) the same exact old epic? Give me a break...</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the moment the two most stupid sword graphic (I mean the farest from &quot;real&quot; metal graphic) are the cristal sword (aka BoW/DBotW) and the elf shoe (FB), so don't expect SoE to give us a &quot;real metal graphic&quot; for our epic.</div></div><hr />

But ya - Something seems oddly familiar about the red glowing blade.  Whatever could it be??   More importantly tho - anyone seriously think that they'll go back in and actually Change our 1.5/2.0 graphic?  I think the developer could have given a class assignment to the local 4th grade art class and came up with a better looking sword IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Up to me the best sword graphis came with Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Earrindo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Now be fair, the concepts for these weapons is immaculate, i have no complaints, its the damn 3d designers who botched it, these people are usually artists, why they messed up so bad on these is beyond me.<br />
they could have done better at making those amazing concepts designs into real things.<br />
<br />
well, virtual things.<br />
<br />
cheers )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Emaculate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Wow Holy crud the 3d artist for this game are well crap time to hire a new modeler.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Ok so I made my own version of the Cleric shield in 3dsmax, it is 238 polys, the only thing is it doesnt have the particle affect, well since I suck at particle affect lol<br />
<br />
Cleric Shield (http://public.fotki.com/AnOldFriend/anoldfriend/epic_shield3.html)<br />
<br />
Now lets see the difference between mine and theres shall we. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">seriously, it doesn't take that much skill to do what the EQ 3d modelers do, and they still manage to mess things up this badly. and these guys get PAID to do it, while Emaculate whipped that up in his spare time. not that he's not good at it, i've dabbled in 3d modeling and it's not exactly easy, considering that they do this for a living is just pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Emaculate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">To make this shield it took me a total of about hmm maybe, maybe an hour and some really good modelers could proly do it in less.<br />
<br />
One my friends made the enchanter staff and I think its called the sorcerers staff and trust you me it is alot better then the ones these &quot;pros&quot; made.<br />
<br />
If I can get a pic of them I will show you his verses theres aswell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Wow that particle for war 2.0 looks so generic.. epic 1.0 anyone.. think they could use something more creative?</div></div><hr />
