<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">105 is your cap at that level iirc (5 x level) + 5.  They should all be close to that ideally.  If not, dont sweat it.  Between levels 41 and 51, your skills are artificially capped.  During that time you'll have lots of time to skill up on whatever melee skills are lagging.  Also, don't forget archery.  You're never going to be able to crank out ranger style bow damage, but it's nice to be able to actually hit something on occasion when you're pullling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trong</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can dual weld so get a decent delay 1HB and 1HS and go to town. Raise those to max, then switch to 2HS, then to 2HB. Don't forget about Piercing, I know we cap at 240 iirc, but there are some good Piercers out there.<br />
<br />
Don't waste practice points on skills. If you fight alot they will raise on their own.<br />
<br />
Oh, and before I forget, if you got a shammy partner, be sure to get a dex buff. Helps in weapons skill increases and procs if your weapons have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And try to max them one after the other because with a skills at 50 you're just like a lvl 10 guy almost ( speaking about dmg mainly )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;i'm i going about training these skills wrong or something? i do each one 10 points at a time and right now i'm around 50 with them all. is there a better strategy i should be using?&quot;<br />
<br />
You mean you use the weapons, and after about 10 points in skilling up, you switch to a different weapon right?<br />
<br />
You don't waste your actual training points on weapon skillups do you? I know they're not totally needed for anything, but it just seems odd to toss em into your skills as you go, when beating on monsters will do the trick just fine.<br />
<br />
Uh, if you are just swapping weapons every 10 points, I don't think you're doing anything WRONG, per se. I just think you're finally starting to feel the backlash of what's happened with SOE making levelling so fast at the early levels. For the first 30 to 40 levels of your life, you are going to outlevel your skills really briskly. <br />
<br />
My advice would be to pick ONE skill (usually 1hs for warriors is a favorite due to its high taunt factor and superior DPS at the lower levels) and get that maxxed as soon as possible. I bet you could have 1hs maxxed by level 25. Easy. THEN, as you go along, slowly try and keep the other skills close.<br />
<br />
Till you hit your 40s, when levelling is reduced from the clip of 4 or 5 a day (well, if you have a long play session) down to one a day or one every 2 days. Then your skills will catch up and even out.<br />
<br />
By the time you're 55, I bet you'll find ALL your weapon skills have caught up. And you'll still have 10 levels left to grind. The longest 10 levels in the game.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just keep using the weapons for that skill. They will go up. Sometines it seems really slow but as you lvl up it takes longer in each lvl and skills will max out for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My monk leveled faster than any other character I've played. I made it a point to keep all the weapon skills even, so they lagged behind quite a bit for a while but by 30 they evened out nicely.<br />
<br />
I let my 2hb on my warrior fall waaaay behind until lvl 40 or so - that SUCKED to get back up. I'd resort to practicing on other groups' mobs while LFGing in DL because it was just unacceptable to use in a group until I got it up to a certain point.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about them being a little low, just keep working at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, I let my 2hb go until 63, when I got a GSOT. For a while it was fun because since I missed so much I could attack through enrages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greklak</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never noticed this before but can you gain weapon skillups on light blue conned mobs or do they have to be dark blue cons and up?  Also, what's the best way to raise the archery skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Light blue will raise your will raise skill unless they've changed things recently.<br />
To raise archery skill, get the cheapest arrows you can find (summoned arrows would work) go to Everfrost near the Permafrost entrance. Almost certainly there will be someone there soloing giants. Ask if they mind if you stand there raising your archery skill. They probably won't, if you are well socialized enough to ask politely.<br />
This might be kind of tricky if you're an evil race warrior: there are mountain passes you must go through to get to the Permafrost entrance that require you to pass some Barbarian guards. However, you can do the same thing in any camp with a stable (that is, boring) high-hitpoint spawn that people farm.<br />
A Dex buff will, I believe, speed the process up.<br />
When I was playing my first character, I worried quite a bit about the fact that I could never cap my skills before I leveled. I now think that unless you die many times each level and refuse to be rezzed, you can't do it. But eventually your skills catch up as you get faster weapons and each level takes longer; and as a previous poster mentioned, for a while your skills are capped for several levels, giving you a chance to catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just goto warsliks woods and shoot the rooted iksar out in the water. He's level 50, doesn't summon, and is dark blue to level 65. If you get to close he can hit for about 119, after I ran out of like 300 arrows I soloed him for almost no xp, went back made more arrows, and he was up again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greklak</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, thanks for the tips.  I'll give them a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what i would do is take your favorite weapon or weapon combo and use them until you max your skill in it. then go to the trainer and train up your others as much as you can. points are most profitably spent on a weapon type for which the only weapon you have available is something really slow since such a weapon would be painful to level up otherwise.<br />
<br />
as for saving the trainer points ... save them for what? learning languages? you have to spend them on something and it might as well be weapon skills.<br />
<br />
i used to think it was cool to get to level 65 without having spent any trainer points. thats about as cool as leveling up without ever buying a kei just so you could say you did it. kind of a pointless victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Training mobs:<br />
<br />
Paineel - Ernadi Natasu, lvl 35 SK (401 pt Harm Touch), 6(?) minute respawn<br />
<br />
Warsliks Woods - Ssolat Dnaas, lvl 50 monk, perma rooted, cons dark blue at 65, doesn't summon<br />
<br />
Unless there are changes I hadn't heard about, these are good mobs to practice your skills on.<br />
<br />
As you level higher, skills will catch up naturally. No worries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolam</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated above, DEX has a lot to do with your skill ups in weaponry.  I started my warrior as a secondary character to play with my wife's shaman. <br />
<br />
After leveling, I find that I will have 1hs and 1hb (my main weapons) will be max skill in about an hour of fighting.  This is with my DEX about 235 or so, and with %24 percent haste on me, and Celerity (which i forget what percentage it is.)<br />
<br />
It is a lot slower with the 2 handers, but getting a good fast one like the GSoT helps things go faster.<br />
<br />
I used piercing up until about level 50, when I saw that the cap was 240 and I abandoned it for 1hb.<br />
<br />
I don' t know if the extra 10 points available to 1hs and 1hb over piercing makes a big deal when you're 65, or not.  Anyone care to comment from experience, not guessing?<br />
