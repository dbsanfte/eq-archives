<br />
It appeared to be something that might be useful in LDoN. Should you concider getting it for that reason be warned - it goes off with about the frequency of a bow proc. We aren't talking the frequency of Rogue Assassinate mesages in ME here at all.<br />
<br />
As a public service I probably should log a day's fighting and provide a count per 100 kills. But so far (in a week) I've seen it happen three times.<br />

Wow... it's an even bigger ripoff than I suspected.  I just didn't bother with it because I almost always put a snarer in my groups anyway.  Also it doesn't effect high enough level mobs even fully maxed.</div></div><hr />

Is it something I would get early on?  No, but it's nice when you get all the useful skills.  I have it go off several times per LDoN adventure.  The mob has to be fleeing, so it won't go off if there are other mobs in camp, or if it is undead (undead do not flee).  So if you are in Guk, where most are undead, and the eyes do not flee (immune to changes in run speed), then you will not see it go off.<br />
<br />
But go to Ruj or Tak, and you will see it go off quite often when you have a single mob start to run.  It has saved my ass many many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a feeling its based on crit rate, with max Coup and Max POP crits it goes of 5 or 6 times per LDON mission for me. Really depends on how your group is distributing DPS though (if nukers are finishing mobs off it will not go off much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;it goes off with about the frequency of a bow proc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Funny you should mention that, because a few people I know who have it, have stated they've seen it go off a LOT more when using a bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a feeling its based on crit rate, &quot;<br />
<br />
So do I. So does my ranger friend who has it (he has higher crit rate with his bow than he does with his melee weapons, see my frist statement for where I'm going with this).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really lame for such an expensive aa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think its nice, just two exceptions<br />
1. 90% of the time im the puller in the group and so i turn atk off and pull the next mob before the first one runs.<br />
2. Im pretty sure there are mobs immune flagged, like all ldon hard mobs (yes, i mean the blue ones). After 35 hards im pretty sure i never saw it &quot;proccing&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm fairly sure none of the &quot;hard&quot; mobs are 59 or below, which is the cap for maxed coup de grace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">59 or above, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ewww, was pretty sure it was lvl 64 :(<br />
nvm )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A mob fleeing AND less than 10% health is pretty rare if you are set up in a decent DPS group. Most nukers blow them up before it happens. It's nice to have, but yes...very expensive. Funny when it goes off with an arrow shot on the trash mobs around the camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're about maxed its a semi decent DPS boost but don't look at it as being a huge boon for runner killing. Saves you 15 seconds finishing off a few mobs is about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have it maxed as well.<br />
<br />
It goes off relentlessly when I use my 1h weapons (19 delay mainhand, 28 offhand).<br />
<br />
It hardly ever goes off with my BoWar equipped.<br />
<br />
The difference is huge, and I end up using 1h weapons in those groups  that will have a large number of running mobs specifically so I will get finishing blows more reliably.</div></div><hr />

It's eye-candy and nothing more. Fun to get if you have nothing else to get, but I would have rather gotten Resists and Double Rip.</div></div><hr />
