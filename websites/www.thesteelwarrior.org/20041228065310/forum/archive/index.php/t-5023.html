<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serrik</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I will state my main is a monk, and I love him.<br />
<br />
But my first character ever was a warrior, 4 years ago, and I played that as my main for 2 years and still always seem to keep a warrior alt in my stable ready for action.  <br />
<br />
On to the questions =P<br />
<br />
I figure with the implementation of agro building disciplines now, and taunt messages finally being honest, that the accepted method to maximize agro with taunt has been modified some.  So my question to skilled warriors here is, in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
1)  In an exp group, when do you find it most effective to use taunt, and your provoke line?<br />
<br />
I have been provoking at once, given it is a DOT, and provoking whenever I can, as it eats really no endurance.  Taunting once after the slow til successs, then taunting after a big agro spell lands (or heal), til I get success, with provoke being used non-stop til the mob is near dead, so that I have provoke refreshed for the next pull.<br />
<br />
So is there a better method?  I come to the experts and ask =)  My goal is primarily to hold agro tighter then a cloistered nun.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your insights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damrod</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">use provoke when the mob is inc ( so the slower can slow without aggro, etc ... )<br />
Taunt as soon as he refresh :D<br />
<br />
This is my advance perhaps not the better but ... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I do is use the provoke skill on INC so I have a bit of agro ahead everyone else, and its almost always enough to make sure the slowers/debuffers don't get beat on (sometimes i lose agro when they sit, but that isnt very often).<br />
<br />
If I lose agro mid-fight, I immediately taunt, and if it succeeds, I provoke again right after to give me a small boost in agro again, and assuming the other players in my party aren't trying to get agro and keep it, I usually have it for the rest of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played warrior and shadowknight extensively, and my experiance is that it is best to use agro gaining disciplines/spells imediatly after a succesfull taunt ( which granted doesnt happen all that often ).  I generally pull with a bow and keep incite till I need it, or if my luck is good and I happen to have a succesfull taunt during the fight I use it.  From my understanding taunt puts you at the top of the &quot;agro list&quot; + 1, so taunt puts you on top, incite adds to it, making it that much longer before someone else steals the agro.  Incite before taunt doesnt seem as effective to me...<br />

happy newyear 0o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jet</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, i try to be the puller, where  applicable, thats big  agro to  start  with.<br />
<br />
Then i bow as i run back to group, and taunt and attack once its in  group. (sometimes i taunt pull, just  depends on the  situation).<br />
<br />
Then i get my face nose to nose  with the mob (agro proximity) and then use INCITE if the  slower happens to pull agro off  me, it  snaps it back  fairly  fast.<br />
<br />
If a ranger or monk is pulling  agro  off me , because they feel like  it, i dont waste my  INCITE on them, its their job to FD or Jolt off  agro,  im not gunna  waste my  INCITE on them because i need it handy  when a caster  over  agros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serrik</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I am misunderstanding some thing then.<br />
<br />
My warrior has provoke atm and not the others.  He is only level 41.  But it is a DOT (or a HOT Hate Over Time), and I can use it non-stop and my endurance does not even drop in the least.  I assumed others are a hate &quot;HOT&quot; not  an instant hate.<br />
<br />
So would you not want it running? and cast on the mob ASAP and keep it running to maximize the hate you develop?  It seems to me we should be thinking to be proactive by building the hate before it is needed, rather then after. <br />
<br />
What I have heard so far here does not seem to jibe with my own experiences and reading of the provoke effects.<br />
<br />
I guess the higher level hate producers require much more endurance?  Are they not a DOT as well?<br />
<br />
And as far as wasting it on rangers and other melee, I agree, when they can take a hit or two, and we can get a successful taunt and rob them of their place in the agro list, eventually....</div></div><hr />
