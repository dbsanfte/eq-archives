<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shortt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been playing a ranger for awhile and decided i wanted to me essential in a group. I have a fungi and 40k to spend what should i get for him? Its a gnomer btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get him a pally. You did say &quot;essential in a group&quot; =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why don't you play an Enchanter or Shaman?  They are essential and can solo on the side if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, two completely unhelpful replies so far.    <br />
<br />
Since you already have a fungi I think the most bang for your buck on a lower level twink is weapons/haste.  Unfortunately the new weapons that you will probably want to use in your 50s have reccomended levels (CHoS, GSoT, SotB).  I'd start with the best haste item you can afford and then pick up some fast weapons of each skill type that have decent dmg/delay, some cheap armor and go to town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">=\ Yep, that will make him essential. After you do that you can come back here and bitch like the rest of them:)<br />
<br />
But here, I will bite, get a centi LS, good weapon for low to mid lvl dude, maybe a lammy for main hand. You can wear the cultured armor at any lvl, so if ya got it to spend then I would get that, will hold you till mid 50s and higher. Haste I thought kicked in at lvl 20, I might be wrong on that one though. With 40 k I think you could get the legs and the BP in culturedarmor, then put some mid range items in the rest of your slots.<br />
<br />
There, not completely unhelpful. But you'll be back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really strongly recommend you re-think your class choice.   Warriors are just a dead end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do you have a built-in group (meaning a group of friends you always play with or regular access to guild groups)? If not, start something other than a warrior. Pally was suggested, and SK isn't bad either; in many pick-up situations, they'll go for those two before they go for warriors. (If you really want to be desired in just about any group, make a cleric, enchanter or shaman instead.)<br />
<br />
But, if you have a built-in group, or if you've made up your mind and warrior is what you want, I'd next recommend you rethink your race. Yes, in the end game your gnome will be just about as effective as an ogre, but before then, an ogre will rule with way more HP's and stun immunity from the front, as well as being a large race that can slam/bash without needing to equip a shield. There's also the matter of perception. A pickup group rarely knows who you are (at least for the first few times you group with some of them), and a big burly ogre just sells himself much better than a scrawny little gnome. People may not admit to it, but on first impressions, size matters!<br />
<br />
Also, make the ogre worship Rallos Zek and for the plat you have you can outfit him not only with a pair of good fast weapons (plus nice 2HS's and 2HB's), but with a full suit of Fierce Heraldic armor! It's got a recommended level of 45, but in the meanwhile, you can still wear it from level 1, and for the first 30 or so levels your fungi will do just fine for you.<br />
<br />
Is this the cheap, unimaginative, dirty way to do it? Yes...but it's also the way that you'll probably get more groups as a warrior if no one really knows you. They probably don't need a warrior, but if they have no choice but to get a warrior (like, say...there's no pally, SK, rogue, ranger, cheerleader, or quadriplegic nobel prize laureate available), level for level, and based on similar equipment, they'll take the &quot;fatty&quot; over the trash-can.<br />
<br />
Having said this, I still regret, to this day, having deleted and restarted my halfling warriorette some 2 years back. Given that I've always had a built-in group, I should have kept her and not given in to my base desire to have a burly barbarian with slam instead.<br />
<br />
YMMV, but good luck with whatever choice you make. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with the previous posters. I play a 65 warrior and 99% of the groups I get are when my friends get on; pickup groups are just really difficult to get for warriors unless there are no pal/shd available.<br />
<br />
If you want to be essential to a group, make a knight if you're set on playing a melee, otherwise go cleric/slower.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows warriors can't agro well and need help in that department; on the one hand that's good, if it's common knowledge maybe VI will fix it. But on the other hand, it took them years to fix wizards and knights - and in the meantime warriors are avoided for pickup groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dont be fooled by the simpletons before me ... Warriors are a fun class to play.<br />
<br />
A little frustrating at times, but fun regardless.  Only when you get into PoP grouping does it really matter if you have a knight or a warrior as your tank, aggro issues just dont happen like they do in PoP, only in your 50s will you notice the knight favoritism that everyone is so down on lately.<br />
<br />
With 40k to spend, Pick up an RBG, RBB, or Soulscream Belt.  A Wurmslayer, and a Lammy.<br />
<br />
Invest in Crusty armor for all the spaces you dont have armored already, then pick up some Velium Fire Wedding Rings.  Clattering Bone necklace, Cloak of the Maelstrom, and a gnomish vanishing device (for invis)<br />
<br />
Gnomes are weak, i will agree to that.  when people look at gnomes they dont think they are very capable warriors, its a myth that doesnt prove true by todays standards, but its a prejudice that has lasted since EQ started, back then, it was a truth.<br />
<br />
Make a Vah Shir .... no cultural armors, but who cares, there are other options out there now .... and they are just as rare, if not moreso than gnomes.  Kitty warriors are very few and far between.<br />
<br />
And chicks dig the fur ... and the tail ... they tend to just punt gnomes.<br />
<br />
Everyone here bitches and moans about not having fun playing a warrior, but they wouldnt play anything else if they had the option to .... because warriors are fun ... hands down no arguements fun.<br />
<br />
Nothing can stand toe to toe with something like a warrior.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get him some gnome cultural armor. The rightclicks are undeatable, even if they do cost a little to use in terms of mana batteries</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cloak of Greater Pernicity &gt; Cloak of the Maelstrom. A bit more pricey...but well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This thread just makes me sad.<br />
I hope SoE starts paying some attention like... oh I don't know NOW would be a good time! :rolleyes:<br />
You know things are in a bad state when someone comes to a class board asking for suggestions on creating a character of  that class and the majority of replies advise to make another class altogether.<br />
*Hangs her head in frustration*<br />
I say just play what makes you happy. If playing a Warrior does it for you, then do it. Take what Platinum you have and equip/upgrade your Warrior as best you can and go out there, somewhere in Norrath and kick some ass for Warriors everywhere.<br />
Thanks, done ranting now. ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey, Deadalus. Off topic, but I noticed your Magelo says you are on Zebuxoruk - might want to update/change that. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ill try to post a constructive reply rather than talk you out of your decision. Im not sure of the prices on some of this on your server, so you may have to shop around some. Since my warrior is agnostic, I know jack about cultural stuff, so ill stick with suggestions that would apply to a gnome warrior in general.<br />
<br />
-Blood Runed Greaves and Gaunts<br />
-Sash of Dragonborne or Soulscream belt would be good haste. Rbg if you can find one that doesnt put too large a dent into your funds.<br />
-Clattering Bone necklace<br />
-Cloak of the Maelstrom or Cloak of Greater Pernacity <br />
-Imbued granite spaulders if youre after ac or a Dragonwing Mantle of some sort if youre after a mixture of both.<br />
-Lammy, Wurmslayer, Centi, Exquisite Velium weps (no stats but decent damage), may be worth investing in a  Frostbringer. Might be pricey, but you'd use it for a while.<br />
-Cobalt boots (decent ac and a semi useful effect later on)<br />
- 6ac/65hp rings<br />
- With some of the new earrings coming from Ldon you may can snag some nice earrings pretty cheap, all i can suggest here is shop around a bit.<br />
- Fill in any random slots with Crusty for a sta boost.<br />
<br />
Maybe that will help ya get some ideas on ways to get started. Luck to ya!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">centi/jade mace combo, embalming skinning knive, two handed mtihril sword and sarnak battlehammer.  Thos are the weps you need until mid to late 30s and they'll work your skill ups.  Cheap and it'll get the job done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gladious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well after purchasing all those items someother suggestions may be for the not mentioned slots sarnak hide mask usually pretty cheap, cougar claw earings (not bad ac and stats) if you can I would recommend a nice bow perhaps, nightmarewood compound bow has awesome stats and you can keep it forever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I see alot of good stuff here but some people are trying to talk you out of play a warrior.<br />
Understand the warrior is the most fufilling class i have ever played in this game we don't have any fancy tricks to throw out there we step up to the mob and stand in its face take our beatings well and try to dish out some dps in the meantime.<br />
<br />
I am a 60th level warrior on xegony my gear is not the best in the game but i can stand toe to  toe with most any paladin.<br />
<br />
But understand to play a warrior takes a warriors mentality you got to be stuborn and know that you are the tank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kormad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You are past the lowest of levals I suspect already but Id suggest right after making a warrior or any class go to the bazaar and get all the hp items you can and a fast weapon as lvl 1 char 600+ hp is pretty cool and sad at the same time. merchant overnight and replace as needed as the other warriors have said I hope this is good advice this is what I have done with my alts pre 20 was only worry about HP and then go to AC/STA or whatever the class call for <br />
