<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lauthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am currently PL'ing my 42 warrior in DL with my 51 druid. My Warrior is well equiped with upto 3990 hp with cleric HP buffs and more typically 2790 with my druids skin buff.<br />
<br />
Although DL is ok for PLing I am expecting the exp speed to slow down in the next level or two so i am looking for the next place to move onto.<br />
<br />
I have a couple of ideas:<br />
<br />
Mines of Nurga<br />
KC<br />
<br />
But if anyone else knows of a good PL'ing place please let me know.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stop PLing.  Warriors are almost entirely dependent on groups.  Tanking in a group is a much different thing than having your druid get you free xp.  The only way to learn how to tank for a group is to do it.  It is better to learn those skills now in your 40s then it is to try and figure these things out in your 60s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lauthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When i say that I PL oftern its not just me in the group, I have a Shm and a Warrior friend who oftern group with me, my druid just pulls and parks buffs and deals with most of the heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it's just you and the druid, umberbulks in Echo are good xp until about 49.  You can also hit poj at 45 or 46 - then pod after a couple more levels.  Once you get 55, pov or cod might be doable depending on your gear and number of people in the grp.<br />
<br />
Also, once you get to 50 I'd try to always work with a full group - even if it means using pickups to fill it out.  The reason I say that is you need to learn group tactics with others...unless you never plan to group with anyone other than the friends you mentioned...in which case, ignore this one ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh yeah, you can do a bunch of LDoN at your level.  That's a whole different environment from outdoor zones.  The old Kunark dungeons are pretty good too, especially since they are not nearly as overcrowded as they were pre-PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SolusekB is yummy untill 47 or so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For straight-up PL'ing of melee characters in their 40's I like the grizzly caves in Great Divide. There's no loot to speak of except for some claws and grizzly skins here and there, but the exp is constant and the mobs are plain old melee types, no casters of any kind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sol B will take you all the way to 60 if you try hard enough =p<br />
<br />
Kobalds to mid 40's and then bugs and bats till 52ish.  LDC's after that or head towards the effreet lord.<br />
<br />
The entrance to the hole is pretty good late 40's early 50's too.</div></div><hr />
