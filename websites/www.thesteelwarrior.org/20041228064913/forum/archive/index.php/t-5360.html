<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havent played my warrior in over a year. I went and bought all the new discs I could and headed out to use them. I have upgraded to LDON. The first time out, I use Mighty Strike it toggles down and works. I wait 30 mins and it doesnt repop. When I click on it it tells me 13426 hours xx min and secs before I can use it again. I did a /petition and a /bug but have heard nothing as of yet. Its been 4 days and I just wanted to check and see if anyone else had incountered this problem and see if Im just doing something bone-headed and is an easy fix. All my discs are toggled, even bellow.... Any answers?</div></div><hr />

I'd be tempted to download all the patches again, though it is painful unless you have broadband.</div></div><hr />

Somehow my windows clock was reading July 12, 2002!!!!!! Wtf? Anyway hopefully this will do the trick! Thanks a million!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">please let us know if that works Reyd. your problem is not unusual. i used to have that problem and it fixed itself mysteriously after a few days. which mean s i never got around to checking my BIOS clock (although my windows clock was correct). its a problem many have had and  any feedback on solutions is always useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaron</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw, where do you buy the disc tomes in PoK?  I looked in bldg with the GM warriors.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Tomes can be found if you go in the PoK library and go down one level to the cleric NPC's. You go straight down the walk way where they stand and then follow it when it turns left and at the end of that walkway there is an NPC that sells the tomes.. Forget his name.</div></div><hr />

Every now and again, Incite won't refresh for about 3 mins. I haven't been able to determine a consistant occasion when it occurs to pinpoint its cause or recreate it though.</div></div><hr />
