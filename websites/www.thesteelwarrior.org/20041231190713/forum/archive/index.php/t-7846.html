When you target someone and /shield, two things happen, one all the melee damage your target took is reduced by 50%, kinda like a slightly better &quot;defensive&quot; disc for them, while you in turn take 50% more damage than your target.<br />
<br />
So if you target say a wizard, and you /shield on him, and the next blow on the wizard was to be 100 damage, the wizard would take 50 damage(50% less), and you would also take 75 damage(50% more). So the mob does 125% of its normal damage, in exchange for hoping to save someone's life. Putting on a shield(The AC) helps the damage the warrior takes directly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Far as hotkey I use 1 2 3 4 for the 4 most common hotkeys I use, 1-Main attack, 2- Kick/bash/slam. 3 - Taunt, 4 - Incite(disc hate).  5 - 9 i depend on the class i'm playing, but i usually reserve 10 for save my life stuff, like furious/fortitude, or Layhand, wepaonshield type.  But I also use WASD to move, so 1 2 3 4 is closest for me, while my right hand stays on the mouse to target and add a 3rd dimension to movement/viewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I macro disarm and taunt together, like this:<br />
<br />
Open a blank macro, and give it a title (ex. D &amp; T)<br />
<br />
line 1: /doability # (where # is the matching number of disarm on skills window)<br />
line 2: /doability # (same for taunt)<br />
<br />
To add chat text to the above macro, add:<br />
<br />
line 3: text<br />
<br />
 This text will appear in your chat window in your current chat type such as group, say, raid, etc. To specifically have it always appear in a particular chat type, just add the correct prefix to line 3:<br />
<br />
line 3: /gsay text</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/assist<br />
/pause 02<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
If thats what you meant, then just F8 or re-assist your MA or whatever. That will assist the mob youre on to gain his target then shield them, thats how my hotkey is set up anyway, you may need to change the /pause to whatever works for you with your ping. I have one that's just /shield clericsname also so theres no delay at all and I dont miss any attacks if its just the cleric getting agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some potential hotkeys for you at your level:<br />
<br />
Kick<br />
bash (or, if you are large race, slam)<br />
taunt<br />
incoming (/g incoming %T)<br />
assist me (/g Please assist me in killing &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; %T &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;)<br />
assist target (either the puller or your MT if you aren't him)<br />
range attack<br />
bind wound<br />
shield (/shield %T)<br />
shield cleric (or shaman or enchanter) (/shield player'sname)<br />
Discipline (obviously, depending on what you're doing, you could have a number of these.)<br />
<br />
I do not hotkey autoattack; in fact, I've left it on the Q key, but that may be fairly unusual; do what makes sense to you. You can also combine any of these commands (link them) in one hotkey with a slight pause between the two command lines <br />
/first command<br />
/pause 2 (or 4 or 6 or whatever)<br />
/second command<br />
<br />
The /shield player'sname command is very very handy, I think. I'm always in a big hurry when I want to shield someone, and I don't want to fiddle around switching targets. So, target mob, run up to mob (stand right on his toes) and hit /shield player'sname. You'll continue to autoattack the mob, and shield the caster without having to switch targets or losing any time.<br />
<br />
Enchanters who are attempting to mez a mob typically do not want you to be hitting that mob. However, you can /shield the enchanter and taunt the mob without interfering with the chanter's attempts to mez that mob. So that gives the chanter a bit of extra time.<br />
<br />
In your 30s you may well have to explain to your group that you will shield casters, then explain what shield does, and that the caster needs to be standing right next to you. And they need to stand still. Both taunt and shield have very short ranges, so casters who run around in a big circle squealing are doing almost exactly the worst possible thing they could do. (Now, some casters are quite capable of kiting mobs as a sort of crowd control, so you can't automatically assume the caster is inexperienced. But generally, casters running around getting whacked on the back by mobs = badness.<br />
<br />
I also have some specific hotkeys for certain situations:<br />
BACK: /g BACK OF THE MOB NOW PLEASE<br />
/pause 2<br />
/g BACK OFF THE MOB NOW<br />
<br />
(the above command is sometimes useful when you're in a dungeon or some other place where the &quot;push&quot; from the other melees can cause the mob to climb the walls or drop over a ledge or warp somewhere else entirely or get too close to other mobs that you don't want to aggro yet. Also, sometimes in pick-up groups where your only crowd control is root, some players will not get out of a mob's aggro range when it's rooted. Until they do, they will take damage from the rooted mob. Very inefficient.)<br />
<br />
RUN /g RUN! ZONE NOW PLEASE!<br />
/pause 6<br />
/g NO, DON'T ARGUE, JUST ZONE NOW. YEP, THIS MEANS YOU.<br />
<br />
CRAP: /g MASSIVE OVERPULL DO NOT ASSIST LET ME DIE.<br />
/pause 2<br />
/g MASSIVE OVERPULL DO NOT AGGRO MOB LET ME DIE.<br />
<br />
I tend to tell my pick-up groups not to assist on mezzed mobs until I call assist (obviously, I only do this if there is a mez-capable caster in the group). The reason for that is three-fold: it assures folks that you are going to tell them when the mezzed mob is ready, and it gives the enchanter at least a slight heads up. And, of course, in pick-up groups it suggests to them that the assumption is that you and you alone will break mez. Enchanters really like you if you break mez cleanly and in good order, and they really don't like it when you or someone else randomly breaks mez, especially when you break mez without being above the enchanter on the hate list. Some of 'em get darn touchy about it. When you suggest that they have a type A personality and that without some form of counseling on how to releave stress they may well face increased health risks, they get even more touchy. /shrug.<br />
<br />
Any of the /g hotkeys can be changed to /raidsay when appropriate. In fact, my CRAP hotkey is usually only up for raids.<br />
<br />
Uh, there must be more to it than that. I'm forgetting something, but anyway, those are some things to consider.<br />
<br />
You can basically hotkey a bunch of stuff that is sometimes useful. I don't have &quot;/g How's mana?&quot; hotkeyed, but I ask it fairly often, especially in pick up groups and expecially if I'm pulling. Often in pick-up groups at your level casters are a little reluctant to call for a med break--they don't want their mana to be the group exp bottleneck. So, if you think that's the case, you call for med break. If anyone asks for a med break, vote with them. A lot of players seem to think that med breaks slow down experience, but what really slashes a pick-up group's experience is when people die or the group wipes. Let your group's main healer know (perhaps in a tell) that they should feel free to call for a med break and that you always vote the same way the healer votes, heh.<br />
<br />
Another thing I'll sometimes tell pick-up groups when I first get to a camp is where I plan to position the mobs. Usually something like, &quot;I will be pulling the mobs to the beastlord's pet right here (stand there) and I will position the mob so its back is to the pet.&quot; Yes, it's a little bit anal retentive, but it clearly lets your group know where the mob will be and allows them to park themselves and all pets accordingly. It also prevents &quot;group creep&quot; in camps where you want your group to stay in one place, but find over time that people inch forward a bit on every pull in their eagerness to start killing the mob.</div></div><hr />

line 2: /doability # (same for taunt)<br />
<br />
To add chat text to the above macro, add:<br />
<br />
line 3: text<br />
<br />
I didn't know that could be done, in the mapping of those into one button.  I've been mapping the button where I keep taunt and disarm together.  Press button #3 and I do both.  However that screws me up when I switch over to my cleric, and forget about that button being mapped.<br />
<br />
Anyhow my question is if taunt and disarm are macro'd as you shown, is there a reason for Line #3 Text?  Forgive me if it sounds like a stupid question to ask, yet I feel the only stupid question is the one that isn't asked.<br />

<br />
aye, click on the target you wish to shield.  its best to be as close as possible..another reason to put a text macro in is so the person you are trying to protect knows it, and wont run away, causing your /shield to fail due to being too far away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield &lt;PC's name goes here&gt; is how it works...but you need to be fairly close to them, has a small radius to work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two of the ways you can shield a person:<br />
<br />
target the person and hit a hotkey that is set: /shield %T. <br />
If you do this, you can use one hotkey to target any number of people, but you do need to target them.<br />
<br />
or, if you think you might need to shield a specific person -- call him Bob (the trigger happy slowing shaman) then you can set up a hotkey specifically for Bob:<br />
<br />
/shield Bob<br />
<br />
You can then use that hotkey to shield Bob without targeting Bob. However, the only person you can shield with that hotkey is Bob (until you change the hotkey).<br />
<br />
In either case, you have to be very close to Bob to shield him. The reasons I suggested in the earlier post that you stand on the toes of the mob that is hitting Bob are 1) you'll be close enough to Bob to shield him, and 2) you stand a good chance of being closer to the mob than Bob, which will give you some proximity aggro and that might help you to get the mob to stop hitting Bob, which is what you ultimately want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep 2 /shield keys on my main page.  One called 'debuff' and one called 'healer'.  <br />
<br />
debuff looks like:<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 1<br />
/sh<br />
/poke<br />
<br />
I use F8 to retarget the mob after using this macro.  My healer key looks like:<br />
/sh &lt;name of healer here&gt;<br />
<br />
I have to update the macro everytime I get a new healer.  A bit tedious at first but when my healer's getting pounded I want to instantly shield them and not screw around with assist.  Hehe if the debuffer (or overaggroer) dies, /shrug.  If the healer dies its usually  :eek:  After a while I just update the macro with out really thinking about it.<br />
<br />
BTW, /shield tends to be GREAT for getting aggro back.  At least I've always used it (and had good luck with it too) as another aggro tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
For my example of linking disarm and taunt, no I don't add any text. But i just simply used that as a 'common' example of a linked hotkey (using more than one skill), and how you could add text to it.<br />
<br />
This page (http://www.tuatha.cc/topic.asp?topic_id=7976&amp;forum_id=30&amp;Topic_Title=AA+Hotkey)  I created on my guild's board explains how to create similar macro hotkeys based on AA abilities.</div></div><hr />
