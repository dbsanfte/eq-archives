<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today my guild was giving a shot at the bomber event in Inktu'ta, and since I've heard this event is DT-happy, I decided to see how much my spellshield helps.  I have 31% spellshield and I got a Bulwark of Alendar (absorbs up to 20% for 1600 spell damage).  So we screwed up and died and I got DTed, and I took 12200 damage from DT.  My total HP is about 12600 raid buffed.  Didn't have spellshield (the spell) or a Rune.<br />
<br />
I think I'll try to get a screenshot with some old world DT mobs that don't hit much.  I figure if I go in with rune/spellshield/alendar and DI my chances of surviving one is pretty good.  Any suggestions on one to use?  <br />
<br />
For anyone who cares, this also shows that spellshield is applied before runes, since 20000 X 0.69 - 1600 = 12200, and if rune is applied first the damage would be (20000 - 1600) X 0.69 = 12696.</div></div><hr />

It'll take you a little while to clear through to the first DTing isle, but putting an arrow in a mob with DT will basically guarantee you've got full health to start with. Getting a fear golem down and alone without dying will be a slightly different difficulty, thanks to happy aggro near him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I just need to convince some people to do it... :)</div></div><hr />

They hit for a fuckton too. <br />
<br />
Ahah! There's something else you may need to watch out for. Cazic Touch, the oldworld DT, acts very, very differently from Touch of Vinitrias, the Luclin+ DT. Cazic can and will ignore things like DA, there's a non-zero chance it'll ignore Bulwark, Spellshield, etc. Dunno which touch Inktu'ta mobs use, but, it's more than likely Touch of Vinitrias, or some recycle-altered variant.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember a very long time ago I saw a screenshot of Furor getting DTed for 19300 by Emperor Ssraeshza (700 for spellshield) and I'm pretty sure he just had DT like anyone else.<br />
<br />
I think fortitude and hitting a Tribunal might be the safest.  I'll try to get someone to do this then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oldworld Deathtouch is flagged unresistable, thats why DA doesnt block it, i'm 90% sure the luclin DT's have some high resist mod, but arnt unresitable, and thats why DA blocks, but i'd have to check lucy and i forgot name of those death touchs</div></div><hr />

<br />
not a big difference imo.<br />
we tried paladin disc sanctification on dread once, way back, and it didn't work. pally ate it :D<br />
and i seem to remember too what someone earlier said, oldworld DT hits straight through DA/HS/QVoX. been a while though.<br />
<br />
anyway, impressive amount of +spellshield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looted a few more spellshield thingies yesterday, did the math, and I should have enough survive DT now too. Got Inktu'ta tonight, guess I'll be the only one yelling 'CHOOSE ME!!!!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is the bombers can also melee for about 5k, which screws up anti-DT plans quite a bit.  The lowest I've seen them hit for is about 2K and that seems to be as low as it gets, so you have to survive a minimum of 2K + DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a 1200hp or so buffer, but for the first one I'm prolly just gonna pussy out and autoripo hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they proc DT instead of casting it so if you riposte you won't actually get DTed?  Last time I got killed by one it was like miss, hit 1900, DT, dead.  If they just cast DT I should be dead before the hit 1900 part (didn't bother getting Alendar that time so 13800 would've killed me fine).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a funky type of DT. It ignores FD and DA for a start I think, so it definitely doesn't need to come from a successful weapon hit. Maybe with VIE and another warrior shileding me....<br />
<br />
It'll probably get changed to DT=30,000 damage soon if the devs read this thread, but I think that would be a shame. A small chance of surviving a DT is kinda fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah but next expansion will probably have even more insane loot so high end players will have even more hp.</div></div><hr />

They seemed to melee through furious, either that or it ninja'ed me from behind. Had plenty for the DT, but got meleed for 2500ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They changed Cazic Touch.  You now take 32000 from a DT.  I havent checked other spells because I wasn't sure the name of some of the other DTs, but I'm assuming they are the same way</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, proof that the devs are reading our boards... I guess DT is meant to be deadly. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">death touch is death touch not really big and hurting touch!<br />
<br />
they'll prob make it so SS wont work on DT's, 32k with good spellshield seems overcomable if oow gives HP increase's like every other x pack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your using alendar in your calculations, would gain more by using calrena, 25% instead of alendars 20% if i recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

Since DT is 20K, even 20% is 4000 which is more than the max Alendar absorbs.</div></div><hr />
