<br />
I guess you missed the math on how Rangers are more efficient and heal more per time than Paladin heals. But you can just keep assuming that the Paladin would have healed better. <br />
<br />
Why don't you say,&quot;No sir, I have no real concept of how limited a paladin's ability to heal is, I'll shut up about how powerful those heals are until I either play a high level paladin or I'll accept the word of multiple paladins when they tell me that they're insufficient.&quot; That little speech would be more honest and would sound less like words coming from your rectum. <br />
<br />
So if Paladins are the perfect group tank, why do I lose groups to warriors now? Why do Knights in GoD not even get groups with our perfection? <br />
<br />
IF you're in a fight where the paladin is going to be sufficient to keep you up all by his lonesome, you're not going to need a heal during the actual fight <br />
<br />
Wow this is getting really dumb. Do you not even see how that if a Paladin can keep a group going with just Light of Order that a Ranger can do it better. So much better that its embarassing. <br />
<br />
<br />
We move on to the world and warriors are out to get us.<br />
<br />
What does our healing power vs a ranger have to do with our need for mitigation upgrades? Oh right, nothing. You want us watching the light show and listening to the scary voice so we don't look behind the curtain. You have no points. Knights need an upgrade and Warriors (Liper specifically in this case) don't want to share.  <br />
<br />
There's lots more as I am sure there are here but the thread is http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessageRange?topicID=858.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100<br />

Well, they undoubtedly will get all those things when the level cap is lifted to 70.  And what to you think Warriors are going to get, seriously?  My expectation is a lot of jack and a whole lot of shit, but maybe I'm overly pessimistic.<br />
<br />
But I have to agree with BB on one thing he says over and over again which appears to be more and more true as time goes on.  Knights, in particular Paladins, want tanking equality and spellbook superiority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, they seem to want to erase the warrior class from the game completely.  It boggles the mind thinking about how these people can seriously think tanking exactly like a warrior AND having a spellbook is balanced.  This shouldn't even be an issue.  How do these people deal with anything at all if they lack such simple common sense in a video game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
from what i tollerated to read, they are upset (/shocker) that a ranger can heal like 50 more hp for similar mana cost (extra 20mana), but some how totally dismissed the fact that the ranger needs to cast a three second heal 4 times to get the same effect as the pally that casts 2 one second heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its mostly rationalized by SoE i think becaues its also extremely fast, but the main problem is we have no good heals to fall back on for long cast timing, we  have another line of heals that are 5 second base, but barely do any more then our Quick heal.<br />
<br />
Ask for for better heals and clerics and druids cry foul!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not to mention shamans.<br />
<br />
Upgrade your longer casting time spell by even 200 more HP and you've got a heal that's better than what a shaman has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ask for for better heals and clerics and druids cry foul! <br />
<br />
Wanna know what's funny?  You guys aren't gonna be better tanks because you shouldn't match warriors.  You're also not going to get better heals because shaman are considered &quot;overpowered&quot; by SoE.  If shaman don't get a better heal, there's no way a paladin is going to get one, because that's just bullshit.<br />
<br />
So if I was a paladin, I'd be crusading for shaman healing power to get a bump.  Anything else is a waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because its much better to get on shamans/druids/clerics turf then it is to get on warriors right? -_-<br />
<br />
Healing and Tanking stack and scale differently accross content which makes class's like paladins really hard to balance and not be overpowered/underpowered at different content levels heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because its much better to get on shamans/druids/clerics turf then it is to get on warriors right?<br />
<br />
Actually I'd say it's because there is a lot more room for growth in heals then there is for tanking.  Shaman aren't anywhere near matching a Clerics healing power, so moving them up a notch shouldn't seriously threaten Clerics or even Druids.  While moving Paladins up a notch in tanking will seriously threaten Warriors, since they're barely a notch below Warriors to begin with, barring those times defensive is used of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">shamans are more multifaced then clerics, improve healing enuff and then can fill slow/cc and healing spot more easily shifting healing balance again in single groups, no res? pomt taken, but maybe have pal or nec in group or just dont need res because can get after!<br />
<br />
I dont nesicarily beleive all that I just wrote above, but yo u will get responess  like that and some have merit, its a lot easier to say oh well just upgrade something that wont be in direct competition w/ your class, and not look at from all perspective.<br />
<br />
/Shrug personally if it was up to me I'd revamp a lot of class's, then fine tune the changes after been done for a while.<br />
<br />
P.S. Glatius if my post comes of condsecnding/derogatory to you its not my intent,  your one of the more level headed/fair people that post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, wouldn't that increase Paladin attractiveness for groups with Shaman healers?  A Shaman with a slightly better heal combined with a Paladin to fill in for rezz, buffs, and who also has a slightly better heal seems like a pretty attractive combination, wouldn't you think?<br />
<br />
*shrug* I won't claim that there wouldn't be objections.  It just seems to me that for the most part that even when Knights find there to be issues with their spellbook, typically all they do is use that as attempted leverage to get their tanking increased.  Oh look, Rangers might  have a small marginal advantage in heals in some situations!  Therefore Paladin tanking needs to be improved!  And I have to stand there scratching my head going, huh?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it could possibly improve Paladin group attractiveness but my intent was to show that it would have effect on priest group balance, not paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because its much better to get on shamans/druids/clerics turf then it is to get on warriors right? -_- <br />
<br />
Not at all, it's just that you're not gonna get it, so I don't know why Pallies keep thinking they are.<br />
<br />
You're never going to be as good of a tank as a warrior.  Ever.  Nor should you.  EVER.  FOR ANY REASON.  You have a spellbook, we do not, and don't try to tell me that the 4 discs I get to use every half hour or so constitute your spellbook, because that argument is ridiculous, old, and tired.<br />
<br />
Now, concerning your spellbook, I think you can get a lot, but there are problems standing in the way.  The first is that shaman are considered overpowered because they can solo Kunark dragons.  Whoop de do.  My shaman has been healing basically exactly the same amount since Kunark, minus SCRM.  Meanwhile, my warrior has went from 2500hp unbuffed to 5500.  We have a problem there, and as long as that problem exists, Paladins can never get a healing upgrade because the thought of a hybrid outhealing a priest is as unrealistic as you outtanking me.<br />
<br />
Now, if we can get shamans what they should have got..which is an actual DECENT heal, then we can look at pallies and say &quot;okay, ya, there's lot of room for improvement here without stepping on anyone's toes.&quot;  Reasonable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm all for that, myself.  With slow mitigation, they can choose how powerful shaman can be.  This means that shaman need to have other methods of healing, increasing their heal is a good idea, and gives leeway in lesser healers being able to increase healing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarhl_MT</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What bothers me most about these pally and SK complaints is that, not only do they want to be near equal to warriors, but they want the average knight to be able to tank as well as a high-end warrior.<br />
They complain they can't tank in GoD -- well guess what? not all warriors can tank in GoD either, not even all lvl 65 warriors - I for one don't have the gear nor the AA's to effectively tank anything past the begining cpl zones. I can't effectively tank BoT towers nor can I do Hard LDoNs. I don't get chosen to be MA for any mobs beyond luclin, so at raids I am reduced to DPS (HA!). I can't even off-tank with out taking a healer out of the rotation (something that a pally or SK CAN do). These are all things I've heard knights complain they can't do and they assume that ALL warriors can just by virtue of being a warrior with Defensive Disc. I am certain there are knights doing all of these things that I, a lvl 65 warrior with my unmatched disciplines, cannot! THEREFORE, KNIGHTS NEED TO BE NERFED!!! j/k  ;) <br />
From my perspective they aren't even asking to be my equal, they are asking for most knights to be able to do things that not even all warriors can.  :mad: <br />
I really think they just long for a return to the days when everyone wanted a Knight as a group tank and us warriors were left to squabble over the single MA position at a raid.<br />

Thus a -1 DI for knights would not help us overcome the Defensive Cap.

Since those undergeared Warrior would now have an additional -1DI <br />

and then..<br />

that Knights are unable to function and cannot compete with Defensive Warriors. <br />

  The majority of PEOPLE I know have quit. Including myself. It's not your class, it's the game. Look at most of the mods here at TSW... retired. Lots of the most outspoken people in general... retired. It's the game that's not making itself fun, it's not us.<br />
<br />
 If these forums are seriously bringing you down so much, don't read them. Too many people get caught up in the drama and exaggerations posted that they start to believe that their class is worthless. Even warriors, when they had their worst aggro problems, were playable. Difficult, but playable. Knights are better off now than warriors were in PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's agreeing with him, saying &quot;my guild has paladins tank blahblah&quot;<br />
<br />
I dont have every single high end paladin in existance saying it.  I hear a lot of Time-geared paladins saying it.  Paladins tank right where they should be: they can MA mobs if they've farmed the zone those mobs are in.  You want to MA in Tipt?  You best have farmed everything before tipt (we have paladins who do tipt easy, and we arent even time farmed).  You want to MA in Ikkinz, you best have farmed Kod'Taz and Ikkinz loot.<br />
<br />
Paladins were never designed to be first choice tank, and paladins were never meant to farm the uberest of mobs in the game unless they too were uberest in the game.  That goes all the way back to EQ Proper -- paladins could tank nagafen at level 50 when they had the best gear in the game up to and including nagafen.  <br />

Somehow I feel sympathetic to paladins, maybe they should get better mitigation and more dps, better disciplines, etc., though I'm not willing to share my Cleric abilities with them.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Dismissing paladin overbalance/underbalance issues by saying some variation of &quot;Give them cleric stuff&quot; is like a father saying to a child &quot;I don't know how to deal with you, go find mommy&quot;; the two parent classes don't know how to deal with the child, and paladins are overpowered/underpowered in various aspects on both sides of the warrior/cleric angle. The biggest problem in giving paladins better heals is knightemization; it's very easy for post-elemental knights to reach 5-7k mana, matching and even exceeding some priests. Give paladins efficient heals, and they can outheal some priest classes, sustained, with enough of a gear advantage. Give paladins more HPS and they begin to compete with shaman/druid for secondary healer in GoD groups. A single, one-class fix isn't going to solve that. What makes the balance equation even more complex is that clerics are the most common class in Everquest, even excluding bots, and we can't solo effectively (I *can* solo in plane of fire, but not very effectively, and I'm one of very, very few clerics anywhere with the skill and tools to); reducing our raid or group role leaves a lot of clerics bored.<br />
<br />
I guess you missed the math on how Rangers are more efficient and heal more per time than Paladin heals. But you can just keep assuming that the Paladin would have healed better. <br />
<br />
Thott made a chart just before Priest Rebalancing I during Luclin that &quot;proved&quot; shaman are the best healers against any mob, even if it's unslowable. Just because he did some math doesn't make that math correct in practice, it just means Thott is a dumbass.<br />
<br />
If I had to balance the equation myself, I'd go for a full &quot;Priest Rebalancing II&quot; and include paladins, since they get most tools priests do, get better cures than any priest, get the only stun spells in the game with resist mods (except for one wizard god nuke), get a root spell that puts priests to shame, and can do more HPS with Light of Order than shaman can with Daluda's Mending.<br />
<br />
It'd probably be something like shrinking the healing spread between priests from 100-63-47 to 100-~75-~65, but reducing non-cleric healing efficiency a little further to make up for higher HPS, then giving paladins slightly more efficency in healing but with a longer casting time, plus a light of order-like fast heal that isn't interruptible.<br />
<br />
To balance clerics for giving up even more healing ground, I'd give them the last two things stopping them from being an actual caster class; variable-duration invis and a way to make their detrimental spells actually land, via a MR debuff on the tash line that is only about half as strong as tash. Then give shamans fixed-duration invis and druids an 1100 mana group heal. That makes clerics real casters, not some garbage quasi-melee class Sony doesn't know what to do with.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's beyond inaccurate to claim every high level Paladin but 1 has stated they can't tank in GoD.<br />
<br />
A truthful (in know this is a foreign concept for some) statement might have been:<br />
<br />
Some high level Paladins, Nomilus as an example, have stated that Paladins are not Warriors. They have a different role than Warriors, perform it well, and tank very nicely.<br />
<br />
Others, Iustus for example, originally argued that Knights must be able to suceed in all forced one group mandatory flag content and that some adds - Kyvv Heartstikers, etc. hit too hard to be comfortably tanked by melee hybrids. Since the GoD adjustments, most of these Paladins have fallen silent.<br />
<br />
Yet others, McBash, took up a crusade for Tanking Parity (and Spell Book superiority). Despite:<br />
<br />
1. Statements by Verant during Beta that they would not be creating powerful Tank Mages, fully capable Tanks and fully capable casters.<br />
<br />
2. Indications in early class descriptions that Knights were primarily warriors (small &quot;w&quot;), later clarifications stating the Warrior class would be &quot;unmatched&quot; as tanks, other statements the the Warrior role as primary tank would not change, and recent statements that like it or not Warriors would always tank better than Pallys and SK's.<br />
<br />
3. Adjustments by SoE to insure that Knights could get all forced one group mandatory flags, tank in normal experiance groups in GoD, and continue to perform their usual new cutting edge content raids roles.<br />
<br />
4. Defensive would not be shared.<br />
<br />
The Tank Parity (and Spell Book superiority) people see this as an opprotunity to reduce or eliminate a Warrior 3 minute tanking advantage that has existed for 4 years and is a Warrior class defining ability.<br />
<br />
The amusing part is the most vocal proponents are fellows like yourself with 6500HP's unbuffed that can not MA in Phase 3 much less safely MT CT or Inny in PoTime.<br />
<br />
To make Paladins like yourself, Graal, Gilfalas, Kaev, Aeka, etc. capable of doing content that is not trivial to 12K HP 100% Tanks is going to take a bit more than the 20 second Weaponshield-like &quot;burst mitigation&quot; capability Knights may be entitled to.<br />
<br />
In order to put such Paladins where they believe they should be in the game SoE will need to give them.<br />
<br />
1. Full Defensive. Better make that all Warrior AA abilities in case there's something else good in there.<br />
<br />
2. Permanent (-1 DI) mitigation when Defensive is not in use.<br />
<br />
3. Shield equipped (-2 DI) mitigation that stacks with any other reduction. The ability to use a shield when weilding a 2Hdr.<br />
<br />
4. Sturdyness 20, at 1 AA per 100HP's since they can't make it too hard for y'all players that can't even get past 200AA's.<br />
<br />
4. All Knight 1-handers to be Pimary/Secondary and Knights to get DW.<br />
<br />
5. Instant casting unresistable stuns effective to level 70 mobs.<br />
<br />
6. Holy Light, Virtue, AE Stun, and Slow<br />
<br />
Don't laugh - I believe I've seen each of these ridiculous ideas at one time or another on the PoN Class &quot;Balance&quot; forum along with repeated assertions that there should be three (sorry Rangers) tanks capable of MTing any mob.<br />
<br />
Many knights want to demote Warriors to just another tank. They are willing to let Warriors have Tendon Slice or even do a little bit more DPS. Anything as long as they can be the powerful Tank Mages that Verant said would never see the light of day (and did, for two expansions - hard to adjust to balance, isn't it?).<br />
<br />
IMO SoE should not make adjustments to a hybrid class that allow it to surplant a pure class in their area of specialization.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-29-2004, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the classes are fine.  Warriors are probably better than Paladin right now in the scene of raids but it's always been that way.  When you have 18 or 81 people you're more concerned with how to make use of your best people for each role rather than someone who's merely good at everything.  Anyway I don't see it as an advesarial situation.  There are plenty of times I yelled at the Knight slackers to take some burden off me, especially when I need damageless aggro (Warriors damageless aggro is absolutely worthless).  I tank better, and I actually aggro better too, except on mobs people try to slow before it's in melee range, but a Paladin is more flexible (and better on mobs people try to slow before it's in melee range).  Oh and a Paladin can keep someone who can't resist any Dark Mass on the Mshas alive by himself, while I cannot.  I think that's a fair tradeoff.<br />
<br />
As for single group stuff, Ikk trials are no longer necessary.  Did I miss the migration of everyone from PoP to GoD because that's where the mobs you actually can't stun are?  Assuming you are perfectly incompetent at stunning a mob, at mob round per 2 seconds you still get a straight 16% DPS reduction from Akilae (barring resists).  Yeah it's less if a mob is slowed, but any tank class can tank a slowed mob.  That's a lot more than my HP and DI-1 does for sure.<br />
<br />
And if by chance you're actually fighting stuff that can't be stunned, I don't know about others, but I very rarely use defensive/evasive in XP groups.  So I have my extra HPs and -1 DI versus your free shield.  I'll bet your shield wins over my -1 DI if you just want to talk about survival, and even if it doesn't, that's just the way it ought to be.  Obviously my Furious/AE Taunt/Fortitude has a huge edge on Paladins on burst survival/aggro (AE Taunt + Furious/Fortitude can get you 12 seconds on virtually any kind of bad pull) but I don't see how that's overpowered.  Even if none of your special abilities matter (because mobs kill too fast, even though they really do not), you still have root, and that is as good a lifesaver as anything else.</div></div><hr />

Now for the pally's who are reading here. (I know a couple of you. /wave guildies) Quit whine'n and beg'n for defensive. There are 3 or 4 knights in our guild who do the offtank job. (Thank god I hate being offtank.) They do a damn good job with no healer backing them up or a smaller healer to back them up.<br />
<br />
I did hear a good idea from a friend whose a pally. /Gasp<br />
<br />
Give paladin's a defensive style ability that lasts for like 45 seconds to 1 minute. (Basically a get me outta a pinch style defensive.) Here's the catch though. You MUST (I.E. No way around it MUST) wear a shield to use it. (READ WEARING A SHIELD ON YO STANKING ARM) thus reducing the dps done because your now weilding a 1hs. Its kinda like giving them our /shield ability (that does still exist right?)<br />

Bah what do I know I am just a warrior who caint tank in the sewers in GoD. (That place is worse than friggin Tactics.)<br />

That's flatly not true. NO Paladin has asked for a full defensive disc, and have not asked for ANY evasive disc, in any suggestion I've seen.<br />
<br />
ANY Paladin that has asked for defensive has asked for a PARTIAL defensive ability, of about 25-30% mitigation, and no evasive disc. Add to that the warrior's 12.5% innate better tanking ability, and that in NO WAY would acheive even close to parity between the warriors and hybrids. Course, those suggestions are moot anyway, because defensive (according to the devs, who have a track history of changing their minds, &lt;cough&gt;lvl70&lt;cough&gt;) won't be whored out to other classes like so many other warrior abilities have been.<br />
<br />
BB's claims that hybrids want tanking parity and spellbook superiority is just propaganda/rhetoric, with no basis in fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, this entire argument happened with clerics vs druids and shamans, before the other two healing classes got lesser forms of CHeal. So the precedent has been set. Neither were they asking for healing parity (and nuking/dotting superiority)... and look how well that change turned out.</div></div><hr />

Just not clerics and druids.<br />

It was my understanding fast heals came with a premium - I personally do not believe you should be getting all of fast healing and efficiency rolled up in one...unless you want to have healing superiority and tanking preference together, and which seems to be the tone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i kept up with my guild and have had decent attendance for well over a year, and when we started doing tipt and ikkinz..guess what? your right my gear wasn't good enough. was my guild supposed to keep doing time once a week and finish rounding out all the knights gear and leave GoD alone? i don't think so. <br />
<br />
the guild is fully capable of moving on, yet i wasn't able to keep up.  this goes back to your old argument BB, lazy paladins should just gear up and shut up.<br />
<br />
the ONLY paladins doing these with any sort of regualarity are paladins and SK's who were in guilds that had no choice but to farm time for 6 months because there was nowhere else to go. now that some paladins have reached well over 10k hp, suddenly thats where the bar has been set, and it's ridiculously high. and even these paladins are having riduculous fail rates.<br />
<br />
was there a hp requirement for knights to move on from VT? were guilds expected to farm VT when the guild was ready to move to insure the knights could do thier role effectively? why is this suddenly the case now? i'm not a newbie who just got into a raid guild and am lacking the level of gear as the rest of my guild. and i resent your implying so.<br />
<br />
9.5-10k should be plenty to move on with your guild to the next level, at the same time bringing that number up once you farm time more and get deeper into the expansion. it's not a 10.5k cut-off point where you have to sit out of raids 5 days a week because your not tall enough to ride. and if this is the case for your knights, i sincerly pity them.<br />
<br />
Others, Iustus for example, originally argued that Knights must be able to suceed in all forced one group mandatory flag content and that some adds - Kyvv Heartstikers, etc. hit too hard to be comfortably tanked by melee hybrids.

<br />
thats because they have given up and quit.<br />

and are you actually trying to claim that the content rebalancing worked? it made things WORSE, because in places where we actually COULD tank, like vxed and tipt trash, our stuns no longer land on them.</div></div><hr />

Nomilus and Iustus have quit?! There is some attrition atm. As near as I can tell it's whole guilds, people playing CoH or the WoW beta, players burned out, players disqusted with all the bugs, and as you note - some Knights that couldn't make the adjustment of being in extremely high demand for 4 expansions because of their spellbook to having to compete as Tanks based on HP's and AC.<br />

And this is the best evidence SoE performed due dilligence. The preponderance of stunable mobs allowed Paladin/Monk with SoT groups do very very well indeed. Having asked SoE to review and adjust, that's what SoE did. Unfortunately, this meant advantage was adjusted as well as disadvantage.<br />
<br />
Get closer to 10K HP's buffed. I assure you there is a difference. However, even then you will not tank like a 12K HP buffed Warrior.<br />

Incidentally I had a guild group in Vxed the other day. Our cleric 2-boxed a guild paladin, and we camped Chavoor's spot and killed him several times. Specifically the group consisted of PAL/CLR/ROG/ROG/WIZ/SHM (btw the other rogue has been inactive for months, owns sub-par weapons, and has just over 5khp). We had no problems at all.

My recollection was that starting with Velious, mana pool penalties were removed, more FT was made available including the venerable Crown of Narandi, Knight armor improved dramatically and the first of the Plate Tank/ALL armor began a long period of Knightemization, awesome 2H Knight weapons seemed to drop in every zone, Essence Blade was just a wee bit better than Essence Mace, etc., etc.<br />
<br />
I seiously have difficulty remembering anything major that Warriors received other than mobs widely resisting Blade of Strategy's proc and as a result every Warrior was dying to have the only aggro weapon worth a hill of beans - BoC. Years later players sell this staple aggro weapon for hundreds of kPP while Windblades top out at around 30k pp on my server. Even our epic was a curse disguised as a benefit.<br />

<br />
Personally I'd say that Late Velious - Mid Luclin was a tranisition era, where previous perceptions (Kunark Era - Early Velious) were still in the mindset of many, but in reality Knights were equal, to better off in groups, (although to be frank, that era had such low dps, that no one really cared at all, and moks/rangers would suffice for nearly all content xp group wise*,) it wasnt until CT revamp, that Knight aggro became more of an advantage that mattered, - espcially since taunt didnt work there for a while and mobs hit reasonable hard.<br />
<br />
*This is not to say people seeked out rngs/mnks, for any mnk/rngs readers out there, but rather to point out how low dps was and how little tanking mattered<br />

When not under defensive, the difference between a Warrior and a Paladin is:<br />
<br />
~386HP innate Warrior advantage after AoTC.<br />
<br />
&quot;-1 DI&quot; given to Warriors by the Phase 1 Melee Update to increase the overly modest Warrior advantage. This was a needed change intended to provide the proper balance.<br />
<br />
the 500HP Sturdyness AA Ability to provide those Warriors that obtain it a pure Tank specialization advantage not restricted to melee damage only.<br />
<br />
There are Knights that have argued this is all too much. What do you suppose their goal is? It's to as close as possible tank exactly like a Warrior and have a spellbook.<br />
<br />
Then there is Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared. It's not to be shared for one good and compelling reason. Warriors tank the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
The difference between Warrior and Knight tanking is intended, proper, and provides a different raid role for the classes involved - just like the Warrior/Knight spellbook gap. Warriors chose to be one dimentional and the absolute best at what they do - Tanking.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=7370) I advise a Warrior wanting to do GoD content to gear up by getting his LDoN augments and complete his tanking related AA abilities.<br />
<br />
There is burden to be well equipped if you wish to tank.<br />

You sir tank just exactly like you are supposed to given your class definition and progress within that class.<br />

So no, these numbers are most certainly not coming out of my ass. Thank you, come again.<br />
<br />
And is 25% too much? Considering the warrior present tanking advantage, the present warrior HP advantage, and the theoretical defensive advantage, I don't think it's too close at all. Just like the druid partial CHeal (not unlike the hybrid partial defensive) that was given to druids wasn't too close to cleric CHeal. There's NO way that would threaten our role on anything important, it's not like they would suddenly start using hybrids where warriors were available. After all, they didn't suddenly start using druids for a cheal cycle when clerics were available, did they? Of course not.<br />
<br />
It's irrelevant anyway, unless the devs change their mind (again), they're not getting any form of defensive, period.</div></div><hr />

Druid iCH was implemented because druids lacked a group role. As similar as that sounds to knight tanking issues today, there's a reason druid iCH only works in groups; once mob dps reaches a certain point, it becomes almost entirely useless (the same happens with CH later in GoD). Burst mitigation for knights would be usable on any mob in any expansion, group or raid, and make a significant difference.<br />
<br />
After all, they didn't suddenly start using druids for a cheal cycle when clerics were available, did they? Of course not.<br />
<br />
Because no matter the gear, all clerics use the same spells (except for Holy Light, which even in the highest-tier guilds many clerics don't own), and all druids use their own set of spells (with Sylvan Infusion being the rare spell). A guild with 4 cleric mains will use an app cleric with 4500 mana to heal instead of a druid with 7000, because no matter the druid's gear, they cannot beat the HPS (Healing-per-second) of Supernal Light while maintaining the same efficiency, and healing doesn't infinitely stack. A guild whose top warrior has 7000hp, and whose top paladin has 10000, will undoubtedly have the paladin tank on raids.<br />
<br />
The only similarity knight tanking issues have with druid iCH is the precedent Sony set by giving the generalist class a defining specialist ability. A precedent that did actually kill clerics' group role for a while (I spent the last 2 weeks of Luclin soloing low blue guards in echo, because it was the only xp I could find after Priest Rebalancing), and if it weren't for exponential mob dps increases in PoP and the fact that clerics were given a new specialist ability - much, much higher HPS/efficiency patch heals than other priests (pre-Priest Rebalancing, patch heals across all priests were nearly identical in HPS, efficiency, and cast time), it would have hurt the cleric class deeply.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't understand what knights are complaining about; I've done sncrematory with a time-flagged, zerg-guilded half-competent SK tank that couldn't even hit 6khp buffed before trials were tuned, and now after retuning Maelin's korean guild, a guild that is only halfway to time and was still on the korean server less than 6 months ago, where Luclin, PoP, aa's and levels post-60 didn't exist - a guild that has never set foot in VT and has only briefly visited ssra, has tanked Tri-Fates with a paladin. It's not easy, but it's possible. Tanking high-risk areas with generalist classes was never supposed to be easy unless the generalist is geared past the content, just possible.<br />
<br />
If you really want to argue the cleric-versus-druid precedent here, Daemonwynd, Warriors should tank right around 35-40% better than knights, not including the -1 DI advantage; that's the constant difference between Cleric Lights (Omen 3770, GoD 3275, PoP 2750) and Druid Infusions (Omen 2275, GoD 2100, PoP 1750) throughout major expansions, and that doesn't include the innate 5% bonus to non-CH heals clerics get.<br />
<br />
Since tanking only stacks very minimally, obviously 35-40% is too far between tank classes.</div></div><hr />

i have to wonder how much of that is actually true. i know lots of lower end guilds use paladin MT's for stuff like vindi, statue, tov etc, but i've never heard of a paladin tanking AoW...not saying its not possible, i'd be curious to know if it's been done actually. and if its been done, skip ahead a few expansions and lay the same knowledge to those, such ass emp ssra, or even bertox.<br />
<br />
i just think at some level of inc DPS, no amount of HP is going to counteract a sharp reduction in inc spike dmg that defensive would give. having a steady flow of inc dmg under defensive would be safer than spike dmg with a higher hp pool..</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually if you have a higher hp pool you can tank it the same as a lesser hp defensive warrior.    if DPS is decreased while using defensive by 40% and you have 40% more hp then the warrior you will tank just as safely with the same amount of healing.</div></div><hr />

One of the highest level Paladins on my server left a PoTime guild recently and applied to an EP guild. Yes indeedy he had more HP's and AC than their usual MT. They didn't invite him (not the original owner I suspect).<br />
<br />
With full equipment transfers PoTime equipped twinks are capable of transfering to a new server. If they are unable to find a PoTime guild, then an EP guild will do just fine.<br />
<br />
There are guilds started by Paladins that left a high level guild. In some cases they are well equipped and built up huge DKP balances before their new guild got rolling. They did in fact MT quite a bit on the way back to the EP's.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that all Warirors should always MT better than all Knights. However, the gap can't be so small that Knights could surplant Warriors entirely. Remember, the #3, 4, 5, and 6 guild Warrior often have no raid role unless the guild gives every Warrior a chance to MT. The #1-6 Paladin has a raid role even if they bag their weapon (not that they shouldn't tank mobs they can handle).<br />
<br />
Knights do not even have to ever be able to Tank like a Warrior as they were capable of in PoTime for all three classes to have a raid role. The problem is the the Warrior raid role is very appealing to primarily melee (and powerful caster) classes.<br />
<br />
They want Defensive so they can tank as much as possible like Warriors. Should Warriors buff, heal, and Res like a Paladin then? I think not - we are different classes.<br />
<br />
And Daemonwynd - Soledragon, Gilfalas, and McBash have all started threads where they have come out in favor of three tanks with the same role. It's not an isolated post.<br />
<br />
Besides, Knights don't need Defensive to perform their role in GoD - the content was adjusted.<br />

<br />
No, it's not isolated.  Not any longer.  At one time there were only a few Paladins over at PoN who had a delusional desire to be able to surpplant Warriors in all situations.  Of course this was back during PoP when Paladins were hands down the best choice for group MT, bar none.  Back when Paladins with 1-3k less HP and significantly less AC could still be selected over a far better geared Warrior for a group.  Now that the group MT attractiveness between the three tank classes has been pretty well leveled, they seem to feel the raid role should be leveled as well.  Forget secondary roles, Knights think their secondary roles suck.  Forget the spellbook, Knights think that when not MTing their spellbook sucks.  Basically they've come to the point where they want exactly what BB has been saying, &quot;Tanking equality with spellbook superiority&quot;.  And frankly, to a great degree they've stopped being rational about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so a monk with 2 shielding and 60 avoidance tanks 2.4% better then a paladin?  Say it ain't soo!<br />
<br />
You can see the similarities but let me show you something.<br />
<br />
DB 87<br />
DB 102 notice a difference?  that's a automatic 14 off of every hit.<br />
(hrmm not quite 15% is it hehe)<br />
<br />
Average hit difference will automatically go from 223 and 255 to 238 and 255 (smaller gap per hit no?)<br />
<br />
<br />
It's hard to quantify the warrior as tanking innately 12% better specially when the raw numbers aren't equal at the base equipment levels etc.<br />
<br />
The area's where it shows him bieng better (skills) is only slightly higher then a paladin by fractions of a precent.<br />
<br />
Also in the parse, how did the DI change for the warrior and no one else? or was the parse unable to factor the innate di mod? considering miss/parry etc and DB the larger part of the war advantage was in his shielding and -1di?<br />
<br />
So actually warrior superiority is like hrmm... 6-8%? there's a number that actually interprets the data and doesn't just ignore other factors.  the largest factor in it? -di and ac by appearances, nothing to do with warrior having higher riposte parry etc....<br />
<br />
pretty much ac and -1di...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't give two shits if you believe it or not... it just speaks volumes with the fact that you don't want to. Especially with your penchant for trying to claim I'm blowing smoke out of my arse. If you REALLY wanted to browse through the data, go track down the originator of the parse, even HE didn't post the raw data seperately.<br />
<br />
Secondly.<br />
<br />
Yes, monks tank close to hybrids in average damage taken. That's a fact due to the avoidance bonus monks have, that probably needs to be fixed too. Hence where I support moving warriors to -2DI and hybrids to -1DI.<br />
<br />
Thirdly.<br />
<br />
It's a fact that pure melee and hybrids make different itemization choices. Those choices are reflected in this parse.<br />
<br />
The warrior can concentrate SOLELY on a very few stats and numbers. AC, HP, and +tanking mods. That allows him to achieve quicker, and in the end, more tanking mods.<br />
<br />
The Paladin has to balance ALL of AC, HP, Mana, Wisdom, Flowing Thought (which takes anywhere from a couple to several slots), Mana Preservation, Spell Haste, Improved Healing, AND tanking mods. The Paladin is NOT going to have the shielding that the warrior has, because he's got a LOT more to focus on than just AC,HP and tanking mods. A Paladin is not going to have much if any shielding mods at the level the parse is at, so the data is not biased. ONLY when a guild starts getting close to finishing Time will the hybrids gain any significant amounts of these mods, and even then they will have less in the end than the tank who can concentrate on only a few mods. This is validated also by seeing the monk, who due to being able to concentrate on melee mods, ALSO has significant amounts of tanking mods.<br />
<br />
The data is not biased, the difference is accounted for by different loot choices by the different classes. You know, all classes being different, and all. It shows in a spectrum: pure melee:lots of tanking mods quick- hybrid:ome tanking mods, no so quickly-pure caster: rare tanking mods, eventually. Just like with casting mods: pure casters:lots of big of casting mods quickly-hybrids:big casting mods, not so quickly- pure melee:some casting mods, eventually.<br />
<br />
Hybrids are in the middle spectrum, getting some casting mods and some tanking mods, but neither of them very quickly due to having to get BOTH and not just one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While true, this isn't as big an obstacle as some would claim.  As has been shown, much of Knight useable gear has several catagories covered.  Almost never will a Knight have to give up HP for AC.  Almost never will a Knight have to give up HP for Mana.  Almost never will a Knight have to give up AC for Mana.  Most gear for Knights has equal amounts of HP and mana while also having high AC.  The various effects are available on a narrower selection of gear, but not completely unavailable.  And the fact of the matter is that Warrior gear also has effects available on it, that you could argue that Warriors needed to make trade offs to obtain, except for the most part the effects aren't nearly as beneficial for Warriors as for Knights.  Where is our equivalent to mana preservation?  Our equivalent to flowing thought?  Our equivalent to spell haste or improved healing?  The fact of the matter is that they don't exist.  So while you can attempt to portray the smaller catagory of areas that a Warrior has to focus on as a strength, by trying to argue that it's more difficult for Knights to cover all their areas to full potential, it can just as easily be argue that the Warrior has a greater limitation, since not only does he not have as many catagories for improvement, he doesn't receive as many improvements per item as a Knight, given that Knights almost always receive benefits from  AC/mana/HP on an item while Warriors only receive benefits from AC/HP.  And while Knights receive similar benefits from avoidance and shielding mods as a Warrior, the Warrior doesn't recieve similar benefits from mods targetted at casting.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Let me put it this way.  If you have a baseball player who hits lots of home runs, but doesn't field the ball worth a damn, and you have a second player who hits almost as many home runs, but fields the ball very well who will gain greater advantage?  The player who becomes only a slightly better hitter, or the player who becomes a better hitter and a better fielder?  Just because some players focus more on their fielding than their hitting doesn't mean they couldn't have focused on their hitting.  And that doesn't mean that the guy who can only hit is suddenly benefited more than the other guy who can do both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's more with the affects that it's a concern than with stats of any sort, obviously. Knightemization. Lots have items have just about every stat under the moon. Effects are more limited to one or maybe two for the vast majority, and a choice needs to be made between FT/focus/tanking mods and tankingmods/tanking mods/tanking mods.<br />
<br />
IE where a pally goes Healing mod/spellhaste mod/manapres mod/FT/FT/tanking mod//tanking mod a warrior can go tanking mod/tanking mod/tankind mod/tanking mod/tanking mod/tanking mod/tanking mod.<br />
<br />
You give an example, which only goes so far.<br />
<br />
When you're looking for something to be made for you, do you go with the journeyman who can do several things for you, but only so well? Or do you go for the master crafter who can do something for you, and do it for you very, very well?<br />
That's what specializing with the tanking mods tank will do for you, he's going to tank for you, and tank for you very, very well. The hybrid, he's the journeyman. He can tank for you, but not quite so well, because he has other choices to make as well, to support his casting. End of the day, you take the amster crafter if you need the tanking done well, and you take the journeyman if other things are important. Not that hybrid casting is really all that good enough that people take that into account and take them in group because of it.<br />
<br />
I don't see the problem with closing the defensive tanking gap a bit, as long as if at the end of the day, the warrior STILL is preferred for tanking named over the hybrids, and we're equally desirable in XP groups. As long as OUR role isn't threatened at all, what's the big deal? We're STILL the master tanks, STILL the ones being taken for named when available, and just as valid choices as a hybrid for XP groups without named hunting. If any change is great enough where hybrids are taken over us for named, well, fuck that, I say, nerf the hell out of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladins can actually do the same thing.  The fact they don't choose to, means they want to focus somewhat on their casters side and make that better (however these gear choices do not reflect a difference in class abilities to take damage)<br />
<br />
The data is not biased,  <br />
<br />
You are 100% correct, you know what is biased?  the interpertation of that data.<br />
<br />
Data on it's own is rarely biased.  <br />
<br />
See the problem? YOU have interpretted the data as straight up oh the dps is 12% lower on a warrior that proves warriors tank 12% better then paladins.  Will you say monks tank better then sk/pal because they parsed at lower DPS? when it's the damage spikes and ability to live through them that make the fights or break them?  Or will you just say but that's because he has 60 avoidance (holy crap)  You HAVE to take the ac and shielding mods into account.<br />
<br />
Then you also need to factor that the data is wrong in one area so might be wrong in others (we all know DI does not change so how is DI different on the warrior?  answer data is either wrong or the interpretation is wrong)</div></div><hr />

Yes. They do. Because those choices translate into what's actually going to happen. In other words, reality, and not theory. Because those choices reflect the choices of the vast majoirty of Paladins gamewide.<br />
<br />
 You are 100% correct, you know what is biased?  the interpertation of that data.<br />
<br />
No. You know what is biased? The perceptions of the person who is viewing the data presented by a person. YOU don't like me. So you're going to be biased against what I say.<br />
Data on it's own is rarely biased.  <br />
<br />
See the problem? YOU have interpretted the data as straight up oh the dps is 12% lower on a warrior that proves warriors tank 12% better then paladins.<br />
<br />
Which a dev statement backs me up on. Sorry, not going to pull that one off.<br />
<br />
You HAVE to take the ac and shielding mods into account.<br />
<br />
I did. And the different loot choices is the reason. I don't have to subtract them, I don't have to change the numbers, I just have to understand WHY it's that way, and that that difference is there because that difference actually exists in the game.<br />
<br />
Then you also need to factor that the data is wrong in one area so might be wrong in others (we all know DI does not change so how is DI different on the warrior?  answer data is either wrong or the interpretation is wrong)<br />
<br />
Wrong. The DI difference is from the warrior -1DI change, not incorrect data, and not incorrect interpretations, you just don't know what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it does, from warrior to non warrior. With a DI change, the DI will be different for the warrior than it is for the others. That's why it's shown that way. Obviously the mob's base DI is what's shown for all other classes. BUT those intervals will be less for the warrior, which is why it's shown as less.<br />

You know what, if that's what you choose to believe when I do that math FOR you, there's nothing I can do. It's readily apparent by your very first post of &quot;You're talking out of your ass&quot; without even asking for any proof first, that you're only interested in believing what you want to believe.<br />
<br />
As for the dev statement being only 5%, I have to wonder if you know anything about math at all. When comparing two numbers as a percentage, you have to CONVERT the numbers so that they reflect the same thing. You can't just go from damage taken from one class to another, do that math to find the percentage difference, and then with the other source simply subtract one from the other. Again, this shows that either A: you don't know how to compare different sets of numbers, or B: You're only interested in seeing what you want to see. Both are equally likely.<br />
<br />
your secondary proof (which is a random e-mail apparently someone got?) doesnt' allign with your first proof so how is it secondary?  All it backs up is that warriors are superior to paladins and SK<br />
Yes, it does align. Your not knowing how to compare numbers doesn't mean they don't align, it just means you don't have a clue.<br />
<br />
All I've done is point out where the first data is wrong, and where the other &quot;data&quot; is not close to your asertation of warriors bieng 12% better (a number you have indeed pulled out of your ass)<br />
<br />
Now if things just slip out of your ass so easily now that you don't notice it, stop biting the pillow and look at things from a mans perspective sometime.<br />
I rest my case, you just proved it for me. Still doing the same thing now as you were in your very first post, even before and instead of asking for proof... Still utterly convinced in your own mind that &quot;I'm talking out of my ass.&quot; No matter what I've said, you've still clung to the same thing, which proves the problem lies not with what I've said, the problem is YOUR bias. Proof? If this had come by a source that you were NOT biased against, you would likely have taken it at face value, or at the VERY least not immediately dismissed it as someone talking out of their ass. <br />
<br />
But you know what, I'll even give you a THIRD thing. That one being that when talking about the warrior advantage on boards such as EQLive, OTHER posters mention the same kind of difference that I've already shown. Do a search on warrior tanking advantage to see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Example: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shadowknightbalance&amp;message.id=1427#M1427<br />
<br />
So we have 3 different things on one hand, all saying about the same thing, and thenw e have you on the other hand, desperately trying to pick apart everything to descredit what I'm saying, but offering NOTHING yourself to actually show it to be any other way.<br />
<br />
Give it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladin average damage taken: 130.4<br />
Warrior average damage taken: 109.2<br />
<br />
130.4/109.2 = 11.9% warrior advantage over paladin damage taken.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Let me try this a different way.  A) that parse does not indicate a 12% tanking advantage for warriors, it indicates that the warrior had wayyyy better gear then the paladin to the tune of 15% shielding and over 200ac more.  That's a gear difference not a CLASS difference.<br />
<br />
Then your post from the devs.<br />
<br />
Dev statement of warrior mitigation and hybrid mitigation for average gear: 44%&lt;warrior&gt; 39%&lt;hybrid&gt; = 44/39= 12.8% warrior advantage. <br />
<br />
While the % is mathematically correct the presentation is wrong.<br />
<br />
According to what mattered to you a monk has a tanking advantage of 3% over knights! omfg they are overpowered! nerf them!<br />
<br />
You have given any factors other then DPS zero consideration.<br />
<br />
You link two things that are in fact different as supporting facts.<br />
<br />
Let's put it this way<br />
<br />
if a paladin say mitigates 1% of damage, and a warrior mitigates 2% you would by your conclusions and assesments say &quot;OMG warriors tank 100% better&quot; when in fact they only tank 1% better.  You see your mistake? hrmm probably not, you seem to get &quot;paid&quot; by the post.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's say a mob does 100dps.<br />
<br />
a warrior would mitigate 44% making it's dps roughly 56dps  a Paladin would mitigate it to 61dps.<br />
<br />
Too say that the warrior  Add to that the warrior's 12.5% innate better tanking ability, and that in NO WAY would acheive even close to parity between the warriors and hybrids.<br />
<br />
in your parse you provided as proof to the innate better tanking ABILITY, there's a qoute  something along the lines of &quot;tanking is more then just dps taken&quot;  <br />
<br />
IF a paladin can heal the equivlent of 60dps, would that then mean they have a innate ability to tank better by whatever %? no.<br />
<br />
if you want to find the innate tanking difference you need a parse with absolutley no gear advantage, just raw skill.<br />
<br />
strip both classes naked with humans, give em max skills and the same FS weapon.<br />
<br />
Then tell me what the taning difference is?  wait... we couldn't do that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Upgrade your longer casting time spell by even 200 more HP and you've got a heal that's better than what a shaman has.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont think adding 200 hp to the heal I  still can never use while doing my job would allow me to heal 152.043 hp/sec more.  Or did you not realize that over 5 minutes, a shaman puts out 290.723hp/s and a paladin does 138.68hp/s in full raid buffs + max ft (18s, 19p)... and with both classes actively doing other things (paladin tanking, shaman Malo'sing, Slowing, crippling, and keeping FA up, can still hold 150+ hp/s while a paladin holds an amazing 16.743hp/s (as of last parsing)?  Oh, it only ends up more in the shaman's favor after 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Somehow I dont think adding Healing power to a spell a paladin cannot actually use will even dent a 896% advantage a shaman has.<br />

As someone who has played a Paladdn, Bard, Cleric, Shaman, Druid in highest level raid and group situations, and additionally a rogue, ranger, monk,  and enchanter in group situations, I generally know what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins want to be able to do our job. As it stands, there are very few places in current content you want a paladin, because the difference in tanking is in no way, shape or form balanced out by the waste of space we call a spellbook. <br />

Someone explain to me how Stuns that dont stun, heals that cannot be cast while in combat (for a tank class), buffs that dont work when a cleric is present (and clerics are sort of required for GoD), and Heals over Time that cannot be used when a cleric or shaman is present (see that clerics: required thing) serve as any sort of utility.</div></div><hr />

Sophistry. The fact of the matter is, a 1325HP 450mn spell is BETTER than The BEST direct healing spells that one of the pure casting healing classes get, and you would be a hybrid MELEE. (you know, 25% cleric)<br />
<br />
Shamans would start screaming bloody murder, and there's absolutely no way they would accept your argument.<br />
<br />
Look, I'm not necessarily against paladin healing upgrades... I support it, with the caveat that it would have to be part of a larger upgrade for ALL the lower end healing clases, rangers, beastlords, paladins, AND shamans.... the entire lower end is really starting to suck with the higher DPS mobs are putting out.</div></div><hr />

A shaman can't heal as fast as a paladin. A shaman doesn't have any group heal.  Agreed a paladin just cannot be main healer in a group, unlike shm / druid / cleric, but  they are really awesome back healer, very efficient in emergency situation because they heal much much faster than shm / dru.<br />

<br />

present (see that clerics: required thing) serve as any sort of utility.<br />
<br />
Brell stack just fine with cleric buff, and you don't need a cleric for any kind of xp group, even in GoD.<br />
There are clerics that do use their heal over time ? I've not seen any for quite a while now. except MGB HoT. That was ok during early PoP but now...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet those choices do not have to be made and if the warrior had been lucky enough to get every shielding item in time and the paladin just broke time and hasn't even seen quarm yet? (likely considering the gear in the parses) How can you say that with a straight face the only way to show the taning difference between classes is identicle gear.<br />
<br />
Then it's a simple factor of figuring what's needed gear wise, and if paladins only role is taning there is no need for other things meaning a war and paladin gear choice can and should be the same.  Gear differences is not taning differences.  <br />
<br />
If I produce a parse 15hrs long with a paladin in time gear and a warrior in time gear, but the paladin has all the shielding and avoidance mods possible and the warrior has all the attack regen, and the paladin parse comes out ahead of the warrior I'd assume it'd be valid to say &quot;paladins tank x% better then warriors, ignore the gear choices because that's just what there were choices&quot;  <br />
<br />
If you can't see the flaw in your argument yet you are the dumbass people give you credit for.<br />
<br />
&quot;The AC and mitigation differences reflect REAL differences IN GAME, due to differences in LOOT CHOICES made by hybrids and warriors&quot;<br />
<br />
Gee really?  and in a game where gear is a deciding factor between cutting edge players and not so, you'll then say stupid gear choices are irrelevant?  Oh and then say the tanking difference inhernt to a warrior is 12%.... it's soo stupid it's not funny.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or did you not realize that over 5 minutes, a shaman puts out 290.723hp/s and a paladin does 138.68hp/s in full raid buffs + max ft (18s, 19p)... and with both classes actively doing other things (paladin tanking, shaman Malo'sing, Slowing, crippling, and keeping FA up, can still hold 150+ hp/s while a paladin holds an amazing 16.743hp/s (as of last parsing)? Oh, it only ends up more in the shaman's favor after 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The fuck? Please explain how a shaman can heal 900+hp per tick over 5 entire minutes, while doing slows, cripples, FA, and resist debuffs, when Trushar only does 420 per tick and at max healing haste (Quickening of Mithaniel + Blessing of Reverence) has a cycle time per cast of 6.1 seconds (3.6 to cast, 2.5 sec fizzle time). Daluda's cycle time isn't much shorter than that at 4.8 seconds, and would have to be cast every 3 ticks or so to maintain 900+hp/tick. Total mana spent on heals alone over 5 minutes would be around 7000 (14 Daludas and 6 Trushars, assuming SCM3, SCRM, Chrononostrum, Preservation of Mithaniel, and Marr's Blessing), plus the mana costs for everything else the group requires - 280 mana per Malos, 0 for slow if the shaman owns Time's Antithesis, 245 per FA, 158 per cripple (after SCM3 + Conservation of Xegony). I've seen enough whine threads on EQCleric by shaman that claim that Cannibalize mana regen sucks to assume that very few shaman, if any, can burn 10 thousand or so mana in 50 ticks, and my figures used GoD spells and several time-level focus effects/items that cut down mana costs substantially.<br />
<br />
And as for your Paladin figure of 16.743hp/s over 5 minutes, that totals up to 5022.9hp over 300 seconds. Using nothing but Supernal Cleansing, the total healing over 5 minutes is 12500hp; nearly two and a half times what you claim, and over the course of 5 minutes Supernal Cleansing cast 9 times only costs 2160 mana. The Chrononostrum and Preservation of Mithaniel focus effects I assumed are from Trimdet (Paladin Qvic armor) boots (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68863) and Necklace of Eternal Visions (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9289), respectively; 2 highly-prized focus effects for paladins without sacrificing an inch of tank equipment. Since PoP/GoD and knightemization inflated hybrid mana pools to retardedly-high levels (You yourself have 6300+ Barraind, and your magelo only shows a few time items, and nothing from high-end GoD), I'll assume you can afford to spend 2160 mana over 5 minutes, even though with max ft and just aotc you'd recover 1100 of that mana while spending it - net mana spent, 1060. So for the cost of one Omen group heal you can heal 41.667hp/s over 5 minutes, and that's only using cleansing.<br />
<br />
I'd say the &quot;896% shaman advantage&quot; is 896% bullshit. You must be a veteran of PoN's &quot;Fastest Nerf In History&quot; during Luclin, where PoN posted parses of a VT-geared cleric's dps against a paladin wearing trash, resulting in Sony nerfing the new cleric proc hammers within 48 hours. Seriously, a level 60 Paladin can't beat 30dps?<br />
<br />
Your whole &quot;parse&quot; is ludicrous even without the fake numbers; I can stand around and chain-cast Holy Light, and over 5 minutes I *might* break 350hp/s - only because I run out of mana in the first half of that 5 minutes - and a druid could sit on a horse and chain-cast Karana's Renewal, over 5 minutes healing a total of 133660.8hp; 445.536hp/s. If you're going to compare efficiency vs speed, efficiency will always win over time... otherwise there would be no point in using efficiency-based heals. Paladins don't have efficiency because they aren't priests, and Shaman don't have speed because they can cripple most mobs' dps.<br />
<br />
PoN would be a ghost town if Paladins would actually aim for being 75% warrior, 25% cleric while retaining a few unique niches (best stuns and best cures in the game fill that department), instead of this 120% of a warrior, 80% of a cleric role they can't seem to stop whining for.</div></div><hr />

You know why he took such a lesser amount of DPS? the 60 avoidance, yes monks dodge/block more crap then any other class, but his largest advantage was avoidance.<br />
<br />
just looking at miss % from cleric to druid (hard to say but I'd say it's reasonable to assume every 10 avoidance = 1% miss chance)<br />
<br />
a paladin would get missed 6% more, add to every hit having 15% or more taken off the DB and it's very very easy.<br />
<br />
Trydan's Chestplate of Nobility 2% shielding<br />
Greaves of Furious Might   + 4% shielding<br />
Earthen Bracer of Fortitude  +2% shielding<br />
Necklace of Eternal Visions +2% shielding<br />
Shroud of Eternity  + 4% shielding<br />
14 shielding there<br />
now for the avoidance.<br />
<br />
Globe of Mystical Protection 10<br />
(just time shit)<br />
<br />
DB from the paladin would then hit about 88<br />
warriors would rise to 102 (increasing DPS taken by warrior and decreasing the amount taken by paladin)<br />
<br />
Then you'd also decrease the dps by 1% from the avoidance.<br />
<br />
Then the AC difference which the paladin would anihalate the warrior in insuring almost always a max hit probably or high spectrum of hits.  <br />
<br />
to say &quot;The difference between warriors and knights is big enough that this cannot happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
is completely devoid of any serious thought.  <br />
<br />
Take a look at the hits, DB along was making up a total min of at least 30% of the damage, shielding of 14% would reduce the damage per hit by at least 4%.  which since a warrior mitigate what was it? 5% better then a paladin/sk you then have only 1% to overcome and I assure you the AC value would more then make up for that without factoring in 10 avoidance.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up,  saying x numbers mean something without considering every difference between what you're contrasting is not accurate and does nothing but sow lies to a apparent advantage that is not as large as it's bieng presented as.</div></div><hr />

Wrong again. You're arguing the wrong level for the parse. The level of the parse is at is Time while having  just killed Quarm or so. We're not talking about a level where the shit has been farmed out of Time yet. Therefore your post about possiblities of what they can achieve when they can farm the shit out of time is irrelevant, because that's not the level the parse is at. Only if the parse was done when just about everyone's got everything they could ever want out of Time, would that have a shot at being valid.<br />
<br />
Then the AC difference which the paladin would anihalate the warrior in insuring almost always a max hit probably or high spectrum of hits. <br />

A warrior will out-Tank a Pal/SK on every single EQ mob.<br />
Let there be no doubt on that fact. (Of course ripostes could mean nearly equal tanking)<br />
<br />
Paladins/SK need more than 75/25 to be a really viable class on the top end.<br />
80/40 or something around these numbers.  Why ?<br />

Yes, the extremely high end Paladin (after farming Quarm long enough to get everyone all the drops they want) can reach very close to what a warrior can reach. The difference drops quite significantly.<br />

I'm somewhat shocked that you would try to pass off data as supporting a 12% Warrior tanking advantage when you acknowledge:<br />
The AC and mitigation differences reflect REAL differences IN GAME, due to differences in LOOT CHOICES made by hybrids and warriors.<br />
<br />
1. It's a CHOICE. Hybrids can chose otherwise and tank more like a Warrior. I, for example, could chose to stress Strikethough, Combat Effects, Haste, and Attack in order to produce higher DPS. IF I make such a choice, then I'm not entitled to complain that my tanking suffers as a result.<br />
<br />
2. You further admit the data is cooked because the status of the players is barely PoTime rather than PoTime extensively farmed. The two most important focus effects for a Paladin are:<br />
<br />
a. Improved Healing, which just happens to be the effect on Trydan's Chestplate of Nobility - Marr's Blessing, Increase Healing by 30%.<br />
<br />
b. Mana Preservation, which happens to be on Necklace of Eternal Visions - Preservation of Mithaniel, Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 20%.<br />
<br />
both of which appear on excellent AC/HP equipment with Shielding even - NOT a compromise in the first place.<br />
<br />
IF you want to state not geared up, not ready for advanced content, haven't completed previous content, poorly geared for tanking Paladins are at a tanking disadvantage compared to better geared Warriors, I suppose that's a reasonable assertion.<br />
<br />
But that is the only point you have made. And after the extreme misrepresentation, I'm surprised you would argue about it and persist with creating the impression that Warriors have an innate 12% tanking advantage which you ultimately admitted occurs IF and only if Knights chose to give it to them. (And even this is NOT true).<br />

The fact that it's a choice is irrelevant, because of the fact that just about every hybrid makes the choice to not focus on tanking alone. When you're talking about balance, when you're talking about the way things are, you need to look at what the majority is going to do, you need to balance to the choices that players DO make, not the choices that players theoretically COULD make, but don't.<br />
Are you now going to claim that because a caster can focus on tanking, HP and AC, that any parse done with casters who DECIDE to concentrate on their mana, FT, and mana regen instead, isn't necessarily reflective of the way things are? Come on.<br />
<br />
2. You further admit the data is cooked because the status of the players is barely PoTime rather than PoTime extensively farmed. The two most important focus effects for a Paladin are:<br />

Paladins aren't &quot;giving&quot; the tanking advantage to anybody. Short of the top .1% of Paladins, that advantage exists. The fact that this parse is representative of 99.9% of the player base is a GOOD thing and not a bad thing. <br />

Get your head out of your ass and realize that the top 1% are NOT the only ones that matter, and are NOT the only ones who should be balanced to. The other 99.9% pay their $13 a month just like you do, and should matter just as much.</div></div><hr />

This is not an identically geared Warrior advantage nor innate. It in fact exists in sub-optimal and differently geared tanks.

Exactly, and just because you choose to heal better doesn't mean you need a tanking improvement.  And just because you do more damage, doesn't mean you need a tanking improvement.  If you haven't focused in on tanking as the primary objective, that's a choice and doesn't give you leverage for additional benefits.</div></div><hr />

Sub-optimal is all a matter of perception. While you as a warrior demonstrate that you think that only taking tanking gear is the &quot;optimal&quot; way to gear up, many hybrids can and do demonstrate that they feel &quot;sub-optimal&quot; is gearing up so that they totally ignore a facet of their class, and concentrate on tanking alone.<br />

Again, you're making these judgements based on YOUR perception of what &quot;sub-optimal&quot; is. Hybrids demonstrate by their gear choices that they feel &quot;sub-optimal&quot; is something different. <br />
<br />
What you've got to understand is that making different loot choices does not necessarily mean they're making &quot;sub-optimal&quot; choices, it just means they're making what they feel are THEIR &quot;optimal&quot; choices. <br />

This parse is representative of the largest part of the population. The warrior vs hybrid will change a bit, pre-tanking mods, and same vs monk, but not extremely so. The AC differences will scale down with content.<br />
<br />
Far better than the absolute top end of even the people in TIME that you were trying to limit it to.<br />
<br />
You want to compare tank ability in different levels of gear that's a different issue which you would say &quot;this person in this quality gear tanks x% better then this person in x quality gear&quot;  But it would not be &quot;a warrior tanks y% better&quot;<br />
<br />
And how would you have it? &quot;Well, at x level and y gear, they tank better than a hybrid of x level and y gear, but this x level and y gear, they tank worse than x level and y gear, but better than x level and y gear?<br />
<br />
Don't be freaking ridiculous. Way to completely overanalyze and overcomplicate things. OF COURSE the number will change with gear, levels, and AA. That's a &quot;well, DUH!&quot; situation. But it's the AVERAGE that's a concern, and the AVERAGE is about the only way to compare.<br />
<br />
This parse is only REPRESENTATIVE of several different sources and several different people, and statements of still OTHER people, who are all saying around the same thing.<br />
<br />
But here. I'll make you happy.<br />
<br />
A warrior will tank, ON AVERAGE, 12.5% better than a comparable hybrid.<br />
<br />
Happy, or do I have to go into the freaking legaleze with disclaimers and crap?<br />
<br />
Sheesh. It's amazing how much grief people who have got jack to contribute to an argument, can make an argument. Maybe i'll just take a page from their book... instead of bothering to provide any evidence, I'll just pick apart the fool who actually presented the evidence's points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im in an ep guild and can't yet speak for time ,or, much god content.However ,the knights in my guild are very active tanking on raids and in xp groups.They do at least as much as the majority of our warriors on raids.Perhaps, tuning in some manner is needed in higher content,but, thats beyond my experience and probably yours.I'm ma and I always prefer a strong knight taking over for clearing duty.They have better aggro tools for the job imo.<br />
<br />
Narrowing  the measure of tanking strength between knights and warriors now would break what was just fixed and doesn't make any sense.You have a subjective opinion and nothing more.It runs counter to recent attention by the dev's and the majority of opinions on this board.I don't think it's selling.</div></div><hr />

I find that funny, coming from the guy that claims that even at the parse is at, that Paladins have an AC &quot;advantage&quot;, and they'll have just as much shielding <br />

Hmmmm. THIS reads to me:<br />
Then the AC difference which the paladin would anihalate the warrior in insuring almost always a max hit probably or high spectrum of hits<br />

yeah when the paladin is in time gear and the warrior is wearing nothing time related which is what I was insinuating. I will admit I left out part of my thought which was put the warrior in only kunark gear and the paladin in time gear.<br />
<br />
You listen well. I already TOLD you that you were taking it to a different level of the game than what the parse is at. <br />

you're right I'm comparing a fully time farmed paladin to a warrior that's not, but it's the same thing you're doing with your war vs paladin to a lesser degree, both are absurd I'll totally agree = )<br />

Tell you what, since you can't take my word or logic that to come up with a statement like a warrior tanks 12% better then a paladin (which is a class statement not a gear statement)  I'll coem up with a post in a little while just  for you explaning how scientific statements are made and accurate polls and tests are preformed.  Since you can't take hearing &quot;the difference between that paladin and that warrior was 12% but it's not a warrior tanking advantage it was that war's tanking advantage over THAT paladin... to get a accurate statement like a warrior tansk 12% better then a paladin you'd have to get both in identica  gear otherwise the test is laid open to subjective interpretations such as yours. &quot;<br />

It WOULD be an ad homenim attack if you actually were directing any kind of real argument against mine, for me to have an argument to attack instead of the person. Instead, what you're doing is attacking the person. You know, &quot;you're talking out of your ass&quot; &quot;you misinterpreting the numbers&quot; &quot;your analysis is flawed&quot; are all examples of what you're doing to discredit the argument, while ignoring the actual arguments such as the differences in loot strategy between classes... a textbook ad homenim attack.<br />

I'll tell you what. You go parse yourself some comparably geared tanks and come back here with the parse, and then we'll talk. But util you come up with REAL, SOLID proof to back up what you're blowing out your arse, don't even bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One parse says nothing.  You're banking your entire argument over a parse and a Dev post that you have yet to actually back up with any type of proof.<br />
<br />
I can take a paladin and a warrior in a time guild, and that warrior could be monumentally better equipped than the paladin if:<br />
a. the paladin has a lot more DKP unspent than the warrior<br />
b. the paladin raids less than the warrior<br />
c. the paladin is a moron who got loot that doesnt help much<br />
d. the paladin has much less AA than the warrior<br />
e. the paladin spent his DKP on two rare drops while the warrior spent his on 5 more common ones<br />
<br />
One parse by one paladin and one warrior means nothing.  They were not equally equipped, and its very arguable that they were even similarly equipped.  You need to stop preaching back the rhetoric that you believe to be true because of some secret dev announcement and a single parse, and stop arguing over A POINTLESS FACT.  Because your 12% figure that you keep beating your chest over really is insignificant.  <br />
<br />
Warriors tank better than Paladins with defensive and without, and nobody seems to care about that 12% except for people who like getting a rise out of you, and you yourself.  You're a fucking warrior, and if you cared so much about Paladins, you should be playing a paladin.  A warrior who is preaching about how we need to give mad love to paladins has zero credibility, and is just a walking target.  I cant help but think you're doing this intentionally...</div></div><hr />

<br />
One parse says nothing. How funny is that. You know what, if THAT parse says nothing, then NO parse done by anyone says anything.<br />
<br />
Not just that, but these two back up not only each other, but a THIRD reference point, that of posts by people on OTHER boards who say about the same thing... as I've linked an example earlier in the thread.<br />
<br />
3 different sources of data... vs absolutely nothing solid by people who say differently. Just &quot;if-then's&quot;, possiblities, theory, possibilities, and rhetoric.<br />
<br />
Find some proof, find some HARD data (as I have) and we'll talk. Until then, spare me the rhetoric. You want to talk about not having credibility? There's no credibility there, when you have nothing to back up your claims. There's about as much substance to the claims as smoke.<br />
<br />
BTW, I've NEVER said we have to give &quot;mad love&quot; to Paladins, AND I've never been too huge on the 12.5% advantage. It exists, that's it. It's not OMG warriors are so good, it's not OMG it's such a huge advantage, or we're so great, or any of that crap. It's YES, the difference exists. You're mistaking my being passionate about the fact that YES, it does exist, as passion FOR the difference. <br />
<br />
12.5%, at the end of the day, isn't a huge, game breaking difference, in fact it can easily even escape notice in day to day play. What's funny is the people that even try to argue such a small existance down EVEN FURTHER. Like... 12.5% is a tiny ass difference as it is, how the hell do you think you're going to make some big point by arguing it down a few percent, how the hell do you think changing it a few percent is a big huge deal?</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to believe that, not going to argue that because it seems sensible with what I see in game.<br />

<br />
No one uses a monk over a knight to tank anywhere, why is that?  because they do not tank better!  The reason that monk tanks better (which is not merely the DPS taken over a fight but survivability and other things)  is because he has much better gear then EVERYONE in that parse.  <br />
<br />
So please tell me while you control your laughter, which tanks better a monk or a paladin?</div></div><hr />

Here's another flaw, you're saying a warrior and a padin have a 12% difference, if it is 12% what is that 12% of?<br />
<br />
if a paladin mitigates 200% of all damage (just showing numbers) and a warrior does better then a paladin by 12% a warrior mitigates 224% of all damage, that's a very large difference not a small one.<br />
<br />
if a paladin mitigates 39% and a warrior 12% he mitigates 44%, your dev statement would back that up but by saying it's 12% without a point of reference is meaningless and does nothing but take away from thoughtful debate.<br />
<br />
To say a warrior tanks 12% better then a paladin in Lesser gear is just as meaningless.  <br />
<br />
My lv 65 rogue mitigates more damage then my lv 65 paladin! (ignore the paladin is a mule wearing finesteel and is encumbered)  therefor my rogue tanks better then my paladin and I would be correct because I'm comparing MY rogue with MY paladin.  But if I then said because MY rogue mitigates better then MY paladin, rogues tank better then paladins by 12%.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they do all back each other up. All of them come up with close to the same numbers for an advantage over paladins. Course, you absolutely won't see that, it's a case if you can lead the horse to water, but you can't make him drink. <br />

No. They're not &quot;tanking better&quot;. They're taking close to the same damage, with the caveat that they're taking HUGE spike damage hits compared to the Paladin. Much more avoidance, much less mitigation.<br />
<br />
No one uses a monk over a knight to tank anywhere, why is that?  because they do not tank better!  The reason that monk tanks better (which is not merely the DPS taken over a fight but survivability and other things)  is because he has much better gear then EVERYONE in that parse.<br />
Actually, they do use monks to tank trivial content over a Pallly, because they tank well enough and do much better DPS. So it's not &quot;never&quot; as you claim, another thing you're blowing out of your ass. Not very often, sure. &quot;never&quot;? no.<br />
As for the monk having better gear... I can only be so sure without having a magelo, but going by EQrankings by AC, I'd have to agree that he's better. Not &quot;MUCH&quot; better like you claim, but reasonably better.<br />
<br />
So please tell me while you control your laughter, which tanks better a monk or a paladin?<br />
Paladin. Duh. Which is supported by the parse data with the much higher spike damage, so it's not me misreading parse data, it's YOU misreading parse data by trying to go by ONLY average damage taken per round as a comparison. Answering this against my better judgement, because sure as shootin', you're going to turn this into a strawman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
okay okay though we got to a real crux.  You're saying a paladin is better then the monk, why the dps is lower on the monk!  wait that's not a measure of tanking ability, yet that DPS difference is where you got your 12% difference in a warrior and a paladin.  Do you care to take it back since you basically said DPS is not a valid point to compare?<br />

no no we couldn't do that?</div></div><hr />

No, you dumb shit, as I JUST SAID, average damage isn't the only measure of tanking ability. I NEVER at any point said that DPS is not a valid point co compare, I did say that in this instance DPS isn't the ONLY thing needing to be compared, and that is because of the difference in damage per hit and damage per round. Not only THAT, but in this instance I agree with you in that the monk is better equipped. It's a good thing that I never claimed the monk was equally as well equipped, now, isn't it?<br />
<br />
That average damage per hit is not significantly different enough in the war vs pal argument to throw off the average damage comparison, where it IS in the pal vs monk.<br />
<br />
You're so desperate to try and prove me wrong, YOU are guilty of the very bias you accuse me of, drawing flawed conclusions from the data.</div></div><hr />

Now that you've said something I was hoping you would let's move on.<br />
<br />
&quot;DPS isn't the ONLY thing needing to be compared&quot;<br />
Now &quot;This parse is representative of the largest part of the population&quot;<br />
<br />
But the monk is better equiped enough then the paladin to make him overall tank better...<br />
<br />
So the larger part of the population of monks are better equiped then paladins....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet that's the number YOU used to come up with the 12% number.  (out of that parse anyhow)<br />
<br />
&quot;but in this instance I agree with you in that the monk is better equipped&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That average damage per hit is not significantly different enough in the war vs pal argument to throw off the average damage comparison, where it IS in the pal vs monk.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the average hit is a bit lower on the warrior because of a 15% shielding and higher AC.  OR is that something irrelevant?  Keep talking because the more statments you make the easier it is to discount the past 9 pages worth of bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What flawed conclusions?  oh right that it's not something you can compare as a class vs class because the tests don't support that, that the parse only proves those toons vs the other toons Gear played such a high advantage point that it's impossible to definitively say off that parse how much better one class is over another in tanking.<br />
<br />
Now if there were several different parses of the same quality of that one but different levels of gear, then you could do that but you can't.  Hell for all we know the monk could of tanked even better because the monk AC bonus was gimped with weight by the parser.</div></div><hr />

I mean LDoN Gear is  Plate / All ....<br />
Most ATK augments (useless for tanking) are replaceable with FT augments.<br />
Of course there is a problem with one focus (MP4 that is)<br />
But i'm really curious how &quot;efficient&quot; a full LDoN Paladin would be.<br />
<br />
FT2 Guk Type7 All Slots<br />
FT2 Mira Type2 Chest<br />
FT1 Mira Type7 All Slots<br />
FT2 Mira Type3 All Slots<br />
FT1 Mmc Type3 All Slots<br />
FT1 Guk Type3 All Slots<br />
<br />
Thats FT9 just from LDoN Gear <br />
<br />
Solstice + Dain Shawl 8 + LDoN Hard Earring = FT14 <br />
(The last FT should be easy to find)<br />
<br />
Grab Extended Blessing 4 Augment (LDoN Type7 for HoTime &amp; Buffs)<br />
Grab Spell Haste4 Augment (Barindu Sewers &quot;Lair&quot; Expedition)<br />
Grab a &quot;Ceramic Totem of the Rathe&quot;  (Tradeskill Bazaar)<br />
<br />
Still at LDoN Lvl a paladin can get FT14 SH4 IH4 <br />
With almost the same gear as a warrior.<br />
<br />
The AC difference will only be related to 3 items (Dain Shawl &amp; Solstice &amp; Range).<br />
The other gear will be 100% Identical.<br />
<br />
Now of course people will say &quot;there is no such Paladin&quot;... Well its possible <br />
And it doesnt require Time++ gear. Its just long, like the Maxed Time++ Paladin.<br />
<br />
<br />
So please tell me again ...<br />
What Tankability do Pal/SK have to sacrifice to develop their hybrid side ?<br />
<br />
A LDoN Paladin can have FT14 And All Focus exept MP4 (Doesnt Exist)<br />
A Time++ can have FT15 And All Focus (every single one of them)<br />
<br />
With exactly (or almost) exactly the same gear as a Warrior ....<br />
<br />
Knightemisation at its summom  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually no, we're the least efficient healers in the game. we may have the fastest heal, but it's about as useful as having a 1 sec cast greater heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When stun are actualy stuning, paladin just kill all other tanks. It's situational, but you can still stun most of the xp content<br />
<br />
this is a warrior myth, we do not &quot;kill&quot; all other tanks, thats complete BS, if it was true, than according to warrior logic, there would absoltuly be no reason what-so-ever to use a warrior in any grouping situtation where a paladin is able to stun...and you guys said yourself, you have no problems getting groups now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Claiming you can't use 1 sec casting time spell in combat is bullshit.<br />
<br />
i challenge you to borrow a friends lvl 65 paladin, or a guild paladin and tank anything in GoD and try to heal yourself reliably. on paper it look pretty damn sweet, in reality, it's not the be-all end-all of heals...ESPICALLY while tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brell stack just fine with cleric buff, and you don't need a cleric for any kind of xp group, even in GoD.<br />
<br />
you knew damn well what he was talking about, if 1 buff is all you can think of that doesn't get completely nullified when there is a cleric present, than you just proved his case.<br />
There are clerics that do use their heal over time ? I've not seen any for quite a while now. except MGB HoT. That was ok during early PoP but now...<br />
<br />
if you don't see clerics using thier HoT's anymore, what in the hell do you think OUR watered down, cast on one person at a time, spell slot wasting HoT is going to do?<br />
<br />
you don't see paladins telling warriors what its like to be warriors, how can you possibly believe you know more about our class than we do? seriously<br />
<br />
i can take anything, write it down and present it one way, back it up with facts till my eyes bleed, and in practice it will be completely different.<br />
<br />
on paper AE taunt looks likes its the best goddamn ability in the world, in practice it's alot different.<br />
<br />
on paper having the ability to use 4 hate procs plus incite seems pretty fucking godly, in practice its alot different.<br />

Well I've often done trash exp groups with a druid healer, you know my one reason for doing that?  I had a paladin to add symbol and res if necessary.  but you said when a cleric is present, I guess I never use brells then because it's only the best buff for maxing my hp in conjuction with others.  tell me what buffs do a ranger get to cast in a group with a paladin? oooo predator and maybe CoR<br />
<br />
ooo mages! they can only cast one for the group DS, <br />
ooo or sk's voice of terror<br />
having anything that's needed is a good thing, and the ability to cover when things are lacking is a awesome thing.<br />

&quot;try letting us paladins tell YOU how it is to be a paladin, you don't know it all.&quot;<br />

When a paladin says his heals are worthless and you have a paladin keep you up through Damage spikes while CH chain goes on every other raid is enough to let most warriors know it's not total bullshit.<br />

Seeing a paladin offtank a mob for a hour straight with only heals bieng his own is enough to say thier spells mean something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EmiliaEQ,<br />
I'm going to let you in on a secret. FT is not a huge deal when tanking a single hard mob for a Paladin especially at LDoN progression. Mana Preservation is much much more important. Yes, PoTime Knights can have it all pretty much. But remember, all doesn't mean Improved Damage IV, and not even Spell Haste since many spells are fast enough that there isn't a huge benefit or Improved Range since in and addtank group ya shouldn't need it.<br />
<br />
Admittedly in an easy LDoN adventure, FT IS awesome to have since it's pretty easy to get carried away and the fighting is continuous.<br />
<br />
The important thing is to compares apples with apples. As a Tank a Paladin really doesn't need to cast much more than stuns to keep aggro. They may slip into their other roles and spot heal or Root, but that's not necessarily being a Tank.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to Ariakkas and his foolishness - so how much healing does Light of Order do?? You said,<br />
it's about as useful as having a 1 sec cast greater heal.<br />
so, 1 sec Greater Heal (Pal/39) at 300HP's healed vs. Light of Order (Pal/65)  at 1000HP's healed. LoO is more than 3 times more healing in the same time span!! Wow!!!! In fact with AA's and Improved healing, it's not bad at all. Add a little Hopebringer action and first thing ya know, your Cleric is meleeing.<br />
<br />
And yes, Paladins outclass Warriors horribly in groups where they can stun the mobs. Ditto groups like easy LDoN where they can do a little CC with Root and use Root pulling to get past the fact that their Pacify runs out of gas before they are complete gods in tivial content.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Warriors get groups for two simple reasons. Many groups no longer care that Knights are superior. Warriors are good enough. In addition, if you are hunting hard named mobs, it's nice to have a tank that doesn't buckle and make the Ranger use WS to finish off the mob. Warriors, unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles, and sometimes that's exactly what a group needs.<br />

That reduces the AC difference to 2 items (Range, Ear) that aren't well known for having high-AC alternatives. Improved Healing at that stage of the game means very little, since there is less hp to heal, and CH still reigns supreme by far.<br />

i challenge you to borrow a friends lvl 65 paladin, or a guild paladin and tank anything in GoD and try to heal yourself reliably. on paper it look pretty damn sweet, in reality, it's not the be-all end-all of heals...ESPICALLY while tanking.<br />
<br />
Then maybe instead of fighting for other classes' abilities like defensive, Radiant Cure, or shaman heals, you should ask for something more realistic? Something like abolishing the fact that channeling scales based on the cast time of the spell? I mean, what's the use of trying to get increased HPS/efficiency on your heal spells if according to so many Paladins, you can't cast them at all while tanking?<br />
<br />
If you don't know what I'm talking about, Ariakkas, I challenge you to borrow a friend's level 65 cleric, or a guild cleric and tank anything in LDoN and try to heal yourself reliably... with CH. On paper it looks pretty damn stupid, but in reality, it keeps me reasonably safe every single time I tank LDoN-hard, and I'm not exactly high-end geared.<br />
<br />
Dry your eyes, Paladins; you'll be able to use your overpowered stuns all you like in Kod'Taz and below once OoW rolls out (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5292&amp;source=Live), despite the fact that before the GoD retune, 3 paladins could keep any mountain trials trash mob from ever hitting anyone at all, while a pooka hamburgerizes it in 15 seconds. Who needs priests anyway?<br />
<br />
Maybe it's the fact that I usually read this board at around 2am, but this whole debate between Daemon and Pumilio, this 12.5% based on one parse that had gear differences somewhat beyond &quot;realistic choice&quot;, and &quot;leet_beta_infoz_01&quot; that Daemon seems to hide like it's crack cocaine, isn't going to change my (or anyone's) mind on Warrior-versus-Paladin tanking. This back-and-forth thing just keeps going on and on (and on, and on) so much so that if you replaced the words &quot;gear choices&quot; with &quot;causality&quot; I'd think I'm watching Matrix Reloaded. Can we like, get Arbosch here to summarize that whole debate or something? KOMPRESSOR boggles my mind less than these last few pages.<br />

I agree, and this from a man who argued here on TSW against Knight nerfs while arguing with Paladins at PoN for Warrior aggro and then against Knight defensive.

No, I haven 't said that. There you go putting words in my mouth AGAIN... Bravo. It's NOT &quot;PoP equipment&quot;, it's only a VERY small subset of TIME equipment.

Make you a Knight and no one would notice. Heck people keep making that mistake, don't they?<br />
<br />
Ya's posted the same Remove Defensive drivel on SoE's class balance board and was mistaken for a Knight over there.<br />
<br />
You flatly stated no Paladin had asked for tank parity (and spellbook superiority). I don't know why, since now you admit you don't even read the highest trafficed Paladin site and wouldn't know the accuracy of what you posted.<br />
<br />
Here's what you posted:<br />
I have to take issue with Battleblade's claims that Paladins want &quot;tanking parity&quot; (and spellbook superiority). That's flatly not true. NO Paladin has asked for a full defensive disc, and have not asked for ANY evasive disc, in any suggestion I've seen.<br />
<br />
ANY Paladin that has asked for defensive has asked for a PARTIAL defensive ability, of about 25-30% mitigation, and no evasive disc. Add to that the warrior's 12.5% innate better tanking ability, and that in NO WAY would acheive even close to parity between the warriors and hybrids. Course, those suggestions are moot anyway, because defensive (according to the devs, who have a track history of changing their minds, &lt;cough&gt;lvl70&lt;cough&gt;) won't be whored out to other classes like so many other warrior abilities have been.<br />
<br />
BB's claims that hybrids want tanking parity and spellbook superiority is just propaganda/rhetoric, with no basis in fact.<br />
My claims that some hybrids want tanking parity and spellbook superiority is based on post made by Kaev, Gilfalas, McBash, Soledragondead, and Kelther,  the Remove Defensive thread, the PoN Class Balance board and some posts on SoE Paladin Class Balance forum.<br />
<br />
Try reading what Paladins post before claiming you know what they have or have not posted.<br />
<br />
I said:<br />
stating that of cource it's not PoP end expansion equipment <br />
To which you replied as if I maligned you:<br />
....TIME equipment....<br />
Where if you don't mind does PoP end expansion equipment come from?<br />
<br />
Just for your information, comparing differently equipped tanks doesn't mean jack. When comparing &quot;average equipped&quot; players a 10% (btw &quot;12.5%&quot; implies precision in such a comparason that can not exist) difference doesn't mean much either. Anyone with a brain would know that the critera used to establish what average equipment meant is important to understanding the final numbers. How pray tell was &quot;average equipment&quot; determined? Which please please average was used? Mean, median, or mode. How if you don't mind were naked retired, twinks, etc. discarded from determining this &quot;average&quot;. You don't know and I see no evidence that this was a rigid study and means anything at all. One can drown in a lake with an average depth of 1 inch.<br />
<br />
12.5% innate better tanking ability<br />
Okay, let's strip a Knight and a Warrior and see this &quot;innate&quot; precisely 12.5% better tanking ability at level 1. Or does 12.5 suggest unsuportable precision? Or does &quot;innate&quot; not mean innate. Or does the data you cited not support this conclusion in a meaningful way?<br />
<br />
You make claims for the data that can not be supported by the data and the method used to obtain it. Everyone posting on this thread knows it.<br />
<br />
I needn't LIE sir. With your authoritive sounding claim that NO (that would be 0 sir) Paladin has asked for Tank Parity (and spellbook superiority), subsequent admission that you don't even read PoN so you wouldn't even know, and exagerating the meaningfulness of data (I have three sources and they all agree - 12.5%), you are handling that task in this thread superbly.<br />

Which to begin with is not a biased statement, it's a fact.  Second this parse is not a AVERAGE (also since there is no conclusive standard on average to find a innate tanking difference you'd have to get all toons in identicle gear or naked)<br />
<br />
 it's only a VERY small subset of TIME equipment. You know, 1 in 100 players who every have played in PoP. <br />

Just to help you out with making Valid observations about anything in life here are the four steps to the scientific process<br />
<br />
I. The scientific method has four steps<br />
1. Observation and description of a phenomenon or group of phenomena. <br />
<br />
2. Formulation of an hypothesis to explain the phenomena. In physics, the hypothesis often takes the form of a causal mechanism or a mathematical relation. <br />
<br />
3. Use of the hypothesis to predict the existence of other phenomena, or to predict quantitatively the results of new observations. <br />
<br />
4. Performance of experimental tests of the predictions by several independent experimenters and properly performed experiments.<br />

<br />
When will you get it through your thick skulls that that parse is only confirming what I've heard from many people, including parses on THIS BOARD, about what the warrior tanking advantage is?<br />
<br />
I've been hearing about the warrior tanking advantage since I was a wee little level 45 or so, reading this board and others to learn about my class. These posts by OTHER PEOPLE even on other boards (which I've posted  one just as a representation of what I've seen). Is it a balance issue? Fuck no.<br />
<br />
Take what even I've heard from old debates even way back when here and on the old boards, take the parse, take the dev post, take posts by other people on other boards, and you know what, they're ALL agreeing. There is a definite and minor tanking advantage that a warrrior has over a paladin. Quit fucking picking apart the little shit, and look at the big picture for once. There is a minor advantage, somewhere between 10-15%. It DOES exist. <br />
<br />
Believe this advantage exists. Or not. I no longer care. I, for one, know it exists, and have known it existed for years. The preponderance of evidence all agrees on the fact that it's there, and there has been NOT ONE single piece fucking  of evidence presented by ANY of you nay-sayers that would tend to show that it doesn't exist.  It shows that all you're doing is talking right out of your ass.<br />

<br />
Even IF there were such an advantage it means absolutely nothing. Warriors, Paladins, and SK's are different classes with different raid roles. Warriors are supposed to be unmatched in the most brutal battles, and Knights don't generally MT. In experiance groups, none of us have an exceptional advantage despite their obvious superiority (the Phase 2 Melee Update was supposed to improve Warrior groupability a tad for balance purposes and it never happend).<br />

1550 hp heal with a 3.75 cast time (which CAN be reduced with focus and spell haste buffs) with a 2.25 recast<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
1000 hp heal with a 1 cast time (which CAN NOT be reduced with focus and spell haste buffs) with a 5 second cast time. A paladin that has LoO almost assuredly will have light of nife, so he can load up both spells to work around the recast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
1000/1+5 = 166.7~ --- Just LoO<br />
[(1000+850)/2]/1+2.25=284.6~ --- LoO chained with LoN<br />
<br />
<br />
1550/3.75+2.25=258.3~ --- Daluda chained with no spell haste foci/buff<br />
<br />
1550/2.44(spell haste)+2.25=330.5~ Daluda chained with spell haste buff and foci.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as healing efficiency goes:<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
LoO --- 1000 hp/430 mana --- 2.326 hp/mana<br />
LoN --- 850 hp/400 mana --- 2.125 hp/mana<br />
ToN --- 1125 hp/450 mana --- 2.5 hp/mana<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
DM --- 1550 hp/490 mana --- 3.163 hp/mana<br />
Specced Alter OR SCM: 1550 hp/441 mana ---  3.515 hp/mana (being conservative and using 10% mana savings instead of 12%)<br />
Specced Alter and SCM: 1550 hp/392 --- 3.954 hp/mana (being conservative and using 20% mana savings instead of 24%)<br />
Now consider Canni....<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
SI --- 2100 hp/550 mana --- 3.819 hp/mana<br />
SI Specced Alter OR SCM: 2100 hp/495 mana --- 4.242 hp/mana<br />
SI specced Alter and SCM: 2100 hp/440 mana --- 4.773 hp/mana<br />
<br />
It is easier to compare paladins to druids since neither class gets canni. A paladin would require almost twice (190%) the mana regen to sustain the same level of healing as a druid given the same gear and AAs (note the paladin can not get SCM). FT15 compared to FT0 isn't going to make that big of a difference. Maybe, just *maybe*, FT15, mana prez focus, and IH focus will allow the paladin to heal almost as well as a druid with NO SCM, NO healing focus, NO mana prez focus, and NO FT...assuming that both classes were operating without any but their own mana regen buffs. When you start adding in mana regen from external sources, each point of mana regen the druid gets counts almost twice as much as it does for the paladin.<br />
Druid:<br />
18 mana/tick for med<br />
8 mana/tick for 9<br />
4 mana/tick MoF<br />
30 total<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
17 mana/tick for med<br />
3 mana/tick for AoTC<br />
15 mana/tick for FT<br />
35 total<br />
<br />
Assuming 20% (18.5%, but we'll round up a bit) improved effeciency on average for both IH4(average 12% increase) and MP4(average 5.5% savings) we can multiply 35 mana/tick by 1.2 and get 42 mana/tick efficiency. <br />
<br />
42/30 is not 1.9, not even close. So give a paladin that large of an advantage in gear and the druid would still have a 35% advantage in efficiency.<br />
<br />
Now, add in external mana regen sources, and it gets pretty obvious that it doesn't matter WHAT amount of gear advantage the paladin has.<br />
Druid:<br />
18 mana/tick for med<br />
18 mana/tick for C5<br />
9 mana/tick for SD<br />
8 mana/tick for 9<br />
53 total<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
17 mana/tick for med<br />
18 mana/tick for C5<br />
9 mana/tick for SD<br />
3 mana/tick for AoTC<br />
15 mana/tick for FT15<br />
62 total<br />
<br />
Add in the 20% efficiency bonus for foci: the paladin gets an adjusted 74.4 mana/tick compared to the druid's 53. The paladin has 71% of the efficiency of the druid, with all of those gear advantages. BTW, those foci listed are much harder for a hybrid to get than for a priest....<br />
<br />
That's only efficiency at that. The druid would still be able to put out almost twice the HPS as the paladin.<br />
<br />
Is there a problem with that? I don't particularly think so. I think the game needs more competent tanking classes than it needs more competent healing classes. I don't personally think that a hybrid can really expect to be strong in multiple areas. But I also don't think exaggerating a class's abilities helps anyone. The idea that paladins could replace druids or shamans as healers in anything but severe fringe case scenarios is laughable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When will you get it through your thick skulls that that parse is only confirming what I've heard from many people, including parses on THIS BOARD, about what the warrior tanking advantage is?<br />
<br />
I've been hearing about the warrior tanking advantage since I was a wee little level 45 or so, reading this board and others to learn about my class. These posts by OTHER PEOPLE even on other boards (which I've posted  one just as a representation of what I've seen). Is it a balance issue? Fuck no.<br />
<br />
Take what even I've heard from old debates even way back when here and on the old boards, take the parse, take the dev post, take posts by other people on other boards, and you know what, they're ALL agreeing. There is a definite and minor tanking advantage that a warrrior has over a paladin. Quit fucking picking apart the little shit, and look at the big picture for once. There is a minor advantage, somewhere between 10-15%. It DOES exist. <br />
<br />
Believe this advantage exists. Or not. I no longer care. I, for one, know it exists, and have known it existed for years. The preponderance of evidence all agrees on the fact that it's there, and there has been NOT ONE single piece fucking  of evidence presented by ANY of you nay-sayers that would tend to show that it doesn't exist.  It shows that all you're doing is talking right out of your ass.<br />
<br />
If you wanna think paladins tank just like warriors, all the power to you. I no longer care.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone here will disagree with what you said about warriors having a tanking advantage, but as to it bieng 12% fuck no. :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
When will you get it through your thick skulls that that parse is only confirming what I've heard from many people, including parses on THIS BOARD, about what the warrior tanking advantage is? <br />
<br />
yeah okay, so who else have stated warriors have a 12% tanking advantage?  right, please present links and qoutes other then yourself this time ( I don't care if it's archieved.)<br />
<br />
Parses here do not support a tanking 12% difference, they merely support tanking differences, but no concrete number like 12% which you keep harping over.  <br />
<br />
According to your &quot;dev statement&quot; that backs you, warriors mitigate damage 5% better then paladins...  and that's the goal roughly?<br />
<br />
Now if they said that warriors should tank 12% better then knights you might would have a point, but if the dev said knights mitigate 50% of damage and warriors 55% the ideal of having a warriors 5% better mitigation then a knight (seems thier ideal amount) without any special factors would still be in line, but the % a war tanks better by is not 12% then.<br />
<br />
You found two unrelated numbers that happened to match up and use those as the basis of your argument.  You took and compared DPS taken with Mitigation (what the devs were talking about) and then said they back each other up.<br />
<br />
Then when asked if a monk was a better tank then a paladin because dps taken was less (your whole basis of arguing a war tanks 12% better) you said no because DPS is not the only thing that matters.  So there in your contradicted yourself.  You &quot;no longer care&quot; because you can't win the argument after painting yourself into a corner, so best to leave now before you get paint on yourself that won't come off.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both sustained HP/time and flash heal (HP's healed in one second) would be interesting to know.<br />
<br />
While I doubt anyone would seriously suggest replacing a Shaman or Druid in a Ramapge Tank healing rotation or healing an add tank, I believe a Paladin's healing power IS more than pretty decent and does have raid impact.<br />
<br />
I do aggree that a class can't expect to be an effective healer, buffer, tank, and produce decent DD DPS and melee DPS. Like Duids, Paladins are only capable of doing 3 out of 5 reasonably well and none of them to Cleric (healer/buffer), Warrior (tank), Wizard (DD DPS), Rogue (melee DPS) standard. Maybe (laugh) Druid melee DPS is overpowered compared to Paladin nukes.<br />

Prove it. Oh wait, you can't even bring a single shred of proof to the table... You're talking out of your ass. Where's your parses? Right, you don't have any.<br />

Already have in this thread, in a post directed, I believe, specifically at you. Again, you show you're not listening to anything I'm saying.<br />
<br />
Parses here do not support a tanking 12% difference, they merely support tanking differences, but no concrete number like 12% which you keep harping over.<br />
Yes. They do. If you choose not to believe that, well, that speaks volumes... but whatever.<br />
<br />
You found two unrelated numbers that happened to match up and use those as the basis of your argument.  You took and compared DPS taken with Mitigation (what the devs were talking about) and then said they back each other up.<br />
Better than you, who has NOTHING to back up what he says. Because you bring up NOTHING solid to back yourself up, you have zero credibility.<br />
<br />
Then when asked if a monk was a better tank then a paladin because dps taken was less (your whole basis of arguing a war tanks 12% better) you said no because DPS is not the only thing that matters.  So there in your contradicted yourself.  You &quot;no longer care&quot; because you can't win the argument after painting yourself into a corner, so best to leave now before you get paint on yourself that won't come off.  :cool:<br />
Again showing your ignorance, because I ALREADY explained the difference, why it applies in monk vs hybrid, and not in war vs hybrid. You completely ignored that, again showing that you don't care what I say, you're just continunig in your crusade of showing me to be talking out of my ass, which you made very clear your goal was in your first post.<br />
You're right I no longer care because I can no longer win the argument... because I could show you solid gold plated proof and you would claim that that doesn't prove a god damned thing, and find still other ways to try to call it into question. You don't care WHAT I show  for proof. I can't win an argument with someone like you who just won't listen, as you've shown over and over again in the thread, that all you care about is showing how I'm talking out of my ass.<br />
<br />
The fact that you steadfastly refuse to being up ANY solid evidence to prove what you're saying (while, incidentally, jumping on me and screaming that I'm talking out of MY ass before I had shown proof, how much of a double standard is that) speaks for itself. . that your claims have zero basis in fact. Why? because you can't even bring a SINGLE shred of evidence to the table that would prove your claims.<br />
<br />
No, when you actually find some proof to lend your claims any kind of credibility, then we'll talk. Until then, take your talking out of your ass and shove it back where it belongs, because with no evidence to back your bullshit claims up, you've got about as much credibility as the doomsayer walking down the street claiming that the world is going to end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daemon, the reason I don't need to bring proof of anything is I haven't been trying to prove anything requiring proof.  The things I have (why your analysis is flawed) I provided links to show you how your diagnosis of the situation is flawed and cannot be stated as a absolute.  I'd link you qoutes to all the people agreeing that you're wrong in stating what you have because the difference in tanking is a combination of superior gear AND class but I don't need to they are in this thread already where as the people supporting your opinion are niether in this thread nor qouted/linked.<br />
<br />
You refuse to recant on your prior stance that warriors maintain a 12% tanking edge over knights when there IS nothing to support that.  If you believe we are wrong in this break down the numbers, explain WHY a war has a 12% edge in tanking but a monk does not have a 3% edge.<br />
<br />
I want to make this as simple as possible for you, so let me break it down what you have done.<br />
<br />
Random letter by dev saying knights mitigate 39% and wars 44% divide two numbers and you got 12%<br />
<br />
Now you went and said that statment backs up your argument that a war has a 12% advantage over knights because war dps taken and paladin dps taken are 12% difference (this is true you cannot deny this unless you edit your prior posts)<br />
<br />
Then when asked which is better tank, the monk or knights (monk having a 3% less dps taken then the knights) you say the knights.  <br />
<br />
How could you say the knights when the measurment for tanking better earlier (dps taken) was used to determine what was better?<br />
<br />
Now on to the next point<br />
<br />
You say the monk is a poorer tank because of the average damage taken per hit.  I totally agree.<br />
<br />
And if we compare the average hits of the war and paladin we do see your fabled 12%.<br />
<br />
But! here's the MAGICAL part.  when we take the warriors average hit of 223.3 and ADD to it the amount his shielding took off (14damage per hit so we can add that straight to damage per hit average since DB is a constant)  That fabled 12% advantage you claimed shrinks now to just a 8%ish advantage.  want to then see about the AC impact?<br />
<br />
The SK with about 100 less ac then the knight took about 13more per average hit then the paladin, we could say that if the paladin had a 200ac more he'd have a slightly lower average per hit because of a higher ac, we'll say the result is only half though because of diminishing returns.  so 13damage per hit less,  <br />
<br />
So now, warrior average per hit is at 237.3 and the paladin is now at 242.1<br />
<br />
Now the mitigation difference is 5%.  Guess what, your DEV STATMENT does back that up.<br />
<br />
Want to know the tanking edge the warrior has in this scenario (it's impossible to say I'm acurate that 200more ac would of taken 13 dps off per hit, but it's not a stretch to imagine)  about 2% advantage in mitigation.<br />
<br />
Now since I'm just EXTRAPOLATING data, it's not a given without testing, but I trust in equal gear (read same ac, same shielding, same avoidance) you would find a 5% mitigation difference.<br />
<br />
This is a logical step based off of your data, which I haven't refuted but I factored in the AC and the mods into it all.  You never did.<br />
<br />
Please say something about this bieng wrong....</div></div><hr />

Oh wait, you can't even bring a single shred of proof to the table... You're talking out of your ass. Where's your parses? Right, you don't have any.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where are yours? I think it has been sufficiently shown that your apples to oranges parse, that you so adamantly proclaim as proof, doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Your peer review has come back negative yet you still refuse to accept it and find other means of backing up your claims. No, some secret &quot;dev&quot; document doesn't count. It is not public therefor not available for peer review.<br />
<br />
If you really want to make your case, find some evidence to back up your claims. In case you missed it, what we want to see for a parse to be an adequate and irrefutable data point is:<br />
<br />
A very large sample - atleast a few hours against the same exact mob, i.e. no incoming damage variance due to varying mob level, atk, DI, DB, etc. If that's not possible, you will need an even larger sample to insure an accurate spread of damage values over time.<br />
<br />
The same gear - The comparison needs to be done with the same stats, values, shielding, etc in order to minimize unknow factors that may not be fully understood at this moment.<br />
<br />
The same level/AA/skills - They should all have the same appliacble AAs and max skills /w mods. Again, we want to minimize the amount of adjustment that needs to be done to factor in skills/AA who's effects may not be well known.<br />
<br />
Only after each of the criteria are met can we say with any amount of certainty the exact % that X tanks better than Y. Anything else is just speculation. The reason why you are having such a hard time conviencing people is that no one else seems to have noticed the difference in tanking ability that you say is so obvious. Hence, the scepticism, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Until then, please spare us all the drama and find something else to argue about.</div></div><hr />

In my next raid, please please group me with a Paladin. Hopebringer (what an appropriate name), group heal after DArb, LoO for 1500 or so HP's in 1 second, LoH, and GRC makes Paladins third to perhaps only Clerics and Druids as the class most likely to keep me alive.

<br />
I finally discovered why Daemonwynd and some Knights may cling to the 12.5% innate Warrior tanking advantage myth as if it were true! (It's our SeKReT mitigation table dat does it shhhh).<br />
<br />
As Gyrfalcon Softwind posted on PoN but substituting more realistic numbers:<br />
<br />
Defensive 40% damage reduction over 3 minutes - Total 120%<br />
&quot;-1 DI&quot; 3% reduction over 7 minutes - Total 21%<br />
<br />
Grand Total 141% reduction over 10 minutes or 14.1% average reduction.<br />
<br />
Unless people buy onto the idea that a Warrior has an innate 12.5% tanking advantage a Knight with the same stats and equipment, then it's perfectly clear -<br />
<br />
*** Knights tank 85.9% as good as a Warrior taking Defensive into account and have a Spellbook!! ***<br />
<br />
This excludes DD, innate procs, etc. which we don't reduce and the affect of self-healing.<br />
<br />
But let's round it down and call it 85%. Now they buff more max HP's than a Cleric, buff AC pretty good too, 90% Res, Flash Heal (maximum HP's healed in 1 second), Group Heal, and spot heal perhaps better than a Shaman during actual combat. Waaaaaay more than a 40% Cleric. Wattya think? 60% is charitable? Call it 60%.<br />
<br />
85% Warrior and 60% Clerics.<br />
<br />
Newsflash!!<br />
Thanks to Igneous for doing the necessary parse (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=7414). While another parse may show different results, much of the damage taken difference can be accounted for by the &quot;-1 DI&quot; Warrior mitigation advantage and is no where near 12.5%.<br />

It wasnt the same at all.  He provided numerical dissection of your argument and disproved it.<br />
<br />
Your lack of response further enforces his correctness, and your incorrectness.<br />
<br />
This same thing happened on your thread to &quot;remove defensive from the game&quot;.  Someone finally schooled you to the point that you couldnt say anything, and you ignored it (and eventually disappeared)</div></div><hr />

With no evidence to back them up there's zero credibility, especially when in opposition to numbers created from evidence provided by the opposite side.<br />
<br />
As my my &quot;disappeareing from the thread&quot;... notice how I was the last person that POSTED on that thread... so everyone ESLE disappeared from the thread... yet, there's no mention of that in your post, hmmm, I wonder why.<br />
<br />
You're showing your bias in the worst way.<br />
<br />
as for &quot;couldn't say anything&quot;, that just about as correct as your &quot;you disappared from the thread&quot; claim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you even READ Pumillo's thread?  The part where he breaks down the tanking percentage and makes it 5%, using YOUR parse?  If, by using his parse, he has ZERO credibility, what does that say about yours?  Hmmm......<br />
<br />
You said &quot;lets let this thread die&quot;, while never responding to Igneous's post.  After I read it, I was thinking /applaud, because he put it in such a way that I could see no real argument to your post.  This is after I had said &quot;you didnt respond to me&quot; and you said &quot;oh, yes I did...if that's not good enough for you, nothing I can do&quot; and I said &quot;you responded to THIS?&quot; and you said &quot;ooh, no, not THAT...I can't read *EVERY* post that comes through here you know&quot;.<br />
<br />
You are picking and choosing what you want to respond to, and you happen to IGNORE the strongest points.  My bias towards you is quite founded -- I've been observing your debate tactics for the past two weeks, and its ALWAYS the same.  You pick out the weakest argument against you, and defend that, while throwing ad hominem attacks at the strongest arguments.  Here's a little hint for you: Pot, meet kettle.  You can't say &quot;i'm ignoring this post, because it has ad hominem attacks&quot; five seconds after issuing 6 ad hominem attacks in your post.  I'm not even sure you know exactly what that phrase MEANS, because you are clearly not seeing your own use of it.<br />
<br />
Guess what?  This is the fucking outhouse, and ad hominem attacks are PART of the debate.  You say stupid things, and people are going to call you stupid, and then tell you why.  You can't discredit their entire argument because &quot;they called me a poopyhead in the beginning!!!!!111!11!1oneone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your parse does not support your claim.  The &quot;REAL GEAR CHOICES&quot; that hybrid made was not suited directly to being the best tank he could be, and the choices the warrior made was.  The warrior was NOT &quot;equal&quot; to the paladin.<br />
<br />
I dont have to &quot;prove&quot; this to you.  Learn a little bit about how scholarship works.  The person making the claim needs to support his evidence.  People who refute said claim do not need to &quot;prove&quot; him wrong, the burden of proof is on YOU.  Your evidence did NOT support your claim that warriors have a 12.5% innate advantage over paladins.  Your evidence did not support your claim that on AVERAGE warriors tank 12.5% better than paladins.<br />
<br />
See, here, for the FIRST to be correct, you need to have &quot;all else remains constant&quot;.  Same stats exactly.<br />
<br />
For the SECOND to be correct, well, you need an AVERAGE.  Yes, that's right, to claim something is an average, you need to actually COMPUTE AN AVERAGE.  Show that some may be more, some may be less, but overall, it comes out to roughly 12.5%.<br />
<br />
That's why I am saying one parse shows nothing.  You did not have &quot;all else remains constant&quot; like we do when we parse proc rates.  You did not compute an average.  Going off that parse is like me going off a book I read once while trying to convince a jury that the defendant is guilty -- ITS INSUBSTANTIAL BY ITSELF.<br />
<br />
Please, grow up.  Try to meet the maturity level you expect others to meet.  And learn to take a hint -- when 40 people are standing over you telling you you're wrong, and refuting every possible claim you make, I think that should tell you something...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another important informal fallacay is:<br />
<br />
Fallacy of Composition - Arguing that a whole must have a certain property because the parts have it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have provided one link to One post with a parse of melee classes.<br />
<br />
Then you generalize and state that Warriors have better innate tanking by 12%.<br />
<br />
The fact that the warrior had shield mods does matter.  That's not Innate.<br />
<br />
Innate:<br />
<br />
Possessed at birth; inborn. <br />
Possessed as an essential characteristic; inherent. <br />
Of or produced by the mind rather than learned through experience: an innate knowledge of right and wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you put armor and gear that modifies those 'essential characteristics' then you no longer can talk about innate.  That is tanking ability modified by gear, it's nothing to do with innate ability.<br />
<br />
You mentioned all these other threads with parses proving your 12%ish number, link them.<br />
<br />
Your ONE provided parse of ONE warrior and ONE pally isn't sufficient to make a statement about the ENTIRE warrior class compared to that of Pallies.  Especially when you're comparing gear differences instead of class differences within that parse.  Take out the AC difference, take out the shield differences, take out AA differences (which I didn't see listed).  Then show us 12%.<br />
<br />
Until you can do that, you've only shown 12% between those two toons in that parse.<br />

<br />
To state this, you would have to show a Warrior class 12.5% tanking advantage. The individual parse shows an advantage a specific Warrior has when measured against an unequally equipped specific Paladin.<br />
<br />
That's like comparing me to Nomilus and declaring there is a 100AC Paladin advantage.<br />
<br />
But, it doesn't matter much. Everyone else reading this knows full well that you either just don't understand or for some unknown reason choose not to.<br />

<br />
So try saying this &quot;The warrior in this parse had a 12.5% tanking advantage over the paladin in this parse.  While not a exact formulae for finding the differences between the classes this does show us a few things about the innate advantage a warriors has when you figure out the ac differences and higher skills.

<br />
To state this, you would have to show a Warrior class 12.5% tanking advantage. The individual parse shows an advantage a specific Warrior has when measured against an unequally equipped specific Paladin.<br />
<br />
Yes, they ARE equally equipped, as in they have the same level of gear for the progression they're at. They're not &quot;equally equipped&quot; as in wearing the same gear, they're &quot;equally equipped&quot; as in having the same LEVEL of gear. They're equipped with different priorities in mind. How many times do I have to repeat this to get it through your thick skull?<br />
<br />
You might as well say Monks and beastlords are unequally equipped (or a beastlord and a shaman!), even though beastlords have the same kind of different priorities in gear selection.<br />
<br />
Hell, let's take it to extremes. Just because a wizard at the same progression point in the game has half the hitpoints and AC doesn't mean their gear is unequal to a warriors'. Their gear IS just as good, they just have different priorities.<br />
<br />
You've got it stuck in your head that the only way a hybrid is as well geared as a warrior is if they specialize in tanking to get the same melee stats as warriors, to the partial or complete exclusion of their casting side and role. That's simply FALSE. The gear is not inferior, it is just (in most cases) DIFFERENT.<br />
<br />
Supporting their caster side does not necessarily mean they're lesser equipped, it just means that they're equipping to min/max their casting side as well as their tanking side. Min/Max for MOST of the Paladin community does not include ignoring half of their abilities just for the sake of maximizing the other half. THEREFORE, they are just as well equipped, only DIFFERENTLY.<br />
<br />
you either just don't understand or for some unknown reason choose not to.<br />
Pot. Kettle. Black.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that that's incorrect.<br />
<br />
There's not only the -1DI, there's also the innate avoidance difference, AND there's nearly always the AC and tanking mod differences, due to the fact that the paladin has different priorities in gear selection via mana pres, spell haste, improved healing, flowing thought, yadda yadda yadda. This does NOT mean their gear is inferior, it just reflects different priorities in gear selection. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I was not speaking about just this parse, I brought a few other sources of data into the picture so as to show that this difference isn't there just for THIS parse, it's jsut about everywhere.</div></div><hr />

how about this, compare pre time parses if you want a statement to reflect the differences in the classes.  wait then it'd be really close, too close to say 12%.<br />

<br />
It's not a &quot;dumbass&quot; assertion at all, it's choices that are reflected every day in game by real paladins.<br />
<br />
Unless you're calling all paladins dumbasses, like they don't know what's good for them, but you somehow do?  <br />
<br />
If you read PoN you'll find they consider thier spell book worthless so why bother increasing it's capabilities when the tanking is your concern?<br />
<br />
Again, reading PoN and expecting to find a realistic view of how Paladins view things is a dumbass expectation, due to its administration and banning everyone that doesn't kow-tow to the &quot;party line&quot;, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Reading EQLive's hybrid boards gets a much clearer and unbiased view, that's why I read those boards and not PoN.<br />
<br />
how about this, compare pre time parses if you want a statement to reflect the differences in the classes.  wait then it'd be really close, too close to say 12%.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it might be about 10%. Close enough.</div></div><hr />

Second the Mitigation difference will be 5%. <br />

So using a post that got hijacked off the private develpers fourms when we dont know the basis behind the post, You assume that it is how real world game mechanic's are?<br />
<br />
How ignorent are you? How insanely incompatent are you making the entire class look because you are taking something that may not even be in affect and using it to justify an arguement?<br />
<br />
Put the crackpipe down and step away from the boards Daemon.  I'll give you a few reasons now too.<br />
<br />
#1 The truth behind said fourm report that you use as the holy bible.  No one except for the person that leaked that knows its validity, We dont know if its on a alpha build, or the dev's world. You do know they have there own version of the game where they tweak shit before it goes to test right?<br />
<br />
#2 Even if it somehow was an accurate reflection do you know whether or not it was based upon what level arrangement? Do you know if it was built on a 65 warrior? A 65 warrior with 700aa? Maybe a 20th level warrior?  No why because that document didnt give any hard fact's it just had  warrior / paladin / sk / pets.<br />
<br />
#3 That it was based on ther develpers fourm, it may just be a idea they were batting around to fix mitigation and bring classes in balance. Now however since you keep spouting off that you have access to &quot;leet develpers information&quot; you may have hurt TSW more then helped because of your stubborn refusal to drop the entire damn I have I_337 Dev Infoz omg. <br />
<br />
#4 Your arguments are sad pathetic attempts of being an attention whore gone wrong, I dont care if you were beaten as a child or what. im sick of your entire lame ass excuses as arguements. Use something substantial like I dunno your own 15 hour parses for you and a pal / sk of equal levels. and btw thats 15 hour parses for each class. Then come back with your findings. <br />
<br />
Kadah<br />
OMGZ I HAVE L337 DEV INFOZ !!!2~~!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kadah, for those very reasons, it's nowhere near solid enough to present on its own. Nor did I do so. It's just not reliable enough.<br />
<br />
I only mentioned it as secondary evidence; notice the focus that was paid to th parse, instead.<br />
<br />
As for where the post came from, it came to light on the Mage boards shortly before the pet changes went in. I would have thought that people would have taken a minute to think, that post had more to do with pet rebalancing, pet rebalancing happened jus a bit ago, so this post was just a bit ago... Pet changes have since gone live.<br />
<br />
The fact that it comes up with the same comparative numbers as the parses and posts found on other boards is a measure of validation for everything involved.<br />
<br />
So don't be attacking it like it's supposed to prove something all on its own. It wasn't presented that way.<br />
<br />
The rest of that crap isn't pertinent, so I'm ignoring it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Straythe</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only mentioned it as secondary evidence; notice the focus that was paid to th parse, instead.<br />
<br />
Where is your primary 'evidence' then?  I only saw a link to one set of data.<br />
<br />
Again, we can remove the word innate if you'd like.  But you still claim a 12.5% tanking advantage to warriors.  That's as a class, that should also apply to warriors without the gear shown in the linked parse yes?<br />
<br />
If that's the case, then it WOULD be an innate advantage whether or not you choose to use the term innate.<br />
<br />
If it only applies to the gear listed in the parse, then it's only a 12.5% difference between warriors with THAT set of gear and with Pallies with THAT set of gear.  You can't make a class observation on a set of data from an individual.  Fallacy of Composition, it's a fallacy in logic, does not hold up.  You've failed your attempt at logic given the data you've supplied.<br />
<br />
You've only supplied a link to ONE set of data, and you've argued very heavily on that data.<br />
<br />
The fact that it comes up with the same comparative numbers as the parses and posts found on other boards is a measure of validation for everything involved.<br />
<br />
By all means, link the other posts/parses you keep mentioning that you see everywhere.  One set of data obviously and logically isn't enough to make a class comparrison.<br />
<br />
I'm not biased towards/against you, you just aren't arguing your point effectively or offering enough data that supports your theory.  The only data you've offered is that a warrior WITH tanking mods, has a higher tanking ability of 12.5% than a pally WITHOUT those mods.  Without more supporting data, your observation of the warrior class compared to pallies is without merit, unless ALL warriors have the same tanking mods and all pallies DON'T have any tanking mods.<br />
<br />
The burden of proof is on you.  Given the supplied data, our burden is to prove it false which has been done given one set of data.<br />
<br />
Given the data, a class observation can't be made.  Class observations can only be made on the innate class, not with special gear that modifies innate abilities.  Who cares if they are in the same progression?  One has special modifications to their tanking ability, the other does not.  This doesn't mean that all warriors have that same modification and tank equally as well.<br />
<br />
I don't have those special tanking modifications on my warrior.  Does that mean I'll tank 12.5% better than a pally with similar gear/AAs that I do?  I don't know, NO data has been offered to evaluate, just your word that you've &quot;seen&quot; parses showing it does.  Fine, link them.  The burden is still on you whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
Theory: Warriors tank 12.5% better than pallies.<br />
Data: A Warrior with tanking mods tanks 12.5% better than A pally without them.<br />
Conclussion: ALL warriors tank 12.5% better than ALL pallies.<br />
<br />
All men who wear pink are gay.<br />
That man wearing pink is gay.<br />
So, All men who wear pink are gay.<br />
<br />
Same format.  I'll even say that every man I saw wearing pink is gay, does that make my argument above valid?  The best you could say is that &quot;Maybe all men who wear pink are gay&quot;.<br />
<br />
Either gather and present more data, or have the grace to admit that there IS NOT enough data provided to make a class observation.  Provided being the key word, I'm not going to go track down the parses you've seen and do your work for you.  The burden remains on you to prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's been 4 things that have come out that have all agreed in around the same advantage, 12.5% +/- 2.5%.<br />
<br />
First was Brodda's Parse.<br />
<br />
Second was the dev post. I'd link that, but the administration here would censor it as they did the last time I posted it.<br />
<br />
Third was the link I posted in a thread that I've been involved in recently on TSW here from a poster on  EQLive boards as evidence that other experienced people have done parses of their OWN and found the same bonus. I'll get around to finding that link and relinking it here at some point.<br />
Edit: here's the example I linked: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shadowknightbalance&amp;message.id=1427#M1427<br />
<br />
And fourth, another parse, found here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7414<br />
<br />
All of this evidence, from SEVERAL sources to a greater or lesser extent agrees, all having around the same advantage. <br />
<br />
Now, what EVIDENCE has been posted that the difference is any less? Where's the parses that only show a 5% tanking difference? There's none. Not a SINGLE detractor has posted ANY solid evidence to show things to be any different than my statements.<br />
<br />
All my detrators are doing is blowing smoke and picking things apart while offering no solid evidence to the contrary. I've posted SEVERAL things that all agree with each other.<br />
<br />
This isn't a court of law, I don't have to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, the way EQ is set up with us having to figure out just about everything by outselves, we don't have the ability to prove stuff like this beyond a reasonable doubt at all. I've linked several outside sources of evidence to prove my points, my detractors have come up with absolutely nothing. Zero, Zip, Zilch, Nada. Not a SINGLE solid piece of evidence that the advantage is even under TEN percent, let alone the 5% that some of them claim. They can't even completely discredit the evidence I post, they can call some of it into question, and indeed they do try, but not all of it, especially not all of it put together.<br />
<br />
I've challenged them over and over again to come up with something solid, come up with a parse as evidence that this advantage doesn't exist, or even that it doesn't exist to the extent that I've stated, not a SINGLE one of them has been able to come up with a single god damned thing. That's all I've asked, is for evidence to the contrary. The absolute silence that that challenge has been met with by my detractors speaks volumes.<br />
<br />
That's all I want, is evidence to the contrary. Am I asking too much? I don't think so. I'd be willing to admit I'm wrong, I'm open to the possibility, but, you need to show me some evidence... and preferably several different sources agreeing, as I've presented.<br />
<br />
As I stated in another thread, if people chose to not believe me, that's their business, I really don't care. I've known about this advantage since I was a wee little warrior reading TSW to learn about my class, and I've seen it over and over, on the old boards as well as these.<br />
<br />
Only thing I care about is people who attack the evidence I've presented, and the conclusions I've drawn from multiple sources and years of experience and reading of thousands of posts from other experienced warriors.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm not out to &quot;prove&quot; something as the original poster of an entirely new assertion, I'm just maintaining what others have already come up with, and to which I *thought* the community as a whole agreed with. That's why I defended the attacks made against TSW of having an &quot;official position of a 5% tanking difference, so that they can argue class balance in their favor&quot; or words to that affect. I defended TSW, saying the real numbers tossed around here were 12.5% to 15%. Now I'm sorry I did, I should just have let the bash stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay let's look at all this evidence.<br />
<br />
Baazghul says<br />
They have been reproduced between 13% and 17%. I have parsed 14%.  15% seems like a good middle ground <br />
but he provides no links (finding 30 people saying the sky falling does not make the sky fall)<br />
<br />
If you won't believ me, try the DEVELOPER admission of a warrior's 16% overall mitigation advantage over a knight <br />
<br />
You've at least handled basic math right by showing 12.5% with the &quot;mage dev statement&quot; he's pulling 16 from these numbers?  if he can't handled 39/44 I doubt he's competent to post regarding comparitive studys of parses.<br />
<br />
16% according to developers on the mage boards...   <br />
<br />
again his errors.<br />
<br />
And fourth, another parse, found here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/foru...read.php?t=7414 <br />
<br />
umm great, you just linked a parse showing less then 10% advantage?<br />
<br />
I started reading further and reaslied you posted there....<br />
The ACTUAL number that is generally thrown around on Steel Warrior is 12.5-15% <br />
<br />
great so now insteed of it bieng just YOU pulling this number out of your ass to agree with everyone now you're trying to say tsw is supporting that number which it's obvious we don't.<br />
<br />
Glad you found some people that agree with you dae, but umm... where are the people we recognize? wait that's right you've gone to the sony &quot;official boards&quot; where it's a habitual whine fest and very little productive information goes on because no one knows who provides reliable information and everyone is vieing for the e-penis award.<br />
<br />
I saw no dev/cs rep posts there and after page 8 and most of page 9 just quit reading it.  There are no facts other then everyone saying there's something that backs them up somewhere and to trust them, much like you do.<br />
<br />
the parse you linked?  4.5% mitigation in warriors favor.<br />
DPS difference? 7.2%<br />
<br />
holy cow does that support your argument of almost DOUBLE the number....<br />
<br />
Seriously show me how what I've said is wrong.  I've shown you wrong just off your evidence you've supplied.  It's not that we haven't provided any proof, we merely showed why yours is wrong to a point of unrefutable math.  But I guess we missed out on 3rd grade math?</div></div><hr />

mm great, you just linked a parse showing less then 10% advantage?<br />
<br />
And here is the evidence of what I've stated: my detractors attempting to pick everything apart instead of actually showing any evidence of their own that would show anything to the contrary. Why? At this point, I've got to come to the conclusion that they've got nothing but an opinion with no basis in fact. So they've got to try to pick apart what I've said to try and get the number close to what THEIR opinion is, because their opinion has zero basis in fact.<br />
<br />
great so now insteed of it bieng just YOU pulling this number out of your ass to agree with everyone now you're trying to say tsw is supporting that number which it's obvious we don't.<br />
Because at the time, I thought TSW did. I now see the error.<br />
<br />

Um. That post I linked is of a relatively well known SK.<br />
<br />
the parse you linked?  4.5% mitigation in warriors favor.<br />
DPS difference? 7.2%<br />
Wrong again, this time because you're doing that math incorrectly using incorrect numbers provided by the math in the parse (warrior damage per swing should be 115, not 116, 230x.5 = 115). Secondly, you divide paladin damage BY warrior damage to get the proper comparison, as has been done for this whole discussion, the hybrid is the base and the one being compared from, and the warrior is the one being compared TO... doing this exactly as theoriginal posters did theirs when I first saw it on TSW somewhere. Do it the way you're doing item, and you start gotta putting it as how much WORSE hybrids tank than warriors. It's important to crunch the numbers properly to support the exact phrase of your argument.<br />
<br />
I did the math in the there, including avoidance, to show the REAL number, which is just a shade over 10%. <br />
<br />
Also note that that parse is at the Time level where the gap significantly closes due to knightemization, and even THEN the difference is still 10%. So at most levels of the game, the number will be higher, and closer to my assertion. This accounts for the discrepancy between Thepp's parses and this one.<br />
<br />
holy cow does that support your argument of almost DOUBLE the number....<br />
Holy cow does that support my claim that you don't know what the fuck you're tlaking about.<br />

Hah, no, you haven't. You just proved you don't have a fucking clue. Hello, avoidance differences? And yes, you must have missed out on third grade math. no third grader would take 2+2+3 and come up with 4 because they ignored the 3 altogether.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how you managed to get this 'just a shade over 10%', claiming 'you made the math' but this number is bullshit<br />
<br />
Here is what you should have done :<br />
1st remove shielding.<br />
total damage taken by the warrior, removing shielding : 446283<br />
total damage taken by the paladin, removing shielding : 475607<br />
swing on the warrior : 3864<br />
swing on the paladin : 3803<br />
<br />
So<br />
Warrior damage taken by swing : 115,4976708<br />
Paladin damage taken by swing : 125,0610045<br />
<br />
As a result :<br />
Paladin is taking 8.28% more damage than the warrior.<br />
Warrior is taking 7.64% less damage than the paladin.<br />
<br />
You just can't do math. You don't round numbers before the final result.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, considering that I was calculating from Ingeous's numbers, since there's no total damage provided in the info from the parse, which THEY rounded, that's a better statement for her than for me. Either way, the numbers I was using aren't going to make an appreciable change. The argument is differences in SEVERAL percent, a tenth isn't going to matter much if at all.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, you just want to bash me, I see. <br />
<br />
Now, as for your numbers, you ARE right. At that level, the advantage is just over 8%. The bitch of it for me is, I plugged my numbers into the trusty old windows calculator more than once and got the same 10% number until when I re-did it today, so I don't know WHAT the fuck happened there. /boggle<br />
<br />
Lesson here is, at the very highest of levels, the warrior advantage shrinks quite alarmingly.<br />
<br />
Of course, that doesn't disprove my 12.5% or so advantage much at all formost of the game, because only a VERY small percent (~1-2) are at this level. My contention for the advantage is for average players, as in not the ones at the very highest end of the game... in fact even at 8%, it supports it, due to the difference AC makes and the fact most paladins won't match warrior AC levels.<br />
<br />
So, note, I admitted I was wrong in this instance.... it's not 10%, it's somewhere between 1 and 2 percent less than that.</div></div><hr />

Listen you dumb shit, how many times do I have to say things so that you'll hear them? I already STATED, and MORE than once, that this is the top end of time content, where the picture changes due to knightemization. I'm not arguing about 1% of the population, I'm arguing about the other 99%, because that's the fairest view. Just like I'm not arguing the bottom 1% where the difference is most likely  greater.<br />
<br />
The fact that that's the SMALLEST difference that there ever exists supports my assertion of how it is for the majority. It's not all that difficult to get that extra 4% with the AC advantage that warriors have over knights for virtually all of the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
You're VERY obviously jumping on anything you can bash me with, while ignoring anything I have stated that would get in the way of that bashing. You've set this tone ever since you jumped down my throat saying &quot;Oh, you're talking out of your ass&quot; when I first stated the 12.5% advantage without linking evidence to prove it. You've made it clear already made up your mind far before any evidence was presented, and that you opinions will not change, no matter what. Your most recent post is just the most recent of the evidence.<br />
<br />
As for the difference &quot;is not class is it&quot;, of course not, it's class benefits, itemization, and the differing loot priorities, which together, all add up to the &quot;warrior advantage&quot;. I dropped the word &quot;innate&quot; due to incorrect usage a while ago.</div></div><hr />

Compare two level 1 character with the same stats naked and a Warrior innate 12.5427568% advantage and you've got a point. Or compare two level 40's or 50's. Otherwise you have only proved better tanking equipment makes you tank better.<br />

Not quite. The innate advantage is the -1DI and the extra avoidance (from the skills). The advantages that change is AC (which is far from being different only &quot;sometimes&quot;), and eventually shielding/avoidance mods before Time gets the crap completely farmed out of it by a guild.<br />

You're talking out of your ass yet again. Actually, yes, I do have facts to base that claim on. Brodda Thepp's parses and comparisons between Thepp's and Igneous's. Magelos of guilds and the comparisons between their warriors and hybrids. EqRankings. So on, and so forth.</div></div><hr />

Sorry you have been talking about shielding, you've been saying a warrior will have shielding and higher ac then a paladin, that a paladin won't get shielding because he has focus effects to go after.

<br />
What you've done is said the difference between this millionaire's ability to buy mercedes and that millionairs is this.  There for it's representive of every guy making 10 peso's a year to 200,000$ a year.<br />

You're one of those kids that would argue with your math teacher about why your answer to 10 divided by 2 CAN be 3 when regardless of what formulae you're using it's not the correct one for the problem at hand.<br />

I only assume you'd argue too with your latin teacher that habius corpus should really be heabiae corpae because a girl is in question but the use is in a totally different manner (not proper lating but a legal term without gender designation)<br />

You've taken a parse of the top3% of the population basically, and then a disproportiantly equiped segment AND then said it represents 97% fo teh population<br />
<br />
THEN you say to back your claim you site another parse that shows a third less tanking difference then you say is there (disproving your self)<br />
<br />
But say it's right because the gear difference (again gear not classes)<br />
<br />
I will say a warrior mitigates 5% more then a paladin.<br />
<br />
I will say in most cases a warrior tanks 8-10% better then a paladin.  I will not say the differences between the two is 12.5% because there is ZERO evidence to prove that.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are quite a few saying that, there are more saying against it.<br />
<br />
There is NO ONE, not one person providing solid proof to that claim of 12% or more.<br />

All anyone has done is shown tanking ability with better gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most paladins and SK's just want to be able to off-tank and they should be able to, their DPS is lower then yours high end, they don't bring much else to the table, hell during PoP i think the balance was pretty much spot on, the only thing knights had going for them was snap agro, and they should have it, hell SKs are even given a line of spells that generate pure agro. although it is currently broken.<br />
<br />
Why do you feel you should have total tanking domination.?<br />
<br />
I'm not a tank but tanks heavily affect my grouping, i play a beastlord and wanted to start a tank as an ALT, and don't see much reason to play a SK or Pal, with the current situation going on.<br />
<br />
in the lower to mid 50s warriors have a hard time getting agro sure, but does that affect the warriors high end no, not what so ever, in the high end i read a SK chain casting fear couldn't even pull agro off the MT warrior, their is something seriously wrong when a warrior could do that.<br />
<br />
this game is terribly unbalanced and broken when it comes to the high end tanking and i feel it should be fixed, i think SKs and Pallys should be able to tank the very high end, but it should just be alot easier to use a warrior instead, that way warriors will always be prefered but if not you could always use two other classes.<br />
<br />
or the game could be totally balanced like EQ;OA which is an awsome balanced game just the content is weird and grouping is nothing like everquest.<br />
<br />
All the tanks in the game are balanced and all the healers are balanced as well, just warriors and clerics are more adept at their forte, but a druid or shaman could heal just as well potentially but it would take away from other roles they have in game.         Tanks were all balanced also warrior just had better agro, SK's did damage and self healed, and paladins had stuns to reduce damage in the end it worked out pretty good and the auctioning system was also better.<br />
<br />
but enough about that just feel the game should be more balanced where classes could share role's instead of trying to hog, them and what brenlo said in someone's sig, i think someone should slap the fuck for saying stuff like that.<br />
<br />
He wasn't an original designer so why should he be saying stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

What does the truth hurt, read some of the previous post and try put yourself in Pally or SK's shoes, you find it won't fit you to well, if you started off playing a class you knew what supposed to be able to tank and find out your not needed for tanking later on you would feel kinda like you been ripped off.<br />
<br />
level all the way up to 65, some of you say that pallys just want to get rid of the Warrior class all together, the way some of you talk its as if you want the knights to completely disappear.<br />
<br />
Just speaking my mind and this is what i have discovered.<br />
<br />
The agro weapons generate too much agro in my oppinion in a LDoN mission the tank pulled and got one BoC proc at the start and missed the rest of his attacks, then i engaged and procced twice with Steel Hilted flint dagger for full effects and the sand elf didn't even look in my direction their is something seriously wrong when that happens.            <br />
<br />
Didn't mind not getting hit but its just too much especially when warrior only did 1 proc and a hit for like 40, and i got in 3 hits and two procs for 625 each.</div></div><hr />

Ah, but you see I WAS in at least the Paladin's shoes. I had a Paladin a level or two higher than my Warrior when Kunark came out.<br />
<br />
I decided that I wanted to be a Tank/Tank and not a Tank/cleric.<br />
<br />
I would forego buffing, ressing, healing, stun, blind, DA, Pacify, Root, remove curse, etc. I'd forgo it ALL for Defensive and being far and away the best tank possible.<br />
<br />
At level 50, the Paladin ran rings around the Warrior in groups. Add the removal of mana penalties, FT, KIE, class/diety armor, Windblade, and a few more levels since I made that choice and I assure you that in groups my Paladin is without peer.<br />
<br />
Matter of fact, he raid MT's virtually indestinguishably from a Warrior and can solo blue experiance mobs when buffed almost non-stop.<br />
<br />
You might have missed Arch Overseers using Knights to MT PoTime. Well equipped Knights CAN stand in for Warriors as MT's.<br />
<br />
I note that you say all they want to do is offtank. Not mind you addtank, or plow tank yard trash. They want to group tank better than Warriors, add tank, plow tank, off tank, and stand in for Warriors as MT's when needed. AND have a spellbook. Who's greedy??<br />
<br />
Oh, some have said they'd settle for narrowing the tanking gap and giving Warriors more versatility so they wouldn't be so one-dimentional as compensation. An offer for Warriors to be much like Knights as tanks and to have incrediably inferior &quot;spellbooks&quot; - very generous.<br />
<br />
There is one Tank with unmatched survivability. Raid Warrior #3-7 is just as entitled to tank the most brutal mobs as Warrior #1 and 2. Paladin #3-7 is just as entitled to addtank, melee, heal, buff, Root, stun, Res, spot heal, remove curses, etc. as Paladin #1 and 2.<br />
<br />
I'm not against making Knights better able to raid addtank or plow tank. I don't want blue adds to kill them. I'd like to see their spellbooks be more useful in raids. However I'll be darned if I want them to offtank or MT like a Warrior. Warriors have ONE raid role - Tanking the stuff that hits too hard for others to handle.<br />

<br />
You mean kind of how I felt all during PoP?  Do tell, I'm unfamiliar with the concept.  And Knights tank just fine.  They even off tank just fine in GoD now from what I hear.  The tests that have been run have shown that as far as we can determine there is somewhere between a 5% and 12% difference in the tanking of an equally geared Knight compared to a Warrior.  This is not a &quot;huge tanking gap&quot; which needs to be significantly decreased, because to make it any smaller would make it non-existant.  If what you're really trying to say is that Knights don't get defensive and therefore can't tank boss mobs anywhere near as well as a Warrior, that topic has been beat to death in a dozen or more different posts and you really have nothing new or insightful to add to the discussion.<br />
<br />
Other people have addressed your aggro complaints so I won't bother beating those down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
are you that self rightous to think you have ANY concept what-so-ever of what it is like to be a paladin because you played one FOUR GODDAMN YEARS AGO? or that you have any concept of what it's like to be a lvl 65 paladin in GoD?<br />
<br />
Matter of fact, he raid MT's virtually indestinguishably from a Warrior and can solo blue experiance mobs when buffed almost non-stop.<br />
<br />
if hes 65, the only thing even remotely blue he can solo is PoI, and the exp there is complete and utter crap. and if hes not 65, well than this argument is rather moot isn't it?<br />
<br />
You might have missed Arch Overseers using Knights to MT PoTime. Well equipped Knights CAN stand in for Warriors as MT's.<br />
<br />
you might have also missed how much MORE effort they had to put into the fight to make a knight able to MT it. AO let a knight tank quarm to prove how broken the VIE line of spells was...NOT to give warriors a platform from which to spout drivel about how paladins are threatening thier third reich supremecy.<br />
<br />
I note that you say all they want to do is offtank. Not mind you addtank, or plow tank yard trash. They want to group tank better than Warriors, add tank, plow tank, off tank, and stand in for Warriors as MT's when needed. AND have a spellbook. Who's greedy??<br />
<br />
warriors are. not all knights plow tank trash mobs, i was in my guild for over a year, yes even during &quot;the dreaded black time of the warrior&quot; and our MT plow tanked EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
we don't give a shit about being better tanks than warriors in groups, i don't see where that has EVER come up, we want to be used in groups, thats how it is now, no problems here, cept the ones you guys create.<br />
<br />
SOME paladins want to stand in as MT's, and for no other reason than to feel useful once in a great while, my guild didn't even use knights on &quot;knight mobs&quot; like CT and inny, so i didn't even get that pleasure.<br />
<br />
the key word there being &quot;stand-in&quot; for warriors, not &quot;replace&quot; warriors....kinda like how before, warriors could &quot;stand-in&quot; as off tanks, but they have now &quot;replaced&quot; knights as off-tanks.<br />
<br />
Oh, some have said they'd settle for narrowing the tanking gap and giving Warriors more versatility so they wouldn't be so one-dimentional as compensation. An offer for Warriors to be much like Knights as tanks and to have incrediably inferior &quot;spellbooks&quot; - very generous.<br />
<br />
warriors crutch a while back, was that if they gave knights better tankability, warriors would need more versitility, we called your bluff and said sure, have all the goddamn useless versility you want...seriously, TAKE IT...but then you guys realized we were serious and you backpedaled.<br />
<br />
There is one Tank with unmatched survivability. Raid Warrior #3-7 is just as entitled to tank the most brutal mobs as Warrior #1 and 2. Paladin #3-7 is just as entitled to addtank, melee, heal, buff, Root, stun, Res, spot heal, remove curses, etc. as Paladin #1 and 2.<br />
<br />
problem is, warriors #3-7 is just as useful and needed as warrior #1 and 2...whereas as once you got a BSS buff whore, paladin #2-7 can be replaced by ANYOTHER CLASS...seriously...put any other single class in there and you won't miss not having the other paladins.<br />
<br />
I'm not against making Knights better able to raid addtank or plow tank. I don't want blue adds to kill them. I'd like to see their spellbooks be more useful in raids. However I'll be darned if I want them to offtank or MT like a Warrior. Warriors have ONE raid role - Tanking the stuff that hits too hard for others to handle.<br />
<br />
your all for giving us upgrades that encroach on &quot;other&quot; peoples territory, as long as warriors retain thier surpemecy we're entitled to all the upgrades in the world, we just can't have anythign worth a fuck.<br />
<br />
offtanking was the one thing we had that even remotely resembled a raid role, and we fit into that niche nicely, we were happy...we felt useful...we did things on raids, and if we fucked up we payed the consequence...the raid felt our presence, and our absence. if not enough knights logged on, sure the raid would continue, because warriors could do the job, but it wasn't ideal.<br />
<br />
you guys have all but taken that away from us, and you admit here you don't believe its a role we should have.<br />
<br />
so what exactly do you guys think we should do on raids? <br />
DPS? <br />
<br />
cure once a raid, with inferior cures that are done better by every other class?<br />
<br />
root mobs, that are better done by wizard and druid AA's?<br />
<br />
heal people, with inferior heals that don't have an effect, and are better done by a secondary healer job?<br />
<br />
blind mobs with flash of light so they run away?<br />
<br />
nuke mobs with flame of light for 125dd?<br />
<br />
pacify for the raid if we happen to be fighting mobs under lvl 55?<br />
<br />
cast cancel magic on inc mobs to strip any real debuff that have just been cast?<br />
<br />
i spose our raid role could be single group heals, since thats the only thing we do even remotely well, we could even expand on it, make is so that a class that already has a group heal role, could have a raid healing role..oh wait, that would encroach on beastlord, a class that has NO PRESEDENCE WHATSOEVER FOR HEALING MULTIPLE TARGETS, *and* they get a mana regen componet to it to boot...</div></div><hr />

It's about perception. People are percieving that knights can't tank (well) in GoD therefore they can't! When in fact we can, and in a lot of cases subsantialy better than an equivelent warrior. Just don't expect to be able to tank the named toe to toe with a any better than 1:10 success rate where the warrior should have a 70- 80% success rate, using conventional means. However changing tactics somewhat I can guarantee close on 100% success rate on named (excluding lag and ld issues) using a pally.<br />
<br />
Up until a couple of days ago I was in full support of a mini defensive, now after actualy getting into vxed and tipt I am not so sure we need it (and of course my views may well change as I progress) although I still think a 30 second(ish) WS type disc shouldn't be out of the question.</div></div><hr />

My Paladin is 53. IF he was 65, he'd be soloing Kunark Dragons in addition to all the blue content I can solo as a Warrior. And shocking as it may seem, I can get GOOD exp as a Warrior so leave that propaganda over at PoN where it belongs. If you've reached 65 and can't solo a yellow bubble of normal experiance every hour or so, SoE can't help you - you don't know how to play the game or you are terribly under equipped.<br />
<br />
Actually, AO didn't prove how broken Vie was. Some Knights offered that as the &quot;explanation&quot; but sadly it wasn't true and AO said so.<br />
<br />
Warriors haven't &quot;replaced&quot; Knights as offtanks. There is not a single mob to my knowlege the I can't tank that a Knight at my progression level can tank. Afaik, with the exception of Griegg Venificus there has never been such a mob.<br />
<br />
As a hybrid class, almost everything IS someone else's territory. Healing is, Tanking is, buffing is, etc. - you CHOSE not to be unique and not to be the best at anything. You wanted to tank AND cast. Guess what, Rangers want to Tank and shoot a bow. Some Knights have pushed hard to make everyone forget Rangers are tanks too. Pretty wide middle ground you're demanding.<br />
<br />
The Warrior/Paladin tanking gap is a heck of a lot narrower than the Wariror/Paladin healing, buffing, and ressing gap. Hybrids got some advantages due to being part casters. And some tanking disadvantages because they chose to be part Tanks.<br />
<br />
You've got raid roles. Just not the raid role of a Tank that is unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
And Ikkinz is not required individual content. It's guild progreesion content. SoE did not change Ikkinz afaik.<br />
<br />
Knights are entitled to get normal experiance groups, MT mandatory individual flag one-group content and have a useful raid role. They are NOT entitled to be functionally equivalent but slightly less prefered to Warriors vs every single mob in the game.<br />
<br />
It is not the fault of SoE or the Warrior class if your guild does not let you addtank or MT Inny and CT. With 6500HP's unbuffed it's pretty difficult to be a PoTime+ raid tank. Farm PoTime a bit. You will easily reach 7500 HP's unbuffed and tank better as a result.<br />

<br />
wrong, rangers wanted to do DPS and have high utility. REAL utility, like sow, several useful buffs, damage shields, lev, invis..etc etc etc<br />
<br />
rangers trade tank ability for high dps, its as simple as that. i DON'T have high dps, so i want my tank ability back.<br />

It is not the fault of SoE or the Warrior class if your guild does not let you addtank or MT Inny and CT. Perhaps they have seen your equipment - 6500HP's unbuffed is not a PoTime+ raid tank.<br />
<br />
im certainly not the only knight in my guild, and i certainly wasn't the top geared knight, we had plenty of knights perfectly capable of tanking those mobs, but we still used a warrior.<br />
<br />
taken from AO forums<br />
Our dastardly monk tanking deeds took a healthy leap fowards tonight in an effort to prove that even the Plane of Time Gods were no match for a leather-clad combatant. Using the healing pattern we use for our warriors and without a single Bulwark of Vie or Voice of Thule, Saryn and Terris were bitchslapped back to where they belong.<br />
<br />
OMFG NERF MONKS THEY TANK AS WELL AS WARRIORS WTF OMGZORZZZ<br />
<br />
I don't know if other guilds use knights on these guys but I'm guessing they use warriors like we usually do. Once again, using the same healing we use on our warriors, coupled with Bulwark of Vie, knights can fill a warrior's role<br />
<br />
you see that...let me point it out.....USING THE SAME HEALING AS WARRIORS, ****COUPLED**** WITH BULWARK OF VIE<br />
<br />
Nomilus vs Quarm using our normal warrior healing pattern and bulwark of vie<br />
<br />
just in case you thought it was a fluke about the BoV thing....<br />
<br />
<br />
and just to put some things into perspective...<br />
<br />
Thirdly, any idiot who has played this game for more than a day will tell you the little guy in the corner is a monk. What he won't tell you is that it's possible for the monk to tank Fennin, from start to finish, using Virtue and no Brells. And dual wielding too, none of this 2-hander crap. Now where's that nerf bat again? <br />

Even other Knights don't necessarily see their classes as crippled as you do.  You were perfectly willing to accept the advantages of having spells when they gave significant advantages, yet now claim that the spells no longer compensate for the very small tanking difference between equally geared Warriors and Knights when defensive isn't being used.<br />
<br />
You can tank.  If there is still content in GoD that isn't properly tuned so appropriately geared Knights can adequately tank content they should have every reasonable right to expect to tank, then that needs to be brought to the attention of the SoE devs and additional tuning should be implemented in those problem areas.  If on the other hand you're talking about boss mobs that Warriors are using defensive against just in order to succeed and which aren't legitimately considered one group content, then your issues are off base.<br />
<br />
SoE has admitted that GoD was originally tuned with a higher level cap in mind and they neglected to retune it before release.  Recent changes seem to have mitigated most of the problems to a reasonable level.  If you're finding that isn't true in some content, and it wouldn't surprise me if there are still instances of improperly tuned content here and there, then you don't need tanking modifications, you need content modifications.</div></div><hr />

You traded some tanking ability for heals, buffs, stuns, Root, Pacify, Res, GRC, and to be powerful vs. undead.<br />
<br />
AO used Bulwark of Vie?? Awesome - I've suggested numerous times that Paladin's should get that spell. Of couse the aggro might need to be adjusted so it is as much as resisted level 9 stuns.<br />
<br />
Paladin raid roles -<br />
Add tank, off tank in some encounters, prefered MT in some encounters, buffer, melee DPS, speedbump, Rampage Tank (DA hammer is a nice addition for doing this btw), spot healer, group healer, curse remover, emergency resser, etc.<br />
<br />
A Warrior's raid role - MT, offtank, add tank, melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Or a Nomilus said once:<br />
This seems to be a comon post over and over under many diff names.<br />
<br />
Maybe try the following ideas to get what you want:<br />
<br />
If you want the same HP as a warrior ..then roll up a warrior.<br />
<br />
If you want the same agro as a warrior.. then roll up a warrior.<br />
<br />
If you want /disc Def...Then roll up a warrior.<br />
<br />
If you want to toss huge heals...then roll up a Cleric.<br />
<br />
If you want to deal more damage...then roll up a monk or Rogue.<br />
<br />
BUT....<br />
<br />
If you want to be a muti-faceted class that can do ok DMG, able to take a good amount of DMG, toss a few heals and be able to save the day in many diff cases...then shut yer pie hole and enjoy your Paladin!<br />
<br />
We are what we are..deal with it! (if not..go roll up a warrior)<br />

If GoD was made for a higher lvl cap then they shouldn't have changed it imo --OoW is coming out soon, and by then high - end hybrids will have better gear to tank the situations + 5 lvls -- life is not always fair -- this is a game, but it is also a world which can never be entirely fair. You make who your character is -- you make your relationships in this world and define what role they accept you in. You also make you gear decisions and have to spend huge amounts of time working for them. <br />
<br />
I've got a rogue in our guild who tanked in a PoF exp group last week -- the difference between Pure warrior tanking and most other classes is negligable once your geared and have the defensive AA's which everyone gets (why aren't there some warrior only defensive AA's to help us define our class?)<br />
<br />
You role a hybrid for a reason when you start EQ (of course if you are experienced in high - end EQ and powerlevel a hybrid up because you think you can be superior to a warrior you;re gonna bitch and whine non-stop so? go powerlevel your guilds next warrior twink!) Your class as a hybrid comes with lots of utility that makes your class not only more exciting in the day to day game, but also more able to survive without depending on your relationships with other people. Enjoy your class! We as warriors are nothing without our EQ relationships - we've chosen a harder class and should have SOME benefit from that after all the work we put into it. The warrior class is a BIGGER challenge than the hybrids and gets basically NO rewards for this beyond raid tanking.<br />
<br />
Before I'd made many friends in EQ I played a paladin because it allowed me to enjoy the game without as big of a time sink -- without relying on other characters as much. After I'd developed relationships in EQ and saw the power  a warrior brought to other peoples experience of the game -- tanking became all I wanted to do. So I started over and made a warrior. If you claim that your classes skills are worthless then ask for new utility -- but don't demand the sole point of my class. <br />
<br />
There should be a GREATER difference between warrior and knight tanking -- it is our ONLY position in the game. Hybrids should look to more utility if you feel your classes are weak. You demand offtanking priority -- what are all the up and coming warrios supposed to do to prove themselves on raids? Oh DPS? according to you this is the most pathetic role a person could have on a raid. Why bother gearing up up and coming warriors.. they do nothing on raids ....<br />
<br />
sorry for the long post, but this topic is pathetic imo.</div></div><hr />

Their healing and vie spreads were explained in a thread on EQCleric by a german cleric shortly after Nomilus first tanked Quarm - the same german cleric that did the vie chain by himself. Other than one cleric chaining Vie every 4.65 seconds, their healing spread was the exact same. Which means that if a warrior can easily tank time-RZ with 9 clerics healing, an equally-geared paladin can tank the same mob with 9 clerics healing + 1 on vie. Not bad for a class that isn't even supposed to be able to tank the goddamn boss mob, eh?<br />
<br />
so what exactly do you guys think we should do on raids? <br />
DPS? <br />
<br />
cure once a raid, with inferior cures that are done better by every other class?<br />

<br />
pacify for the raid if we happen to be fighting mobs under lvl 55?<br />
<br />
cast cancel magic on inc mobs to strip any real debuff that have just been cast?<br />
<br />
<br />
896% bullshit again. Seriously Paladins, your PoN-logic is making it look like you're not even trying to catch the Clue-Train.<br />
<br />
Complaining about cures and roots? Yeah, you only already have the best of both in the game -<br />
<br />
Paladins are way ahead of priests in terms of cures, and their compact P/D/C cure costs zero mana (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=15751). Priests' only comparable cure is the Pure Blood series, which cures less P/D counters and doesn't touch curses. The only other P/D/C cure in the game that doesn't have a 3 minute recast is a mana intensive group heal, the Omens version of which costs 1375 mana and is inferior to the Crusader's Touch upgrade in all 3 types. Should SoE ever expand into multi-phasic dots, paladins will be the only class with a reliable cure.<br />
<br />
How isn't Shackles of Tunare an awesome spell? It has the same resist adjust as other root spells, casts more than twice as fast, lasts almost twice as long as the priest version, and costs half the mana. It casts almost three times faster than strong root, and lasts 6 ticks longer there too. Paladins have nothing to complain about, at all, for roots or cures.<br />
<br />
And heals? Paladins are the third highest HPS class (post-Omens) and one of only two classes with a group heal:<br />

Yes, the efficiency between paladin and ranger heals is slightly fucked, but the triple HPS does partly make up for that. If paladins want efficiency, there's always Cleansing. Focus effects will of course give third place in HPS back to shaman, but that's where it should be anyway. Paladins retain the &quot;combat medic&quot; role they actually asked for; Omen-Paladin-Heal is a lot faster than any priest heal, and if 315 HPS doesn't have any effect, what the fuck are shaman doing using their point heals at all? Shaman heals save plenty of (cleric) lives clearing trash on raids, as do &quot;combat medic&quot; paladin heals if paladins will actually use them.<br />
<br />
We've told you plenty of times, Ariakkas.. I'll say it again: Paladins' role on raids is offtanking non-reds and MAing, but they also have cures and flash heals if they're actually awake and watching combat. You're a lot more involved than dps_class_01 (not to mention warrior #3 and beyond), and it's not like you're a cleric, where a 30 second afk at nearly any time can end the fucking raid. The guild I guest with does Uqua with a Paladin MA (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=139486), so paladins definitely aren't useless.<br />
<br />
cast cancel magic on inc mobs to strip any real debuff that have just been cast?<br />
<br />
Or stripping an Ikaav's 40+ point damage shield, or stripping the Swift Like the Wind on a KT shaman named, yes, there are mobs that require dispel. Hexxt Spiritpillager is a bloodbath if you don't - an 11k defensive warrior went from full hp to dead faster than my 2.4 sec SL cast.<br />
<br />
It's a pretty deserving twist of fate; warriors went through 11 months of xp-group uselessness, and paladins justified it by saying warriors should be weaker group tanks since they are better raid tanks. One expansion changes the equation a little bit and paladins start crying the same tune, despite the fact that paladins are better off than warriors were then. If I was a warrior, I'd tell you that I'm a better raid tank because you have the advantage in a group, using the exact bullshit logic knights gave warriors for almost a year during PoP. Ikkinz isn't anywhere near impossible anymore for a knight.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are the most specialized class in the game, the only thing we do is tank. Warriors are 100% dependent on other classes to do anything. Ever been in an exp group when the ranger you recruited to snare fell asleep &amp; forgot to snare? I knight can snare root stun the mob a warrior can...ummm chase the mob helpless as it runs off to its friends. Ever lost aggro to an early tash or slow &amp; watched helplessly as the enchanter in your group gets turned into a grease spot?...well I knight would of never lost aggro in the 1st place but a pally could stun or root giving the chanter time to move &amp; drop aggro. Ever been deep in a dungeon w/o a cleric &amp; have someone die? gee that 90% rezz sure would be nice. Ever group with a SKILLED sk ( I swear 90% of SK suck at pulling ) who pet pulled or FD pulled a named out of a pack of mobs? yep another worthless skill. IMO the tanking difference is TOO SMALL, minus defensive a warrior should have an &quot;eyeballable&quot; difference in tanking between knights &amp; right now the difference is hardly noticable. GOD was retuned for knights to be able to tank, knights imo are still the prefered tank in 99% of exp groups, knights have no reason to bitch imo.<br />

It's almost the same argument as CH vs. SL that happened all over EQCleric a year ago - flash heals aren't about being sustainable, or efficient, or even cheap. Flash heals are about speed, as in being fast enough to catch someone before the second or third round hits and the target dies. That recast time on your flash heal exists for a reason; it keeps paladins from being able to sustain better HPS than a shaman (without focus effects), and without it a potime-farmed paladin could replace a druid or shaman as secondary healer on Kod'Taz/Ikkinz named - they already can for trash.<br />
<br />
The role of combat medic includes having the fastest heal in the west, but that heal isn't meant to be cast *all* the time - only in emergencies. If your group or raid requires emergency healing more than once every 6 seconds, your problems run deeper than paladin healing abilities.</div></div><hr />

Your hp/sec figure is the average hps per second assuming that the spell is being chain cast, and the assumption is that cycle time is is the amount of time between each cast of the spell. You may as well leave out hps and cycle time if you aren't going to take recast time into account.<br />

Every class on that list can actually hit those hp/sec figures chain casting their heal spells, except paladins. I think that is misleading.</div></div><hr />

Sustained healing is a very misleading way to measure Paladin healing.<br />
<br />
I agree players shouldn't compare apples with oranges. But Paladins don't sit in healing rotations nor are they group healers. They are emergency healers/Combat Medics and that is how their healing abilities should be examined.<br />
<br />
Afaik, no healer can surpass a Paladin on speed of casting and maximum HP's healed in a single cast. Excepting a Cleric, it's difficult to find any class that can exceed them in a single (2 spells) back to back cast.<br />
<br />
But puhlease, don't feel you must only reply to Warrior posts that you think may misrepresent. You are missing the masters of misrepresentation -----<br />
<br />
Perhaps you haven't noticed Gimmel that many Paladins compare their healing with the sustained healing of a Shaman using Canni as if it can be used during combat. Even when they downplay their healing ability on this board by comparing their healing to a Druid and they are challanged to compare themselves to a Shaman not using Canni, they will not do it.<br />

On SoE's Paladin class board, Dagny acts outraged that a Warrior using Defensive against a named high DI raid mob outtanks him. What he fails to point out is that when not using Defensive:<br />

YES, he's proven that Warriors are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles because of Defensive. Seems resonable, this is in our Class Description, is our traditional role, and as SoE has said - like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and SK's.<br />

He's also proven that he's probably a much more effective add tank than the Wariror he compares himself to.<br />

What sticks in his craw apparently is that he wants to tank those raid named high DI mobs more like a Warrior. Perhaps he should have rolled one. He consistantly insists he should tank like one.<br />

Good Lord, BB. The paladin is blatantly and significantly better geared than the warrior At that level, the paladin should have WORSE AC than the warrior, not better. If I was to parse a warrior that's significantly better geared than a Paladin, I'd probably get a difference of 15-20%, so Of COURSE the gap's going to be lesser than it would without the gear difference. Not only that, but a SEVEN MINUTE parse isn't even anywhere NEAR the sample size needed. That &quot;parse&quot; isn't worth the space it takes on up the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Talk about picking the biased arguments to support your point of view.<br />
<br />
You wanna make a REAL comparison, parse two EQUALLY geared toons. Otherwise you're just as guilty of the spew, as some PoN posters are known to do... finding blatantly flawed arguments, just because they happen to support their argument or getting tanking upgrades (or protecting the status quo, in your case).<br />
<br />
I like to see parses, but damn, that one's a complete piece of shit.</div></div><hr />

When people pointed out that your magic 12.5% Warrior tanking advantage was based on unequal equipment, you argued REAL world trumped equal. Now you do a complete turn around. Good to see it.<br />

I didn't pick out the Paladin and Warrior, Dagny did. And what's best, it's a fellow guildmate of his at the same progression level. Just the kind of &quot;real world&quot; comparason you claim to find most meaningful.<br />
<br />
In the &quot;real word&quot; sometimes Knights have a huge equipment lead, even at PoTime. Take away the Sturdyness AA's and add in AoTC and you can easily see the Paladin's lead is almost 1000 HP's!! Pretty extraordinary for a Paladin equipment lead over a Warrior in the same guild.<br />
<br />
Get the point chief? Real world, same guild, same progression level, Paladin far better equiped than MT's and asking for the Defensive advantage to be minimized so he can complete his assendance.<br />
<br />
The Warrior can thank Verant/SoE for Sturdyness (which Dagny opposed) and Defensive. Without them the Warrior would never MT - assuming he's ocassionally allowed to.<br />
<br />
At least one Paladin was truthful enough on that thread to say outright that Paladins want to MT raid boss mobs. I want to cast LoO, LoH, Res, Root, and be the best HP buffer in the game. But, since I had to choose, I chose unmatched tanking of brutal mobs.<br />

No, you're misunderstanding me. I'm talking about real equally equipped hybrids and warriors. As in, toons at the same progression level, and the same level within that guild, making the choices that each player decides is best for their toon. IE compare the best geared warrior vs best paladin, or worst warrior vs worst paladin, NOT best geared Paladin vs worst geared warrior, which this case seems to be. And CERTAINLY not the &quot;well, they COULD do this&quot; bit.<br />
As for &quot;I didn't pick it, Dagny did&quot;... you were the one to seize it and trumpet it like it's perfectly valid and a good parse. And the guildmate... just because he's in the same guild, doesn'tmean he's equally geared. There are some tanks that are better equipped than others in the guild, he certainly picked one that wasn't as well geared.<br />
<br />
Get the point chief? Real world, same guild, same progression level, Paladin far better equiped than MT's and asking for the Defensive advantage to be minimized so he can complete his assendance.<br />
Yes, some of the more extreme Paladins do do that, that's not at issue here. I think most warriors know there are extremists at PoN, just like there are extremists at TSW. <br />

hold the phone batman, could this really be?<br />

so when a warrior is sub-geared for his guild and progression level, its certainly A-OK for him to retain his clear tanking advantage...clearly better than a better geared knight...<br />

having raid dominance and group equality is perfectly acceptable for a warrior, but having group superiority and raid equally is a big FUCK NO for paladins. we only deserve group equality and raid uselessness. <br />

being upgraded when you really need it, ala agro..even tho you guys whored out a 5 expansion old KNIGHT snap agro ability, it was perfectly fine....but god forbid paladins get anything what-so-ever that encroaches on warrior supremecy.<br />

its perfectly fine for warriors to have warrior only tanking AA ala sturdiness, stalwart endurance....but i'll be goddamn if knights are allowed to have physical enhancement to themselves, or get any new AA's related to tanking that aren't even nessecarily knight only, just SOMETHING.<br />

its perfectly ok for warriors to have several useful discs for tanking AND dps, but it's not ok for knights to have a single disc that is of any use what-so-ever.<br />

Besides Defensive is Only usefull at one point And knights have Proved with gear upgrades it is not Needed or they would never maintank. and you snap agro was an oversight on SoE you really think they wanted tehre level 70 mobs to be stuned with level 9 spells?  and if you think Incite line is snap Agro Play with it more I guarntee I can still get agro jacked from Me by over zelious rouges and wizards who are criting Back stabs And Nukes</div></div><hr />

For three minutes?  Yes.  Warriors are, hands down, a better healer for 3 minutes than a paladin ever will be.  Live with it.  Longer fights the paladin takes precidence.  Guess what, I'd rather have an EP geared cleric healing my group than a GoD geared druid.  I havent heard druids whining about this disparity.<br />

Sounds like you have issues with your guild then, so take it to them, not us.  Everyone in my guild, even the apps who dont even have ornate, get a chance to be the main assist for trash clearing.<br />
<br />
having raid dominance and group equality is perfectly acceptable for a warrior, but having group superiority and raid equally is a big FUCK NO for paladins. we only deserve group equality and raid uselessness.<br />
You still have group superiority if you tank anywhere except GoD.  PoP groups, LDoN groups, you still fucking have group superiority over us.  Incite is not &quot;snap aggro&quot;, unless we're pulling the mobs ourselves a paladin is a better person to have in an exp group than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Paladins are not meant to tank the hardest hitting mobs.<br />
I'll repeat it for you:<br />
Paladins are not, and never were meant, to tank the hardest hitting mobs.<br />
One more time, for good measure:<br />
Paladins are not, were never meant, and most likely never WILL be meant, to tank the hardest hitting mobs.<br />
<br />

Incite is not &quot;snap aggro&quot;.  Its a 30second reuse PROC.  It gives me an extra 600 hate ONE time for 30 seconds.  Snap aggro is being able to get aggro immediately regardless of the RNG or your gear.  You cast two level 9 spells and you have more aggro than incite gives us in 30 seconds.  We didn't have a paladin skill &quot;whored&quot; to us, we got a skill that gives us the ability to hold aggro once we get it (if I incite before I have aggro, 9 times outta 10 I still dont get aggro.  Try fucking playing a warrior for once before making outrageous claims like that)<br />
<br />
its perfectly fine for warriors to have warrior only tanking AA ala sturdiness, stalwart endurance....but i'll be goddamn if knights are allowed to have physical enhancement to themselves, or get any new AA's related to tanking that aren't even nessecarily knight only, just SOMETHING.<br />
You had all the POP tanking AAs.  Because of these, the disparity between Knight and Warrior in POP was something like 98% HP.  Sturdiness was needed to give warriors the most hp.  Yes, warriors are supposed to have the most HP, and its supposed to make a difference versus mobs the warriors are fighting.<br />
<br />
its perfectly ok for warriors to have several useful discs for tanking AND dps, but it's not ok for knights to have a single disc that is of any use what-so-ever<br />
<br />
Yes.  Just like its perfectly ok for paladins to have several useful spells for tanking AND utility, but its not ok for warriors to have a single spell in our spellbooks what-so-ever.<br />

Actually, Ciae is a cleric, as such, he should know better. But it seems you are saying that since some paladins have given biased and misleading information, that it is ok for others to do so too. Lovely. Look at this paragraph:<br />
Yes, the efficiency between paladin and ranger heals is slightly fucked, but the triple HPS does partly make up for that. If paladins want efficiency, there's always Cleansing. Focus effects will of course give third place in HPS back to shaman, but that's where it should be anyway. Paladins retain the &quot;combat medic&quot; role they actually asked for; Omen-Paladin-Heal is a lot faster than any priest heal, and if 315 HPS doesn't have any effect, what the fuck are shaman doing using their point heals at all? Shaman heals save plenty of (cleric) lives clearing trash on raids, as do &quot;combat medic&quot; paladin heals if paladins will actually use them.<br />
The paladin is compared to 2 other classes on the basis of a hps figure that cannot be attained. You say a paladin's role is flash heals and not sustained heals? Fine. Compare them on that basis. But instead they are being compared on a hps figure that has no basis in reality.<br />
<br />
You are showing yourself every bit as willing to be dishonest as the paladins whose tactics you pretend to abhor, BB. Evidently it doesn't really matter what you say as long as you get what you want in the end.</div></div><hr />

As you may note, I did not originate that comparason. I also clearly stated that it is not fair to compare apples to oranges.<br />
<br />
But since you have taken an interest:<br />
<br />
1. Which class, on it's own can buff maximum HP's the most?<br />
<br />
2. Which class is able to heal the most HP's on a single player with a single action?<br />
<br />
3. Which class has the greatest heal of a single character in one second. For argument's sake, let's call that Flash Heal capability.<br />
<br />
4. How do Paladin heals compare to Shaman heals in ALL catagories under actual combat conditions (Canni not possible)? This would include flash healing as well as sustained healing.<br />
<br />
5. Which melee class has the greatest likelyhood of being able to produce a ranged aggro event at any given time.<br />
<br />
6. Which class due to it's ability to be more autonomous in a group is best suited to add tank the many many normal blue stunable adds found in GoD and previous expansions.<br />
<br />
7. Compare Warrior and Paladin DPS against a single undead mob when the Paladin uses Slay Undead, Holy Forge, and Ward of Nife.<br />
<br />
I think in each case some players have gone beyond simply trying to change the debate from class balance to &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbook Superiority) to outright fibbing about their class capabilities.<br />
<br />
The worst some Warriors can be accused of is pressing for an aggro improvement (largely to get LDoN groups) when PoTime equipped Warirors didn't require it.<br />
<br />
The worst some Knights can be accused of is claiming they need a mitigation ability to add tank (Tanks don't use Defensive when tanking adds, it takes too long to refresh and might be unavailable when needed) and totally discounting the value of their spellbooks to groups, while having an agenda to eliminate competition in add tanking from Rangers (the Forgotten Tank), be preferred to off tank red splits and &quot;share&quot; MTing named raid boss mobs with Warriors.<br />
<br />
The worst some Clerics can be accused of is not being upfront with their support of a Knight position that Warriors should tank like Knights and have the crappiest Tank spellbook in the game.<br />

<br />
I'll help -<br />
Paladins have a powerful spell book with spells providing synergy with their melee tanking abilities that make them particularly well suited to act as raid add tanks/Combat Medics/curse removers/augment group healing, etc.<br />
<br />
They wanted and have enjoyed all of these capabilities.<br />
<br />
Warriors are unmatched at tanking mobs that other Tanks can not handle.<br />
<br />
When not MTing, Warriors stand in line waiting for their chance to MT or offtank red mobs that other tanks can't handle.<br />
<br />
We have different raid roles Gimmel. Knights want to take over offtanking, &quot;share&quot; MTing, and have their spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though, they don't want to &quot;share&quot; with Rangers (the Forgotten Tank) nor Clerics, who as armor wearing/mace weilding Knight Templars can't be allowed melee DPS - because powerful healing + tanking is too powerful a combination.<br />
<br />
Class balance does not mean comparing Tanking ability while hiding spellbooks. It doe not mean disparate classes should &quot;share&quot; the same raid role.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent list Gimmel. Every single one of the things you list should be expected of a class that is a master of all weapons and unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
However many of the priest class Paladin attributes I listed are not related directly to tanking.<br />
<br />
Warriors are 100% Tanks.<br />
Paladins are part Tank and part casters.<br />
Clerics are primarily casters (and part melee).<br />
<br />
Apparently Tanking and melee ability is inversely proportional to caster ability. Given Paladin healing, buffing, curse removing, Rooting, stunning, Ressing, etc., etc., etc. compared to a Cleric.....<br />
<br />
How close should they MT raid boss mobs compared to a class that is unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles? Given the power of their Cleric side and the relative ineffectiveness of Clerics at MTing, I'd say a Paladin even taunting a raid boss mob should be DT'd just for having the audacity (until farming end expansion equipment makes the mob trivial). Paladins have a raid role. It is just not the Wariror raid role. They chose not to roll a Warrior (or a Cleric). They chose versatility and some (but not all) of both classes.<br />
<br />
There are some Knight prefered raid boss mobs and SoE can make some more. Their opprotunity to MT is regulated by mob design.<br />
<br />
So long as Warriors are largely preoccupied MTing raid boss mobs and off tanking red mobs, Knight raid addtanking without Warrior competition is relatively assured. But some don't want simply a useful raid role, they want the Warrior raid role.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And notice that in my list I didn't include defensive? That list would still apply in full even if knights got a mitigation disc. Which is why warriors would still be &quot;umatched in surviving the most brutal battles&quot;, even if knights got a half defensive. Hell, even if they got a full defensive, warrior's raid MT role for boss mobs wouldn't be threatened significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if SK's got a 100% res and Paladins got Virtue, a 99% SL, etc. Clerics would still be the preferred healers.<br />
<br />
That argument is unworthy of you.<br />
<br />
No Warrior will play a game where Knights can tank 95% as good as Warriors and have a powerful spellbook. Given a choice between a marginally better tanking #3, 4, 5, ... Warrior and a Paladin with all their raid utility a guild would be crazy to admit Warriors.<br />
<br />
Defensive is used for tanking high DI mobs. It establishes the primary difference between Knight and Warrior tanking. Warriors are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battle. Knights are not. In order to achieve the same result (not dying) Knights require more HP's, more AC, more shielding, more healing, and more group support when they MT the hardest mobs in the game. And even then, some mobs may be beyond the ability of any Knight to MT.<br />
<br />
The %mitigation difference between Knights and Warriors vs. high DI mobs was established four years ago. Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared, duplicated by other means, or removed.<br />
<br />
It does not prevent Knights from getting experiance groups, mandatory individual flags, or having a raid role.<br />
<br />
I've always supported Knights having all the tools they need to do a superlative job add tanking in raids. I've supported some minority of raid boss mobs to be Knight preferred. What I've never supported is Knights to be replacements for raid Warrior #3, 4, 5, .... and to have spellbooks.<br />
<br />
The &quot;problem&quot; Gimmel was that much of GoD was designed for level 70 players. Interestingly enough, some very small minority of level 65 Warriors can meet such an unfair challange where run-of-the-mill Knights can not. Thank goodness an undergeared or too low level Warrior can sometimes handle a challange that is much too hard. Otherwise we'd all be staring at Fienen Ro and wondering how we were going to get into PoTime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good Lord, BB. The paladin is blatantly and significantly better geared than the warrior At that level, the paladin should have WORSE AC than the warrior, not better. If I was to parse a warrior that's significantly better geared than a Paladin, I'd probably get a difference of 15-20%, so Of COURSE the gap's going to be lesser than it would without the gear difference. Not only that, but a SEVEN MINUTE parse isn't even anywhere NEAR the sample size needed. That &quot;parse&quot; isn't worth the space it takes on up the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Talk about picking the biased arguments to support your point of view.<br />
<br />
You wanna make a REAL comparison, parse two EQUALLY geared toons. Otherwise you're just as guilty of the spew, as some PoN posters are known to do... finding blatantly flawed arguments, just because they happen to support their argument or getting tanking upgrades (or protecting the status quo, in your case).<br />
<br />
No, you're misunderstanding me. I'm talking about real equally equipped hybrids and warriors. As in, toons at the same progression level, and the same level within that guild,  <br />
<br />
Okay..... I believe this when pigs fly.<br />

<br />
Paladin has 20 shielding and 5 avoidance<br />
Warrior that's real has 22 shielding and 15 avoidance.<br />
<br />
you parse those two together I bet you'll see about 10% difference. Less if it's on mobs that don't care about ac above 1500<br />
<br />
those two are on my server, at the same progression and gear aquasition rate and in the same guild.  What was your reply?<br />
<br />
Again, you're taking your numbers from the wrong level. That level is the farmed the crap out of time level, where the difference drops quite significantly.  <br />
<br />
IE compare the best geared warrior vs best paladin, or worst warrior vs worst paladin,  <br />
<br />
i did that and you said it was the wrong level? huh?<br />
<br />
So it's not about same progression it's about only far enough in time to stack the cards in the warriors favor with you.  <br />

Daemonwynd going to call bullshit again on you.</div></div><hr />

They are still very much overpowered.  If I was in charge of recruiting I'd take a high end Knight over a Warrior any day (then again my guild also has a lot of warriors too).  The only thing that's different now is that Warriors are undisputedly better at tanking in just about any kind of situaitons, which is the way it's SUPPOSED to be.<br />
<br />
Actually, if I was making an XP group, I'd take a high end Knight over myself as tank (well maybe not, because I'd take myself, but you get the point), unless I'm going to do something that's actually quite difficult, in that case I'd try to get a Paladin (backup rez is so important for anything difficult) and a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

That's right. You keep bringing up people at the end of time (or nearly end) level, where the difference shrinks quite significantly, which is the the absolute minority of the population. <br />

<br />
But yes daemonwynd you said compare the best warrior or the best paladin and then bitch that it's no right because they are peope near the end of time (sorry they are the best paladin and best warrior on my server) and meet every piece of criteria for determining the warrior advantage but you can't do that because it would break your statisitcs you've pulled from the air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariakkas</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For three minutes? Yes. Warriors are, hands down, a better healer for 3 minutes than a paladin ever will be. Live with it. Longer fights the paladin takes precidence. Guess what, I'd rather have an EP geared cleric healing my group than a GoD geared druid. I havent heard druids whining about this disparity.<br />
<br />
first off, we're talking about raids, and while your arguement holds true, you wouldn't have druids as sole healers, you DO see druids being put into Ch rotations, and druids have 3 other very important raid roles to fall back on...and yes you do see druids bitching about it, they bitch about everything under the sun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like you have issues with your guild then, so take it to them, not us. Everyone in my guild, even the apps who dont even have ornate, get a chance to be the main assist for trash clearing.<br />
<br />
if you would have kept up with the thread, or at least bothered to go back and read my other posts before you decided to open your soup cooler, you would have known that i am referring to BB saying that i am undergeared for my guild, and thus while my guild is in GoD raiding, i must sit on the bench and watch, waiting for our next time run so i can play with the big boys . has nothing to do with my guild itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
You still have group superiority if you tank anywhere except GoD. PoP groups, LDoN groups, you still fucking have group superiority over us. Incite is not &quot;snap aggro&quot;, unless we're pulling the mobs ourselves a paladin is a better person to have in an exp group than a warrior.<br />
<br />
well im REALLY glad im of use on content that i don't use anymore, thats a real comfort at night when i go to sleep....i honestly can't believe you said that.<br />
<br />
a warrior is a superior tank vs an orc pawn, while don't we balance you guys vs orc pawns?<br />
<br />
it's not snap agro unless.....we're superior tanks unless.....you can tank anywhere you want except....are you seeing a pattern here?<br />
<br />
Paladins are not meant to tank the hardest hitting mobs.<br />
I'll repeat it for you:<br />
Paladins are not, and never were meant, to tank the hardest hitting mobs.<br />
One more time, for good measure:<br />
Paladins are not, were never meant, and most likely never WILL be meant, to tank the hardest hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
i got a mantra for you too<br />
<br />
<br />
WARRIORS AREN'T THE ONLY TANKS IN THE GAME!!!<br />
WARRIORS AREN'T THE ONLY TANKS IN THE GAME!!!<br />

<br />
Incite is not &quot;snap aggro&quot;. Its a 30second reuse PROC. It gives me an extra 600 hate ONE time for 30 seconds. Snap aggro is being able to get aggro immediately regardless of the RNG or your gear. You cast two level 9 spells and you have more aggro than incite gives us in 30 seconds. We didn't have a paladin skill &quot;whored&quot; to us, we got a skill that gives us the ability to hold aggro once we get it (if I incite before I have aggro, 9 times outta 10 I still dont get aggro. Try fucking playing a warrior for once before making outrageous claims like that)<br />
<br />
so, before incite was put in, warriors had any form of ranged agro what-so-ever? like you said, i don't play a warrior, so by all means, if you guys had one before incite, lemme know...but you see, i pay enough attention to the world beyond my nose to know, that for 5 expansions, paladins and SK's were the only tanks with ranged, on demand agro. if i push a button, i get agro...if you push a button, you get agro....<br />
<br />
<br />
You had all the POP tanking AAs. Because of these, the disparity between Knight and Warrior in POP was something like 98% HP. Sturdiness was needed to give warriors the most hp. Yes, warriors are supposed to have the most HP, and its supposed to make a difference versus mobs the warriors are fighting.<br />
<br />
WAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH PALADINS HAD ALL THE POP TANKING AA'S!!!!!!!11oneone<br />
<br />
well now everyone has all the pop tanking aa's, so we're all pretty much up shit creek without a paddle now aren't we?<br />
<br />
im sorry that paladins got a bone that you didn't get, the fact we get aotc must be like acid in your mouth, but don't worry, your aotc nerf is coming for us in omens...but like anything else having to do with a class the game can't function without, you gotta cater to thier every whim and whore out yet another knight ability..that makes 3 now by my count...ranged agro, PE, and the /shield ability that was created, designed and tuned on the paladin board.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. Just like its perfectly ok for paladins to have several useful spells for tanking AND utility, but its not ok for warriors to have a single spell in our spellbooks what-so-ever.<br />
<br />
how many times do we gotta say this...oh thats right, you didn't bother yourself enough to read the rest of this thread....we gladly said you can have all the &quot;wonderful&quot; utility you want, seriously...you guys already get more utility out of your armor than we do out of our spellbook. take more, have it all....but the second we give in, you guys realize utility ain't worth a fuck, so why would you want any of that, it would hurt your case for tanking supremecy.<br />
<br />
Go back to PoN where whining is more appreciated.<br />
<br />
this is actually a whine board , if you don't want to hear whines, don't come to this forum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WARRIORS AREN'T THE ONLY TANKS IN THE GAME!!!<br />
Where oh where did you see the word tank mentioned in any class description? Beyond the descriptions, as Brenlo pointed out:<br />
Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs.<br />
Now if you have some problem with your ability to tank, then perhaps you should look at your issues rather than intended Warrior tanking superiority.<br />
so, before incite was put in, warriors had any form of ranged agro what-so-ever?<br />
Yes, I used Crystalline Silk Nets and Swollen Fungus Beast Glands which until just before SoE commited to repairing Warrior aggro issues were vendor rechargable. Interestingly enough Wariror aggro was not an issue in raids as players maintained aggro control during raids and Knights generally could not stand up to raid boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Numerous high level Warriors in PoTime gear actually peceived no significant problem and said so. The problem really came to a head during LDoN when mobs arrived in clumps.<br />
<br />
I don't really see your point. The Warrior class Description says:<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm. (emphasis mine).<br />
<br />
Warirors sent parses, previous statements by Verant/SoE, showed the the Warrior Taunt skill cap was higher, etc. and made a case.<br />
<br />
Now kindly show me where it says Paladins should taunt better than Warriors.<br />
<br />
In the case of Knights, SoE explcitly said GoD content was mis-designed and was corrected. They have directly stated some of the GoD content was level 70. Thus Knight effectiveness in this expansion is corrected by adjusting mobs.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I fully expect Knights to get Weaponshield unless they actually test what happens when you combine the best hp buffing class, third best healing class, second best tank, only Plate Tank that can root adds, only tank that can Res, DA, GRC, and has access to stun mitigation vs. many GoD experiance mobs (it used to be more, but y'all called SoE's attention to it inadvertantly I think).<br />
<br />
However, IF SoE has tested and Weaponshield is not in the works (since you already have DA - your 100% mitigation ability) you may have to wait for your level 70 stuns to attain &quot;mitigation&quot; consistant with your historical class abilities.<br />
<br />
*****Hopefully SoE won't think to have those stuns put a stun recourse buff on the mobs so these stuns can't (as stuns always have been) be abused.*****<br />
<br />
Still, you need to give some thought that when not using Defensive a typical tank like me has 500HP's from Sturdyness, ~386HP innate advantage after AoTC, and &quot;-1 DI&quot;. My guess is that you fall a little short of the 11K HP's buffed that you could have if simularly equipped. Until you reach that point, don't expect to tank anything like me. In a game where Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and probably some Druids have a thousand or two HP's more than you unbuffed, y'all still have a ways to go.<br />
