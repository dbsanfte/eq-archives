<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SolRo is great for cash flow, but if you are not flagged BoT or Tactics are good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnome escort quest in CT and farm the Iron Cog Earring 10ac 5str 100hp. 1 balanced group of lvl65 can handle it pretty easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bot or Tactics will have upgrades for you.  Droga is decent exp and you could pick up some stuff to sell if nothing else.  LDoN is always good.  Even everfrost armor would be a major upgrade for you.  If you're looking for stuff to camp solo, go collect components for Fierce Heraldic armor and find a smith to do the combines for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ldon would be my biggest suggestion.  You can do alot of work with just Tak points.   First thing IMO would be replace the arms, bracers and shoulders.  Anything with raw hp's would be better.<br />
<br />
Also if you are interested in quests, look into:<br />
Strength of the Elements<br />
Spirit wrack coord (you will also obtain a 85 hp ring from this quest)<br />
Dain ring.<br />
<br />
You can see my magelo for any of the stats on them.  Alkazams has a nice write up on all of them.  I did all of these with 1 group or less except for final war for dain ring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ldon would be my first choice (hard and regular loot and buyables from camps) .. but you can also look into Plane of Mischief.  several named are on PH systems (can pop randomly every 30 mins).  i still wear quite a few pieces (you can see them in my magelo).<br />
<br />
feathered cloak of the prankster<br />
grand pauldrons of study<br />
tri-plated bracer thingy<br />
pearl ring of the spry<br />
jeweled ring of life<br />
<br />
lots of stuff comes out of there, and some of it is really pretty nice.  it may take you a few hours to get what you want, but every time a named pops it will drop something on its loot table guartanteed.  its not the best out there (you can buy better in the baz), but its the perfect answer for the toons on limited budjets.<br />
<br />
edit- all the named are gimp easy .. the hardest in the zone are fully slowable and hit for a max of 600 ... most of them have a max hit of 300-400 though ... so they make BoT mobs look like rambo.  i 3boxed them all with my ranger tanking ... thats how easy they are. (my ranger is a hoss though ... so /shrug)</div></div><hr />
