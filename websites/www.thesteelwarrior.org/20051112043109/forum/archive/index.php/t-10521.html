<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started buying the full Lambent set when I was lvl15.  I just thought it would be neat to collect a whole set like I had previously in EQ.  Well, it has lasted me to lvl34 and hopefully will carry me to 40, when I can wear plate.  At lvl30 I started collecting gear for when I dinged 40.  Last night I pretty much finished up all my buying, except for a mount.  Just wanted your impressions on what I have and what I might have forgot.  For RP reasons, my char can only use one sword and a crossbow (long story).  I have already modified much of the gear.<br />
<br />
Heavy Mithril (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/itemlookup.html?iname=heavy+mithril&amp;level_min=40&amp;level_max=45)  Helm, Shoulders, Breastplate (+32 kit), Gloves (+32 kit), Pants (+32 kit), Boots (+32 kit).<br />
<br />
Thorium (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/itemlookup.html?iname=Thorium&amp;level_min=45&amp;level_max=46)  Bracer (+7sta enc), Belt.<br />
<br />
Heraldic Cloak (http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=8120) (+50ac enc)<br />
<br />
Skull Splitting Crossbow (http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=13039) (+5dmg Scope)<br />
<br />
Most likely will still use the Whirlwind Sword and jewelry until I can loot better.  I was looking for some plate bracers or belt with &quot;...of power&quot;, but after a week I went with the Thorium for the high armor rating.  Comments appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Been wearing mine for close to 20 levels now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scarlet Monastery is a wonderful place to pharm in the 40s. learn how to pull the chapel (which is not hard if you're patient) and you will be a blessing to groups. Mograine drops a really awesome shield that complements a Sword of Serenity (from In the Name of the Light quest) nicely. also, Herod drops a rather good 2h axe, perfect for multiple targets at once.<br />
<br />
Razorfen Kraul has some good stuff, too. the last boss drops an Icemetal Barbute. last boss in Uldaman - you might need to be escorted by higher level guildies or friends for this - drops a 40ish DPS 2h sword.<br />
<br />
it's good that you got some Thorium for the resists and Mithril for the AC, but raw armor is not everything in groups. if you're gonna camp the AH, get Bear items. still though, I recommend you find some spots where you can pharm money and get a mount asap.</div></div><hr />

Isk's right, a mount is seriously going to change the way you play the game. Runs that I just looked at and went, &quot;Fuck that.&quot;, I run with no problems. I'm pretty sure that I've gotten more griffon points in the past 5-10 levels then the last 35 levels.</div></div><hr />
