<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not talking about in xp groups without a chanter and SoV or whatever.  I'm talking about in raid situations (majority of my play time), when I'm usually max hasted (isn't SoV or VQ 70% or something?), how important is a 41% haste item.  I ask because I'm kind of hording my DKPs for one, and really trying to obtain one, but I wonder if I should spend my points on other slot upgrades and worry about the haste later?  Am I mixed up about what max haste is?  (thought it was 100%),  or do the high end chanty hastes not max you out?  Just looking for some opinions.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good question :p, though you don't list your current haste. No haste spell currently takes you to max from 0 haste.<br />
<br />
I have an RBB, and my guild is working on popping Xana who has 2 things I need: CHSD and neck haste. I would love to hear some opinions on this.<br />
<br />
Of course I also need to get down to Droga and camp me some 1h weapons...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well... 41% haste items comes (in 99% of the cases) with nice HP and AC too.<br />
<br />
so why stick with a cloak of flames/RBB/RBG/etc which has crappy stats when you can spend DKP on a HP/AC upgrade and get haste as well.</div></div><hr />

any 32% haste item will cap ya - rbb, cof, spiked seahorse belt. <br />
<br />
the choker from poi dragon is really nice unless you got 100hp item from cazic thule, vadyn, or archlich. i would think the poi dragon and cazic thule raid force are about the same though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yelinek is the only guy i know who drops good 41 haste everytime, really its not that common. until they upgraded the poe rings, i dont think there was a good item in teir4 even. MM has a great belt, but it hardly drops everytime.<br />
<br />
kinda odd imo that one of the raex pieces didnt have haste on it, dang poe bracer is great slot for priests with the extended range = (</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yah, if you got access to VT, tvx finished ppl missing haste more than any other mob.<br />
<br />
other than that, stuff just isnt that common tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I currently use an RBB.  So with VQ, I'm maxed.  My guild does farm VT, but we haven't hit TVX in the last couple of tries for some reason.  (maybe he's not on the way to Aten Ha?  dunno, not that familiar with VT)  But really my question is, if I can bid on other items that would also benefit me, and I do need upgrades in a lot of areas, should I horde all my DKP for a 41% haste item, or should I bid on upgrades etc., and if a good haste item comes along grab it?  I know in xp groups I don't always have VQ, so maybe for that reason alone its worth it, but sometimes I don't know if I should be passing up on some really good stuff just to save up my DKP for a haste item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i would say save the dkp get the 41% haste because usually it'll have good enough stats to keep you there for a while.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Byork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are regularly raiding Vex Thall, but bypassing TVX it's still possible (although very rare) to get a Cord of Midnight off the trash mobs in the zone.<br />
<br />
Only once have I seen it but our guild did have one drop off (I believe) an Eom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Eoms can drop TVX loot randomly, not just Cord of Midnight. Gorget of Superiority and Shadow Footpads (+ living symbols, etc) can drop from them as well. But it's really quite rare, you're better off killing TVX for TVX loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks folks.  Aye, I have my eyes on all that stuff as my guild does kill those mobs when we can.  But I think I'm to the point that I'm going to go for whatever upgrades I can, and if I do have the points for good haste then I'll go for it.  I'm almost always maxed hasted on raids, and in xp groups as well.</div></div><hr />

On a side note, RBB is only 31% haste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As for elementals, Earth bracers aren't the only ones. See also the ring from Air, Sable Shoes of Flame from the Fennin Ro event, Flowing Moss Mantle from PoEarth and a weeeeeee bit harder to get, Double Woven Kelp Cord from Corinav himself.</div></div><hr />
