Look at my profile, Agnostic Halfling Warrior, level 65.  I still need to work on more HP myself, but I'm just under 5k HP unbuffed and just over 1300 AC unbuffed.  I do typically run the 150 HP / 50 AC from Tribute points, but that isn't reflected in my profile, since it's still technically a buff (it can wear out, when you're out of points).<br />
<br />
Under my alternate profiles, you'll find a Bazaar-upgrade...but don't expect 60K to take you very far unfortunately.  I'm currently in the unfortunate boat of having most of my upgrades costing 50k - 300k.<br />
<br />
A suggestion might be to get a pair of bloodmetal earrings and a pair of valorium rings of gallantry, if you don't have them already.  These will give a noticable bump in HP for most people.</div></div><hr />

What server are you on?  On Luclin it seems BoT is full all the time these days and ornate prices are dropping like crazy.  Gauntlets used to sell for 50k and I've been seeing them go for as low as 15k for the mold in the bazaar.   This sucks cause I have some ornate on my trader !! Curse this market !  /Grin<br />
<br />
I'm agnostic so I've gone the ornate path for my gear, since the GM's refused me when I asked them if I could &quot; find religion &quot; so to speak when I was in my 50's.   It's really hard to beat the AC and HP from cultural.<br />

I'm in the same boat as you and I hate it! :mad: <br />

Here is my magelo if you want any other ideas:<br />

I had been waiting for this to happen for months, only now that it's happened I'm already in EP gear :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3k HP, 1k AC @ level 55 ... <br />
<br />
I'd say you're pretty much on par for that level without looking at your actual gear.  Expect to hit 65 around 4k hp (with no aa), most of this HP will come from the HP bonus per level til 65.  Once at 65, nd3 will add 400+ HP.  I'd also expect more AC bumps due to skill ups and item drops during the course of normal adventuring.<br />
<br />
Without looking at you're gear, I can't really make better suggestions, but as someone mentioned above, there is a &quot;cultural-lite&quot; armor set that can be made.  In your case, it'll be similar to the brell cultural armor, with lesser stats...I can't recall the name of the armor atm.</div></div><hr />

Probably because half the server is flagged for SolRo. I usually wake up about 4:30 am est and clear out the named in BoT with my 3box combo. Only usually us 3 in there.</div></div><hr />

One question I have is are you in a guild? What level of raiding do they do if you are?</div></div><hr />
