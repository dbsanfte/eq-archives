<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kujawa Zek</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, my name is Kujawa. I play a 59 warrior on saryrn server. After switching around I have come back to my warrior. I have gotten him some gear, but still missing some slots. I have about 710k left to re-equip him with. Was thinking maybe a BoC for main-hand, Black Plated Collar for Necklace, Stonewood Compound Bow for range (when I hit 61), and Fierce Heraldic Vambraces for arms. <br />
<br />
I am in a mid sized family guild. We do PoI dragon (like 5th if that in line for Xana Hammer). We are in the NtoV rotation, and we do Nadox Inny, Korusk (that chardok b boss), and some other mobs. We are just starting to get into BoT named. Thanks for any suggestions. Here is my magelo, http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=429857 .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would shoot for the following:<br />
Blade of Carnage<br />
Great Blade of Storms (better than PoI hammer and more common)<br />
Xenamech haste neck<br />
Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
2x Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience<br />
either LDoN BP or Ornate BP<br />
Helm of RZ<br />
I would also try to get either a pair of Crystallized Acid Bracers or a Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet<br />
<br />
That should set you up for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kujawa Zek</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am back. My magelo is up-dated. I have about 250k left. I left my old guild for a guild almost exactly on par with it, except they use dkp, and raid BoT more. There are only like 4 warriors, one being the guild leader, and 2 other that don't seem to log on often. Would it be in my best interest to just get the CHSD for very low dkp (I may be the only warrior on raid without one), or earn up some dkp and get a GBoS (alot of rangers and rogues will be putting up some DKP for it).  Also currently running without a haste item at the moment, no compliants, and I see very little change from when I was using my 34% haste belt, but I am not parsing anything. Is it worth it to drop 50k on a Cloak of Flame, or just wait, and earn up some DKP for a raid haste item? <br />
<br />
Currently no luck on bracer up-grades (Only acid bracer was 200k, and Mana-Threaded is even higher &gt;&lt;). Any information would be appericiated. And, what should i save up for in LDoN? Guild leader uses a BoC and CHSD, and uses a 150dd and like 100 or 125dd on them, said argo was extremely easy to hold, should I do the same or work for Anger 3 proc for my BoC? Kinda like the yak procs because of stun + dd, but no one ever wants to do LDoN guk. Thanks alot !<br />

<br />
I would advice you to get the following upgrades from the Bazaar:<br />
<br />
Amygdalan's Chain Mask<br />
Ritual Talisman of Fate<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (use this till you get either CHSD or GBOS)<br />
Cloak of Flames (no haste is a joke)<br />
Ornate BreastPlate<br />
<br />
My guess is that this will run you 300-350k depending on your servers prices (you can camp neck and hammer easily with 2 friends to save some pp).<br />
<br />
Get anger aug for BoC, if you find anger3 too expensive get anger2 - it's nice as well. When you get a new 1hander anger aug that as well. Get a 2hander for DPS situations - WMBS comes to mind or Greatstaff of the 4 winds that drops off Auflife Chaoswind in BoT Tower (he can drop Ornate BP as well).<br />

<br />
I'd upgrade BoC to anger 3; no long term reason to anything halfway with a tool like that.</div></div><hr />
