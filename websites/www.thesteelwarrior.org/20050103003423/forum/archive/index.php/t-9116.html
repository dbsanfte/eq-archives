Crazy objectives/things you have to do, fun stuff though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jadesii</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't bought it yet, so I can not really form an informed opinion. However, what I have seen so far is at the very least, intriguing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">from the first glance, OoW doesn't seems to follow GoD, as the lore pretends, but rather stays before in game progression. But since its much easer to play within I will just forget about it and say it's an OK expension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was getting pretty bored of EQ, even playing my friends bst sometimes.  OoW has brought the fun back to the game.  It has new spots I can go to xp and nice loot drops.  I think its a pretty good expansion.  I also like the only 1 zone is a flag zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkgecko</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I'm pretty happy with it.  It offers alot of content to the majority of players who didnt get much from GoD.  Someone posted that they like how zones aren't flagged, I would prefer it the other way tbh.  But I can see the point, it's just aggrivating to have asshats chattering away in ooc, or training zonelines that make no sense, which wouldn't normally happen in yxxta/qvic etc.  Hell, even KT has become idiotland now that vxed/tipt have been made easier.<br />
<br />
The raid events in MPG...pretty damn fun.  Some of them need some more tuning, but they put alot of thought into these, and it shows.  The one group events seem easier then they should be for the loot that you get, but I suppose we're a bit overgeared for them.<br />
<br />
Only having one flagged zone, that doesn't appear to be hard to get flagged for, may end up boring the top guilds, we'll see when we get there I guess.  Should be pretty soon ;)  God knows it can't be worse then tacvi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My issue is with the lag and the xp per mob...the former being ridiculously high, and the latter being too low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sad to say, I miss flagged/keyed zones already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sukrn</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Content wise, OoW is great, fun wise, OoW is great.  However running two clients at the same time is causing some people to blue screen in addition to extreme lag.  <br />
<br />
Time for an upgrade I guess :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the majority of oow is great due to the fact of the summit basically, they scraped it all after and redid it more throughouly, nothing seems buggy, nothing seems crashing zones, maybe a virtual memory error now and then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't own it either....but ( unlike GoD ) ... I want to purchase this expansion solely on what people's feedback is about it. I figure on that idea alone it was worth a comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't fought there much, but I have a few friends who have and I only hear good things from them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I like it.fun zone's well thought out for camp for single groups(one group pu's).reminds me of the older expasions.dont have to be uber or in one of the top 5 guild to get good loot and a good time.train's have away's been and part of this game.CB at level 70 least it's not boring. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geeta</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the expansion its self the trials have been a blast really only 2 things i dont like.<br />
( 1) being the excessive lag, part of it may be on my side however i do not have any problems anywhere in the game but about 3 zones in oow.<br />
(2) i wish there were a little more requirements for some of the zones maybe make MPG level restricted to 67+ and the group trials act as a key for riftseekers keep the raid trials for anguish.  as for  WOS god its become  KCv2.0 i play on FV server so i can only imagine how crowded it is for you guys on the blue servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grunmore</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OoW raid content so far is pretty fun. Trials i like because they are quick and cut and dry. You win or you dont, no maybes. The grouping i am quite disappointed in. The grouping content sucks, there is no organized spawns anywhere that i can find, and the mobs are so spread out. Also the xp per mob is pretty good, but it takes time to kill each one, and get to the next one so overall for the time spent it is not that good. Another thing, no keys/flags = trains all over the place. Bad idea to make all the zones open to everyone.</div></div><hr />
