<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Troyhill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I just had an idea that might help our situation.  I’m an lvl 54 Warrior on Kane Bayle. We engage a mob and then a enchanter cast a slow or a debuff of some kind and the MOB without a second thought goes over to hit the enchanter with no consequences. That is what kind of ticks me off is the fact that a mob can disengage me with out having to pay a price for turning his back on me in a fight. There should be some kind of penalty to a mob that is engaged with a warrior and turns his back on him. Yea I know that a mob has less ac on his backside but the mob is not paying any serious consequences for turning his back on us to go beat on another group member. Maybe if warriors got a free Backstab for good damage along the lines of a Crit and the potential for some truly serious damage along the lines of a rouge Back Stab ability to make the mob think twice about turning his back on us when we have it engaged. This would be in addition to our normal Offensive output.  Of course we could not do this at will but after we have established agro and then if a mob decides to leave our melee rang the ability should take effect. This ability would work like an extra taunt in the fact that If we lose agro to a pure caster we would have a chance to get it back from damage and if that did not work then we could fall back on our ability to taunt.</div></div><hr />

How do you explain us being able to hit a mob OUT of melee range?<br />
<br />
Good idea but like most there are flaws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Troyhill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I’m not sure what the problem would be if there was more than one Warrior in a group or how there would be a negative impact on raids.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that we can hit a mob out of melee range. What I had in mind was once a warrior has established agro and the Mob has targeted him/her that the Mob should not be able to disengage the warrior with out consequence. So if a Mob should decide to go after a caster who is out of melee range that the Warrior with whom the mob is engaged should get a backstab/free attack as the mob disengages the Warrior to go after the caster. The backstab/free attack should be able to do some potentially high damage along the lines of a Rough backstab ability to give the warrior a chance to reclaim agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not give any damage, as for that would be taking a role away from rogues.<br />
<br />
But it would be nice to have a nice high Aggro taking ability from the backside... <br />
<br />
What scares me, is people are gonna start bringing out the &quot;Wedgie&quot;! skill name ideas :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it doesn't matter about any of that stuff baadan. it just means if your a warrior with aggro and somebody else. anyone got aggro you got a free hit or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When are you guys going to get it?! SONY DOESN'T CARE HOW BROKEN WARRIORS ARE!!! Move to a new game, dumb your stuff (like I did) and get ready for WoW. Sony is just counting the cash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or the many variations of &quot;kick to the balls&quot; bleh<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, I have this great new agro idea for a warrior I'm going to call it &quot;Groin Snap&quot;<br />
<br />
Can you imagine... <br />
<br />
Cleric tells the group: Binn use that groin snap ability of yours!<br />
Binnamar tells the group: Hell no, you wanna reach in there!? :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
hehe</div></div><hr />

Only thing is.. Everquest is flawed..<br />
<br />
When I cast if there is a little tiny hill in the way, i get 'You cannot See your Target&quot; even though I can.. And when I run a round the corner, mobs can still cast on me.<br />
<br />
Or if  a mob rampages, they can hit you even a mile away in some zones.<br />
<br />
Or, if mob over 50 it can summon...</div></div><hr />
