<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone point out what this was? So far as I have seen (looking through the EQ &quot;official&quot; forums and unofficial ones) it seems like all they did was review the past changes (Revamp Round 1?) and add END to items. Was adding END considered &quot;Revamp Round 2&quot;?<br />
<br />
I am still holding out hope that the END additions are only partially done, since it seems very random on which items had END added.<br />
<br />
Has anyone found an official response to this? or perhaps a thread I missed discussing it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any calm and rational replies that are not insulting and/or rude :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it'd be nice if we HAD something we could use OFTEN, the extra endur is useless because there is not much good to blow it on unless a named is up or we are raiding, maybe some berserker like skills? (in the way they function)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It appears part 2 was only adding end to items.  Lets hope part 3 comes.  Though, before getting angry at them, would you prefer that they held back end on items until they had the rest done, or got it early?  So as long as part 3 doesn't take as too long, it will be fine imo.<br />
<br />
As for it being random which items got end, there are a few items which I think they overlooked, but most of it made sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but there isnt even any vapor about a part 3</div></div><hr />
