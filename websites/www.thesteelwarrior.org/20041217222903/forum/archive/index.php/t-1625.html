<br />
The worst RvR event i the whole game is clearly Xegony.<br />
35 minutes SCing and prepping, and then 45 minutes of a fight full of bugs that you can loose if a lag spike hits your guild or the RNG is bitchy for the worse ele god loot there is.<br />
Give me Sigi instead of Xeg any time of the day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An hour to Summon corpse, 45 minutes to kill and 15 minutes to deal with loot, etc in order to get 2 monk/bst weapons tops my list.  Even worse is that you usually need 50+ to do this encounter, making your loot per hour per person ratio a big nothx.<br />
<br />
Xegony:  .02 loots/manhour.<br />
<br />
Compare to Fennin:  .07 loots/manhour<br />
Compare to Coirnav:  .05 loots/manhour<br />
Compare to Rathe:  .01 loots/manhour<br />
<br />
Why doesn't Rathe top my list?  Because Xegony is much much more boring and is honestly easier to fail these days.  You have a failure on Xegony and watch that loot ratio fall farther and farther...<br />
<br />
Funny thing is Plane of Time.  Phase 1 is ungodly good rvr, watching 5 people get very decent loots in the space of 45 minutes-1 hour.  Better still is the fact that you can do this with 36 people.  <br />
Stage 1:  .13 loots/manhour<br />
Stage 2:  .06 loots/manhour<br />
Stage 3:  .06 loots/manhour<br />
<br />
Would be really nice to see the Rathe and Xegony drop more loot to bring them in line with Coirnav and Fennin.  Perhaps guaranteed legs/essence would make some sense for these gods.</div></div><hr />

Factor in script bugs (now less common) and all the time it took most of us to learn the event and we're at somewhere around .01 loot per man/hour.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kildace</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Rathe better because it is not a fight based on pure luck.<br />
You have the same SC than to get to Xeg, you need more people, but when you fail rathe, you fail rathe for a reason, not because of a lag spike.<br />
<br />
And loot off rathe is far less disapointing than the couple monk weapons Xegony usually spits out.</div></div><hr />

Could also put random elemental pieces on the 5 6 bosses that come with each xegony wave really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta go with Xegony/Rathe. They should change the Rathe encounter so that the timer starts when you kill the first councilman, but they don't repop if you exceed the time limit. Then they could put random loot on them without fear of farmage. The various bosses in the Xegony encounter should also drop random loot. The pain in the ass both of these encounters are hardly justify 2 pieces of loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a classic example of overcompensation... they keep doing this. First they did it with underpwoered rangers, then they did it with underpowered casters, now they're doing it by overcompensating in loot drops. That's just from what I can remember they overcompensated with, there's probably other examples.<br />
<br />
They realized they put far too much loot in Vex Thal, so they put far too LITTLE loot in PoP as overcompensation.<br />
<br />
Wonder if they'll ever learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And Plane of Time isn't dropping loot like VT was?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. <br />
<br />
VT mobs drop half again the loot per mob, which is par for the course: SoL, 3 loots per mob, PoP, 2 loots per mob.<br />
<br />
My guild obviously isn't in Time, so I can't comment on how many named type there are and how often they are come across, but I don't think Time will ever come anywhere near the 30+ loots in 8 hours of VT... even accounting for mudflation.<br />
<br />
Course, anyone with Time experience... feel free to step forward and correct me on this.</div></div><hr />

100 or so loots in 15 raids, including learning raids and fighting through lootless PHs.  Those 15 raids equate to about 3-4 hours each.  <br />
<br />
In a fully popped Plane of Time (which occurs every 3 days), you can spend 1 hour getting the first 5 loots, another hour getting 3 more loots, another hour getting 4-8 loots.  The first 3 stages take one hour each and give you 12-16 loots.  The next 4 gods will give you 2 loots each for a total of 20-24 loots in 7 hours in Time.  Given the fact that you can do this twice as often as VT, you are looking at 40-48 loots per week spent in Time, compared to 30 in VT.<br />
<br />
VT what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time is a loot playground. Maybe less loot per mob, but WAY more mobs in a week than VT.<br />
<br />
2x a day you can get 5x tier 1 loots<br />
every 3 days you can get 3-4 tier 2 loots<br />
every 3 days you can get 3-4 tier 3 loots<br />
every 3 days you can get 8 tier 4 loots<br />
every 3 days you can get 8 tier 5 loots<br />
<br />
I would imagine most guilds do tier 1-3, then come back the next day for tier 1 and 4, then next day for tier 1 and 5. You can do this cycle 2 times a week. Each cycle is good for 30-40 loots or 60-80 in a week.<br />
<br />
You do have to consider that after a few weeks most tier 1 drops will start to rot. Even with a large % of those items rotting, you can pick up 40+ loots from tier 2-5 every week. Getting 2-3 tier 1 loots during off hours is pretty easy as well if you have people who can use the items.</div></div><hr />

Or the event in it's whole? :p<br />
<br />
We were about to finish the event, didnt notice the time though, and the last Archwalker depopped.<br />
<br />
So next time we're there we'll finish it, but we've yet to experience Sigismund himself :p<br />
Hoping he's not the reason for all this hate vs the event ;)<br />
Would annoy me a bit if we'de have to do the event 2-3 more times to learn the sigismund fight :eek:</div></div><hr />

The one time we did the event with a full raid force we won. Haven't tried with more than 40ish since=/ But got Sigi unexpected and still won that 1st time. Though it was fairly close. I think if we could get more than 5 clerics on at a time it would be a lot easier=P</div></div><hr />
