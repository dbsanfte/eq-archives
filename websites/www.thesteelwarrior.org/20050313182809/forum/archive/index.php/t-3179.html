I don't want to hear things such as ohhh, I bet it will do great! It has hate, dd, and stun! I want to hear facts, facts, and more facts on how well it holds aggro, the dps you dish out, do you favor it, is it worth a month's raiding to get?? We've killed RZ in time like 7 times or more, and have yet to see one drop. Only reply if you have personal experience.... thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />

I tanked Quarm twice successfully! One was for 7min, other was for 3-4 min.. Can you say the same??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have a darkblade, i dont want a darkblade.  That said, the tanks that have it in my guild seem to have slight initial aggro problems, mobs turning during the first 20 seconds, etc.  But once they are locked in, they are fine.  If you can get a Blade of War, that would be the route to go IMO.  Blade of War DPS compensates during the opening 20 seconds while you pump out a couple procs, etc and get mobs solidly on you.  <br />
<br />
Thats just my opinion.  Warriors in my guild like it a lot, i think if you had a blade of war to open a fight and switched to a darkblade + whatever you would be absolutely fine.  However that is a luxury that might not be possible.  I saw your magelo and you wield ED and a BoC, if a Blade of War is not an option, then go for a DBW, its better then a BoC in terms of proc rate im sure, because BoC proc rate is horrific.  2 Slow weapons may hurt your initial aggro, but if your guild is careful you should be fine.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone with a darkblade can add more to what your asking, but since no one has yet i figured id throw in my 2 cents :P</div></div><hr />

Other than that ! MT has darkblade and likes it but it doesn't sound really great for the class only weapon :(</div></div><hr />

This is not the &quot;I am the baddest Warrior there is, Thread, damnit! I don't give a crap about that, I just wanna have fun... I guess those cruel comments don't see this game that way. Besides, how do you know I didn't ask for some fellow guild members? OMG, maybe they're too busy and I wanted to be nice and dig a little deeper into this weapon....<br />
<br />
Anyways, yea, Quarm is luck mixed with teamwork.... if it's all about clerics, then a ranger can tank Quarm right?? Orrr a wizzy! Blade of war is not an option, since we will probably never kill RZ in Tactics again. These questions I posted is both for me and my fellow warrior guildmates.<br />

All those comments from Chatja ogre, which had nothing to do with this thread here finally forced me to go look up how to ignore a person. <br />
<br />
UserCp -&gt; Edit Ignore List -&gt; <br />
<br />
Should have done it a long time ago. Now all the ignored posts only show up as a note, which you can click on to read the real post.<br />
<br />
I can only recommend it, if there is someone you don't want to listen to !!<br />

<br />
If you get BoW to avoid ripostes, then DBoW wont be worth it, but it is better aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Chatja ogre <br />
Augmented DBoW will be as strong as augmented BoW.  <br />
<br />
BoW is pre-Time, so has a Type4 aug slot. This accepts the 125dd +0.0sec stun aug for 760 points from Guk.<br />
<br />
DBoW is a PoTime weapon, so has a Type8 slot. No type8 augs have been discovered yet on any live server to my knowledge. <br />
<br />
If/when they do drop, they'll be from 3 hour adventures and harder to obtain than the Darkblade itself. They'll also be rarer because the loot table in the few high level hard LDoN events will undoubtably be larger than Rallos Zek's table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you agree they can both be augmented? Good! :P<br />
<br />
You can upgrade both weapons (Not directly with the same aug tho)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't compare the aggro of DBoW to a BoW but I can compare it to a Vanazir. As far as AA goes, I have Punishing Blade 3 but I don't have Ambidexterity yet so using a two hander nets me a slight AA advantage. My offhand weapon isn't that hot either.<br />
<br />
Here are the two different weapons sets that I use:<br />
<br />
Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair - 100dd/27AC debuff  <br />
DMG: 60 DLY: 38 DPS: 31.84 <br />
Symbol of the Planemasters - 75dd/Stun 0.0 Sec/65<br />
<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord - 100dd/Stun 0.0 Sec/65 and 650 Hate<br />
DMG: 38 DLY: 35 DPS: 22 <br />
Symbol of the Planemasters - 75dd/Stun 0.0 Sec/65<br />
The Rotting Fist - 40dd/24 per tick dot <br />
DMG: 16 DLY: 20 DPS: 16.5 Magic DMG Disease: 1 <br />
and I add a the following augment:<br />
Silver-Flecked Crystal of Agony - Rujarkian Bile - 125dd<br />
<br />
From my parses the last few days, the two hand setup is beating out the dual wield by about 20dps on average. Dual wield is usually 130ish and Vanazir is +150ish. Parses are over around 3 million total damage and coming from raids and xp situations. Maybe the dual wield will go up once I get Ambidexterity and a better offhand down the road.<br />
<br />
I seem to proc and flurry a hell of a lot more with dual wield, but its 4 potential procs compared to 2 atm and more swings. Who knows, maybe it will be 5 procs to 3 after some Type 8 augments are discovered.<br />
<br />
From a aggro stand point. I just really can't say one way or the other. I don't have aggro problems with either set up really. I still have a long way to go in making a decision on this. I'm the second warrior in my guild to get a Darkblade and I've heard some of the wizards in the guild say that they can nuke more when someone is tanking with a Darkblade. So maybe the aggro over the long haul is better. <br />
<br />
Stats are obviously better using two weapons over over one, but I really don't think the states gained negate the slight increase in riposte damage. So I'm leaning towards sticking with the Vanazir for tanking hard hitting Gods for now and using the Darkblade setup for the trials and clearing trash mobs.<br />
<br />
I would say go with whatever you’re lucky enough to get and deal with that. BoW, DBoW, SEWS, Vanazir are all sweet weapons. I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting...  I think getting Ambidex and a good offhand like EoE would likely remove that 20 DPS gap there and make them about even...<br />
<br />
Dual wield (with a slow 1h like DBotW) is getting a lot more tempting the more I research...</div></div><hr />

So you agree they can both be augmented? Good! :P<br />
<br />
You can upgrade both weapons (Not directly with the same aug tho)  <br />
<br />
Sure, but if you can aug the Darkblade with a hypothetical aug, I'm gonna aug BoW with a hypothetical 'make it into a 1h offhander' aug. <br />
<br />
Show me any aug on a live server that works on Darkblade, and you may have a point, but until then, there's no proof any even made it off the test server.</div></div><hr />

Ive seen warriors using a Darkblade, even using the supposed &quot;dream&quot; DBW + EOE combo, -----LOSE-----, yes l o s e, initial aggro time and time again.  <br />
<br />
The extra hp, and the extra damage via DD's are NOT worth the raid wiping because you cant hold a mob on ya.  We have 7 Blades of War in my guild, no one ever loses initial aggro wielding it.  Last time i checked our job is to tank, and you could have 300,000 hp, but if you cant hold aggro, your not doing your job.  Id take the ability to hold aggro over the 200`ish extra hp from the DBW + EOE combo anyday.  Especially when its so easy to stay on par hp wise via upgrades other then weapon slots.</div></div><hr />

You dont have to rely on your weapons initial dps to get it.   The only time ive seen a warrior lose aggro is either special circumstances or during a poor tank switch, this includes the Blade of War.  In which either case 9 times out of 10 the warrior is relying on something other than his weapon to get that initial aggro.  Our main tank uses a bloodfrenzy + aegis with 0 problems aggro wise.<br />
<br />
I guess if your contesting whats better for initial aggro with nothing else included (this means no ae taunt or gimmicks), then I would have to go for the Blade of War as the winner.  But if your looking for the overall better setup, for both raiding and grouping, the Darkblade + EoE combo has no contestation.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Personally, I choose to rely on the cheap gimmicks that are available and keep my ac/hp as high as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only real reason to do BoW -) DBoW+EoE are the HP/AC.<br />
(I'm not too concerned with DPS, while long term agro is nice<br />
BoW is more than sufficient for that task if you ask me)<br />
<br />
Which leads to another question.<br />
<br />
DBoW+EoE = 65ac 405hp for 2 loots.<br />
Compare that to 50ac 175hp for 0 loots (i have a BoW)<br />
<br />
So with 2 loots you gain 15ac 230hp.<br />
<br />
Suppose you could win almost the same stats asking 2 other time<br />
loots, would you do it ?</div></div><hr />

It's a nice setup, aggro with it after 1 minutes is very hard to shake.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't take it over my Ykesha BoW. I have better initial aggro, I have less stats but I take half as much ripostes, so it evens out imo, my dps is a tad worse but hey, doesn't matter that much to me. I'll take the initial aggro over dps any day.</div></div><hr />

I have not kept up to date on the new augs/mods but it would seem to me that a type 1 aug fits in all slot types, and a type 8 slot accepts all aug types...correct me if I am off on that or just restating what is already known, but that seems to be the way it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK. You are off on that.<br />
<br />
Type 8 accepts type 8 augs or type all augs only.<br />
<br />
The only confusing part is that type all and type 1 seem to mean the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Type:All<br />
This is on augments. This means you can put the augment on any item with a free augment slot, irrespective of type<br />
<br />
Type:1<br />
This is on items. This means you can only fit Type:1 or Type:all augments into this slot. Since there are no Type:1 augments, this effectively means you can only fit Type:All augments into items with Type:1 only slots.</div></div><hr />

I've tried to use it in groups and on raids but I really don't enjoy chasing mobs all over hell as they ping pong from debuff to healers.  Maybe with an augment it will add just enough to make it a viable choice but in its current state its worthless to a bow user. <br />
<br />
The enchanter I group with about 50 hours a week and I have played with different combinations and you can get it to work but not as well as a bow.  If your in POTime without a  shot at a bow or a 2h from TT by all means get this weapon.  <br />
<br />
It seems to me that the Anger proc is buged.  Example: I proc Anger 3 times rapidly and a pally in my group proced PiousMightEffect and the mob turns to the pally.  I should have had 1950 hate from just the increase hate effect and 3x stun +300hp dd should have had him stuck to me like glue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Brutall completely.<br />
<br />
The darkblade has three major problems:<br />
<br />
- Before-first-proc aggro sucks.  Two augments won't totaly fix this either.  Wizards LOVE you when you get unlucky and don't proc for a good 30+ seconds on gods...  Meanwhile my BoW aggro seems very consistant.<br />
<br />
- Anger seems less aggro than EB.<br />
<br />
- Twice the ripostes using this weapon, along with NEEDING a good offhand to make it viable at all.<br />
<br />
Its not a totaly useless weapon.  Considering how proc based it is, sometimes you get get lucky with procs and aggro the shit out of mobs.  Problem is, you gamble with your aggro using one.  I will most likey end up starting fights using a BoW, then switch to dual wield after I proc EB, but ONLY after I get an EoE and two type 4 augs for both my EoE and darkblade.  Until then, its BoW 100%.<br />
<br />
The fact that I am wielding a weapon from a tier 3 plane over our time weapon doesn't sit well with me.</div></div><hr />

I assume you're using a ranger in conjunction with that ae taunt for boost agro? Otherwise you're not gaining anything at all from blowing your taunt.</div></div><hr />
