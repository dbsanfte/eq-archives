<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Welp, I've decided to bypass NToV and just move the guild to Ssra. Why? I have no idea.<br />
<br />
Hell, I don't even know anything much about the zone. Maybe offer an alternative to the hell that seems to be Ssra...<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me the why and who and how of this place?<br />
<br />
No, don't need stats n' stuff like that, but what should I be doing in here.<br />
<br />
Just camp stuff?<br />

<br />
...it's<br />
<br />
all...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Prepare to get bored then get even MORE bored.  Oh and guess what you will even get so bored you might fall asleep I did it once :rolleyes:  I love the zone just hate camping Emp Pieces it is SO BORING because it seems the 1st and 2nd floor Commanders are so damn rare.  The mobs on the 3rd floor have an assload of HP.  That'a about all when you go to get your green metal bring some AE'ers they will have lots of fun. <br />
<br />
Of course you should keep an eye out for any named there as their loot would probably be an upgrade to almost everyone if you are just starting out.  I don't know about Ssra status on your server but on mine usually the Asian guilds get to kill all the named :mad: If your doing Ssra to work towards VT eventually I wish you luck I know some people who quit just because of how god awful boring and rare some pieces/mobs can be.  That's about all the info I can think of off-hand have fun in Ssra :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, luckily most of the big guilds have finished with SSra and are into the EP's now. Now it's just us bottom feeders fighting for ssra. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Janus_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree wholeheartedly with Greyslayer.  Ssra is the end-all, be-all of boring zones.  Hours upon hours upon hours fighting snakes over and over again.  And they don't even sound like snakes. They sound like ducks.  Camping my emp key and vex thal parts in luclin just about burned me out... And I'm dead serious about this. No one I've ever talked to that has spent more than a few months farming stuff (named, keys, what have you) in this zone even remotely enjoys it anymore.<br />
<br />
But anyway, the main stuff to go for in the zone is uhm..<br />
<br />
Cursed cycle<br />
Rhag cycle<br />
Creator<br />
High Priest<br />
Emp key farming --&gt; Blood/Emp<br />
<br />
Difficulty?<br />
<br />
I'd say Rhags are the easiest, followed by creator, followed by cursed cycle, high priest, emp.<br />
<br />
I have sorta limited experience in here though, so I don't know if I'm correct on that order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ellisand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the Asian guilds get to kill all the named <br />
<br />
 I feel your pain :(<br />
<br />
 Ssra is indeed a boring zone, but personally I think its breaking you in for the boredom of VT clearing.<br />
<br />
 Ssra has some very nice upgrades (hategiver, bloodfrenzy for tanks i particular) if your just moving into ssra though I'd sugest you look into doing some groundwork for seru (keys/banes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're serious about doing Emp you're entire guild is going to have to LIVE in Ssra for about 2 weeks getting keyed up.  Thank God we are pretty much done with keying most of the people that raid often...48 keys in 2 weeks, ugggh.  You'll need to spend hours at the comms camps and then do miniraids for the Insignia's (our last insig raid was 10 hours) then spend more painful hours back at the comms occationally shuffling people to the TMs when they pop for pouches.<br />
If you put in the time you will get keyed but its not easy.  The trick is also getting the people who get keyed to stay and help the people that arent yet. Its not always easy.<br />
My best advice is if you're serious about the Ssra to VT rout, then bite the bullet and get keyed up.  It will never happen if you dabble.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
Also, here's a nice little guide to Ssra:Ssra Guide (http://pub149.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm11.showMessage?topicID=1743.topic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Even our local EP guilds and a time enabled guild return occasionally to Ssra to equip apps or get EB weapons for their warriors.<br />
Ssra was and is the bottleneck in Luclin.<br />
Skipping NToV completely might not be a bad idea especially if you have farmed BoT towers or done other luclin mobs like Grieg or AR nameds.</div></div><hr />

How does this differ from killing drake after drake in North? :)  At least with SSRA u can get 1 group in their farming necessary pieces for AL, Creator, Emp, etc keys while waiting for them to PoP.  Granted SSRA is boring, but its definately a nice change from ntov.  Farm Rhag 1 (with 2 groups) 1st and foremost....  get your priest classes GRC, you will need this...trust me.  He's on a 3day timer if im not mistaken.  Then try Rhag 2 (3 groups), he'd have some decent upgrades for you.  Then once you have 1 key to AL, take him down.  You need a full raid force, we've done him with 21 but thats not the norm.  Other than him rampaging like a mad man, hes pretty gimp.....expect a good 10-20min fight depending on your guilds dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so you want the why, the who, and the how. ok.<br />
<br />
why?<br />
gear up, key up for emp, get VT-ready.<br />
<br />
who?<br />
any snake that moves, preferrably named with ph4t l3wtz!<br />
<br />
how?<br />
i'd go look but i'm short on time, but think there has been a few &quot;how to kill snake_01&quot; posts here.<br />
you can block some of the AE stuff with a cha buff but i forget which mob it was on...<br />
geometry blocks AE too iirc<br />
<br />
good luck getting through that zone as fast as possible, it really burns people out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bractos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">after the Rhags,  the Archlich is probably the easiest mob in there and drops some really nice gear.   Takes a key to get into his room though, drops off comm 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We've been capable of killing alot of Ssra for months now, including LtK, Rhag1 and 2 and the first 2 in the cursed cycle.  So far we've managed to get exactly none of them because they are so heavily camped.  The worst thing about Ssra is that guilds actually have to kill Mobs they don't need in the least to get to the ones they do (i.e. Rhag 1 and 2).  I really hate spawn chains.</div></div><hr />
