<br />
I look at the stats of Fierce Heraldic Plate compared to Brellium Plate (the best an agnostic dwarf can wear that is crafted) and the other is so much better HP and stat wise with similar AC.<br />
<br />
So is there a reason the dorf's (I don't remember being able to even pick Rallos Zek) got a bit gipped on armor in that regard?<br />
<br />
Is it because we have some other aspect to us that is better?  Or is there a whole armor type for dorfs that is crafted and better?<br />
<br />
I bought brellium greaves, boots, and pauldrons yesterday (for like 8k, 7k, and 7k respectively) but just is a bit frustrating ;)<br />
<br />
*b1tching off*<br />
<br />
I suppose time to start focusing on questable armor now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening and if I've missed something, please tell me.</div></div><hr />

No point in going thru this again when you can just read the massive arguments we've already had over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the roleplaying reason why the dwarfs can't worship RZ is because Rallos is the god of the Ogres and he in fact created the Ogre race.  Dwarfs and Ogres are racial enemies so no self respecting dwarf would worship Rallos Zek as his god.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way I love my dorf, was just wondering.<br />
<br />
I realize ogre's make better warriors somehow, but in the end it doesn't matter much.<br />
<br />
And beards rule.</div></div><hr />
