<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question about mobs that require a bane weapon to damage like Lord Inq or SSRA Emp. Is it better to tank with normal agro weapons (like BOC and CHSD) for their agro procs but no damage or is it better to get bane weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use your aggro weapons.  Your aggro will suck with bane weapons and it's much more important to hold aggro than do damage.  It feels weird to stand there not hitting anything, but it's definitely the way to go unless it's a small group where your DPS actually matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Weapon agro works by swings, not by actual contact.  While, for instance, a Blade of War will do absolutely no damage to both Seru and Emp, the agro will be 100% identical to what it would be on, say, your average HoH exp mob.  I tanked Emp Ssra the last time my guild killed him with my auged Blade of War.  Agro was so good, in fact, that he simply summoned me back the moment he casted &quot;Rage of Ssraeshza&quot; on me, as we were killing him in the center.<br />
<br />
Bane weapons are crap for tanking, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i Have tanked Emp and Seru multiple times using Bane weapons.<br />
As long as your guild is careful about getting agro from you the DPS you generate is suffient to hold agro on these mobs and the Damage you do does add up.<br />
You can go either route.<br />
My opinion is if your guild needs you for the dps then use banes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trust me I know how agro works with the potential damage and not actually damage. But I was concerned that because it is not a bane weapon that the potential damage would be reduced to nothing which would mean that the only agro is from procs and incite. I also have no proof of it but I swear that ever mob or at least mobs from one place to the next have agro modifiers in different ways. I still believe that some mobs hate certain things more than others. Like some mobs hate being slowed more than others so the agro produced by slow is greater then normal mobs. I have no proof or no test of this but it just really seems like that at times. Anyway that being said I thought maybe these mobs since they can not be hurt other than by bane damage that they might hate bane damage alot causing the bane damage to generate more agro than an a ordinary weapon on a normal mob. And that this heightened damage agro might out weigh the procing agro. Well from what you said that does not sound like the case. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just spent points on HP bane 1hs .. was going to use it in primary, and BoC in secondary (probably switch to shield later in fight for stats).<br />
<br />
Spent the points so I don't have to spend anymore time in the mines, they sucked.<br />
<br />
If I knew I could tank with my normal agro weapons, I would have saved my DKPs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tanked emporer with bane and with bf/boc.No comparison the eb weapons were far stronger aggro for me.I didn't bother with seru bane and when i tanked him with auged bf/boc I had better aggro then our baned wars I think.</div></div><hr />
