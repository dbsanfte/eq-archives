<br />
The question is the effect from the necklace does the FT portion count toward the FT cap of 15 or not.  I seem to recall reading in several places that the effect for some reason counted against the cap of 15.  However I can not manage to find any mention of this when I really need it.  If someone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors don't need FT =p<br />
<br />
But yes, it *does* count towards the cap.  Here's a thread from the druid's grove discussing it: http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showMessage?topicID=26716.topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found plenty of information for it, thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
As for the reason asking, As guildleaders my wife and I had to make a call on type of resctrictions based on class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my opinion but there should be no restriction on it.  The effect and the item itself is nice for all classes so no matter who you leave off it someone will be left upset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would argue giving it to all but pure melees and feel it would be fair (Im trying to say, dont give it to pure melees)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The neck is one of the best in game so I wouldnt exclude anyone.<br />
<br />
AHR neck always goes for crazy points with us but so far for 5 we have the order has been (Cleric,SK,Wiz,Mage, Druid) but we use points so just happened to be those people with 1000+ points at the time or it could have gone to anyone.<br />
<br />
No matter who gets it, it will not be wasted simply put.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if it wasnt the highest ac neck most ppl can get, i would say go caster myself. <br />
<br />
they intended it to be good for all classes though, adds attack for melee, FT for casters. little regen and damage shield. i doubt you will have many issues leaving it all all.<br />
<br />
point systems are best, would hate to have award it. most ppl who got something close to this would pass on it in a point system, leaving it for the ppl who really need the upgrade. i cant see getting it if i already had AL/emp neck for instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would argue giving it to all but pure melees and feel it would be fair (Im trying to say, dont give it to pure melees)<br />
<br />
thats why rogues hate you :(<br />
<br />
The neck owns for anyone, simply put.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutalliss</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding that neck you need whisperling faction as far as I can understand.<br />
<br />
So I went to the remains and hailed him and stuff, he needed 4 skulls he said. I am kindly atm, was wondering what faction is required and if the little quest he gives is enough to raise me from kinda to ally? or whatever is needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">h8 rogues to, so what !<br />
<br />
The effect is best spent on a hybrid, the stats are good for all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best effect on : Necromancer<br />
Very efficient on : Hybrids <br />
Decently Efficient on : Caster/Priest (FT is easy for them)<br />
Underused on : Melee <br />
<br />
But everyone wants it, so dont try discriminating :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beardo</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silver charm of tranq is just as nice..<br />
<br />
Main reason people want it, is to cap their reg which is dam hard to get<br />
<br />
Also melees want it, for innate 8 DS + spike coat from girdle of thorns its ownage.. too bad they dont got another item with 8 DS innate ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silver charm of tranq is just as nice.<br />
<br />
- You're actually implying dozekar exists ?<br />
- You're actually implying dozekar drops the good tears ?<br />
- You're actually implying Minis drop the right items ?<br />
<br />
No way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beardo</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well<br />
<br />
-A group of people on our server kills doze every spawn, and they got bag fulls of the stuff, every char ,every twink of theirs has all the tears..<br />
<br />
-Been having good luck on doze lately, double plat tear is the win!<br />
<br />
-Like i said, the one grp of people kill it over and over, so its not contested here, so they got every piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which silver charm are you talking about? The one that's lacking 5str, 15dex, 15cha, 15wis, 15int, 25hp, 25mana, 12 to all saves, 8regen 8ds 20atk and ft8?<br />
<br />
Yeah...it's just as nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beardo</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you cant always get everything right?Not like people do vexthal forever, silver charm of tranq is just as good for now. Thats what i meant. Duh of course aten neck is the best.<br />
<br />
In my guild, aten neck went to casters mainly, duh to DKP hording, melees will never see that item in my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ppl have claimed u can do it with as low as indifferent faction(guts baby), confirmed u can do the quest with kindly faction, he wont talk to you till your ally though.<br />
<br />
lets be up front in pop, u need focus effects, not FT. its nice for xp grind, but raiding, which is what VT guilds do, FT just isnt that important. personally i would guess most ppl rather it be MP4 than FT8.<br />
<br />
everyone gets good use out of it. not like anyone but knights/warriors really need that ac. there are other neck items with mana, no one is going to miss 25mana. any argument that its better for one class over another is minimal at best.<br />
<br />
the stats for the charm of tranquility are dated as well, charm is 35ac too. i wouldnt replace it with aten neck if i had it, but theres competition for doze and simply dont have the time to kill minis in hope of that rare symbol. the tear isnt exactly rare either.</div></div><hr />
