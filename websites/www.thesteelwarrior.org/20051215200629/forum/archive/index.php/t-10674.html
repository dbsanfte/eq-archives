We cleared the beginning part and got to the doors. The 60 warrior told us to stay back so we did. He brought 2 at a time maybe more but we cleared most of it. The 60 warrior then took us to a back room and we killed this guy. We came back out and he said &quot;ready for the boss&quot;? We were like yeah, and guess what happened?? The guys that were on the other side that we didn't killed went after us. There were about 20 of them. We then released went back in, killed the remaining guys and then proceeded on to the main guy. We were on the main guy we killed him. His wife comes, were hitting on her and she ends up rezing her husband. We kill both and the mage got head armor.</div></div><hr />

For Mograin and whitemain, you have to completely clear out the Cathredal, and courtyard (if you did'nt close the doors, if you did, forget the coartyard).<br />
<br />
Once you clear out the church, the rooms to the left of mograin and the right..  Dont forget to hit the lamp switch to open the secret door to the high inquisitor.<br />
<br />
After thats all done you will be able to do mograin solo without the whole church agroing you.<br />
<br />
Be ready tho, once mograin dies, his wife comes out and resses him, That's all i'll say =p</div></div><hr />

We've never cleared the courtyard and we never close the doors.  I think that's a myth.  We always clear everything inside the cathedral though, because of the &quot;myth,&quot; which I guess now we have evidence is true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless of whether courtyard mobs are linked to Morgaine ( I don't believe they are ), clearing the wanderers in the courtyard or closing the door is sound advice, particularly if you are low level.<br />
<br />
If the wanderer closest to the doors aggros you because the door is open and you are too far back because you are trying to avoid aggroing more mobs from the cathedral, then it will sit there and nuke you, and everything that goes near it will aggro as well.<br />
<br />
If everyone is over level 36 this is less of a problem, but low level aggro in there is pretty harsh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah. the chapel is one of those instances where patient, methodical pulling helps a lot. it's boring at times but it maximizes risk vs. reward.<br />
<br />
generally I clear the whole courtyard of wanderers just to be safe. the exp is very good around that level as well.<br />
<br />
in fact I'm thinking about posting a guide to pulling SM since it seems to be a reoccuring problem. I've written a draft, just needs to be revised.</div></div><hr />

Oh and the lvl 60 warrior pulled all the mobs from the cathedrel to us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Walk up to the CY door.  Stand outside.  Kill all mobs within normal range that they get to when they run.  Open chapel door.  Pull first few guys from inside, outside.  Once you have room to move inside, move inside.  Clear up to Mograine.  Move left, clear, move right, clear and give mograine the beatdown. <br />
<br />
Only time we wiped was the first time before I cleared the right and the left and they all came to pay their respects.  Ever since we found out where they came from, Mograine's a 30 minute deal.</div></div><hr />

Agree...still love SM.  RFK/RFD/WC/RFC were nowhere near as fun at their level.  Even Maurodan  isnt as fun as SM was.  Uldaman, no comment.<br />
<br />
<br />
/cheer Blizz for their work on the SM</div></div><hr />
