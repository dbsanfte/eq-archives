<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The effect on Vadd's BP seems to me to be a bit difficient. Afaic, it's not something most Warriors would loot without being more or less compelled to loot the Gauntlets. I'm not willing to give up Echo of Anger to upgrade my Raex BP to Vadd's. The Vadd and Raex BP and Guantlets are therefor pretty much a matched set. Looked at this way, it's not that much of an upgrade for two pieces.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the effect is Cleave II and not even Cleave III. Many of us are in DKP guilds where we trade a lot of raiding for an armor drop. Given that the first Radiant mineral of Sundering augs with Cleave III on them are appearing, doesn't it make some sence to not upgrade your Raex BP and Gauntlets and acquire a non-DKP Cleave III aug?<br />
<br />
Generally Warrior BP's have had effects not available on other Warrior items. Generally as you upgrade a BP, the effects get better than on your  previousl BP or at least remain the same.<br />
<br />
Given this upgrade history, I'd almost expect the Vadd's BP/Gauntlets to have Cleave IV rather than have the previous Raex BP/Gauntlets exceed their Echo of Anger/Cleave II effect with an augment.<br />
<br />
It just doesn't make sence to me that an upgrade of two armor pieces can have their effects exceeded by not upgrading at all and simply adding an augment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't see anything wrong with Vadd BP.  It isn't the same upgrade as Raex BP over whatever you used to have before it, but then very few upgrades are that big anyway.  It's 10 AC, 40 HP (or maybe 50) and some extra spellshield which is inline with other slot upgrades from Time to GoD.  Cleave 2 isn't all that great but it's something you get for free.  Given Vadd gauntlets are trivial to obtain and is still the best War gauntlets pre OoW I don't see how losing Echo of Anger on BP is an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Isnt that the entire point of DKP BB ?<br />
<br />
To discourage you from taking small upgrades because they are underefficient ?<br />
<br />
Vadd BP / Legs, are for those that didnt get any Ikkinz/Time BP/Legs.<br />
They are not &quot;upgrades&quot; but a bit better alternatives.</div></div><hr />

Hmm interesting point of view. I had thought given the greater difficulty of obtaining the Vadd's BP that it would be an upgrade - that the Vadd armor set was aupposed to be an upgrade over the EP/PoTime set, which was supposed to be an upgrade over Warlords, ad infinitum.<br />
<br />
Now I see that Warrior's are supposed to wear mix 'n match armor sets. Salmon pink arms, navy blue BP, silver boots. The idea of an armor set  (Hey kids, Collect all 7!!) isn't intended to mean anything.<br />
<br />
Further, there's nothing wrong with getting Cleave II on a hard to obtain BP and Cleave III on a tradeskilled item. Gosh, I hope they put Greater Heal on a tradeskilled aug - I'm so tired of lugging around that Warlords BP for Invigorate - I can't understand for the life of me why I looted it. Oh ya, because BP upgrades are the jewel in the crown when a new amor set appears. N00bie, &quot;Nice BP. Cleave II? Ya I just got Cleave III on an augment my bud made.&quot; :D<br />

So far, so good, put Echo of Anger on it and Cleave II on Vadd's Gauntlets and the kind of mix n' matching Emilia finds quite acceptable works out. You can upgrade from a Raex BP to a Vadd BP without being more or less forced to loot the Gauntlets to in order to retain Echo of Anger.<br />
<br />
But concidering that isn't what they did, upgrading the BP's effect to Cleave III given the tradeskill augs is in order. One ought to be able to loot the Vadd's BP and stick with the Raex Gauntlets without feeling totally boned by SoE. &quot;Woot! I upgraded my BP and lost Echo of Anger and got Cleave II!!&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the reason they put Echo of Anger on an easy to obtain piece of the armor, is to smoothen out progression of the non-uber guilds.</div></div><hr />

Understand, I have QVic armor except for the legs and BP which are Raex. I can just acquire a Radiant mineral of Sundering aug, skip getting a Vadd BP entirely, and end up with Cleave III and Dodge III or 45 HP's instead of Cleave II 10 AC and 40HP's (and the loss of an augment slot sorta). This &quot;feels&quot; wrong to me - there's insufficient incentive to acquiring a high end difficult to obtain BP for Warriors.<br />
<br />
I do in fact feel they threw a bone to &quot;up and coming&quot; guilds by putting Echo of Anger on the easier to obtain gauntlets and another bone by putting Cleave III on the easier to obtain augments.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I feel not boning &quot;ubers&quot; by upgrading the Vadd's BP effect to Cleave III is in order - owners have the perk of not acquiring a Sundering aug. In truth, it ought to be Cleave IV. The effects on a hard to obtain high end BP should be better than (or at the VERY least as good as) those you can obtain using tradeskills - rare drops and high trivial notwithstanding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">True enough, there should be an enchantment on the breastplate that is at least an uncommon one, if not rare. Cleave II or Cleave IV sounds fair enough. What is odder though, is why they didn't put Dodge III on Vadd's leggings and Parry III on the armplates. I mean, it would fit !<br />
<br />
But nooo ... no effect on those.<br />
Despite all other classes having (focus) effects on pretty damn near every piece they get.<br />
<br />
I wonder what their plan is ?<br />
Almost makes me happy I'm not playing anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually BB i think you have a wrong point of view.<br />
Raex BP is not elemental armor, its top quality time loot.<br />
<br />
Compare top Quality time loot to Qvic loot ...  Pretty similar.<br />
Quarm bracer is even better than Vadd bracer.<br />
Compare Quarm cloack to Zum Muram cloack.<br />
Compare Quarm range to Noqfiel Range.<br />
<br />
Etc Etc. <br />
<br />
Phase1/2/3 Were never upgrades to EP armor. They are &quot;a bit better alternatives&quot;.<br />
You will see that in most cases the Qvic/Inktuta/Txevu loots are small upgrades to the<br />
top Quality time loot, but are big upgrades otherwise.<br />
<br />
Compare Quarm bracer to Xxeric bracer.   Top quality PoP vs Top quality GoD.<br />
Compare AHR BP to TRC BP if you want some seriously unbalanced shit.<br />
<br />
To be honest i didnt find getting into Qvic that hard.<br />
Once Uqua was &quot;retuned&quot;  it wasnt harder than TRC / Coirnav.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I get your point, and I'm not arguing with you about that, but remember that you cannot have CleaveIII and DodgeIII on the same radiant mineral because they're both effects you put onto the mineral.  I would guess that most tanks would be taking the hp ones, but remember that those only go onto Hands, arms, and boots...which, for most tanks at that level would only make it 5hp more on their arms/boots (since 40hp augs from LDoN go in those).  <br />
<br />
There's a better chance of getting a larger increase from the guantlets, since there's fewer 40+hp augs that fit it...although I don't know what's available for a Qvic level raider in the way of hp augs.  I know Brutal found a 40hp aug for his gaunts.<br />
<br />
Just saying be aware where those augs actually fit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The OoW augs aren't part of the balancing equation when Vadd BP is out.  If you want to look at an imbalance of RvR there was 1 item with Dodge 3 (Zun cloak) and now you can make a Dodge 3 aug that's attunable.<br />
<br />
Back in GoD the only items with Cleave 3 was Cyno neck and Zun ring that I can recall, so having Cleave 2 on BP is a good deal, especially since Cyno neck isn't all that great for a warrior.  <br />
<br />
The upgrade of Vadd BP over Raex BP is in line with similar Txevu loot over their Time counterparts, and as long as you have a Vadd Gauntlet (and why wouldn't you?) there's no drawback to Vadd BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">vadd's really isn't hard to obtain bp/legs either.  not even certain it can be considered the end game loot at this point anyways.<br />
<br />
if you wanna see a set of loot that'll make you cry foul in regards to EoA, look at mpg/rs -<br />
<br />
Crystal Breastplate (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70701) <br />
Crystal Gauntlets (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70723) <br />
Boots of Shifting Time (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47216) <br />
Armplates of Endless Fortitude (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47204) <br />
<br />
awesome set of armor, really, but again.  no EoA will make for a sad panda.  Especially with those gaunts and that bp, yeesh they're nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Armplates of Endless Fortitude are way cool ... Improved Parry III :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/cry and i got the IP3 32/245 pauldrons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think Crystal BP is better than Vadd BP because it doesn't have spellshield.<br />
<br />
I got parry 3 shoulders too :(<br />
<br />
Why don't they just make all the all plate stuff Crystal whatever and at least make that a matching set of armor?  And how about an Echo of Anger aug?</div></div><hr />
