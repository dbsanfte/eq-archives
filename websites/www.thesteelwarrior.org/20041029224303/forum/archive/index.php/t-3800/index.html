<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can you track dozekar with ranger from door?<br />
<br />
also what kind of force is needed to kill him....?<br />
<br />
is he trivial now? 1 groupable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you stand at the door to HoT and spit hard.. you'll hit Doze !<br />
<br />
(he's behind the pit, straight from the entrance, you can see his door from the entrance of HoT)<br />
<br />
As how many groups you need now.... No clue.. we killed him with 30 or so, but that was more then a year ago, long before PoP... He's prolly a 2-3 group deal now ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm ok..any info on spawn time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He can be duo'd or trio'd with the right classes, but it takes forever to kill him. Best bet would be 2 groups, simply for quicker slaying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">7 day spawn, single groupable if your equipped well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just to double check...this is the dragon that drops quest peices for the ToV quest armor right?(the ubah stuff not he HoT stuff).....also is there a site that has a break down of all the peices? or should i just use alla?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KAELZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">been farming this guy/ trying to farm this guy for some time killed him half dozen times with just a pickup crew of war ranger cle enc.....enc can slow np....more dps would speed up the fight but is not required....cleric needs to yaulp in between casts tho.<br />
<br />
NOT trackable from IZ, you can track from the ledge in HoT np and you should be non kos at that point anyway.   he drops some of the best ac/hp items aside from the elementals (even tho they compare) in the game.<br />

KAELZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can you just pull the first two wurms, then the two wanderers, then Doze right away?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You may also want to kill the static through the right door in the pit, as well as the 2 pit spawns and wanderers to be safe on the doze pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With Dozekar, less is more. <br />

You need some basic things.. you need one person to tank him of course. You need one person to slow him. You need enough healers to keep the tank alive. Really, that's it - it will take a long time for one person to melee him to death though.<br />
<br />
What kind of slower is good enough? Hard to say - a level 60 shaman would probably have trouble slowing him without an enchanter to tash. I was able to slow him without much trouble with my 65 shaman though (no enchanter, just tash stick + malos). Enchanters would probably have some trouble slowing him without malo/malos.<br />
<br />
How many main tank healers you need will depend on their FT/mana preservation stuff (go SCM) if they have clarity (and other mana regen buffs) up or not, and how many hps/ac/defensive AAs your main tank has. <br />
<br />
You can throw in some DPS.. but realize that any DPS person you add will require you to have more healing. This is more so true for melee DPS than caster DPS (Dozekar does a 400 damange + dispel AE every 15 seconds or so on the melees). One priest should be able to keep a few melee DPS people alive if they're doing nothing else. Oh yeah, any melee person without an insta clicky shouldn't even bother fighting.<br />
<br />
I know people would one group him even before PoP. The typical group I saw would be: warrior, 2 clerics, shaman, enchanter, rogue (or monk or ranger). Both clerics heal the warrior. Shaman debuffs, slows, and heals the rogue/monk/ranger (go Torpor). Dot if mana available. Enchanter tashes, helps get early slow to stick, then I guess just nukes/dots. What the warrior and rogue/monk/ranger do is pretty self explanatory.<br />
<br />
Now warrior, cleric, and shaman can trio him (some people on this board have 3 boxed him - though pretty sure all of them were at least somewhat elemental equipped). Warrior, druid, shaman might work too if the druid has good healing AAs and FT. As for duoing him... hm I don't know, that would be tricky, but I'd sure believe it if I saw it. Very well equipped tank/shaman maybe. <br />
<br />
He's more about strategy than being trivial (he has so many HPs he's nearly impossible to zerg). He can wipe out 50 people if they all stand in AE range.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, ranger should be able to track him; I think a druid can as well. Plus there's always good ol' eye of zomm (go stalking probes).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just watch out on doz though, just cause you can one group him doesnt mean he won't kick yer ass in 2-3 rounds before he is slowed.  Unslowed he attacks very very quickly and quads for 900 or some other crazy high amount.  Once slowed he is a baby and a single cleric can keep the tank alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm just curious here about something.  I've always thought that Doze debuffs your first 2 buffs, but someone told me it's only the first 1 ?  Also, I had someone tell he he random debuffs *eg possibly the 1st buff slot and the 7th, we'll say*, but I don't really believe that.  What's the deal with him on debuffs ?<br />
<br />
-Edit- also, while reading some old posts on Allakhazam's, I came across info that Doze has an AE mana-siphon DoT.  Is this still in effect also ??</div></div><hr />
