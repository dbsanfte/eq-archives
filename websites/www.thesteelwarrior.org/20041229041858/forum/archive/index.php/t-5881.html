Im tired of yelling for over an hour to get a group ( i only get 2 hours to play a day) I get tired of hearing &quot;dont you know how to TAUNT ?&quot; from frigging rangers and casters I get tired of raid soloing a mob till 80% and calling for assist and looseing frigging agro before 75%. IF YOU THINK THIS CLASS IS GTG YOU FRIGGING DAFT !!!!!!!<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Magnus, no offense, but if you are having aggro problems with an unauged Windblade you may want to rethink your weapon choices.  Windblade may be ok for aggro (mostly because it's high DPS, but it certainly isn't great aggro, especially without an aggro Aug.  I wouldn't go around calling people Daft because you can't do something they can.  I've been playing my Warrior for going on 4 years now.  I've had aggro problems on occasion, but nothing horrible.  I really get tired of seeing Warriors using unauged high DPS weapons like Windblade and Splitblades and bitching about aggro.  Get some damn aggro weapons if they aren't working, that's what they are there for.  In case you weren't aware, melee DPS is the lowest form of aggro possible.<br />
<br />
Tired of yelling for hours for a group?  How do you think they can fix that?  Force the other 10 million tanks to reroll?  The only way that they can fix that problem is to make Warriors overpowered and I don't want that.  Even then, your still competing with tons of Warriors for a single slot in a group.  I know when I look at /lfg if I see more than 3 other 65 Tanks lfg I log in my Shammie and 2-box.  And there are pretty much always more than 3 other 65 Tanks lfg.  This isn't unique to Tanks either.  Druids often have problems getting groups, as do several other classes.  Nothing SoE can do about that.  That's just part of being a Tank and it always has been.  You want to log in for 2 hours and be able to grind the whole time?  Play a solo class.<br />
<br />
I rarely had aggro problems before Incite was added and now have none (and I primarily used my JBoW when PoP first came out, but now I have better).  At worst, the slower would pull aggro off me momentarily (less than 1 attack round).  I have never lost aggro after 90% health on a raid either.  None of the Warriors in my guild seem to have that problem.  The biggest aggro problem I've had is when grouped with an SK or Pally who thinks they should be actively trying to take aggro.<br />
<br />
IMO, we have the tools we need now to do the job.  I don't want any more.  We already have a retarded healing /disc nobody uses.  They start adding even more utilities and the hybrids will actually have a case against our increased mitigation.  I'll take mitigation over utility anyday.  That's why I play a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

Now with readily available agro proccing weapons, LDoN anger augs, incite, and weapon affinity for extra procs warriors have the best agro that they have ever had in game.<br />
<br />
Even a non-raiding warrior can, with some effort, get a CHoS, SotBS dual wield combo, aug them with some anger 2/3 augs from LDoN and spend aas on the first few levels for weapon affinity for superior agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who really gives a fuck about the aggro? Class just has nothing to DO beside hit attack and taunt and maybe a discipline once in a while. No point in endurance unless the add abilities useable on demand that drain it. Giving us options and adding diversity to our playing isnt going to tread grounds onto a paladin or shadowknight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Half of those abilities they were going to add for opening system, sufficiently reworked, would be decent for adding some flavor.<br />
<br />
Various abilities they could add, with possibly a bit of re-tooling:<br />
Head Bash (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4598&amp;source=Live)<br />
Flurry (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4607&amp;source=Live)<br />
Rage (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4601&amp;source=Live)<br />

Infuriate (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4588&amp;source=Live)<br />

<br />
Now if I can only get my guild warriors to stop mashing Incite, they might not run out of endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besrik - Didn't really understand your post, but in answer to your first question every Tank out there really cares about aggro considering it is one of our 2 primary functions.  And this class has lots to do other than turn on attack, mash taunt and use discs.  If that's all you are doing you are definitely not learning the skills to be a solid Warrior anywhere outside Chardok.  If it's diversity you want, that's what Hybrids are for.<br />
<br />
Kaesorn - I totally agree.  More types of attacks with different effects would be nice to have.  But those are not Utilities, they are exactly that - attacks.  Hopefully the opening system will be implemented eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Openings system is gone, for good reason.  Waiting for an opening is no better for utility than waiting for procs.  Sure it works sometimes, but you have to rely on luck.  We were given incite because relying on the RNG does not equal class balance.  For utility it is the same thing.  We are in a much better spot than we were, and in tanking / aggro I think we are balanced.  But a bit of utility is nice.  We are the only class without utility, including the other specialists.<br />
<br />
We're already being called Hybrids by half the Pallies in the game <br />
<br />
Then those people are idiots.  Thats all there is to it.  We're getting an upgrade to make us more useful to a group.  Even with incite, a knight still wins in many exp groups, for their utility.  Specialists such as clerics and wizards also have utility.  And clerics especially don't have near as much of a fight for their spot.  Also utility makes the class funner, and more than just attacking.  Crying about utility making us a hybrid is the most laughable thing I've heard in a long time.<br />
<br />
And this class has lots to do other than turn on attack, mash taunt and use discs. If that's all you are doing you are definitely not learning the skills to be a solid Warrior anywhere outside Chardok <br />
<br />
Playing a warrior is easy as hell.  Yes you deal with positioning, distance from mob, and all the other little tricks, but those are so pathetically easy it doesn't take a lot of thought or skill to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hoping he was using his GSoT or CHoS and other 1hr I saw in his bag. If you are really wielding a WindBlade then don't complain about aggro. Before Incite and before Anger augs people tanked raid mobs. Imagine the uber aggro combo that was used to tank the first Vindi.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, yes I would love some more aggro, any warrior would. We still must admit we are better off than at the release of PoP ( when smithed Yaks and Frostbringers were heavily debated ). We can still improve but I am glad we have developer's attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gora, its was kinda a response to Sulvar, guess it was worded funny. <br />
<br />
I pretty much agree with Grodain that agro is fine. Now with readily available agro proccing weapons, LDoN anger augs, incite, and weapon affinity for extra procs warriors have the best agro that they have ever had in game. <br />
<br />
Basically agreeing with you. Incite, weapon affinity 5, good weapons, anger3: we can generate some decent aggro. I was agreeing with that fact and saying who cares if they added more abilities for that, they need to add more abilities to make our class interesting and fun. Though hybrids can still kick our ass in aggro. Warriors are retardedly boring and straight forward, and easy. I can play a bard while main tanking with absolutely no loss in efficiency in either class. We simply should have more options in what to do in game. I mean seriously, how often are you burning all your discs in a row to make endurance even matter. No point in adding to it unless they give us abilities to use from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhh, gotcha.  Yea, I agree with you.  And yes, I was referring to MoB positioning, controlling push, etc.  I see alot of warriors (and Melees as a whole) who just don't pay any attention to mob position and push and it drives me nuts.  The entire time I'm tanking I'm strafing around, keeping pets on the back, making sure the mob isn't going into a wall or worse, timing bash to interrupt spells and watching for adds (in case I gotta AE Taunt+Furious).  In raids, I also keep an eye out for adds to off-tank and healers/shamen to /shield if they need it.  That, combined with 2-boxing a Cleric or Druid or Shammie keeps me extremely busy and anything but bored.  I wouldn't object to getting more actual combat abilities, but I don't want pacify or root or snare as has been suggested by some.  If we got those, what would make us any different from hybrids?  In Diablo certain weapons had procs like &quot;Bleed&quot; which caused the mob to stop regenerating.  I wouldn't mind seeing something like that.  Maybe something like &quot;Head Bash&quot; that dazes the mob for a couple rounds, stopping it from casting spells.  Personally I'm quite happy with where we are now and I just don't want to see SoE overdo it.  They make us too strong and it takes all the fun away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'd be happy if they just fixed the taunt skill so it works reasonably.  I think the addition of incite and weapon affinity and the anger3 augs mostly solved the problem with holding aggro.  However, if someone takes aggro away from us, it can be DAMN hard to get it back, when you see a string of 6 taunt failures.  This is also a problem when you go to break mez on a mob.  The group doesn't want to stand around with its collective thumb up its butt waiting for taunt to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading most of the posts on this thread, I found it odd that most folks are of the mindset that they do not need more endurance.<br />
<br />
Well, for me, I'd love to double my END pool, hehe, if possible.  When fighting LDON missions I utilize incite quite often and run out of endurance constantly and find myself waiting sometimes.  When you're finishing the missions in 40 minutes tops (I hate going longer) I find that I pull with incite and also use it on a mezzed mob.   The nice part on the mez'd mob is incite is normally enough to keep it off the enchanter or it only briefly attacks her once I break mez (I do taunt as well, but do not wait for it to work).<br />
<br />
My lack of anger aug'd weapons and the fact I have everyone in the group nuking (clr/dru/mag/enc/nec) means it is hard for me to keep aggro and incite is what makes the difference for me.<br />
<br />
I only do one incite per mob, but many times even by pulling with incite, I have to wait on the next pull as the skill is not ready again.  This kind of scenario is worst case, I admit, but when I finish the mission I want all my casters oom and 0 endurance left, else it means I've been slacking  ;)<br />
<br />
I guess once I get some weapons worthy of anger aug'ing, I'll be like the rest of the folks here, until then, Incite is my little godsend that reduces the mobs melee time on my casters from 30 seconds to 5seconds per mob.<br />
<br />
I won't even get started with how I use furious on quad+ pulls or using Mighty Strike on low health to keep my DPS up, as it just plains ravages my END bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">orrillias</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i only use incite and never use anything else i never fall below 80% end in my pool Im sorry a larger pool doesnt really do much for me the extra regen is nice so that by the time A disci is able to be reused its up and ready to got but I think ive ran out of end in my pool maybe twice .  I thought the whole idea of having a big pool was so with the opening created disci's (that now it seems arent going to happen) it would force the tank to judge when and what to use creating a little more of a strategic game play than whack taunt whack incite whack taunt repeat as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">remind me if im wrong but<br />
adding endurance to items wasnt part of melee revamp 2.<br />
Endurance onto items was supposed to happen on part 1.<br />
Please dont tell me they decided +end was all melee needed and called it a day?<br />
<br />
If so the dev's are smoking some major crack, more diciplines woulda been nice, a bar for disc's for easier use woulda been great (the currenty alt c window is fucking retarded)<br />
<br />
Dont tell me complancy is all the dev's have to offer? Where are the cool revamps and more disc's that where orginally supposed to make revamp 2?<br />
<br />
Im glad Brenlo dosent post here,  Because obviously he has a hack job to fix right now with revamp 2 as its utterly fucking worthless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jofa Hate'Maker</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use my entire endurance, within 3 minutes sometimes, and this is with the new amounts of endurance... <br />
<br />
Last night i tanked agnarr, after using ae-t to steal snare aggro, i used incite, furious (non-proccing target mobs get furious, as i believe in damage output as a crucial part keeping the healers alive).  I was in the corner by the time furious wore off, so i stonewalled, and as soon as Def dropped, i laid into fell strike.  As Fellstrike dropped, i dumped my second hand weapon, and put in my SC.  I only lost aggro once, the entire fight, and we have 6 jumpy wizards, who are always riding the aggro wave as close as they can.  I use incite everytime it pops, on target mob fights.<br />
<br />
While i dont generally loose aggro, our wizzies (as well as a few of our necros that refuse to FD)  get summoned, not rarely, but often, near the end the race to dump their mana, as most PoP fights seem to dictate.  Not this time, the only wizard without scs3 was the lone summon fatality, in our quickest slaying of that bastard, yet.<br />
<br />
I havent done any high risk LDoN yet to further test the utility of the deeper endurance pool.  I assume the benefits will be evident, as i alway ended up scraping the bottom of the barrel well before the end of the run.<br />
<br />
I think its fantastic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont see how this is happening. Any decent group incite wears off just before or as the mob is dying. Cant really use it more than once unless its a boss or something.<br />
<br />
Richard, your GBoS is definately worth putting an anger aug on. I dont know if your guild is a high-end raiding guild or not, and better stuff drops that your not getting. But my guild is working on getting to elementals and i'm not sure i've seen any much better than my GBoS. That 179 hp proc with Anger II i have makes agro control practically easy. Thats an awsome main hand weapon.</div></div><hr />
