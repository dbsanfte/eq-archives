<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I'm posting in lieu of my wife who doesn't fancy Message Boards. Basicly she's becoming our Guild's highest leveled active warrior and is needing some upgrades to her gear.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind we're a rather small guild with about 15 members active at any given time, with no more than 2 or 3 of them being 60... we're not doing things like HoT, NToV, or even Kael (we could do Kael, we just all pretty much hate the place). Anyway, her obligitory Magelo links is as follows:<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, she picked a crappy race/diety combo, but Ogres, Barbs, and Trolls just weren't &quot;Pretty&quot; enough for her, and Rallos-Zek is too &quot;Mean&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heh what about a blessed faydark thunderbolt? :D<br />
<br />
pretty much by slot you can get <br />
clattering bone necklace for the neck upgrade<br />
crystal spider eyes or grobb hide mask for the face<br />
the +15 sta bracer to replace the shackle<br />
new haste ( save them coins or camp the RBG in old seb )<br />
and ditch the snowchipper or move it to offhand..<br />
<br />
still think your best bet is more kael for champs upgrades<br />
<br />
nothing wrong with tunare as a god..err, well, you can't go fight in PoG for berserker armour drops :D</div></div><hr />

Drops in Veksar in the Shop camp.  Was going to link the alla info but the site seems to be having problems.  Haste on the belt is 31% which would be not only a nice haste upgrade but the stats would give her quite a boost as well.<br />
<br />
I LOVE Veksar.  Everything except the dragon (which has to be quested so you don't have to worry about it popping into the middle of your xp camp) is one groupable and there are some nice drops.  <br />
<br />
I got these gloves there from the nobles camp which would be a slight upgrade for her I think (not too sure on warrior stuff I'm used to classifying upgrades by how much mana it has).<br />

Nice drops and FUN zone.  The xp isn't like in PoP so it usually isn't too crowded.  XP isn't bad just not PoP level.  I really recommend it.  Lots of spell research drops there as well if you have casters trying to fill holes in thier spell books.  <br />
<br />
Back to warriors... a whole set of Kylong Darkmail stuff drops there that for a guild of your level should provide quite a bit people upgrades.  Enough nice drops for other classes that you shouldn't have too much trouble convincing a group to go there. <br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First thing I'd do is upgrade her range.  Either camp or buy and Idol of the Thorned, or even Grodan's Idol that drops in ME.  Then its armor farming time.  Either Kael, or screw faction and just got hit PoG.  With 15 folks you could probably do allright there.  Who wants to go to Felwithe anyway?  =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get a blessed faydark thunderbolt for range, 50hp and decent bow stats so she doesn't have to swap out ranged all the time.<br />
<br />
For armor: either Veskar drops or Tunare plate cultural (Full Mithril or Blessed Full Mithril) will be good upgrades across the board. I would bag the IGS and get a dragonwing mantle for shoulders. Grimling contraption is a pretty nice mask you can buy or camp in Acrylia. While you are in AC, you can also pick up a black acrylia sword for offhand, then mainhand the frosty and sell the snowchipper.<br />
<br />
That should get you started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I had been debating on whether the Thunderbolt, or Nightmarewood would be better for her, or if it would even be worth picking up a bow and not a Grodan's or Thorned.  I just don't know alot about Warriors, never played one, which is kinda sad considering I've been playing almost 4 years.<br />
<br />
I knew there was some good stuff coming out of Veksar, I had been looking to go camp her the Kylong Shin Guards but Veksar is crowded to beat all hell on Quellious most of the time (Usually 50+ people in the zone), but I didn't know about those gloves, or the belt, thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Her weapons are backwards. She does have Frosty in main and Snow in off, she just didn't reflect it that way on her profile. One question, would a Wavecrasher be worth it? I can probably foot the bill for one but will she still get aggro from the proc with a shammy/enc slowing, or will it even override my Earthcaller proc?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you didn't already have a frostbringer than a wavecrasher would work nicely; but you would be hurting with basically a 9/19 weapon in either hand.<br />
prob be better off just grabbing a truncheon of doom if you're looking for a slow proc'ing weapon..would be much cheaper.<br />
since she worships tunare already; i'd go with the tunare_only gear; the BFT is a nice bow.<br />
<br />
pretty much wandor summed it up; she'll get some useless +wis from the tunare blessed full mithril armours but it's still damn nice stuff and better than most of what she has now..try to find some smithys on your server ( i think HE clerics would be more inclined to make armour than a warrior ) and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I  have a Full Mithril Breasplate for her already...<br />
The Full Mithril armor is the same as the Blessed Full Mithril cept much cheaper (Got the BP for around 7k). The only thing that concerned me about the Mithril Armor is it's lack of stats (except wis and mana, which has already been deteremined is a waste)<br />
<br />
She has some champions armor already (Sleeves, Boots, and Gloves I think) that she got back when I lead Kael Raids for a while. Would it be worth upgrading these pieces to Mithril Armor?<br />
<br />
We just formed up with one of our Allies to start tackleing HoT so hopefully she'll get some drops from there.<br />
<br />
Basicly my biggest concers are her waist, wrists, and earrings. I acutally didn't think the Darkmetal Visor and Dragon Tooth Choker were that bad for warriors... eh what do I know, I'm just a ranger =P<br />
<br />
I didn't really want the Wavecrash for the slow proc, I was looking for more aggro, that seems to be her biggest problem now.... if a MoB resists slow she has a really hard time getting aggro back from Shammy/Chanter. I had considered a getting her Bonebite for the DOT proc, but I really don't think that adds alot of aggro. Mostly I knew how much Aggro I get from Earthcaller and I didn't know if she would be as successful using Wavecrasher, or if my proc would not let hers land, as well as shammy/chanter slows. I know EC won't land when a chanter/shammy slows the MoB first, but it still seems to draw me some aggro. I already have a Blackened Acrylia Blade (which was mentioned earlier) that I use when Earthcaller isn't needed, I could let her have it... I SUPPOSE =P<br />
<br />
Her haste kind of bothers me, but we have a guy in the guild who regularly camps the Seahorse Belts for the melees in our guild. She might get one soon enough, if not I plan on going to Veksar and tryin to get the haste belt from there, which I believe is superior anyway.</div></div><hr />
