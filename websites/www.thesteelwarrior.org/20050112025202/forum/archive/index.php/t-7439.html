I'm a non raid warrior, in fact i'm a 2 box with a druid main.  I leveled my warrior to 65 and 35aa and I'm running out of stuff to buy.  I've been considering getting a BoC, but from what i've read its not worth it.  So, what is the next step for me?  I've got around 1.1 or 1.2 million pp in the bank and i've been debating between spending it on small upgrades or just hoarding it.  Thanks in advance~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much does a BoC go for on your server?  It is expensive, but if you have that much plat and nothing else to buy there's no reason not to buy it IMO.  It will be a nice aggro/stat upgrade for you, and unlike most items, the BoC has held it's value very well (gone up in value actually) over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorix</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in nearly the same situation, my main is a 65 druid, my alt is this 60 war.  Was only 52 two weeks ago and plan to have him to 65 soon.  Anywho, i've found the BoC is a huge asset, specially when you want to use the druid for DPS burning mobs down (boxing and losing aggro sucks).  But in terms of buyable gear to snag, other than a BoC, i'd look into some more ornate.  The ornate BP is really nice for your combo because we (druids) cannot cast focus and the ornate BP effect is pretty handy for some extra hps/MR (it's only a slight upgrade statiscally but if u have 1.2 mpp tucked away...) also the ornate legs have clicky STA, another buff we cannot cast on our warriors.  Both of these items not only give you new buffs at your disposal but both are upgrades to your current gear (more the legs than the BP).    May also want to snag another EP TS ring from Earth.  Anywho, just my 2cp, i'd work on getting more aggro based weps as well, even for 2 boxing the aggro is much help for keeping control and allowing your druid to do more DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude if you seriously have 1.2 mil plat, go spend it.  There are a lot of great upgrades for you!  I'll list avg prices on my server (ayonae Ro) of stuff I can see just off the top of my head that you could probably buy right now.  Plus, if you upgrade with tradeable loot, if you nab better no drop stuff later can you probably turn around and re-sell what you have without taking too serious of a beating.<br />
<br />
Face: Ammy Chain Mask (8 ac 85 hp) about 35k<br />
Ring: another Steel Ring of Earthen Resil about 50k<br />
Hands: Warlords Steel Gauntlets (EC Hard LDoN) 35 ac / 90 hp about 75k or so<br />
Shoulders: Horn Spiked Shoulderpads from PoN 31 AC / 60 hp about 75k or so<br />
Boots: Bloody Boots of Dark Rites (BB Hard LDoN) 34 ac / 85 hp about 75k or so<br />
<br />
Also, IMHO I think the ornate bracers are not as good as the Mana Threaded Bone Bracelet from EF Hard LDoN (28 ac 75 hp) 35k or so or getting another Crys Acid Bracer (25 ac 100 hp) 100k or so.<br />
<br />
As for the BoC, IMHO if you plop Anger III in your GBoS and maybe a Yak Aug in your off hander you would be doing well for Agro.<br />
<br />
What you really need are AA as getting all the defensive AA, even with almost no change in your gear would allow you to tank Hard LDoN or early GoD (if that is what you are looking to do) with good healers behind you - especially if you get the agro augs and some weapon affinity AA.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

With that much money i would go for a flowing moss mantle first, then you never have to upgrade your shoulder again</div></div><hr />
