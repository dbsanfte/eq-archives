<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can you corner tank mobs again?  Are mobs still going half into walls a lot?  Can you target worth a darn now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not any luck so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They aint gonna be fixxing this anytime soon, and frankly I beleive they have exactly ZERO programmers who know what is broken and/or how to fix it. Also I believe this is the begining of the forced migration that will make the majority of their customers goto eq2. Well in theory anyways, I, personally, will not be buying another SoE product ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, WoW is looking good about now.  It's this kind of sloppy crap that really pisses me off.  The really sorry thing about it is these are new problems added to a game that has been working fine for years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tanked some more mobs; most seem cornerable now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mobs dont go through walls it seems, which is a start. <br />
I was able to corner some mobs while others were a no go - might have something to do with the corner not being entirely square tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cornered glyphed, exiled, cursed, and emp no problem.  Cornered the snakes at C3 as well.  Theres lots of hopping around going on when you look at it from another players perspective, but seems to work.-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Twalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm interesting... my guild has been cornering mobs again for a week or so,<br />
we had problems for a few days and then it's back to normal pretty much only one incident i can remember</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">once I'd worked out how not to get rewinded out of the corner I had no problems corner tanking.  Haven't been on since 14/04/04 patch, but imagine the no more rewind bit will fix the things that made it difficult for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">we took down LMM by puting him in a corner, and he stayed there until he died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Everything seems to corner pretty well in time now except for Saryn...<br />
<br />
CT still has some problems but they are much easier to work around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We Corn holed all of VT and MM last night No probs<br />
<br />
Edit --- Cornered, Sorry bout the mix up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shabba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How do you turn the /rewind off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cornered MM and behemouth last night with no problems, wall tanked Agnarr last night with no problems as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I cornered fake RZ and real RZtW in Drunder last night April 14.<br />
Both cornered just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cyprex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Agree with Hittem, we had no issues with the entire RZ event. It was a lucky night, after 10 kills of RZTW with no BoW, I'm finally the lucky owner of one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I cornered everything just fine in VT last night, which rocked!  The only thing I noticed though is that the mobs look like they're literally standing on top of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How do you turn the /rewind off?<br />
<br />
I think they removed rewind completely with yesterdays patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Woot!!! Congrats on the BoW Cyprex!!!<br />
<br />
As for cornering, I didn't MA except a little bit last night to let one of our other guys take a break but things seem improved after the patch.  I'm  a gnome and was able to park snakes just fine in Ssra in a convienient corner.<br />
<br />
VT cornering seemed to work out fine!!<br />
<br />
yay!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Has anyone had any problems ducking since the patch? It seems when I duck near a crowded aread or near a wall I get stuck and can't move or stand back up by pressing D. I talked to a friend that's having the same problem, were both ogre's so I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this. The only way to get unstuck is either by sitting down or jumping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm, sounds like for most of you cornering is fixed&gt; Tried to corner Statue/Idol/AoW last night, no luck, he got flipped around, and I couldnt hit them.  Yes, I was double shrunk, looking up, and backing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm, sounds like for most of you cornering is fixed&gt; Tried to corner Statue/Idol/AoW last night, no luck, he got flipped around, and I couldnt hit them.

 <br />
I've had issues with AoW/Idol/Status warping even before the DX9 patch. Three times in a row we had AoW warp on us at under 10%, same with Idol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He didnt warp for us, I just couldnt get him and me into the corner correctly. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've found that once I hit the corner I cannot keep walking backwards, I just stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Has anyone had any problems ducking since the patch? <br />
<br />
Got a few complaints of that from some guildies last night.<br />
<br />
As for cornering, Avatar of Smoke cornered just fine last night. I was skelly and double shrunk for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grimhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Im an ogre and i was having the duck problem yesterday. After i ducked i couldnt get back up in a standing position untill i straffed left or right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Is anyone able to corner AOW in Kael?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I didn't have good luck with Nadox Inny last night.  We had a mixup and he went to the healer corner after punting me into my corner behind the boxes (I was in the corner on the left in his room...healers in the hall just around the corner.)  I couldn't get out from behind the boxes no matter what I tried - which has never been a problem in the past (shrunk x2).  Then, after Inny killed 2 of 3 clerics he started hitting me through the walls (I was 2 boxing a shaman and I could clearly see him on my shaman's screen in the healer area...but I couldn't see him on my warrior screen even though I was getting hit.)<br />
<br />
Overall, it seems better (in other zones), but some encounters still seem screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've also had problems with duck, im barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I had some problems with ducking as well... had to jump to get out if it... more PITA that real but still...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">i got stuck ducking on two things in tranq last night, huge pain.<br />
<br />
and i cant remember if ive ever cornered AoW, think maybe once but i know at least 3 times i havent been able to corner him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Anakun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I played last night logged on my mage to farm some and if I stood in a door way and the door shut then I would get stuck inside the door. happened in PoK at the big bank and in dulak harbor at the ocean crasher house, but when I loaded up my war and went to tank in bot I was able to corner very easily tho its not raid level cornering makes exping with rogues and monks easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Duck bug sucks ass.<br />
<br />
However, not only were we able to corner mobs in PoFire post-patch, the SA (me) and TA (also barb) were able to corner as double shrunk barbs instead of relying on illusions. Our MA (an ogre) used gnome so I'm not sure that double shrunk ogre would work or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Cornered Time TZ tonight and won for the first time (yay).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Been cornering all cornerable mobs again. Only had one problem which was on Mith Marr. He seemed to want to crawl up the wall.</div></div><hr />
