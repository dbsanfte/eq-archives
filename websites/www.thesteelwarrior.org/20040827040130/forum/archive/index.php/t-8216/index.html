<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>psykopath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, I am returning from a 6 month break from EQ and currently play on the TZ server.  I am looking to try something different, so I will be putting in a transfer to a new server without the pvp ruleset.  The server select screen has changed since I was gone, so now there is no way to determine which server have the lowest population.  What are the least populated servers to play on?  Any suggestions for a few lower population servers where I can have a fresh start without having every zone be over populated?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Dammit Isk, now everyone will want to play there.</div></div><hr />

Population is VERRRRRY Low, but there are some highend guilds, 2 in Txevu, 1 more in Qvic, another in Time, and another in EPs....not much crowding to speak of, which I guess is good.<br />
<br />
But I gotta ask, why would you want to move to a low population server? I find it just about unbearable, there is like...no basis of players to sell to, buy from, recruit from, group with, etc. If all you care about is raids, it's not bad, if you have a guild lined up, but what's the draw of having no one around to interact with?</div></div><hr />

Coming from a PVP server he may just want to be able to solo in peace for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maelin probably be best bet i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tholuxe is indeed low and Aclylosprada will indeed give free plat lol :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
maelin and morden rasp are the two lowest pop U.S. servers out there with non-PvP and by the way its not a bad choice, I like Maelin cause its quiet and I can 6box just about everything in relative peace :) Course depends on your playtimes and such but I see the difference with my guys on BBane and its huge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">being a warrior on maelin playin from around 11pm pst to around 6am pst you will not like the low lvls unless you twink or pl with a shammy or cleric because when you are in a zone you are the only person in the zone really, luclin is just about empty, 30s or so its loy</div></div><hr />

I honestly wonder what my guild would be like without competition for spawns, Everything always up, everything always timed for respawn hehe.</div></div><hr />
