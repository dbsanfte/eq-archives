<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so before I left, I was fiddling around with dyes and I dyed my BP black because the fungi tunic is pretty damned ugly, and that kinda took some of the shine off it.<br />
<br />
I'm now of the school of thought that it was a retarded idea considering all the dyes everyone else is using without consideration for their fellow man, and I want to remove it.  Here's the problem.<br />
<br />
I own an Incarnadine BP, Champs BP and a Fungi Tunic.  I can get the fungi and the champs looking correctly, because they're both the same tint.  However, the Incarnadine looks silver if I apply the same tint to my chest slot.  I want all dye removed from my chest slot, and I'm not seeing a way to do that.  I want my Incarnadine red and my other 2 BP's the default color.  I've tried resetting the chest slot to pure white, 240/240/240 white, tried the reset button, fiddled around with everything I could find, and I still can't .  So, what am I missing here?  Was this implemented like shit? (that's what i'm leaning towards at the moment).  Is there like a prismatic solvent I need?  Or am I SOL on this whole thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rugal Bloodwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think you have to set to 250/250/250 for a reset.. Its what I read anyways, haven't personally tried however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Either setting it to 0/0/0 or 255/255/255 resets the color, I believe, but I can't remember which one it is.<br />
<br />
Edit: Because I spell better than I type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I should have known it wasn't going to work immediately.  you are correct, 255/255/255 reset my dye, after I took off the BP, zoned, and then put the BP back on.  Leave it to SoE to make a 3 step process out of a 1 step process.  Problem solved tho, good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Champs and Fungi look OK dyed right?<br />
<br />
With those two BPs the only thing you'd be using the Incarnadine BP for would be the Effect, so you would only have it on for like 15 seconds or whatever the cast time on it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a pretty vain bastage, I spend most of my time on EQ in 3rd person mode looking at myself.  The incarnadine matches the rest of my gear, and I just can't be a fashion crisis, even if it is just while i need to be invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another DYE Question:<br />
<br />
Does /dopropertinting fix your neck being black if you dye your armor black? I love the way my armor looks since I dyed it the night LoY came out, but I am sick of a black neck on screenshots.<br />
<br />
If not I might have to go back to silver-look of my Champs by resetting it like Haas.</div></div><hr />

Heh. Guilty. /raise hand</div></div><hr />

If you want to get rid of the color bleeding onto your skin using the NEW models (old models still do it), type in <br />
<br />
/dopropertinting on <br />
<br />
in game I think. If you have a decent video card (lower end ones might not process it correctly), it should eliminate your tinted skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like 'em too. I was the red dwarf in my brellium, except for my blue cobalt gauntlets and ice forged helm. Now I'm all primer grey.</div></div><hr />
