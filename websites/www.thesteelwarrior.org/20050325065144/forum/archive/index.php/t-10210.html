<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, I really liked the last DPS thread with parses started by Timmokk, and I wanted to see how the situation was now with new AA/gear.<br />
<br />
A few general notes about parsing.  It is usually a terrible idea to 'parse' mobs with adds, or mobs where the mob is pushed all over the place and it is easy to 'lose' damage.<br />
<br />
I did most of those parses on Msha's, for the simple reason that:<br />
<br />
- They are easily accessable to anyone who posts here.<br />
- They are always equal, and it is very easy to pick up all the damage from tem.<br />
- They do not have any adds, and they have overall very low magic resist, if properly debuffed.  With the new OoW nukes, wizards get perfectly respectable OoW nukes that save vs MR, so the efficiency drop off switching from FR to MR is much lower.<br />
<br />
I have often heard that Msha's are 'bad parse mobs' but frankly I disagree.  True, the 'ideal' mob for a caster has:<br />
<br />
- Low HP<br />
- Low FR<br />
- No manadrain AE<br />
- Allows horses to be used<br />
<br />
And frankly I cannot think of anything worthwhile that fits the bill.  Msha's are very very caster friendly with the exception of fire resistant, which frankly hurts druids a lot more than wizards.<br />
<br />
That said, here are the parses, I will put up more when I get a chance:<br />
<br />
A note on all parses:<br />
Mobs were almost always debuffed with malosina/hos/chaos chant/tash.  Resists at least on magic nukes were a non issue.<br />
<br />
Bards are very rare for us and they are usually busy debuffing, therefore it is very rare melees or casters get overhaste.  Bards usually twist marr/hos/chant/resists.<br />
<br />
Our top two rogues use epic 1.5 / 1h slasher from primals and piercer from primals / scimitar from qvic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note on the 'rogue kick ass parses': <br />
<br />
A rogue with epic 1.5, and Legion Kukri puts out 680 DPS.  I am really curious to see the parses of the rogues with epic 2.0, if a rogue with epic 1.5 reaches 700 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well we don't know what class any of those are heh~ but I agree I like Msha's for parsing. That rogue DPS is pretty solid... I parsed a rogue in guild with Ritual Spinesplicer/Aranini's Rage at 500ish DPS on those... but I don't think he has the 1/+1 aug from Uqua and I know he didn't have ranger buffs, overhaste, or FA/Champ, so with all of those he could be breaking 600 I bet... Hell I parsed 330ish DPS with Fang of Feratha while tanking although I did have Champ and overhaste~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, classes for those that care can be found at www.ascendingdawn.com and check magelo.<br />
<br />
I found it interesting that Artaniel, a rogue did 391 DPS using.... Tunare Piercer :P<br />
<br />
That's right, a rogue using a 15/21 piercer outdamages a monk with Cyno Handwraps/Shinai of Ancients :P</div></div><hr />

Most parses you see with rogues doing 700+ damage, they're fully ATK buffed, and overhasted, and the fight just all clicks together perfectly.<br />

He was in my group when we beat Weaponry, and he parsed well over 1000 DPS on each mob (we had raid buffs as we had just failed Trial of Endurance, buffed, and then called the night heh), including 1460ish on the piercing mob. Rogues are sick... but some of these 2handers coming out of highend OoW allow for some sweet warrior DPS as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has started doing the M`sha's like crazy lately, killing them at just about every pop that we can.  I've gotten a lot of parses out of it too.  Needless to say, I always parse 260 to 275dps using a DoD (+1 cold damage aug) and a JoS (125dd/stun aug) while having identical buffs all the time (Predator, Salik, Might/Lion, and BBB) and max ATK.  <br />
<br />
Rogues own the M`sha's every single time.  Wizards will be right up there with the rogues (mostly, but not always) IF the fight is less than 4 minutes long.  If it's just like 10 of us killing the M`sha's, considering they do have 1.2 million hp, then I'll pull ahead of a wizard just due to sheer sustained damage alone.  That, though, is to be expected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you not find it wrong that rogues beat wizards in sustained AND burst DPS by the amounts they do?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, Msha's are the most wizard friendly mob I can think off, everything else it goes down hill from.</div></div><hr />

Not that rogues don't badly outdps everyone else, but Mshas aren't exactly the fairest mob to parse on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You won't be able to land Fire or Cold on the M`Shas, and unless they're Malosiniad and Tashed, they're somewhat MR resistant as well.  As far as a &quot;wizard friendly&quot; mob is concerned, I wouldn't exactly call them &quot;all that&quot;.  I'm not 100% sure on this, but I don't think GoD as a whole is very wizard friendly as far as resists are concerned.<br />
<br />
Fire nukes are the Wizard's biggest, and I think they're the most efficient as well considering the Qvic gloves are a 25% mana reduction or something off White Fire and Ancient Strike of Chaos.  Magic nukes aren't as big as Fire nukes, but they are a little bit faster cast time.  Ice nukes take a step further in that they're the weakest, but are also the fastest casting.<br />
<br />
Just cleared Qvic though.  Here are the top 6 for each M`sha:<br />
<br />
Ptav - 3m 10s fight<br />
1)  Wizzy -  96,062 505dps (Antimodes)<br />
2)  Rogue -  74,685 393dps (Kristine)<br />
3)  Monk - 57,887 304dps (Klubber)<br />
4)  Monk - 56,326 296dps (Zzippah)<br />
5)  Rogue - 54,356 286dps (Gily)<br />
6)  Warrior - 47,596 250dps (Eriatha)<br />
<br />
Dvoin - 3m 26s fight<br />
1)  Rogue 105,001 510dps (Kristine)<br />
2)  Wizard 88,771 431dps (Antimodes)<br />
3)  Monk 60,529 294dps (Zzippah)<br />
4)  Ranger 57,271 278dps (Moex)<br />
5)  Ranger 50,854 247dps (Bowemann)<br />
6)  Rogue 50,574 245dps (Gily)<br />
<br />
Mnat - 3m 23s fight<br />
1)  Rogue 109,454 539dps (Kristine)<br />
2)  Rogue 99,875 492dps (Nalfien - just arrived)<br />
3)  Wizard 88,156 434dps (Antimodes)<br />
4)  Rogue 64,851 319dps (Gily)<br />
5)  Rogue 64,244 316dps (Dlgoth)<br />
6)  Wizard 55,800 275dps (Erradis)<br />
<br />
Weapon key --- Kristine uses Uqua auged Epic 1.5 + JoS.  Nalfien uses Epic 1.5 + JoS.  Gily uses DoD + Uqua elf shoe (30/26).  Moex uses Darkglint + Epic 1.5.  Bowemann uses Darkglint + JoS.  Dlgoth uses Ifir + JoS.  Eriatha uses DoD + JoS (when I'm not tanking).  Zzippah uses Shinai + JoS.  Klubber uses SOT w/ 4dmg Ikkinz aug.  <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that these parses aren't the &quot;Be all, end all&quot; of class balance.  They don't represent that, so don't get your arms in a bunch if X class is doing better than Y class.  An accurate distribution of this is probalby 100+ parses all comparing the same members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximiusm</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just a tip, the best parse mob EVER is Exterminator in Rivervale. hes right by zone in, mobs are non-assist on him, and  has about 1 million HP. i parsed on him and dealt 1.6 million damage but it took a few hours (was unbuffed, did em with a abrd in about 1.5 hr), so i figured  that 600k is from regen.<br />
<br />
he hits for about 74 max (this was before i got my defensive AAs and at lvl 65) and is a green con at 65.<br />
<br />
its good for doing ur max DPS since hes green and has gimp AC, might be good for testing the &quot;warriors have to much dps and monks have to little&quot; bitchfest that is goign on at MB tight now.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Phantron, Msha's are incredibly fire resistant, but keep this in mind:<br />
<br />
- Msha's have basically zero MR once tashed, malosinad, hos'd.<br />
- Msha's die relatively fast.  Any fight that takes longer than 5 minutes wizards are going to suck horrendously on.  I got some 10 minute Msha parses where warriors outdamaged wizards.<br />
- Msha's allow horses to be used on them.<br />
<br />
The loss going from FR to MR is not nearly as high as you think.<br />

and, being Corona Fire a level 70 spell focus items do not work nearly as well, basically, as long as a wizard gets to nuke till OOM, the efficiency loss is very small.<br />
<br />
True, an ideal mob would have all the characteristic of an Msha (quick fight, low resists, horses allowed, no manadrain AND low fire resist) but I cannot think of any such fight that any guild is likely to do outside of elementals.  I mean sure, if I parse the damage done while clearing earth rings AE style, or on Monsterous Mudwalker then yeah, casters will be ahead, but on any current raid fight casters don't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
Can you?</div></div><hr />

We had no shaman, so I knew right off the bat that using the big nukes were simply out of the question.  The mob was just tashed, and I highly doubt the bard kept HoS on the entire time as Thundaka was being resisted about 50% of the time on the first Ptav.  <br />
<br />
My guild leader has about a 97xx mana pool.  Yeah yeah, he's a loot whore, but he's pretty pimp.  Instead of using the big nukes, I loaded up Lightningbane which carries a 3.68 ratio on a -300mr check.  I probably should have used Spark of Lightning (4.11 ratio), but hell, when it comes to play a wizard, I'm a goddamn n00bi3.  The fight lasted just over 9 minutes long, and because of his relatively large manapool, I was able to pretty much chain nuke Lightningbane (zero resists) right up until the end of the fight.  As a result, the dps of the wizard on Dvoin/Mnat one was like identical to the ranger dual wielding Darkglint + Epic 1.5.  <br />

Rather interesting, but still really doesn't mean much anything solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bane line have pretty reasonable ratio now and since big nuke's damage is often dependent on if you've a bard remembering/willing to HoS/ancient the whole fight, it seems like a reasonable alternative.  I notice my guild leader uses the bane line a lot too for presumably the same reason: better to have consistent DPS than low DPS because people forgot to debuff a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is bane line has astonishingly low DPS ~ around 300 DPS, if that, chained with a good focus.<br />
<br />
Wizard DPS is already really lacking using big nukes, using draughts is really really terrible.<br />
<br />
I agree that big nukes require hos/tash/chaos chant/malosina, but honestly the other alternative has wizards do warrior DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
P'Tav Msha:<br />
<br />
Hennesy (monk, Cyno 1hb/Flamelicked claws, grouped with bard) 444 DPS<br />
Riatsila (ranger, no TS, with bard) 366 DPS<br />
Aulwen (ranger, no TS, with bard) 352 DPS<br />
Mearis (magician, using air pet, no epic procs) 351 DPS<br />
Pinaduz (warrior, no bard, using pikestaff) 299 DPS<br />
<br />
My DPS was really low because I was coh'ing people in middle of fight, and was too lazy to make a water pet.<br />
<br />
Dvoin Msha<br />
Kinthaf (rogue, all discs, bard) 775 DPS (yeah)<br />
Mearis 442 DPS (using air pet still, I r lazy  :D  )<br />
Hennesy 407 DPS<br />
Aulwen 350 DPS<br />
Warrie (warrior, bard, pikestaff) 325 DPS<br />
Gildurath (ranger, bard, no TS) 294 DPS<br />
<br />
Mnat Msha<br />
Kinthaf (NO discs used at all) 503 DPS<br />
Gildurath (used trueshot) 475 DPS<br />
Aulwen (used trueshot) 468 DPS<br />
Hennesy 435 DPS<br />
Mearis 407 DPS<br />
<br />
Those are top conditions for almost all present, had lots of bards, although I was lazy and didn't make a water pet, since had a raid buffed pet from Uqua and couldn't be fussed to switch.<br />
<br />
I find it ironic that a rogue using no discs at all beats rangers who outgear him using their once every two hour discipline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">461 DPS on a msha without champion / ferocity and not maxed atk.<br />
<br />
Full ranger buff , Bard Overhaste + Lions Might , using MSC + Ykesha<br />
<br />
The fight lasted i would say under 2 minutes, since everyone was so  trying to max dps.<br />
Which means i got the best from my discs.<br />
<br />
Rogue : 688<br />
Rogue : 660<br />
Ranger : 650 <br />
Rogue : ???<br />
Rogue : ???<br />
Emilia : 461<br />
<br />
I'm sure i can break 500 on a Msha if the fight is short enough.<br />
Thats not too far from the 700-900 you can expect from a rogue under the same conditions.<br />
Considering they have pure DPS tools, while i do not.</div></div><hr />

Emilia, you outgear our melees by a fair margin I would say.  We had a rogue parse at 680 DPS using only epic 1.5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I.e comparing a rogue using his epic + a demerex vs a ranger with epic + demerex would be more useful and interesting than random numbers. Or a warrior with a Queen 2hs vs another warrior with say a Great Maul of the Mighty.</div></div><hr />

So their data isnt probably very accurate, my dps however is 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
We knew the ranger was parsing, so actually many of us tried to dish out dmg.<br />
Full buff + Bard + Lions (No Champion or Ferocity not max worn ATK).<br />
<br />
But 460 did indeed surprise me (not too much because of Dethvegi's parse)<br />
<br />
What this means, is warriors using good 2H weapons (Halberd / MSC / Etc Etc)<br />
Can dish out some pretty SICK damage, enough to make every supposed DPS class cry.<br />
400-600 on short fights (under 2-3 minutes) is very realistic in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Ps : Sorry for killing your name<br />
<br />
Ps : Even with Magelos, you dont always have sufficient data (Bard / Fero / Champion).<br />
So the only thing we can be sure of is the posters own data. (no unknown variables).</div></div><hr />
