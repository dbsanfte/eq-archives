It's pretty easy, if you kill fast enough, you even have time to Bandage yourself between fight's, and the last guy is cake.   But BE SURE to bring a Healing potion with ya.  Cause ya never know when the WoW Equivalent of EQ's &quot;You can't see your target&quot; is gonna bite ya on the ass for a few seconds, and you will be fighitng 2 or 3 at a time so the heal potion could be needed.<br />
<br />
Typically, I use a sword and board.  With this fight, I'd go offenseive with eitehr Dual Weild (if you have 2 high dps weapons for lvl 30)  or pull out a big 2h'er.  <br />
<br />
THis fight is about fighting multiple Mob's at once and then a lvl 35 mob within your time limit(Which I found to be VERY generous), so your highest DPS/quickest rage generation option is the way to go IMO.  Rage generation, and building alot of it early, was my main concern, so I went dual wield. I refrained from the temptation to execute the opponennt's once they tried to flee .. much better to save the rage for the next fight.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's pretty easy.  But If I hadn't had a heal potion with me, I'd failed the first shot because although I had my target RIGHT in front of me, THe stupid &quot;you are facing the wrong way&quot; glitch hit me, and I just stood there getting hti by 3 mobs for like 7 or 8 seconds untill I could find a spot that the combat engine thought i was facing my target.  <br />
<br />
IS that not geting VERY annoying to anyone else?  They need to fix it, I mean I am FACING my mobs and sometimes get this message.</div></div><hr />

I hate that...youre correct it is getting very annoying.  I only find it happening when Im very close to the MOB's.  If I stay back a couple feet I find Im basically ok.  When I say this I mean I have to position myself here before I get the message, otherwise you have to finagle a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">YES. Bringing a potion, and either some bandages or food, is essential. I was within 20 HP of losing the encounter. Lots of ways you can work strat - Thunder Clap would obviously be useful. Honestly you may even want to wait until level 31 or 32, just for insurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just stood out of aggro range of the fight area and pulled em as they spawned with my gun.  I dont remember them being social and coming in groups.  Single pull, kill at will, kill the boss, get your zerker stance.<br />
<br />
Was easy as pie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used alot of thunderclap, cleave, Demoralizingshout.  On the last guy, sundar is especiallyimportant.  He wa a mob 5 lvl's above me ,and I couldn't hit him for very good damage at first.  Once I landed the a few sundar's though, I was smacking him pretty hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Their prol not sociable untill youget in the &quot;ring&quot;.  So that is prol a better method.  If your in the ring though, expect multi's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you are in the ring, you are in their aggro radius anyway so yea they'll aggro the moment they pop.<br />
<br />
honestly I was surpised the technique worked but hey, I aint complaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's great.. I love how the mobs have to sit right on top of you in order for them to attack and when you try to adjust they usually just run around before landing on top of you again.<br />
<br />
Wish I could give some more feedback on the event, but I just cheated and brought my shaman =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darmok</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kind of ironic, a bunch of Alliance and Horde warriors were doing this quest when I needed to work on it.<br />
<br />
It's on a PvP server, and no one bothered each other, actually kind of helped everyone. Got it done quickly and easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't in any hurry to get the stance... I was busy doing other quests and didn't bother going for it until lvl 38 or so.... was too fun smacking them around and not once having to heal or bandage :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stood away from the circle and pulled them seperately as well.  Gave me time to bandage up in between fights, and the most I ever hard was two mobs at once, and one was half dead already.  Neat way to get zerker stance though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that may be an exploit, wouldn't be surprised if it is nerfed soon.</div></div><hr />

You can demor shout them and they will run away.  Get your DPS gear on and hamstring them, then demor shout.  They will run away from you and you chase them and beat them down.  You can do it with all the adds except the boss.  Bandage or use a Potion before his fight and you should be good. <br />
<br />
You should see folks appear as you enter the circle.  If not, its bugged and abandon the quest.  Run up to the guy in the hut and get the quest again.  GL</div></div><hr />

(Running after feared mobs beating on them = no damage taken.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The position bug is annoying, especially with my rogue solo. There's usually very little room for error, if I get this problem for more than a round or two, I'm forced to run and try again.<br />
<br />
Sounds like an interesting quest though.</div></div><hr />
