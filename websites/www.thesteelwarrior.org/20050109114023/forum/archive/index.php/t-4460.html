<br />
I give up.<br />
<br />
I can't believe the number of people I read on MB and here who think CASTERS SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS ENDURANCE THING!<br />
<br />
Un-FUCKING-believable.<br />
<br />
Shamans may buff your hit points. And clerics may buff your hit points. And druids may buff your hit points.<br />
<br />
I DON'T CARE!<br />
<br />
It will NOT HELP MELEE BALANCE TO MAKE CASTERS MORE POWERFUL!<br />
<br />
There is no fucking way a shaman should have ANYTHING to do with the endurance pool.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea:<br />
<br />
Let Warriors increase a person's Endurance pool with their own, WARRIOR ONLY, Warcry buff that lasts a good 30 minutes, and costs a chunk of their own endurance pool.<br />
<br />
Let Monks increse your endurance pool's REGENERATION rate with their own chanting MANTRA buff that lasts a good 30 minutes, and costs some of their endurance to activate.<br />
<br />
Let Rogues decrease the COST of abilities you activate in your endurance pool, through the use of their rogue-ish EXPERTISE, in the form of a buff that lasts a good 30 minutes and costs some of their endurance to activate.<br />
<br />
Make this a MELEE THING!<br />
<br />
Leave the casters out of it.<br />
<br />
It will not help balance melees ONE FREAKIN BIT to make us have to go to casters to make our endurance more efficient.<br />
<br />
It will simply fuck up the balance even more.<br />
<br />
I don't CARE THAT SHAMANS HAVE ACUMEN!</div></div><hr />

Calm down, and remember.<br />
When was the last time you told your caster to play in traffic?<br />

Natural selection is your friend</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the OTHER way I'm hoping it could or would go. <br />
<br />
Where the pool is different than mana pool. And where it acts and regens differently. And simply does not depend on buffs at all.<br />
<br />
It's definitely a possiblity. And lately, as even more monks fight me on the idea of having it be melee only (I am in shock, all the lemmings want to be dependent on shamans and enchanters for their KEI endurance equivalent ... good lord that's depressing) ... anyways, the more I see people lining up to make casters more powerful, the more I want the system to just work like a bard's mana pool, or something like that. Something where it just can't be affected by buffs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree wholeheartedly Wu, I'm sick of being so fucking dependent on casters to do anything. (at least with the advent of PoP I don't need a robe wearer holding my hand to travel anymore).  The thought of having an endurance buff the equivalent of melee KEI already occurred to me, and quite honestlyl I find the thought of it disgusting.<br />
<br />
PS:  The lemmings reference made me laugh; rare thing at work these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, the only thought about an endurance regen on a spell I've had was adding one to Spirit of the Wood, the druid AA (up to 250hp heal/tick, plus AC and a DS, 5 tick duration with a 22min re-use).  And that thought was only because:<br />
1) It's already used in AE fights<br />
2) The beastlord AA group Heal-over-time has mana regen and the cleric AA version is larger and longer lasting<br />
3) It already adds AC and a DS plus healing...which IMO help a melee a bit more than a caster, and you're more likely to want it on you anyways...this part just screams &quot;more helpful to melee than others&quot; to me :D.<br />
4) Long re-use for 5 tick duration<br />
5) Druids get no benefit from the addition, and no hybrids get access to it without a druid ^_^<br />
<br />
Acumen came up, but giving Acumen an Endurance regen would automatically give Beastlords the same, since we get Acumen at 65.  As much as I'd like it, Beastlords simply don't need it, we're already beginning to push unbalanced as our abilities work so well together.<br />
<br />
Warcry would be awesome if they changed it to an AE Endurance regen increase tho, like Beastlords have Paragon that increases mana for 6 ticks.  Monks can get a self only version (endurance mend :D )...rogues, have no idea.<br />
<br />
All I have to say is, no matter what happens, do not make a long duration/high regen spell like KEI...that spell screwed up enough as it is by making it the rule instead of the exception.  IMO, if it goes anywhere on a caster, it should be on already existing and used short-duration/long-reuse AA abilities that are not owned by a hybrid.</div></div><hr />

Hell at least spells like Invigor and Acumen will have some type of usage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">usage as shamans turning the endurance's meaning of existance to null?<br />
Imagine if enchanters could instantly replenish any other caster's mana bar, at the cost of a few mana?... would that be a usefull spell? sure would... wonder why its not ingame.. hrm...</div></div><hr />

Is that what you were going for, or...<br />
