<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havent been able to find a general discussion on the topic of AA abilities, and was curious if there were reasoned opinions about what path to take?<br />
<br />
Currently I have<br />
RS3<br />
Dex plus 2<br />
MR plus 2<br />
Metabolism 1 (ok, indecision is a terrible thing, move on)<br />
<br />
Ingenuity 3 (due to dual SoDs) (6 points)<br />
Planar Power 1 (probably a mistake) (2 points)<br />
Tactical Mastery 2 (5 points)<br />
Combat Agility 2 (6 points)<br />
Natural Durability 1 (2 points)<br />
<br />
And I have 2 points currently.<br />
<br />
Questions.<br />
How important is it to max out an AA category before moving on to a new one?<br />
If you are not currently a raid tank, nor do you expect to be one, how important are defensive AAs?<br />
<br />
Again, not just looking for opinion, but the reasons behind them.<br />
I have some thoughts about my own spending of points, and will post, but I want to get bashed on for my poor selection first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CA and LR really help basic tanking in EXP zones to somewhat of a lesser extent so do CS and ID. <br />
<br />
With your current setup I'd hit ND 3, PE, PD, CA 3, CS1 or 2, LR 1-5 and then finish CS and ID.<br />
<br />
But if you get a little bored in the defensive, feel free to wander a bit and add offensive where you like. I('m still working on defensive because I go side tracked with ferocity, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2508&amp;highlight=path)  is probably the best discussion on it I remember.<br />
<br />
How important is it to max out an AA category before moving on to a new one?<br />
<br />
Best answer is that it depends.  As an example, after ND3(and AE taunt), I did CA1, then CS1, then PE, then went back and finished CA, then CS.  But mostly I have been finishing out each catagory, then moving to the next.  Sorry that is not more helpfull, hopefully some one will come along with a better answer for you.<br />
<br />
If you are not currently a raid tank, nor do you expect to be one, how important are defensive AAs? <br />
<br />
To my mind very.  If you look at my magelo, you will see 1 offensive aa(and I would not have taken that yet if I had it to do over, I made some big mistakes early on).  First and foremost as a tank your job is to absorb damage, and anything that makes you better able to do that is a plus, and defensive AA's make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
I have some thoughts about my own spending of points, and will post, but I want to get bashed on for my poor selection first. <br />
<br />
I got a nice chuckle out of that comment.  I am not going to bash your choices, tho I will point out you have missed some all important aa's, in exchange for ones that add little to your ability.  After general AA's, most people agree that far and away the best path to start is this:<br />
<br />
ND3:  more hp's are always  wanted, and ND 3 a bunch more hp's.<br />
AE Taunt:  our class defining aa, and the best 5 aa points I have spent.<br />
<br />
I recomend past there to do the following:<br />
<br />
CA1(you are at 2 already, so done)<br />
CS1<br />
PE<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
PD3<br />
LR5<br />
ID5<br />
<br />
I am finishing up ID now, then will probably start on Ferocity next, then start working towards Flurry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say post your thought, AAs are totally up to you.  I would get all the HP ones, ND3, PE, and PD3 though. (PP kind of optional) For hps, they really do add up, and affect any hp items you aquire as well.  Other than that its up to you.  Probably one of the defensive routes then some offense.  Personally I'll probably get CA3, then some LR next, then have some fun with the offense ones.  I'm in a raiding guild, but I'm not the MT, hell I'm not the TT P, so I figure I'll mix up defensive with offensive now.  Probably will favor def still though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on your commitment.<br />
<br />
Take a look at my Magelo link for what my guild, and my guild only, not a statement of whats right, just our standards, to see what we require of tanks.<br />
<br />
And Im still not totally done with what they would like us to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Metabolism 1 (ok, indecision is a terrible thing, move on)<br />
<br />
<br />
This was your best spent AA (1st rank) next to run3. When you don't have to go back to torment to farm tormentor parts or buy them at around 300 each you will learn to love Metab3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myst will all those AAs your guild wants you to have more?  Hehe, I can't even think of what....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Now my own thoughts.<br />
<br />
For general, Metabolism 3 is the way to go.  I was indecisive after RS3, mainly because regen to me was worthless (my wife is a cleric, 30 hps a minute is a joke).  My dex would cap out from buffing (as well as sta and str) and MR, while, nice and all, was still of low value.  Metabolism lets you use the best foods (tormenter stir fry, or the party platter if you skill up) for a REALLY LONG TIME.  If i could do it over again, I would go Metab 3.<br />
<br />
Planar power, a fair waste.  due to diminishing returns on stamina after 255 and 280.  5 points of extra stamina is maybe 15 hps.  So, for 2 AA, i got 5 attack and 15 hps.  Sorry, not worth it.<br />
<br />
I still am not convinced that ingenuity was a waste, since I am using high damage procs.  Levels 1 and 2 were unimpressive, but level 3 actually has made me satisfied with the ability.<br />
<br />
At the point I am at, I am now in agreement to finish ND, and then either PE or AE taunt. <br />
<br />
The library doesnt really have a ... complete discussion of the topic, not that I found.  I am new to the board and therefore might have missed it easily however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They would like me to finish DR and Flash of Steel and also get Hastened Institagation as well as the Warcry line.<br />
<br />
After that Im pretty much free to get what I like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">generaly you get the &quot;tank&quot; aa hp avoid mitigation first as these help you tank. then you are free to play with &quot;toy&quot; aa. i get want i want because he game is about me having fun. in a guild it's about us having fun, and normaly killing bigger stuff is us fun. getting defence aa you can tank harder hiting stuff easer increasing us fun. i'm not  in a guild so currently it's about me fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zigglewort</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once I got ND3, PE, CA3, LR5 and PD3 out of the way, I was very happy to put 10 AA's into PP5 for the hit points I got from that.  Gear was getting to the point that only occasional drops from full raids or elemental planes were going to be much of an improvement.  PP was a quick and easy way to get almost 120 more hp, don't write that off too soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why people think AET is only a raid ability. I use it all the time in exp groups (or I did anyway). AE taunt kicks butt, and I get it as soon as you can, basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to echo what Tug said here.  AE taunt is usufull in every situation, group and raid.  Grouping, it helps at times on bad pulls(getting the add that resisted mez off the enchanter fast while he tries to remez), and for those times when the RNG decides to screw with you and the xlower is taking a beatdown.  As I said above, AE taunt is easily the best aa points I have spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say finish ND then do AE taunt and PE, in that order.  AE taunt is far and away the best skill out of all the classes, imo.<br />
<br />
As for planar power, you get 4 hp per sta after 255, so the 10 points you spend in PP will net you another 100 hp, not including bonuses for ND/PE/PD (which you should also look at, possibly after you get PE).   Definitely worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Endjinne</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a similar question:<br />
<br />
I finished ND3, and then got PE.  I read somewhere that PE gives a 2% enhancement to ND, CA and CS, but ONLY if you have at least the first level in these areas.  If this is true, it seems to make sense to get CS1 and CA1 ASAP to take advantage of PE.  I therefore did so.  <br />
<br />
Was I wrong?<br />
<br />
OK, next I was planning on getting PD3.  After that are there any more hp-enhancing AA's?  I realize PP is good for about 15 hp per when STA is buffed, but I am not sure that is worth it.<br />
<br />
So what next?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have ND3, PE, and PD3, the only other HP enhancing AA is PP5.  That is if you can reach 305 sta unbuffed.  Maxed at 305 sta, I think you would get around 100-120 hps.  But that's about it for HP enhancing AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Endjinne</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so let's assume I get PD3 next.  I suppose I should move on to CA3 or CS3.  Which 1st?  Is combait agility better or combat stability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think there have been arguments for both.  The consensus from most warriors seems to be that CA will get you more of a benefit than CS.  Not that CS is useless, just that most get CA first.  I guess its kind of up to you.  Check out the Library, I think there are some posts and parses on CA there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go CA and LR before I did CS.<br />
CA is just being completely missed. Both are nice but I like CA and LR more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason CA/LR is better than CS/ID IMO is because of reduction in proc damage.  Otherwise CS/ID would be better because it smooths the damage curve a bit allowing your healer to reliably heal for more without having to worry as much about damage spikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Endjinne</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
<br />
Follow-up question.  How exactly does PE work?<br />
<br />
The only thing I have found that it adds 2% to ND, CA, and CS.<br />
<br />
Therefore instead of these abilities giving you 2%, 5% and 10%, they give you 4%, 7% and 12% respectively.<br />
<br />
This would seem to indicate that if you have PE already, you are insane not to get both CS1 and CA1 ASAP.<br />
<br />
Also, all of the benefit drops on at ND1, CS1, and CA1 and that there is no real effect on ND2, CA2, and CS2.<br />
<br />
Am I wrong here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smashem</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me i looked at it like this. What good is being able to absorb dammage if you dont have the offencife to grab and maintain agro. If your healers die cause you are unable to hold agro then you will follow and  you can only absorb so much dammage before you join them on the floor. I did compleat one set at a time and found it worked out better for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;CA and LR really help basic tanking in EXP zones to somewhat of a lesser extent so do CS and ID. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true.<br />
<br />
CA/CS are about equivalent, as is LR and ID.  <br />
<br />
On a related note, you would almost always want to finish CA/CS before starting LR/ID.  Luclin defensive AAs generally give you more bang for your buck than PoP defensive AAs<br />
<br />
A WAR can probably flip a coin in terms of which to get first.  Granted, many believe that the reduction in proc damage / stun gives the nod to CA, but that is generally not a significant amount.  <br />
<br />
If a hybrid, on the other hand, was going through that decision process, CA might be a better decision as they also cast spells in combat (e.g. less interrupts).  Again, it generally isn't a huge margin though<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Luna has it exactly right.  CA and CS reduce the same amount of damage taken over time, and ID and LR have the same effect.  For further reference, go the The Library and ready Sccaley's LR/ID parse.  The difference is that to max CA or CS takes 12 points each, while LR and ID take 15 points each, making CA and CS a better bargain.  You will want to get all of them maxed eventually tho.<br />
<br />
For me i looked at it like this. What good is being able to absorb dammage if you dont have the offencife to grab and maintain agro <br />
<br />
If you are having agro issues, then looking at offensive aa's might not be a terrible thing, but unless it is a real issue, I tend to think that defensive aa's are the way to go first.<br />

But I'd think two SoD makes this a mute point. . . <br />
<br />
I went with RS 3 and Innate Sta 5. So lets say you have your sta capped.  You get a helm that gives you 10 more sta. This leaves you room to get rid of a item with lower AC/stats/ or no effects that has 10 sta on it and upgrade it with an item with better stats without having to worry about losing any HP. yeah it's only 40 HP, but Look at LDoN, people are spending 1000+ points for a 40 HP aug.<br />
<br />
And If I remember right, ND, PD work off of your &quot;BASE&quot; hp not direct HP from items, so having more sta makes those AA more worth while.<br />
