<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure that everyone has noticed that the spells from 61 to 65 were added with no thought on the part of the developers.  They simply looked at the 50 to 60 spells of each class and did a +5 to each.  This simply does not cut it.  Worse is that they cant spend 20 min to figure out 5 new discs for us from 61 to 65?  If they plan to have a new expansion at least put some thought into class progression and think up something NEW not this BS you have been feeding us.  <br />
<br />
I have taken the liberty of comming up with a few ideas for class spells feel free to add your own.(provided they are not retarded)<br />
<br />
shaman- can cast berzerker freenzy on a warrior that will last for 36 seconds and make them berzerker freenzy<br />
<br />
Necro/sk- can cast a spell on naked lvl 65 charaters and they will return to their corpse with res effects. (confirmation box and uses reagent)  also a lifetap proc aa similar to slay undead<br />
<br />
mag-real Cold and fire AOE's and 8 dmg summoned arrows<br />
<br />
enchanters- Lure root neg 1000 resist  fixed duration 36 seconds.<br />
<br />
warriors- 5 new discs relating to real offecive dmg output.<br />
<br />
pally- ch with 18 sec cast time<br />
<br />
druid- give them more atk debuffs that are not all based on the same resist<br />
<br />
clerics- hmm i have 2 and a half pages of hotkeys atm on my cleric with max aa don't know what else they could possibly want<br />
<br />
monks- give monks a little red waggon to put their pp in and remain underweight<br />
<br />
rogue- beter offencive dmg disc<br />
<br />
Thats all i can think of atm.  <br />

<br />
ROFL I was thinking the same thing.<br />
<br />
While I wouldn't disagree with the enchies getting a low / no resist root, if the enchies were given a *Lure*, then it would be only fair if the wizards get at least Clarity2 :p.<br />
Actually give the lure root to the wizzies and give the enchies a better pet. :)<br />
One that's not that flimsy sword/shield thing and lasts for more than 0.002 seconds. Actually.... just make it commandable so they can get it off stuff.<br />
<br />
/sits back and waits for the screams.<br />
<br />
I see Warriors and Wizards on much the same fence you know.<br />
Entirely different classes, but suffering from much the same misconceptions (Prejudice even) about them.<br />
<br />
I will freely admit that I don't know much about the warrior class, other than hopping on a friends tank when we need more muscle and he's not available. <br />
That's why I lurk here, after all, so I can learn some stuff.<br />
If I jump on the tank then it's just /target mob /attack while I play an ench or wiz or cleric on the other box. <br />
(No, not *that* kind of jumping, Dima. Get that mind out of the gutter :p)<br />
I haven't the foggiest idea about disciplines, nor the AA abilities, so I would never presume to tell a warrior how to do his/her job.<br />
There are a lot of very good warriors out there and we will lose them if nothing is done to enhance the class, because even the most determined will eventually lose faith.<br />
<br />
I also think that the warriors got the shaft when PoP and LoY came out, and something has to be done to rectify that.<br />
<br />
Actually I think that a lot of non-casters or hybrids were left out when those expansions came out.<br />
<br />
I should probably read this before I hit send but my boss is on the way lol.<br />

Its pretty easy to look at the 50-60 spells and upgrade them and thats what they did.  <br />
<br />
Wizards-  3k cold nuke that only works mobs immune to fire damage. <br />
<br />
Bards-  how about a duration tune to make their slow and mez more effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anatis</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutall, I have to disagree on the 3k nuke. (For one thing that would be an aggro magnet.)<br />
<br />
Wizzies already get a 2k nuke with restriction for dragon/giant and a hefty reagent requirement to cast it.<br />
I play(ed) a wizzie. The last thing I'd want is another &quot;it's a great spell but you can only use it on Fridays, on an uneven day in the calendar, at 3am, and only while grouped with 3 druids, one of which has to be an ogre&quot; type spell.<br />
It takes up room on the cast bar and I wouldn't waste that on something I may or may not use. I'd rather put one there that I will use and not mess around with swapping more spells.<br />
(I usually have Harvest / Root / Evac permanently memmed, as well as a magic ds rune in a raid, and possibly concussion - so slots are at a premium and I already swap a lot.) <br />
<br />
But that lure root with fixed duration... To be honest, I think both the wizzies and the enchies would like that. I really think it's a good idea. :)<br />
Heck I think any caster would love that. :)<br />
That would be a permanently memmed spell.<br />
<br />
(I'm trying not to upgrade / fix but think new)<br />
Bards - maybe an illusion song?<br />
<br />
I know it was said somewhere above that more discs wouldn't cut it for warriors, but maybe with the length (and strength) of PoP encounters lowering the timer on them a bit would be useful?<br />
Or make them last a bit longer?<br />
<br />
Would a disc that gives some kind of stacking DS be fun to have? <br />
It would probably be a waste of a discipline tho, I'm guessing.<br />
Or how about one that adds a specific proc to a non proccing weapon? i.e. a lifetap, like boon does, but without the illusion, or stacking with it? (i.e. double the tap)<br />
<br />
Actually come to think of it, a stacking DS song for bards might be fun.<br />
<br />
It was unfair to non casting classes to not have *something* added for them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely think that any new disciplines are completely useless unless Evasive and Defensive are moved to their own timer.  I simply will not use offensive discs except in optimal situations because I always want Ev/Def available.</div></div><hr />

I think it's best for them to work with pets and summon, like more original pet only buffs, like a 90hp group heal proc on water pet, or a fire pet that really cast lure based nukes...<br />
<br />
<br />
For us warriors, I think a great thing should be to have separate disc timers on short and long duration disciplines. Also decrease the reuse time on discs like aggressive at 65...<br />
<br />
And delete Warcry. transform Fearless in a warcry type ability (at 61 this disc affect all the group, yada,yada, yada...)<br />
<br />
Upgrade resistance disc, too. let it increase resists by 1 point per level, so the reuse time would be justified.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's the point on having disciplines we cannot use because we need to keep our class defensive discipline disponible ? Does wizards refuse to memorise root because they wont be able to nuke ? they have 8 slots !</div></div><hr />

Caster's dont need anything new.Any wizard worth his salt will have concussion up to reduce aggro and he will blast away with impunity. <br />
Enchanters have the BEST Pet spell in the game. I watched a 65 chanter SOLO in west tower in BoT with a charmed giant. They dont need shit improved upon<br />
Pallys dont need a Cheal, Christ they can heal to full on a whim when they want. <br />
Monks crying about plat. Lord in heaven havent they cried enough? Your a monk deal with it. You already have your old mitigation back.<br />
Rogues have SoS. Hiya mr god im right underneath ya and I can backstab for up to 3k Please give me more damage output.<br />
Sk's/necro's well. it'd be neat if they could charm or control undead they meet. Kinda like chanter but undead only class allowed. <br />
Warriors.. Umm more damage output.. better mitigitan.. Lower reuse timer on disc's.. Maybe 2 mins + duration for reuse. . I pop disc that last's ten second's after which my disc's become useable in 2 minutes ten seconds.. not 51 minutes. None of these make me invincable or crap you know. <br />

<br />
Once you commit to what style you are fighting in, you must wait three minutes before changing style (except normal).  It takes a lot of energy to be in these different modes and a lot of mental focus.<br />
<br />
You can choose from:<br />
<br />
Defensive<br />
Evasive<br />
Normal<br />
Precision<br />
Aggressive<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Make it so that at level 61-65 there is one less minutes between disciplines.  Yes, that means you can pretty much be nonstop evasive at 65.... if you want to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things i would like to see :<br />
<br />
Unhook the /discs. Like stated before, not having defensive/evasive up practically makes us worthless. Hell, i don't even fight a mob if i'm next tank, much less wanna use a disc.<br />
<br />
Decrease the /disc timers on some of our more &quot;useless&quot; /discs. Fellstrike is fun to use when trying to get big crit/crips but i'm not gonna waste a half hour of time unless it's an exp group or something i know i won't use defensive for. please, reduce the timers.<br />
<br />
355 stam aa. much like the int caster aa to increase thier intelligence by 50, i would like to see one for warriors. adding an addtional 50stam isn't gonna make or break tanking. at most you will gain 300hps with all the hp aa's? might even be less than that.<br />
<br />
Endless Quiver!! our archery sucks. carrying around 8 stacks of arrows sucks, bugging mages for arrows sucks. I carry enough utility items around to fill up alot of 10 slot bags and i don't need to carry a full bag of arrows every night. there is no money in making arrows. It's not like we are rangers doing hellified DPS with arrows. This is just a simple aa i would pay 9 points for in class to get (not to mention give me a reason to get my goofy marshall title).<br />
<br />
Increased weapons? i dunno what VI has in mind for this, but i hope they don't screw it up. We tank, monks and rogues do the damage melee wise (rangers if they bow also). Maybe give us a little boost to help stackability of warriors on raids, but don't overdue it. If i wanted to do damage i would make a wizard or a rogue.<br />
<br />
That's about all i see we need. I'm pretty happy with being a warrior, but these would up the fun factor of being a warrior for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two options:<br />
<br />
1) Warriors need to get ALWAYS ON stances. Aggressive and Defensive. These give us a role where we're not Main Tank (increased DPS) and allows us to excel at melee mitigation (when we tank) but allows Pallies/Sks to have the title of taunt masters.<br />
<br />
2) This can also be done by modifying the current discs.<br />
<br />
Defensive<br />
Evasive<br />
Precise<br />
Aggresive<br />
<br />
These 4 discs should be always on. When you disengage the discs a timer runs until you stop being in that mode.<br />
<br />
So use /precise all night, but when you stop using it, a timer runs for say 3mins then you can stop and change, although not use the same disc for another 3mins.<br />
<br />
Basically when you stop using a disc, you have 6mins till you can use it again, or 3mins to use another. This at least adds a bit of tactical thinking involved.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike<br />
Mighty Strike<br />
Charge<br />
Fearless<br />
Furious<br />
Fortitude<br />
<br />
These need to be revisted, with duration and reuse modified. As someone said, these do not make me invincible (well except Furious =)).<br />
<br />
Having Precise and Aggresive always on gives us a big offensive boost, with the downside we cant tank (useful when we're second war in group, or alongside a pally) and the added complication it will take 3mins to change stances.<br />
<br />
Something along these lines I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raladil</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pally- ch with 18 sec cast time <br />

<br />
I am a paladin, and I have to say, in big, bold, red letters....NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It would be extremely overpowering. Paladins would basically be able to solo anything that doesn't summon with c3+. Root, cheal, cummon back and fight. Would be sick. Two, we might be stuck into &quot;Pally cheal rotations.&quot; I played a Paladin for a reason - to tank, and occasionly save someone's arse. Three, if we were infact put into Cheal rotations, it would be disasterous.<br />

CHeal on Warrior! Raladil, your up!<br />

Fizzle<br />

Cast on Warrior's corpse.<br />
<br />
If you have ever played a Paladin, you'll notice that at that crucial moment, our sucky fizzle rate rears its ugly head. What I would like to see is a useful disc. Let's review Pally discs.<br />
<br />
<br />
/Disc Resistant: Completely useless. Only time I ever put it on was on a Vox raid. 10 points makes NO difference.<br />
<br />
/Disc Fearless: Again, where are ya goin to use this? Aerin/Rydda Dar? Name another situation where 10 seconds of &quot;Fearlessness&quot; would be useful.<br />
<br />
/Disc Holyforge: Only halfway useful disc. However, the raise in damage output is almost nonexistant, and it pretty much eye-candy.<br />
<br />
/Disc Sanctification: It's called divine aura. That extra 10 seconds my save your arse from a train, and MAYBE help in pullin Trak, but other than that, useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, let's see a few of the actual USEFUL discs.<br />
<br />
Warrior: Defensive/Evasive. Speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
Ranger: Trueshot - Large increase in damage output.<br />
<br />
Shadowknight: A few interesting HT discs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I say all classes really need an upgrade in the Disc area however. Warriors might as well not have the other discs, as they don't want to blow a disc in case the MT falls and they need to switch to Defensive/Evasive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hah, just realised this is the Warrior board.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowknights say the same thing regarding their disc also.  If they could give an offencive disc or two to both of these classes it would improve play alot.   <br />
<br />
Altering disc timers is another area that should be addressed for warriors. <br />
<br />
I hear you about pally ch Raladil ,  much too much for them,  maybe a reverse lich type spell would be more realistic. hp for mana insted of the other way around.<br />
<br />
warrior pally and sk could all get a resist proc spell that would be nice for certain encounters.<br />
<br />
Anatis, the cold nuke could be limited to sol tower and fire, i think every mob in those zones are taged as immune.  I don't have as much experiance as you playing a wiz, but i have played enough to know that big nukes are fun.<br />
<br />
Shaman need some fun things added too.  maybe give shaman some REAL potions that are in demand.   Res potions for 1k are not out of line imo.<br />
<br />
Could they add pally/sk defencive and make duration 1 min without steping on warriors toes?<br />

<br />
http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13688<br />
<br />
The SKs have been talking about that recently....the majority of us say we don't want or even need it.  Others realize that there would be absolutely no need for warriors in the high end game at all if SK/Pal got anything close to defensive.  The rest of us just want Death Touch instead. ^_^<br />
<br />
SKs get one disc for HT...Unholy Aura...adds 50% dmg to normal HT and puts it on disease resist.  At 60, provided you have no HT AA (which we didn't receive until PoP), this turns our normally lame 1001hp HT to a slightly less lame 1501hp HT with a slightly better chance of landing...I think I managed to scrape 2% off the mob that time.  Our level 60 one (Leech Curse, heals us for every point of melee dmg we do) lasts about 12 seconds and wouldn't be all that bad, except for our horrible miss streaks that we seem to have.  blah<br />
<br />
For paladins to get CH, in order to make it balanced, they'd have to make it 20secs, do 3k healing, and cost 1000 mana. ^_^  Then we can put them in a huge paladin chain and let the clerics do dmg with their unresistable hammer proc (hey, my main's a SK and alt's a cleric, I can dream of enslaving those pallys once in a while, can't I?).<br />
They already get a mana to hp conversion (opposite of lich), it's called Breath of Tunare (and the lower level version, Divine Purpose). Not very widely used tho...<br />
<br />
I think Struan_Xev hit the answer on the nail (IMO).  Not only release the single timer for all discs...but turn the major 4 (the ones with 3 min duration times) into toggles.  This is just like what they were wanting to do to Slay Undead for pallys until they whined enough (good job pallys, you traded a chance to do even more dmg just because you liked the pretty numbers /clap).<br />
<br />
Each toggle would do pretty much the same thing as the disc did, except without the duration timer.  It'll either be on or off, with a timer between the use of each.  This will allow warriors (and rogues and monks) to use their short duration discs (the 4xdmg, auto-riposte, auto-dodge, etc) to their hearts content (especially with the timers separated).<br />
<br />
Think about it...a warrior is supposed to be the tank right?  What happens when he's not?  How do you switch from tanking to doing dmg?  Except for switching to 2hs/2hb, there isn't (AFAIK).  I think warriors should have a choice:<br />
<br />
1. Lose high dmg to gain mitigation/avoidance (defensive/evasive)<br />
or<br />
2. Lose high mitigation/avoidance to gain dmg (precision/aggressive)<br />
<br />
Is this a good idea for the discs or no?  Comments would be nice, but I know this is just an expansion on ideas already brought forward by a few others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dangit, you made me register.  Long-time paly reader of the steelwarrior.  <br />
<br />
Paladins do not need more healing, especially a CH style heal.  We are very good now (though I do disagree that we can heal to full on a whim - sure everytime LOH refreshes we can).<br />
<br />
I think most Paladins would agree that we are good now and love needs to go to our warrior brethern.  However, any warrior changes would have to be looked at in context to how it would affect us.  <br />
<br />
I will not even begin to post about what a warrior needs -  you all know better then I do.<br />
<br />
edit:  I would like to see disciplines worked across the board.  I also would like to see discipline timers for all melee/hybrids be disconnected from each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krunt</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see allot of good ideas here.<br />
<br />
What I haven't seen though is why defensive and evasive?  Right now i have a three page list of mobs with there DBs and DIs printed out so i know which would be more effective.  How is this fun?  Just combine the two.. maybe have them to 60% of what they do now but they do it at the sime time.  Same thing with percise and agressive.  Throw that on a toggle switch and now we are having fun.<br />
<br />
As it is right now i never use discs in exp groups.  I save up a fortitude for when the cleric, too bussy bashing with that hammer, gets lazy in hour three of the grind and missed the shammys message that slow got resisted again.  Silly cleric starts the heal way too late and by hitting that disc we save a wipe.  Only real use for discs in exp groups IMO.  After all, if I need defensive to exp there then im not going to be exping for long.<br />
<br />
What I would realy like to see is a 12 second GRAB ability.  Call it an uber taunt or what not, but just being able to hit this grab button and have the mob face me no matter where i go.  Make me move at a walk or something but as a warrior when someone else is pulling and thier FD fails as well as my quick taunt, having the mob just run past me sucks.  I always felt a bad ass warrior should just let out some beastial cry and just jump on the punk.  &quot;Sorry MoB_001, you are comming with me&quot;.  <br />
<br />
This would be highly usefull in those situations where whatever you are fighting is getting knocked into a place you don't want it to be.  No more having the raid run around the mob in circles knocking it one way then knocking it the other.  Also no more having to run away from the mob and sitting down to get it to chase you (for when your group is doing there job, doing just enough damage to get agro if you move away but not enough to pull the mob off you when you are near).<br />
<br />
Sure this would also come in handy to just save the day everyonce in a while when you can get a garunteed 12 seconds of full taunt.  Maybe not even have the agro, just have it face you and the mob can hit anyone dumb enough to have more agro then you and still be infront of it.  Put a three minute refresh timer on it.   Long enough so that if your group/raid isn't going to make it wihout the grab then you guys just aren't going to make it, but also short enough that you are not afraid to use it.<br />
<br />
I dunno, maybe its a dumb idea but i always felt when tanking a mob that i shoudl be able to just grab it sometimes, make it unable to ignore this dwarf gnawing on its ear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
add a new disc at 30 that lasts for 15 min and has a 14 min reuse timer (read as always on if you want it on) that has the effect of adding 5points of hate per level per hit.<br />
<br />
change aggressive, defensive and evade to styles. this would allow them to be used at will and allow them to stack with the other disciplines.<br />
<br />
make the new disc run on a seprate timer from the others.<br />
<br />
If tweaked properly I think that it would almost solve the problem that is hybrid insta agro.<br />
<br />
only other thing that I could see that might need to be done would be to increase the frequency of successful taunts and the ammount of agro generated by it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the aggro from them is actually quite significant already - no not Paladin stun type significant but enough. A few times lately I've been NDT-ed and wondering why my aggro is not what it normally is, remembered I have to kick not bash, kicked and hey - I have aggro like I should again. <br />
<br />
Also wanted to say I agree with the idea on making a separate timer for the four disciplines Defensive, Evasive, Aggressive, Precise from the others. <br />
<br />
I also agree with whoever said they just keep fortitude up for exp groups. Buying those few seconds when the cleric is asleep is invaluable. Its also very very useful when the puller gets adds and runs them to the group. AETaunt, Fortitude - you just bought the chanter time to mez something or caster to root some and saved the puller from death. Would like to see the reuse on that lowered somewhat. Sometimes use up FellStrike for a laugh if I'm confident in the group I'm in.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and Furious, woot! Haha for farming green mobs that disc is just such a laugh. Pull 20 or 30 mobs, use it, riposte like a nutter, then SotW myself from Druid on the other account and let whatever is left die on the 90pt DS. Hahahahahahahahahah!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is quite far from the truth. The change was that SoE/Verant (whatever the hell it is now) thought that SU3 was &quot;overpowering&quot; and thought that we should have it as a toggle and sacrafice defense to put out the same damage SU3 originally had. The paladins who already purchased this AA were outraged, as it is extremely underused (undead are nearly non-existant in raid encounters) and not THAT overpowering.<br />
<br />
/derail off<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think Warriors simply having a &quot;style&quot; instead of a discipline would be awesome. It would make the class a bit more versatile as well as making them more useful in a raid situation. I am all for that :)</div></div><hr />

SHM : Alchemy how about some useful Regen and Haste potions. (only useful spells you cant get with long duration)<br />
<br />
Disc timers , why do we have all the discs linked? we already have a trade off when we /disc<br />
i.e. defensive our DPS goes to crap <br />
Evasive same thing <br />
Aggressive our DPS goes up but so does the damage we take, <br />
so why have the added penalty of having them all linked ? were not &quot;always the main tank in xp groups&quot; toggle discs is a great idea, Fighting style is what they have implemented in  Shadowbane (http://www.shadowbane.com/) you choose the style of fighting you want not just hit the melee key then kick taunt and wait, after 60 plus levels shouldn't we have learned how to fight in styles other than swing kick taunt get hit rinse repeat ?<br />

Melee dmg increase, actually this is being worked on  http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view  (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55816/)  near the bottom.<br />
<br />
excerpt from that page - 5)  Class Balance<br />
<br />
We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall. <br />
<br />
As for adding PoP melee weapons I'd love to see a decent stat weapon for Warriors / Rogues with a real lifetap effect, might give us the chance to solo velks at 65 again. War/Rog are about the only classes that can't solo XP (I understand the reason behind the idea, I also know if I wanted to solo I could have made a Wiz, were Warriors were not meant for that but a Pal/Sk can solo xp in PoS then tank for a group) but allowing us to solo even lite blue mobs for minimal xp isnt a balancing issue, its allowing us to get xp even in small amounts to keep up when no grps are available, Id love to keep up in levels instead of,<br />
/ooc  62 War LFG &lt;Cricket&gt; &lt;Cricket&gt;<br />
casters get KEI that allows them nearly unabaided soloing for 2 hours, regen of any sort = 20 mins tops, &quot;Call this Balance?? &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like to keep my wishlist simple then there is a better chance it will get implemented:<br />
<br />
1.  Separate timer for the 3min discs: defensive/evasive/aggressive/precise<br />
<br />
2.  Reduced reuse timers for the other discs, down to say no more than 10-15 min.<br />
<br />
3.  Maybe create some new discs for levels 61-65.  Be creative, but follow the separate timers mentioned above.<br />
<br />
4.  Do something about archery.  Either give us EQ AA skill at the class level, or maybe add an item that summons stacks of arrows that warriors can use (maybe a tinkered item perhaps?).  I don't care if they are 1dmg as long as they are magic.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the whole idea of &quot;styles&quot; which would be toggled on or off I think this would be far too big a change to the warrior class and would be unbalancing within our class.  If this was implemented there would no longer be any reason to have defensive tank switches on long boss mob fights.  The warrior with the most AC/HP/levels/AA points/etc. would be the one chosen to tank the entire fight because there would be no timer expiration for defensive/evasive.  <br />
<br />
Do we really want this?  SA warriors would be relegated to only tanking adds and there would be a division within guilds between the number 1 warrior and all the others.  Maybe that is what people want to happen, but I personally think it would be move in the wrong direction for warriors.  As it stands now you are forced to share tanking duties on long fights and I think that actually helps to keep all your warriors fresh and actively involved. <br />
<br />
If I were to vote, I would say we stick to our guns and push hard for the separate timers on defensive/evasive and not try to ask for something that will be too drastic a change (and thus make our requests get completely ignored) like the styles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm just thought about some disc's that woud be a bit unbalancing like the Invul type disc and auto riposte etc. types.<br />
<br />
At the very least have disc's that can be permanatly enabled perhaps new ones like one offensive and one defensive... and for classes that will be almost always offensive give them some other kind of disc instead of def perhaps. I can't see a rog spending much time defensive so they might prefer something else.<br />
<br />
War perm Defensive would be about right IMHO great mitigation and he can go offensive in xp groups to kill faster etc.<br />
<br />
Anyhow that is my 2 bits..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best idea I've seen is to make the disc setup to do the following:<br />
1. After using a disc, re-use time for that same discipline is the normal re-use time we have now.<br />
2. However, after using a discipline (any discipline), we only have a 2-3 minute timer (can be extended a bit or lessened) before we can use a different discipline.<br />
<br />
This means you can use the auto-riposte to save your life if needed in an emergency, and only have 2-3 minutes before you can use a different discipline.  However, if you want to use auto-riposte again, you'll have to wait 56 minutes (the normal current re-use time on the current situation) before you can use that same disc.<br />
<br />
You still won't be able to use more than one at a time, and with the time between different discs you won't be able to chain the auro-riposte and auto-dodge.  This setup would, tho, allow you to use your offensive disciplines without real worry that you'll not have your defensive disciplines available soon.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know this would be a major change to how disciplines work...and I know it would require a good deal of re-coding, so I'm just tossing this idea out there with other ideas.  My mind seems to be working overtime on random ideas...I'm probably gonna have a headache soon. =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradin</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some suggestions.  Cap KEI.   Its  pain to wait behind the noobsin line and its an abusive amount of power.  It also makes no sense thatC2 is capped and C3 isn't.  I would suggest a planar LVL 46 cap or evenhigher maybe 51.<br />
 <br />
As for the melee abilities as a plain 61 warrior I think several things could be done to help us out:<br />
 <br />
1) Reduce the refresh times on our disciplines.  My disciplines while flashy and neat should be able to be switched according to my foe.  I ould suggest that the following be switched to ten minutes or less.  I mean they are fighting styles and you ought to be able to switch styles at will.  <br />
Mighty strike - really flashy but with mobs HP this wouldn't cause<br />
problems.   Defensive as well.  But the disciplines are really fighting  styles and ought to be adjustable from opponent to opponent.<br />
 <br />
2) Reduce the cost of some AA for some classes.  As a Warrior I am supposed to be the skilled one.  I ought to have a discount for certain defensive AA's<br />
 <br />
3) damage mitigation and HPs are always welcome!<br />
 <br />
4) increasing the weapons themselves is only going to benefit those who can get them.  Your game is forcing many to move to uber guilds and killing the small guilds as it is!  This should not continue.  I am for improving warrior only weapons some of the pally weapons rock<br />
 <br />
5)  Raising warrior mitigation and taunt might fix the Knightly advantage that paladins have .  Consider raising warrior skill caps.</div></div><hr />

That Actually makes some sence, something SOE doesnt have a clue about.<br />
I think they should Raise the Piercing cap for Warriors aswell I mean common, Y cap it at 240 there are some real nice piercing weapons for warriors out there. Guess they did that to make Rogues happy, but for reall I group with a Rogue friend alot hes 65 with close to 100aa's and ive seen him crit close to 2k not like A Warrior will do that Raise the damn Piercing cap geezzz. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What needs to be done by developers is they need to read this and other class boards and actualy have some interaction with the people who play the game, rather then just assume they know what people want.<br />
<br />
Why would you think this is not the case Robok?  I see all kinds of ideas here.  Most of them would be unbalancing.  I have seen many ideas posted on the steel warrior put into place by SOE. /Shield and making AC matter again just to name 2.   <br />
<br />
Just above what looks like a totally innocuous idea of unhooking precise, aggressive, evasive, and defensive, would allow warriors to do ~300 dps on boss mobs for 3 minutes while still having the ability to assume a tanking role if needed.<br />
<br />
I can do 210 dps on boss mobs for 3 minutes with agressive, add another 40% damage to that from precise and it would be way way overpowered.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is simply, because ideas are posted here, and then not put into the game, does not mean that ideas are not looked at.<br />
<br />
Do the developers think that warriors need some kind of boost? I dont know, but if they feel we are balanced now, then no matter how great your idea is, they are not going to add more power to our class.  Personally, I think warriors are just fine right now, so while all these ideas are pretty nice, they simply are not needed to make warriors a viable class at the moment (at least at the level I play at)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is if they even bothered to make /discs stack in the first place~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and btw for those worried I believe he means doing ~300 dps while stacking /discs, something that is currently impossible.</div></div><hr />

I think, actually, having the four long duration discs on one timer, while the short ones are separate (see my idea above, 2-3 minutes to use a different one, but normal reuse time for that same one, as an example).<br />
<br />
Either that, or they could lower the reuse time on Taunt for warriors to about 3-4 seconds.  Or make the stun on Kick about as much agro as the Paladin spell Stun.  Lots of ideas on this MB, I know several here have wracked their brain coming up with various ideas that could give warriors a needed boost in desirability for experience groups.  I'm done.</div></div><hr />
