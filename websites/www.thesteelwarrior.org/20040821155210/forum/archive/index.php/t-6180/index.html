<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure here. Maybe if they charge for it in AA's like they have with warriors to obtain the HP gap I wouldn't mind to bad. It's 60AA's for us to get 500HP. I am guessing this would have been our form of the self only buff but since we do not cast it went to AA's. I could see a half defensive maybe. Would need to have the 60ish AA requirement to get the full 1/2 though. Not something that is just handed out.<br />
<br />
Looking back at other post though maybe a stun that will work on that level mob and cost60aa's might be more appropriate....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they should not have it.   Its one of the few things we got in our favor.   <br />
<br />
Their knights if they get anything and I am against it.   It should be  like a shield parry that forces them to use a shield type modification of  the defensive abililty.   Force them to give up all that cool AA like knights advantage for 2handers and not give them anything in return.  Even then how much of the pie do they want to have?   If they do this though should improve ours even further to be fair.   But even with these ideas I am against it.<br />
<br />
You don't hear warriors bitching about LOH giving them double  Hit Points.  They spells are useful despite their claims.   Stun procs, DD procs and heals yeah that's utterly worthless.  Play a warrior if you want defensive its a core ability of our class.    I agree with Kamce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Opposed.<br />
<br />
If they get defensive, I want to be able to have LoH, HT, and about 10 spells of my choice to be chosen from the pally and sk spellbooks.<br />
<br />
If, after the new expansion has been farmed a bit, there is still a serious problem with knights tanking in GoD, I may rethink my stance on this.  However, as things are right now, most of what I've been seeing is a convenient smokescreen to hide the real agenda, which is getting knights (particularly paladins) back to the top of the tanking heap.</div></div><hr />

Knights should *not* get a new discipline because they cannot effectively tank 3? 4? encounters.  That's less than 1% of all known content.  If &lt;--- big if, anything is changed, adjust the encounters and not knights.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Corrected first post to reflect additional information. Paladin DPS is such a small percentage of group DPS it's immaterial - no meaningful drawback. Paladins have stated the only spells they cast when MTing are stuns to retain aggro. Stuns are fast and need not be chained to hold aggro - no meaningful drawback. SK's of course would HT, etc prior to using - no meaningful drawback.<br />
<br />
Essentially this is intended to allow Knights to MT high DI named mobs like a Warrior and for the mobs to die using a Warrior Defensive mechanism tricked out with insignificant drawbacks while they keep their full supply of mana. It is not consistant IMO with maintaining Warrior specific advantages vs. high DI mobs found in Defensive and the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change. A DI manipulating mechanism Knight's have never had in any form.<br />
<br />
Whats_his_fish would have told you these facts, but he was too busy being pissed off and helping Paladins create near meaningless window-dressing drawbacks for a Warrior Discipline Knights should not have in any form.<br />

With the exception of CT, and possibly Innoruk in time there isnt much reason at all to ever have a Paladin or SK tank over a warrior for named mobs, yes there is an aggro gap (that gets smaller as you approach high end) but its not enough to warrant a loss of survivability.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Half the spellbook, thats the price! I am sick to death of not being able to snare without luck, using absolute crap aggro weapons to do it, and not having a way to split spawns. That effects more than 1% of content, way more than what Knights are paying for.<br />
I still think the best way to solve the whole thing is combine warrior/paladin/shadow knight, hell we would still be weaker than any caster!<br />
<br />
Now honestly, I think a Knight -1DI and Warrior -2DI adjustment (Warrior would only get -1DI extra because of the last adjustment), is what the game really needs. To many classes are way to close in tanking ability to the three tank classes!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're looking at a fight that can't possibly go more than about 3 minutes if not done with 2 clerics (1 cleric leaves no choice but to chain HL/SL) and you're prolonging a fight, and wondering why you fail?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Fitemore, the general idea is to aim it at the playerbase that has moved on from Time, and prior to that well... no Knight pre time would even be capable of getting it.  It's not to beat out Warriors in raids, it's simply to get desireability back up to semi equal levels in very high end 1 group settings.  Hell I would be fine if it was level capped at 68 even because that would take care of the mobs that are an issue (well so far atleast, guess a level cap really depends on Qvic+ 1 group content if theres any)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;the general idea is to aim it at the playerbase that has moved on from Time&quot;<br />
<br />
If this is implemented it would not take a long time before pre-time knights scream they want a lower level version. <br />
Just like BMB was only for level 60 before SOE scale multiple versions of this spell.<br />
<br />
so what's the point now ? all our offensive abilities are going to berserkers and the defensive ones to knights ? They should keep their class specifics and stop whining about class envy. <br />
<br />
Although I would'nt be opposed to &quot;spell defensive&quot; for knights. something like :<br />
<br />
35% spell mitigation reduction<br />
35% negative spell haste<br />
3 min duration<br />
60 min refresh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It may be aimed at the player that has moved from Time but almost all pallies will want it.  I am really against this in any form.    Although, I think its central to us as a class if they were to get it should be limited it may well be avoidable with the penchant of some to complain.   If they get a form it should be the Torpor of the defensive as opposed to the Quiessense.    I  like Kaldanm's proposal of a limited spell version.   I also suggest the use of a shield as part of the equation.   A knight ducking behind his trusty shield to absorb blows is within the concept of the knight.  No 2hand that way!   <br />
<br />
Its a compromise, something they are not willing to do often on issues such as aggro while still  preserving our ability.  We may as a class have to compromise I hope not as I see this as very imbalancing.    To be honest the pally discs suck.   They rightfully should  be less than ours to some degree as they have spells and are hybrids.  Accepting what you are is a good step to happiness.   <br />
<br />
I did not raise cain about nerfing pallies ever.   But sharing our abilities would be a serious setback for us.   It would be a nerf in a sense that it takes an unique ability and makes it common.   Should they choose to do this why not raise our melee DPS to be on par with rogues?   Give anyone backstab behnd the mob?  When will it stop?    <br />
<br />
Classes all have innate strengths that are core to their class that define their very role in the game.  This would be taking what defines our very unique role in battling high DI mobs and giving it to another class.   Our defined role would be gone in a sense.</div></div><hr />

The SK HT disc has a 5 minute duration. This would require rough timing on the group part before engaging. Unless i'm unaware of a way to turn disc off once hey have started other then running out of endurance.<br />

Ok I know this is for pallys, but if thats the restriction for knights to get the weak defensive (which I am TOTALLY against and have said so here a few times), what is your drawback suggestion for SK's?<br />
<br />
 Sithanator <br />
 <br />
 When you active a disc it makes a small Icon in the disc abilities window.  Click on that icon and you end the disc.<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldnt mind a Weaponsheild type def deisc that would make other disc's unuseable for say 30 minutes.  THat would prevent SK's from using weapon sheild then switching ti a fast delay weapon and popping leechcurse.<br />
<br />
I see some warriors wanting 1/2 a knights spellbook also.  Which class and what spells?  In a raid setting I only use snare, lifetap (when needed), AoH (if I dont have fero), Zbite, and the occasional spear (which gets resisted more often than you would tink in ele planes), and FD to try to help CR's if I can.  Out of my total spellbook I use less then 1/4 of the spells at any given time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think Warriors are kidding. The point is that SK's and Paladins do get value that Warriors do not get. This insures that they are equally desired in normal experiance groups and have different raid roles than Warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors, being a narrowly confined Tank archetype get base level DPS and vastly superior survivability - limited to high DI mobs so as to not make them dominate normal experiance groups. Warriors are The Primary Tank, not like Knights primarily Tanks.<br />

Good point a nice strong DoT and Asystole on incoming and a buff pet helps out quite a bit on a short duration fight. Given most weapon parses don't show typical high-level Warrior weapon/Anger III setups vs. top SK DPS weapon/DPS aug setups or take into account the effects of SK DoTs, debuffs, and Pets - I'd guess they might have an edge.<br />
<br />
Add to this a totally random and meaningless avantage like an instant Invis item, CoS (like Cloudy Potions, any instant invis item beats Incarndine BP's and Cobalt legs all hollow) like one PoN poster cited as a meaningful advantage Warriors have over Paladins and you've proved your case.<br />

Completely agree with this Knights analysis: fix the encounter not the classes.  People are using this as fulcrum to create a GOD class (no pun intended).</div></div><hr />

They dont need a discipline with no inherint drawback.<br />
Fro, you say 25% increase casting time , yet AA abilities by themselves not counting spell haste give a bonus of up to 50% increase spell haste for casters / knights.<br />
<br />
And since we are talking about quarm farmed knights here, then how does that hurt them? <br />
Be honest. This is more what the disc if at all should look like.<br />
<br />
25% mitigation <br />
- 50% damage output<br />
- 90% spell haste<br />
+ 90% Spell fizzle chance<br />

<br />
Thats a more balance discipline for knights to get that want defensive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">A spell haste slow would overwrite focus effects on gear, as only one focus effect of the same type can exist at a time.   In other words, you cannot have Mana Pres 4 and Pres of Mithaniel working at the same time, Pres of Mithaniel will overwrite it.   The same can easily be accomplished with a disc based foci.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Perhaps that might be how it could work, though spell type foci certainly can stack with item foci, like Rizlona's or Blessing of Reverance.<br />
<br />
It's really a moot point though, since spell haste foci already pretty much don't affect the spells being cast by a knight tanking, since the foci have a minimum base cast time that is too high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sks do more DPS, cut and dried, thats the whole thing, got a bunch of Knights on the WARRIOR board lying when we got a ZILLION parses showing different! So we do more MELEE DPS, does a Wizard become worthless cause his DPS in MELEE sucks? It is IDIOTIC to not add spell DPS to an SKs total DPS output. Add the pet too, I sure the hell would be using it in 99% of the situations if I had one.<br />
I and many others are sick and DAMN tired of Knight creative math for DPS (and anyone else LYING about their class DPS).<br />
Add procs (Warriors are chained to anger/enraging blow which do ZERO DPS), while you have life tap procs on weapons (in fact 50% should be added to the class DPS for the healing effect per SOE themselves!) and don't lose any aggro. Your damn pets add DPS, and so do your fuggin spells. Get your math out of the gutter. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">You completly missed his point, SK's cant cast damage spells while tanking because we're casting aggro spells.  My pet dies very fast, even a slight breeze will kill it, the truth is an SK pet is better off kept on hold hoping it will /shield which it usually won't.  The only thing you can count as both damage and aggro is Asystole, which SK's don't use for either, when I tank stuff I use it for debuffing to attempt to cut that damage I take down just a slight amount, btw with mob dr resists it takes multiple attempts to cast stick.  The slight damage we do get off our spells while tanking (and believe me, it isn't much) is more than outdone by Warrior aa abilities.</div></div><hr />

A life tap is BETTER than additional straight up DPS, it also heals the casters/weapon wielder.<br />
Knights gonna start this BS of wanting our defensive, we start on their spellbook! Your pet dies easy? I want it anyway! I don't believe you can utilize it near as well as I will, I assure you.

What level is your SK and what are you tanking Doom?  I have trouble chaining lifetaps agains slowed mobs in BoT and ele planes.  If it doesnt fizzle they do get interrupted more often then not, and our fizzle AA's do nothing for spells above 60 which is where our best lifetaps are.<br />

Another thing is partial heals on full hits of lifetaps.  I have this happen mre then once.</div></div><hr />

What the fuck reason would I POSSIBLY have to lie about Knight DPS in relation to warrior DPS, or knight tanking in relation to warrior tanking?   <br />
<br />
I want game balance, no more, no less.  I dont' want to hurt my class, otherwise I wouldn't have spent the LAST MOTHERFUCKING THREE YEARS since WELL before you guys even realized there were problems pleading for resolutions to our class' issues.<br />
<br />
There are realities in this game.   When NOT tanking and using their apprioriate spells + pet, an SK can outdamage us no problem.   While tanking, warriors are EASILY #1 at DPS, barring harmtouch.  It's all about AA's and skillcaps.  <br />

<br />
We simply put, do more melee DPS at ALL times than knights (See every single parse on the Overlord board), and SK's only really compensate when they're not tanking.</div></div><hr />

Because for ONE set of trials, Knights and their supporters would RUIN the game. Let me tell you what is up since you don't get it. ALL Knights will get this modified defensive.<br />

The history of this game shows NEVER do one group of chars in a class get an ability that doesn't trickle down. Of course you don't want defensive, cause then every ingame MORON will play SK and it won't be a rare class anymore. Plus a bunch of IDIOTS will ruin your class rep, cough, cough (Paladins now).<br />
in case you don't get it, it will trickle down so Alan's pet class is again overpowered. That is the fact and history of EQ, overpowering the class you play if you are a major player at SOE.</div></div><hr />

Now, I might not take advantage of it, but a LOT would. We all know the bitching and whining about one group of Paladins having an ability that other Paladins don't, and no precedent for it in EQ.

I view it as fixing a problem with another potential problem.  I appreciate the sediment but I want them to address the fundemental problem: designing content without considering most players.

You're really pulling out the advanced manual on politics here, pretty soon you'll be pressing out campaign buttons and taking out newspaper and TV ads.  Already putting campaign cliches in your sig, and prepping dishonest slogans, holy crap.   <br />
<br />
Your amusing assertion that &quot;Most knights don't want&quot; simply put, just doesn't jibe with reality.   You are engaging in logical fallacies on an epic proportion.<br />
<br />
For instance:  <br />
<br />
The vast majority of Warriors that even dignify it with a comment reject it as they should <br />
<br />
This is what's called &quot;Prejudicial Language&quot;, or appeal to motive.  It's popularly used in politics, but is a logical fallacy.<br />

<br />

<br />
***Most posters on PoN have said that the 6-person encounters should be fixed.***<br />
<br />
This is outright dishonest, as I said earlier, Al &quot;I invented the Internet&quot; Gore would be impressed with your ability to fuck up reality beyond the ability to make heads or tails of it.  <br />
<br />
Most posters, MYSELF included have at one time said &quot;The encounters should be fixed&quot;, among many other things.    The implication that they said that *TO THE EXCLUSION* of other potential fixes which is PRECISELY what you've implied is god damned mind boggling.<br />
<br />
This is what is called the fallacy of Exclusion (http://datanation.com/fallacies/exclus.htm) <br />
<br />
Let's have a look and see what &quot;Most Posters on PoN have said&quot;, I mean rather than a summary from you, let's actually look and see what has ACTUALLY been said:<br />
<br />
On the encounters:<br />
<br />
Aragir:<br />
<br />
My question is simple: How long will knights need to be relegated to the status of &quot;ineffective group tanks in current content, due to poor survivability&quot; before the warriors who post here actually support a knight mitigation ability? <br />
<br />
Leifelf:<br />
<br />
The only other solution to this problem is give Knights a tanking discipline of some sorts. The question then arises &quot;what should that discipline be?&quot;<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
a) Nerf disciplines altogether or b) Give Knights a tanking discipline.<br />
<br />
The answer is not<br />
<br />
c) leave things as is.<br />
<br />
Kaev:<br />
<br />
While I also advocate a knight damage mitigation ability to allow effective tanking in high DI environments, I'd really like to see it confined as much as possible to GoD and handled via the spellbook. Spellcasting is supposed to be the primary advantage knights have to offset Warrior-specific advantages, after all. I'd like to see the spell(s) acquired in GoD, either as drop(s) or via quest(s) requiring drops off of appropriate GoD mobs. Requiring the defeat of suitable precursor content in GoD would (hopefully) minimize the impact on the rest of the game, where existing abilities already give rough parity to all three tank classes in terms of value and desirability to groups.<br />
<br />
Derringer (In about the most elaborate summary of their REAL position I've seen)<br />
<br />
I have repeatedly stated that content could address the issue, but if you must know, the real problem is that defensive has scaled with this content and our means of defense has not. If they modify the content, they are putting off the problem to further expansions. About the only thing they could do would be to make trial nameds and things you have to kill to succeed in exp groups not hit so hard. I suppose you can do that, but you can never make mobs hit harder and retain any balance, so your putting off the problem by doing this if you ever want to increase what exp mobs hit for and give the character something more then a couple hundred hitpoints and a few hundred ac to counter it.<br />
<br />
Defensive has scaled with GoD content. Our tanking skills when compared to them, and even compared with non-tank classes has not, and our heals have not.<br />
<br />
The best solution I have seen is the 25% mitigation discipline being thrown around and making it only usable in GoD+ content. With SoEs track record, I just don't know if they will do something like this.<br />
<br />
Andur:<br />
<br />
Regardless of all that, i don't want these trials dumbed down. I don't want the Zerg guilds on my server to be able to beat them because they were a tuned for a Knight (in our current incarnation) to tank. I don't really see an easy way to fix this without upgrading knights, even the people who talk about SoE having no imagination haven't given any good ideas that keep this as hard as they are, but make knights capable of tanking them.<br />
<br />
I'd really love someone to tell me what content tweaks can happen that won't make this trivial for a warrior. Make it very clear if you do try to explain.<br />
<br />
I under no circumstances am willing to give up this being a roadblock for the crap guilds on my server to balance my class. Yes, i'm selfish and probably an eliteist for that, but anything that seperates me from the Zerg guilds on my server is good. <br />
<br />
Bad enough seeing what is happening to the elemental planes<br />
<br />
Golath:<br />
<br />
You couldn't do your job and got fixed I can't do my job and I want to be fixed. How is this hard for you to understand? <br />
<br />
Tweaking content may be the answer. It may not. but Sony's idea of tweaking content is dumbing it down. I don't want easy content from a new expansion I want challenging even hard content. But I want this challenging content do be doable by all three of the tank classes<br />
<br />
Kether:<br />
<br />
<br />
It IS possible to make the changes without it being literally defensive. However I don't see how you fix mitigation without fixing mitigation. IF named mobs = more dps than trash mobs than all tanks need adequate means of dealing with them.<br />
<br />
You could give pal a Crusader's Yaulp that would basically be defensive but would do X, Y, Z for mana Q. But the point is if you are leaping 16 hurdles to do the same thing but with enough razzle dazzle along the way that it 'appears' sufficiently different you have to ask yourself if the hassle is really worth the effort and possibl problems. <br />
<br />
Lage:<br />
<br />
I think both Knight classes *deserve* at this point, a defensive disc. Not defensive - I agree that goes too far. Half defensive is great, and even potentially too much. But, I believe Knights should have tanking tools greater than that of the DPS melees and other hybrids<br />
<br />
Pretty much every Knight on PoN has tried to find a way to ensure that they'd have the opportunity to tank the encounters (and this is crucial here) WITHOUT harming warriors trying very hard to ensure warrior superiority while also ensuring their own viability.   In the course of these discussions, &quot;Fixing the encounter&quot; has been one among many potential solutions, RATHER than your *bullshit* assertion that it's to the exclusion of altering mitigation.   As a matter of fact, the only knight on that board who has an issue with a burst mitigation ability is Aeka, and it has nothing to do with your claims whatsoever, but more to do with his hope that the devs could be more creative in encounter design, and the representation that a burst mitigation change would have on the ability to design fun and different content.</div></div><hr />

There's a rather dramatic gulf between &quot;Most warriors want X&quot;, and &quot;Most intelligent warriors want X and the morons want Y, which do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't disagree one iota that my position is fairly unpopular among warriors.  I don't really care about that, since I've never been interested in popularity contests or politicking, but in real, substantive game balance.<br />
<br />
Aggro was fucked up bad in PoP, it needed to be fixed.  It didn't need to be fixed &quot;in exchange for&quot; a god damned thing, it just needed to get fixed.  It WAS fixed, AS WAS our durability spread between us and knights.<br />
<br />
Now the durability spread between knights and non-tanks needs to be fixed, as does the degree of survivability between warriors and knights on single group encounters.   <br />
<br />
The fact that Wandor had the balls to tell Brael, who has the highest AC in Everquest, higher than even any warriors to go gain more gear to have a reasonable chance survival while tanking the trials is indicative that there's a problem.<br />
<br />
It's what I call a &quot;double standard&quot;, in that we're telling the single best equipped hybrid in EQ that his gear is insubstantial for a given task, while not placing similar requirements on warriors for the generation of aggro (I've done all 3 with BoW + Symbol) , then you have two completely different standards, and there is no balance.</div></div><hr />

Have fun. Knight Defensive is NOT (I tell you this as a kindness) going anywhere.<br />
<br />
I have supported Warriors receiving &quot;-2 DI&quot; and Knights &quot;-1 DI&quot; to differentiate them form non-Plate Tanks and withdrew support only because of a determined effort to nerf Warrior advantage vs. high DI mobs. Warriors should not suport any upgrade involving DI modification until Knight Defensive is a humorous footnote.<br />
<br />
I have suppoted a Knight Weapon Shield ability just like other Warrior based hybrids get.<br />
<br />
So let's not boldly lie, misrepresent, and claim the high ground here. There are solutions that do not involve the central Warrior defining capability Defensive and it's effect on high DI mobs.<br />

2. Aggro was fucked up bad in PoP, it needed to be fixed.  It didn't need to be fixed &quot;in exchange for&quot; a god damned thing, it just needed to get fixed.  It WAS fixed, AS WAS our durability spread between us and knights.<br />
<br />
3. Now the durability spread between knights and non-tanks needs to be fixed, as does the degree of survivability between warriors and knights on single group encounters.   <br />
 <br />
<br />
1. You are dead wrong, Warriors gave up every once of utility to do one thing, TANK BOSS MOBS, SOE continued showing how stupid they are by putting it in a 6 person trial. Thats all it is, a Boss mob put into a 6 man encounter, they should have left it raid style/Uber guild-Time flag required event, requiring 36 people.<br />
<br />
2. Yep, and I would of agreed Knight aggro needed to be NERFED instead, but Alan would never allow his Paladin to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
3. 99% of the Warrior I bet agree to that statement! Hell yea its to damn close, many of are sick to death watching Rangers and Beastlords tanking stuff! Move Warriors to -2DI and Knights to -1DI (which would help on the trials also).</div></div><hr />

You act as if the spread between knights and warriors is some huge gap for ALL single group content.  The part where the knights are having a hard time is 3 mobs.  That's it.  3 mobs.  Not all single group content, not all trials, not even just the 3 Ikkinz trials, but 3 mobs (you know, the first named mob in each trial that always drops some piece of loot).

<br />
There's a reason they put these 3 mobs as the first thing you fight in each trial (3rd trial you need to do some clearing first).  It gives you the option of zoning out if the fight goes bad, allowing you to recover quickly and try again.  It also shows that if you can beat that one mob, the rest of the trial is yours for the taking.  Now, if you're telling me that knights need some sort of defensive or upgrade or whatever based on 3 mobs near an IZ, I don't know what to say.<br />
<br />
Oh, what a crime it is, that warriors can do better than knights in a single group encounter on 3 mobs in the entire game.<br />

<br />
I don't necessarily disagree with this, except we really need to look at what was accomplished by limiting it to 6 people.   What you were able to do by limiting it to 6 people was to *absolutely* place a limit on the ability to bypass previous content.  No expansion to date has been able to address this anywhere near as well as GoD has simply by putting these 6 man trials in.    I'd argue that limiting them to 6 people was about the best move for ensuring against skipped progression that has ever been done in EQ.   Once you can start fidgeting with greater numbers, you're granted much more flexibility in terms of classes, numbers, etc, and once an encounter is figured out, then it's easily doable by anyone pretty much regardless of previous progression.<br />
<br />
2. Yep, and I would of agreed Knight aggro needed to be NERFED instead, but Alan would never allow his Paladin to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
A lot of people held this view as well, and I wasn't necessarily pposed to it either.  The fascinating thing about the current issue is that it's 100% unrelated to the improvements that warriors got.   If we'd gotten ZILCH, people would be using warriors exclusively to tank these things.  The sympathy factor would've been an order of magnitude lower than it is now.   The reality is that outside of these trials and beyond, tanking has NEVER been as balanced as it is now.   What that means to me is that people will generally snag the first tank they can find, and run with it.   Paladins and SK's no longer have an overwhelming advantage that they used to have.   This is with mitigation still being pretty close (a factor of -1DI).  This is why I fail to see the threat with Knights being -5DI behind us while disced, and -5 DI ahead of others.   People don't automatically go &quot;let's use a knight&quot; even if survivability isn't an issue, why would they start when the spread is even larger?<br />
<br />
No one has ever explained this to me where the threat is.<br />

3. 99% of the Warrior I bet agree to that statement! Hell yea its to damn close, many of are sick to death watching Rangers and Beastlords tanking stuff! Move Warriors to -2DI and Knights to -1DI (which would help on the trials also).<br />
<br />
That's not a bad idea, although again, I'm trying to figure out how &quot;Having a -DI modifier which is double that of knights&quot; is reasonable in one scenario and not another, even when the spread is significantly larger and the threat of replacement is significantly lower in the one you're so vigorously fighting against.</div></div><hr />

I'm not talking about the wussy onese you need to do to get into Kod'Taz, but the 3 single group Ikkinz trials. I want to get a better understanding of your background.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have, in various group configurations.<br />
<br />
You act as if the spread between knights and warriors is some huge gap for ALL single group content. The part where the knights are having a hard time is 3 mobs. That's it. 3 mobs. <br />
<br />
Well, it's really 5 mobs, but it's the 3 encounters.   The problem is that no matter how well they tank all the rest of the encounter, if they can't tank the whole thing, they can't really tank the encounters.   I mean who the hell is going in to those encounters to kill trash and not beat the encounters?<br />
<br />
Not all single group content, not all trials, not even just the 3 Ikkinz trials, but 3 mobs (you know, the first named mob in each trial that always drops some piece of loot). The final bosses for each of these trials are EASIER than these initial 3 mobs. This whole uproar of knights needing defensive or some other sort of balancing is based off of 3 mobs out of the mobs in the entire game.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but if you cannot pass the first named mob, you're not gonna beat the trial.   While Ikk 2 (aside from the first named) is pretty easily knight tankable, the other 2 bosses aren't gonna be tanked by knights reliably enough to motivate a knight to ask them to tank.   <br />
<br />
Not only that, the first named in each trial is indeed the &quot;gatekeeper&quot;, it's insurance that the group has any business going any further.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the named in the temples in Kod are of similar brutality.  Because of this, warriors tend to be &quot;overfavored&quot; for KodTaz exp groups, as most groups want a reasonable shot at loot.   They certainly don't want to limit themselves to the raging crag or Hynid Howler.   <br />
<br />
There's a reason they put these 3 mobs as the first thing you fight in each trial (3rd trial you need to do some clearing first). It gives you the option of zoning out if the fight goes bad, allowing you to recover quickly and try again. It also shows that if you can beat that one mob, the rest of the trial is yours for the taking. <br />
<br />
We agree on this point<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, if you're telling me that knights need some sort of defensive or upgrade or whatever based on 3 mobs near an IZ, I don't know what to say.<br />
<br />
I'm saying exactly what most warriors here are suggesting, that Knights should be able to utilize drops from the content to perform their primary task during the content.   You'll notice nowhere has it been suggested by myself or Brael, or any of the knights doing this content that it should be a global, AA, or level based thing, but that it be scalable, that way these issues don't get run into again.   <br />
<br />
Oh, what a crime it is, that warriors can do better than knights in a single group encounter on 3 mobs in the entire game.<br />
<br />
Again, I must reiterate, it's looking like the complete flagging leg is gonna be required for Tacvi access.   This is NOT &quot;guild advancement content&quot; unless a guild only aspires to do Ikkinz raids for the remainder of their EQ playtime. <br />

That BB is because you are increbily shortsighted.  You at one time thought that having 1khp was better than the full time 5% mit bonus, and that Incite was shit because it didn't have a 15 second reuse time, that unlinked discs were never going to overcome &quot;Pally and SK aggro advantage&quot; and whatever other garbage you were spewing at the time.   Every word of it has been shown to be complete blather.<br />
<br />
You'd rather give away the entirety of GoD content to elemental and pre-elemental guilds, completely voiding pre-GoD progression for a huge set of the playerbase than &quot;lose&quot; something that would have no substantive effect on you, or at least none that ANYONE has pointed out to me.  This is merely another in a long, long list of shortsighted things you've come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I'm neither for nor against a Knight &quot;Defensive&quot; disc of a sort.  I honestly haven't made up my mind. <br />
<br />
But let's consider this though.  A few months ago, Warriors were screaming over the fact that Knight mitigation was too damn close to an undisc Warrior's mitigation.  Warriors wanted something that would set us apart and what we received was a DI modifier to do that.  Now, if Knights were to receive a small form of Defensive, wouldn't that be like taking two steps backwards to what we just previously accomplished?<br />
<br />
The point I'm trying to make it, class balance shouldn't be changed based on expansion, but expansions should be balanced based on current class.  If Brael, probably the best equipped Knight on all servers period, needs a 25% mitigation disc to even dare survive the trials, then perhaps the content needs a slight rebalancing rather than the class. <br />
<br />
Giving Knights a form of Defensive would radically change the face of Everquest.  You guys know that.  <br />

I could see why a knight would want a defensive type capability. Maybe they could do like they have done to warriors and make it a knight only procing defensive weapon that last maybe 15-30 seconds per proc. I can not see it as an outright equivelant if knights are only part tank though . As part tank it should reflect just that, not make an as fully capable class for the same job. Otherwise they would not have given us incite, they would have given us a discipline that was for the same hate and the same refresh time as the aggro spells used by knights with the same levels for each one.<br />

Actually, for the EXACT reason that you stated, it would be terrible, and would be the worst move that SoE could make.  <br />
So instead of changing 3 mobs, you want to change an entire class?  You want to make knights stronger so they have an easier time with 3 mobs, which will in turn make them stronger against the remaining 99.995% of the content out there?  How is that balanced?<br />
<br />
I'm saying exactly what most warriors here are suggesting, that Knights should be able to utilize drops from the content to perform their primary task during the content.<br />
Um, knights were never able to use the current dropping items to &quot;perform their primary task&quot; during the content.  It was only after getting gear PAST the current point of progression were they able to come back and safely tank everything.  It took a lot of Time farming before knights began safely tanking Quarm.<br />
<br />
I now see where you are getting hung up on this topic.  &quot;their primary task&quot;.  You seem to have forgotten that the warrior's &quot;only task&quot; is the same as the &quot;primary task&quot; of the knights.  Give knights the ability to do their &quot;primary task&quot; with the same (or close/very close to) reliability as warriors at their &quot;only task&quot;, and you'll destroy the purpose of having a warrior class at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I'm not the best equipped across servers probally the best equipped really vocal one but theres a handful with better gear than me now (Torahdane for SK's, Thorian for Paladins, and a couple others but those are some examples).  The problem with redesigning the mobs is that theres a few things you can do:<br />
<br />
1.  Shorten the fight by lowering mob hp thereby decreasing the risk of a Knight dying.  This has the effect of gimping the content and making it easier overall, this is a bad change.<br />
<br />
2.  Add a proc to remove Endurance.  This is unfair to Warriors because it removes the majority of their extra abilities (don't know about but I think of them as combat utility) and leaves them at a rather large disadvantage compared to Knights because they would have the full range of abilities.<br />
<br />
3.  Add a proc to remove mana/endurance.  This removes Incite, Defensive, Lifetaps, Knight aggro, etc... a Knight without mana is worse off than a Warrior without endurance, this would just further swing the balance in favor of Warriors.<br />
<br />
4.  Raise the DB and lower the DI.  This reduces the difference in tanking between each class, the higher the DI the more mitigation matters and thats where the true tanking difference between each class lies.  This would just have the effect of going back to more of a PoP style balance most likely and thats not good.<br />
<br />
Adjusting the encounters to be more Knight friendly without either making them easier or completly gimping them for a far lesser geared defensive Warrior isn't exactly easy to do.  Thats why a class change that basically comes down to itemization is a more appropriate fix in this situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">The point I'm trying to make it, class balance shouldn't be changed based on expansion, but expansions should be balanced based on current class. <br />
<br />
Again well put.  <br />
<br />
Frod, its not short sighted to insist they alter the scenario; if anything its long sighted to insist they not alter class balance. <br />
<br />
Its nonsensical to make a global change to a class based on the outcome of a single enounter. The idea of introducing a skill that can only be obtained from said encounter has merit; but clearly none of us believe it would be ring fenced away from the rest of that class in the LONG run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Brael,<br />
<br />
I appreciate that you fully realize the problem.  Make the encounter easier, and gimps who shouldn't be there get through.  Keep it as it is, and knights have a hard time with them.  However, your solution to the problem is similar to when Enraging Blow weapons entered the game to fix warrior aggro.  A temporary fix that, if left in the game too long, will end up breaking more things than it fixes.</div></div><hr />

----------------<br />
Exactly right. It's much better to tune some content than potentially wreak havoc.<br />
<br />
If Knights must be changed, they give up tanking ability and DPS for their spellbook. It is balanced and sensible for spells and mana to be the means of regaining some of this lost ability.<br />

Virtually any solution - including leaving the 3 mobs in question alone (not easy, but Knights can get through the flags so I'm told) beats Knight Defensive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Brael hit on the majority of the problem. <br />
<br />
The problem with having a endurance draining spell is as of now, there is no endurance regen spell, So that would temporarly out of balance. <br />
The biggest thing I have to wander is, What if there are trails ahead of these, that would require knights to be the main tank?<br />
<br />
No one seems to know just exactly whats after uqua (I believe is the last discovered zone as of now?)  So wanting a defensiveish style skill could indeed break remaining content after it.<br />
<br />
Thats the problem with wanting to redesign a class because of 3 mobs, in trials. The trials are passable. The trials can be gone through and have success with a warrior and a knight.<br />
<br />
Is it easier with a warrior? Yes. Is it harder with a knight? Yes. Is that balanced? Yes. The big question now is, Is it passable at the current level with either a warrior or a knight. And the honest answer is yes again.<br />
<br />
Yes it is passable with a warrior and a knight, It however is a bit more luck based using a knight over a warrior, However.  I havent seen any knight willing to swallow pride and go through the trials with a warrior, Heck, I'd let a time geared knight do whatever he wanted and if we got to the boss I could back up tank it.<br />
<br />
Thats one thing that I have noticed simply slip away, the idea of team work, It has come down to, Well my class can do this, blah blah blah. or I dont want a warrior in my group, I should tank as well as him, Or knights have on ability aggro .<br />
<br />
Here's the kicker, what if the Ikkinz trials where designed for two tank classes in one group to survive and win? What a novel concept? <br />
*designer1* Hey Bob I made the content so that the tank classes would have to work together to win. <br />
*designer2* oh lord, Ahahaha thats gonna brew up a shit storm, lets pull up chairs and watch the drama.<br />
<br />
I could see that happening, A lot of friends have told me they have 60ish % survival rate on trials, I wander how they would have faired if they got a second tank with them. <br />
<br />
People need to think outside the box to beat content. <br />
Knights dont need defensive intill content has been addressed as completely broken. <br />
If the best equiped knight in the game cant win in trials then a redesign would be needed, Thats not the case, Knights have won in trials.<br />
<br />
This entire subject makes me sad IRL, that because people are frustrated (which is normal) about content that is on par with time that it should be redesigned. <br />
<br />
As I said, it's time to think outside the box to see how survivability is in groups that may decide they can survive trials using two tanks instead of one. <br />

Fine here you go.<br />
<br />
Defensive in any shape or form IS what warriors have been screamed at, and the sheer amount of abuse many of us have suffered through Velious and beyond. <br />
<br />
It is our CLASS defining discipline.  If it is in any way given to knights who have used &quot;Well yopu have defensive&quot; as a arguement then what are we to get in return?<br />
<br />
All I have seen you do is bitch about knights needing defensive and yet you have not offered a single thing in return.<br />
<br />
Will you give us half our HP in a lay on hands?<br />
Or half the damage of a fully AA'd SK under his disc harm touch ( about 4.5kish - 5kish either way) <br />
<br />
No, I dont think you will, why because it breaks balance. <br />
The trials are not broken. We have determined that, Therefore they dont need defensive in any shape or form.<br />
<br />
If you start gutting the warrior class of its &quot;CORE RAID ABILITY&quot; (yes I believe thats why warriors are perfered MT in EQ for Defensive) Then what NEW core ability will we get?<br />
<br />
It will damage our abilities as a whole if our core class defining skill is given out in any way shape or form.  Let them have a weaponshield / furious esque disc for 12 - 24 seconds at best.<br />
<br />
But should you pursue this madness of defensive for knights, then I want in return a new 65 discipline that increases both AVOIDENCE , And MITIGATION by 60% without sacrificing DPS. <br />
<br />
That would only keep warriors in line as The grand daddy of all tanks in everquest. even if the disc could only be used in Gates , like the knight &quot;bitchfensive&quot; that you want.<br />
<br />
We are finally balanced, The encounters are balanced, I cant make it through them and im 9300 buffed (with tribute) And I dont see a single problem with that at all. and thats under defensive. <br />
<br />
So why do you see a problem with how its set up to be difficult for knights? After all you guys have said that lesser geared warriors can do it, and well if 9300 buffed isnt lesser, is 10k buffed? 11k? what determines it?<br />

I am sure this will balance the encounter very, very well. Every groupe which will go there have a high risk to die and then it is no problem. The warrior has to hope he dont proc fear and the knight has to hope he dont have a lucky round which total destroy him. <br />
<br />
I dont like the idea but it is effectiv the best way to balance this aslong warriors think this trials are fine for knights and keep it fair to give warriors the same % to win against nameds then knights. You still have it better because the fear can go off before he kill the cleric and so you can go on, where we are death when we get onerounded. If you dont support that knights get a higher win chance against GoD nameds you say that warriors should have near the same % to win against them an so they need to make something wich make it way harder for warriors to tank them to keep this balanced. Btw. the same % to win dont mean hat we tank as good as warriors. That our spells/disciplines are good enough to counter the advantage warriors have for tanking.<br />

You see, the thing you miss is that Warriors are The Primary Tank - not tanks that give up part of their tanking capability for spells.<br />
<br />
When ever ever anywhere has Arbosch been able to generally MT like Battleblade? Never never anywhere.<br />
<br />
Two mobs? Three? In the entire game? I can't heal, Res, etc AT ALL compared to a Paladin.<br />
<br />
You think 1 trial should have a mob that fears? Fine. Come on SoE, do it!!. I'll still tank it. Even if the many AA's I paid for fear resistance for 30 seconds is not enough to do the job- I'll STILL tank it. I tanked dragons that feared before Incite, before a wider survivability advantage, before Anger augs, and before &quot;-1 DI&quot;.<br />
<br />
I tanked Vox, Naggy, VS, Vindi, Trak, King, Queen, Ragefire, Tunare, KT, Fear, Hate, WW, ST, VT, VP, NToV, ..........<br />
<br />
I MT'd dragons with twin YKeshas, wearing CRAFTED armor, an FBSS, and without the benefit of Defensive.<br />
<br />
Look though your gear tough guy - did you tank the mobs that dropped that stuff? I think not. I think a Warrior did.<br />

A dis that reduced a knights agro to slightly better than a warriors would do that. As it stands 25% mitigation is too much, 20% would be more in line.<br />

As well we have not seen melee balanceing 2.0 yet, it will likely give some hybrid abilitys to warriors like tendon gash (snare) or head but (stun) or crushing blow (ac debuff).

I am sure you will correct me if I am wrong but high DI mobs did not reaily exist till PoP (1 year ago?). Sure you can claim a granfather clause for tanking big mobs but the mini-defensive I proposed would prevent it's use on end mobs because nothing would be gained by it while still allowing knights to tank the trials; and that would keep our survival level much above that of knights, in effect it would be unchanged.<br />

This answer show that you dont see the problem.<br />
<br />
In all this encounter where the mob feared it was no problem when you dieed. You was allways able to recover and get next tank in.<br />
<br />
In a groupe situation you can not do this. The moment you get feared. The mob will turn on healers and if you dont get aggro back in 2 seconds the cleric will be death. In the worst case you lost 100% of your healing force in 2 seconds. In the best way you lost only 30%. But groupe are not raids. If the knight die, the groupe will mostly follow because simple the othe 5 can not replace him. If the warrior get feared the groupe will die. If you have 60 people and 1 person get feared/die the next will replace him.<br />
<br />
That is the mainproblem. This are not raids. This mob are not the hardest hitting mobs. This mobs should be nothing against a GoD raid named. A GoD raidnamed should eat 20 of this single groupenameds for breakfest. A groupenamed can and will never be the hardest hitting mobs. Let one of them fight against an old Time named and you see the difference and why this mobs are not raidmobs. This are single groupe mobs and so should be tankable for knights.<br />

In reading about general Paldins issues you'll find that they do have concerns about their raid role. Repairing their spell book to give them effective combat heals, lost &quot;stun mitigation&quot;, etc would not only help with raid role, but apply to these trials as well.<br />
<br />
Matter of fact, SK taps, HT, etc. also have not kept pace with an Add Tank/off tank raid role. Again, repair their spellbook to make needed improvement and it would apply to the trials in question.<br />
<br />
As things stand now Knights clamor for Defensive because they would like to be 100% Warriors vs. as many mobs as possible given that their spellcasting is insufficient - especially insufficient to kill 2 boss mobs in a couple of trials.<br />

If knights are given an ability that does not take from warriors, why would warriors care?  <br />
Because the ability some of them are asking for makes Knights into warriors with spellboooks, thus making warriors as a class pointless.  It's not affecting one aspect out of many that a warrior has, it's affecting our ONLY aspect; tanking big hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
If you think putting 3 mobs that cast Fear into the game that must be killed by single groups will balance things out, I have no problem with that.  Bring it on.  I'll be the first to admit Knights have an advantage, and THAT'S FINE.  The encounter would be  tailored to their skills, just like the current trials are tailored to a warrior's skills.  Knights would have an easier time making it through the trials.  That's balance.<br />

Calling to make changes to an entire class that will affect past, present, and future content for the sake of 3 mobs is ludicrous.</div></div><hr />

In these encounters we dont have a 50% mitigation we have 2 ticks of none and then 3 min of 50%, with a charmed pet (in the trials I have been in) that would reduce effective total fight damage to around 25-30% instead of 50%.</div></div><hr />

They want to change the mob, I have no problem with that. They want to inprove Knight spell books as needed to enhance their raid role and scale better to the generally harder hitting mobs and it has the effect of making these 2 mobs more doable and I'm all for it.<br />

Granted, the way as it was proposed would take a lot from us, but as I propose it would not. Knights only bring 1 great thing to tanking and that is agro generation on demand, as I suggest there level of agro should be the thing they give up, making there agro around half what it is currently is would get rid of there agro advantage then it becomes a question of do you want a warrior that can start with furious (our 2 second aspect) and then go in to 50% mitigation OR a tank that starts with 20% mitigation.

That is not valid because knights farmed gear FROM the encounter that they would later tank, the upgrades from GoD so far have been minor at best giveing a few hp more and some ac for the most part.

Stuns are not the only thing that can be done. Fast cast hard to interrupt heals with enough HP's to mean something is another. A buff that could only be cast when their target was 66+ and stun immune resembling a fast cast Vie and overwriting it is a third.<br />

Let me put it this way. I note that you not only have a Paladin, but you have an Enchanter. Why? Why shouldn't your Paladin be able to slow mobs - he could do a 50% slow, Surely adding this capability wouldn't hurt Enchanters. They can slow better and they (unlike Warriors) have many other things they can do.<br />
<br />
I have a 53 Paladin, my original Main. I retired him and put all my effort into a much less well equipped and lower level Warrior twink shortly after Kunark was released. Why? Because Warriors had a better Kunark armor set AND Defensive was introduced into the game. <br />
<br />
Oh, some Paladins nattered that they should get Defensive too, but I looked at my spellbook and realized there was a choice to be made.<br />
<br />
I choose a Warrior with Defensive. I chose to be The Primary Tank - not a secondary tank with a spellbook.<br />
<br />
Now It's true Paladins have MT'd aaaaalllll of PoTime. They have succeeded against many mobs in many trials. Still there are 2 mobs that they have difficulty with - 2 named boss high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
As a Warrior, I'm en fn titled to be unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles. Verant/SoE has defined these as high DI mobs and gave Warriors tools like Defensive and &quot;-1 DI&quot; to lower the DI contribution of total damage.<br />
<br />
I remember PoP. I also remember sending Verant/SoE documentation in their own words that Warrior were always expected to have adequate aggro.<br />
<br />
You show me anything Verant/SoE has said from the dawn of time indicating Paladins should MT high DI mobs like The Primary Tank. You can't because it doesn't exist - it's never been Verant or SoE's intention.<br />

It's not SOME mobs BB, it's TRASH mobs. There's a major difference between the 2. A paladin does not stun mitigate ANYTHING against a named mob.<br />

Fast cast hard to interrupt heals with enough HP's to mean something is another.<br />
<br />
2 problems with this.<br />
<br />
1) 1 rounding. I can have a 20k 0sec heal but if I get 1 rounded 9 out of 10 melee rounds it's absolutely useless<br />

You quoted yourself on PoN from SoE where it says knights were to be able to tank. Doesn't say they should only be able to tank a moss snake. It says tank. Now FIND me where SoE said in plain english that knights were to be COMPLETELY and UTTERLY unable to tank a high DI mob.

Also,  if knights get any portion of defensive, it is certainly not unreasonable for warriors to get a like portion of the knights spellbook and unique class abilities such as LoH or HT.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, knights can to A LOT of things we can't.  Why is this fair, and yet them not being able to tank 3 mobs that warriors can is unfair?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">Kadah,<br />
<br />
Here's the question...  <br />
<br />
And seriously I totally understand your position about defensive being both a cherished skill as well as a hammer with which to beat us over the head with, and I also understand the concern that this would represent a &quot;giving away&quot; of part of that which has been classified as a &quot;defining warrior ability&quot;.  <br />
<br />
All of those are philosophical issues and totally valid ones.   I'm not denying that they're completely valid, and that there is a legitimate fear that it in essence lowers the &quot;value&quot; of defensive, since it would no longer be &quot;exclusive&quot;.    <br />
<br />
That's not the question I'm asking though.  All of those are what can be classified as &quot;philosophical reasons&quot; to oppose such a thing as a discipline that alters a mob's DI.   <br />
<br />
What I'm asking for is practical reasons.   Exactly how would this negatively affect warriors *in practice*?    In other words, can you give me a few examples of encounters or situations where a warrior would be &quot;replaced&quot; by a knight where it's not already being done because of the existence of a 25% mitigation disc that comes from Ikkinz with a turnin in PoTime?<br />
<br />
In other words, if your opposition is solely philosophical and there's no basic practical threat, yet there's a practical reason for knights (real survivability issues) to have concerns, then doesn't the practical need override the philosophical opposition?<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way.   A year ago, we were clamoring for help with aggro generation, because it was simply insufficient.  Many knights were opposed to this on philosophical grounds, they felt that having on-demand aggro generation with good survivability was the realm of knights, and it had been that way since very early on in EQ.   Many even took the position that since some warriors weren't claiming to experience problems, that there was no issue.   In practice however, warriors WERE experiencing issues, and knights had an unfair advantage.   We felt, and rightly so, that just because a few warriors could pull it off, or at least were able to adequately deal with it, that that didn't indicate that there wasn't a problem or that the solution to said problem wasn't &quot;just farm more&quot;, but rather that a change was needed.    We were right.   A change WAS needed, and this change, while philosophically opposed by some knights, didnt' affect them to nearly the degree that they thought it would.   Most knights agree with the statement that &quot;Outside of GoD, tanking has never been so balanced&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Many knights even asked what they'd get &quot;in return&quot; for warriors being able to generate aggro, and the concept repulsed me.  They didn't need anything &quot;in return&quot;, that it wasnt' really a negotiation, but simply a matter of need, and that they had no right to ask for something &quot;in return&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now it's they who are having an issue, and a number of warriors are opposed to a viable solution on philosophical grounds that wouldn't affect them negatively in practice.   I'm completely open to listen to examples where *in practice* this would negatively affect warriors, but no one's been able to give me a single example.   <br />
<br />
Now I have a problem with someone showing a need *in practice* which has a net benefit in-game (never again would this issue need to come up, and the challenge level of all mobs can remain high without special tricks every time), and being opposed on philosophical grounds without *real* practical grounds to oppose as well.    It reminds me too much of the knights that were so damned frustrating during the time of OUR crisis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Frodlin.<br />
<br />
We have defensive again as a core class defining skill.<br />
The problem in point is, How will this affect class balance?<br />
If someone was to go ahead and give a DI modifier now to paladins so they could tank easier in the trials, what happens later on down the gates line?<br />
<br />
Thats a big point, the other is, Well Paladins can still self rezz, self heal, LoH, etc. Having the utility and then the ability to (at 25%) which is 60% of our defensive skill now enroach on what warriors were designed to do. <br />
<br />
If knights can tank everything in time, what happens when they are given a &quot;Defensive disc&quot; You and I both know, the Develper's will fuck it up and make it work on all content.<br />
<br />
That will simply kill warriors in every sense of the word. Because we will have a hybrid class, Able to heal as well as a 55th level cleric (one time cheal) Do burst damage like a wizard with MB ( one time HT ) And tank like a 65 warrior under stonestance. <br />
<br />
How come I am the only one able to see the horror in what that will unleash? When ( and I promise they will) the dev's fuck up this idea, and knights are running around in PoP / Gates, etc with their bastard defensive what role will warriors play?<br />
<br />
Honestly? We will have lost our core class skill, We have no other utility, Not a single drop. Thats it. Tanking is all we do. We will have effectively killed our class because of bad playtesting, Bad develping, and a bunch of pussies crying that its hard and they cant make it through.<br />
<br />
Dont blame warriors. Blame the people that playtested this shit and didnt feedback. Blame the Dev's for making hude DI mobs, Blame people who wanted &quot;A challenge&quot; And kept their mouth shut instead of saying hey blah blah fix this shit.<br />
<br />
Knights have a hard time tanking the trials and it ends up on luck,  Well people in beta said &quot;We want uber challenge's&quot; In fact knights on beta where the ones screaming loudest about wanting shit that would be hard for time geared folks to get through.<br />
<br />
Now they have their cake, and want it nerfed to eat it too?<br />

Fuck that</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE can look at these discusions and decide to give all Knights full exact Defensive. By your &quot;practical&quot; arguments Warriors would still have the &quot;-1 DI&quot; advantage, some 1000 more HP's, Furious, and Incaradine BP/Cobalt Legs. We'd still be the prefered MT.<br />
<br />
Yep, SoE can end this argument by creating Knight Defensive - but I assure you, their shyte will be on the lawn.<br />
<br />
Aggro affected every Warrior and there were statements by Verant/SoE that it should not be inadequate. This effects very few Knights and Knight Defensive is not the only solution.<br />
<br />
Two very reasonable counter-arguments have been provided:<br />
<br />
1. A limited number of encounters affecting a limited number of players is the &quot;problem&quot; - fix the encounters. If SoE can't make balanced 6-person group encounters now, the problem will crop up in the future affecting other classes in other ways. The problem is encounter design.<br />
<br />
2. Knights lost Tanking ability and DPS to gain a spellbook. It's spells and mana that are to be used to restore them. Knights need spellbook revision for their raid role anyway. Why pretend that these two mobs aren't part of the larger spellbook usefullness issue?<br />
<br />
Now, I frankly don't care why you would reject these arguments. I'm not trying to convert you. It's enough to know you are wrong, know why you are wrong, and share it with others.<br />
<br />
However, I and other Warriors are strongly opposed to Knight Defensive and believe SoE (even if players can't) can find a way not to put it in the game.<br />

Ok, let me rephrase, because clearly I'm not getting through, reiterating a philosphical argument and placing the term &quot;in practice&quot; in front of the philosophical argument is not delivering practical examples.<br />
<br />
Name me 3 mobs that knights don't already normally tank that them having a 25% mitigation disc that drops in Ikkinz 2 and has a PoTime turn in NPC would make a raid leader decide to use a knight instead of a warrior, AND the reasons why for each mob.   <br />
<br />
This is crucial, because claiming that X event will happen, doesn't necessarily make it true or credible.  You need to say WHY it will happen so that it can be determined if X really WILL happen or if that is simply the invocation of an appeal to fear to declare your position to be correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I hate to say this but public declarations weren't necessarily consistent, making your argument completely invalid that the aggro changes were done to find a class consistent solution to a problem that they knew about and agreed with for some time.   Would you like me to pull out the Rich Waters &quot;Gimmick&quot; quote to show how the lead designer of Everquest stated that he didn't think warriors should taunt very well?  The reason the change was made was because as the game was evolving, warriors were being left behind in practice and it needed to be fixed.   It wasn't perceived to be needed to be fixed prior, as a matter of fact, when the lead designer of EQ states that fixing it would have undesired consequences, it can hardly be stated that this was a consistently held belief throughout the lifetime of EQ.<br />
<br />
Your belief is erronious.<br />
<br />
Which one?   Let's see, I have several different beliefs surrounding this issue, which eventually lead to the conclusion that out of all of the potential solutions that a Knight Mitigation disc would have the most positive impact on the game as a whole.   Which belief is it that's &quot;erroneous&quot;, that Knights are having trouble tanking high DI mobs?   No, you would certainly agree with me on that.   Is the belief that group restricted content should be tankable by all 3 plate tanks?  I'm fairly certain that you'd agree with me on that one, since you've only stated it 1500 times or so in the last week.   Is it that the success rate in Ikkinz trials is too low and unpredictable when Knights are tanking?   Well I'm not so sure what your belief is on that, but I'm fairly certain that that's not an &quot;erroneous belief&quot;.   Is my belief that success or failure of an encounter being based on the RNG being wrong erroneous?  I'd like you to tell me that that one is wrong.   Is my belief that making the encounters easier would inevitably lower the standards, leading to people not being given the opportunity to progress throughout the whole of EQ, and obsoleting much previous content erroneous?  I dont' believe that is either, unless you'd like to point it out to me.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that what you're saying isn't that my &quot;beliefs&quot; are rroneous, but that my conclusion that the best solution to a problem which you READILY agree exists which would have the BEST impact gamewide would be a 25% mit disc for knights.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm certain that that's what you conclude is &quot;erroneous&quot; based not on any evidence, only feelings, emotions, and fear.   You continually refuse, and it's crystal clear why you refuse, to answer the simple question of which encounters would this affect warriors adversely on and why, because your conclusion that this is potentially bad cannot be backed up with any examples as to where exactly would this be bad at.<br />

Try, anything and everything.  Knights and warriors would become interchangeable for tanking, just like BSTs and Shaman are for slow.  However, warriors have no backup, like a shaman has buffs and DoTs and a Bst can do melee damage besides just slow.  Don't have a warrior around?  Eh, it's ok, we got some knights.  Knights are more than sufficiant for clearing mobs on raids, and with a 25% mitigation disc, they would also be more than sufficient to tank any sort of raid boss/mini-boss.  The same would become true for single group situations.<br />
<br />
Warriors are usually given the default role of tanking on raids because if/when some big bad nasty mob comes along we can throw up defensive/stonewall and take it head on without missing a beat.<br />
<br />
I said it before, and I'll say it again.  Having some tome drop in Ikkinz 2 with a turn-in in PoTime is the most insane idea I've ever heard proposed.  Never before has a class skill or ability been restricted to access to the end-zone of an expansion.  Never before has a class been required to get to the end-zone of the previous expansion in order to progress in the next.  Yes, there are going to be knights in guilds raiding Kod'Taz that do not have their Time flag, for whatever reason.  Guilds do not bring on recruits and then go back 1 or 2 expansions to gear them up; they gear them up with current content.  You would hear an even LARGER outcry from the knight community if your idea was ever implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Madrone,<br />
<br />
A Paladin would tank mobs based on how the utility found in his spellbook reduces the risk and provides useful support on the way to the boss mob compared to the additional risk of having him tank the boss mob.<br />
<br />
Let's pretend that right now as things stand we were in a guild that was going to farm the heck out of spells.<br />
<br />
On the way, I would want a different group composition than when I got there. An efficient guild would have perhaps a Cleric, Paladin, Monk, Enchanter, Rogue, Druid group kill up near the mob.<br />
<br />
They would then have the Enchanter leave and invite a Warrior.<br />
<br />
This would insure the greatest chance of success (and reduce the downside of temporary failure) possible.<br />
<br />
Make groups 8-person and I tell you Paladins would be in every group possible.<br />
<br />
There really is one problem. The encounters are designed to give too much of an advantage to Warriors given their degree of specialization vs. high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
Alter the encounters and we can take turns being /lfg depending on how many Clerics are online. Fairer I think but still not optimal.<br />
<br />
Make the encounters Slaughter 75 and doable with Healer, Healer, Tank, Slower, Puller, DPS and everybody gets to play.<br />
<br />
Make them 8-person raid and decrease the amount of healing needed and again everybody gets to play.<br />

<br />
Agreed.  I have chaffed at 6 person groups (I know, you said raids) for ages since they keep increasing the number of classes.  With 6 people, you typically always need a healer, CC, tank, and dps.  That leaves 2 slots - dps is normally what you want - htere is no room for utility or even a backup tank.</div></div><hr />

Can you give me any SPECIFIC example as to where and why this would be the case?   I'm not asking for that much, and I really am getting the feeling that you're dancing around the issue.  What precise benefit would a knight bring that a warrior wouldn't bring and do significantly better?  <br />

<br />
Nonsense, every class receives the greatest benefit from the end-game zone of an expansion, and to top THAT off, Ancient Spells were directly tied to the end game encounters of previous expansions, as was flowing thought (something which increased the power of existing casters significantly, just as this would do).   Spells are without a doubt the defining characteristic of casters, and every single one of their ancient spells was found on &quot;End Game encounters&quot;.  Add to that the fact that runes dropping for tome turnins already exist in content restricted areas, the argument is rather weak.<br />
<br />
 Never before has a class been required to get to the end-zone of the previous expansion in order to progress in the next.<br />
<br />
I know, and THANK GOD that GoD changed that.  That was the single biggest design error in every previous expansion in EQ.<br />
<br />
 Yes, there are going to be knights in guilds raiding Kod'Taz that do not have their Time flag, for whatever reason. Guilds do not bring on recruits and then go back 1 or 2 expansions to gear them up; they gear them up with current content.

<br />
Actually, the knight community is pretty solidly behind the idea.   You do what it takes to get what you want.   Pre-Time knights have no business expecting to tank in KodTaz + content, period.   Hell, Pre-Time warriors shouldn't be either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">First off, Im not pro-knight defensive.  Not too keen about giving up my one trick to someone who already has a book of tricks, but there is some good discussion going on about it here and some good arguement for aswell as against.<br />
<br />
Anyway, heres another idea on how it could be implemented:<br />
<br />
Rather than giving knights a defensive disapline implement it as a BoV type spell with the following characteristics.<br />
- Recast 30mins<br />
- Self only<br />
- Duration: 2min 30secs<br />
- Effect: -5DI mitigation<br />
- Mana: 4500<br />
- Add what ever negative spell casting effects req. here.<br />
- casting time: 10 seconds<br />
<br />
Reasons for implementing it as a spell and not a discapline.<br />
- it takes a spell slot with a very long recast time and long cast time.  This means knights are unlikely to have it up except when they know it is needed for a particular encounter.  <br />
- The cast time and mana cost means it has to be cast when the mob is inc and can't be used during an encounter (won't be used as an &quot;oh shit im gonna die better disc&quot; tool).<br />
- The high mana cost limits their spell casting once its up - Time geared knights are likely to have 6k+ mana so it should leave them at about 25%<br />
- Duration is long enough to cast it ~30secs before the pull and have the disc up for a 2 min fight.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
Another idea which I prefer though would be to implement some same difficulty 2 or 3 group limited trials with the same loot that give the same progression flags.  I would prefer to see content changed rather than classes changed to balance on 3 encounters.</div></div><hr />

Given time and people becoming aware of tactics, these trials are going to inevitably be easy enough that tag-a-longs will hapen. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Some guilds do have members who are highly valued members that for a variety of reasons can't contribute on a high level.<br />

Rather than giving knights a defensive disapline implement it as a BoV type spell with the following characteristics.<br />
- Recast 30mins<br />
- Self only<br />
- Duration: 2min 30secs<br />
- Effect: -5DI mitigation<br />
- Mana: 4500<br />
- Add what ever negative spell casting effects req. here.<br />
- casting time: 10 seconds<br />
<br />
The problem with the above is the recast time. When you mem a spell it remains unusable until it's refresh time has elapsed. Memming the above spell would require the knight having to wait 30mins before using it. Having the knight die prior to ever using it would once again reset the timer to 30mins.<br />

That's ridiculous BB. Even if a player is PoTime flagged unless they actually HAVE the gear they'll get splatted across the board in the higher GoD tiers and no 25% defensive would ever change that.</div></div><hr />

By your logic gimping those two trial mobs would be an acceptable solution. As you observe if you don't have the gear, you will get splated. Sooner than reaching those mobs in the other trials and, if such a player's gear is typical of their guild, in every raid.<br />

I am a time equiped knight with 10k hps and only a few will make simple tipt, vxed and kodaz nameds with me as tank. They will wait on a warrior or do other stuff. Simple because the risk to fail is to big with a knight. I can tank them and win, but little bad luck and i get killed because the named make a lucky round. They even take applicant warriors which have less hps/ac then i have for this nameds and everyone agree that it is way easier with him because ripost/defensiv combo and nothing a knight do can come near this combo.<br />

You're being VERY narrowminded again.<br />
<br />
1) Many suggestions were passed around about how to improve the class at the appropriate level.<br />
<br />
2) Most of the people agree that the improvements should NOT be readily available to everyone. <br />
<br />
3) Warriors of MUCH lower gear than paladins fair much better in these trials. It's all nice for you to say paladins in semi shitty gear shouldn't be able to do this, but as a paladin I say warriors in much shittier gear than paladins shouldn't have a chance at it either.<br />
<br />
4) The level of players discussing the issues doesn't necessarily mean they have no clue about game inbalance. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also you seem to be so focusssed on your level of play you completely disregard the lower end of the spectrum in GoD. <br />
<br />
A) First zones/Trials are NOT for PoTime geared players. They are based at a lower spectrum in the game<br />
<br />
B) Warriors in the VT level are capable of tanking those zones. Paladins in those same levels or higher (EP) are not<br />
<br />
Just like its unfair for warrirors to be the only choice to tank Ikk/Kod level trials, it is unfair to have warriors the only choice at the lower end of the trials also. (Gear being equal)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm going to say it again. I never said a defensive ability was the only way to go, and most paladins agree there could be other alternatives. But the changes required to our spellbook are extrememe if we're to be a viable secondary role class at that level and SOE has refused to really do anything with our spell lineup in the past. The advocation for the half def that's being kicked around is not done so we can take over as MT over warriors in raids, it's to allow a better balance within restricted areas of the game. <br />
<br />
And no, half a warrior will NEVER be worth a full one.</div></div><hr />

Again, you haven't given any reasons WHY this would be the case.   WHY would someone decide to use a knight instead of a warrior?   Can you give me any SPECIFIC example as to where and why this would be the case?   I'm not asking for that much, and I really am getting the feeling that you're dancing around the issue.  What precise benefit would a knight bring that a warrior wouldn't bring and do significantly better?  <br />
<br />
Do you have some sort of reading comprehension problem?  Or just need every single aspect pointed out to mind-numbingly small detail?  Give knights some form of defensive, and warriors lose any significant edge over the knights in raid or group situations.  It would be a coin toss as to which to use.  First non-afk tank (warrior or knight) would be designated to MA or MT or whatever.  In groups, people would pick knights because they can do other things than just tank, and would also be able to tank nearly as well as warriors in all situations.  Their utility in things other than tanking would give them a massive edge in group desirability.  It wouldn't have such an immediate reaction in guilds, but as people retire and new people are recruited, guilds would start to heavily recruit a new knight over a new warrior down to the point where a few token warriors are kept around for good ol' times' sake.  Why recruit a class that has such a small edge over another in 1 area, and have absolutely nothing else to offer the guild?  It would be like giving shaman nothing but the ability to slow, and then chosing between adding another BST to the guild or another shaman.  Since BST can slow just as well as shaman in most situations AND do melee damage, when all the shaman has is a barely superior slowing ability, why the hell would a guild choose a shaman?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nonsense, every class receives the greatest benefit from the end-game zone of an expansion, and to top THAT off, Ancient Spells were directly tied to the end game encounters of previous expansions, as was flowing thought (something which increased the power of existing casters significantly, just as this would do).   Spells are without a doubt the defining characteristic of casters, and every single one of their ancient spells was found on &quot;End Game encounters&quot;.  Add to that the fact that runes dropping for tome turnins already exist in content restricted areas, the argument is rather weak.<br />
<br />
Upgraded gear, upgraded spells, upgraded &quot;tome&quot; abilites.  Not an entirely new skill.  That's the difference you fail (or don't want) to see.  You're proposing to add an entirely NEW SKILL through not 1, but 2 expansion &quot;end game&quot; zones (Ikkinz trials are semi-end game, for the current situation of GoD).  You can't expect every knight who wants this ability not to cry &quot;foul&quot; or ask for an entire line of the ability with the lower levels of it more easily obtained.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know, and THANK GOD that GoD changed that.  That was the single biggest design error in every previous expansion in EQ.<br />
<br />
You completely missed the point.  Never before has a single CLASS been required to get to the end-zone of the previous expansion; completely separate from a guild.  Proposing a new skill as you have stated would require every knight who wants to play in GoD to have access to the PoTime, and yet put no such restriction on any other class.  You don't think many, many knights wouldn't get royally pissed over this?  Especially those not in Time and recruiting with a GoD guild?<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, the knight community is pretty solidly behind the idea.   You do what it takes to get what you want.   Pre-Time knights have no business expecting to tank in KodTaz + content, period.   Hell, Pre-Time warriors shouldn't be either.  <br />
Show me where there are knights (&lt;--- plural, not just a select few) saying, &quot;Let's have a tome drop in Ikkinz 2 trial with a turn-in mob in the PoTime!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pre-Time warriors can definately (although with difficulty) beat these trials.  You don't think that's a good thing?  Ok, make it harder.  Oh wait, now the knights would need an even better &quot;defensive&quot; ability to pass them with the reliability you seem to want them to have.  Where the hell do you come up with the idea that non-Time warriors shouldn't be able to tank these things, but Time knights should?<br />
<br />
Litterally forcing a guild to complete the end-zone of the previous expansion in order to progress on to the next has NEVER been the way EQ works.  Entire skill sets and spell lines have never been denied a class that wasn't able to get to the end-zone.  The outcry from knights unable to access Time and thus not obtain this &quot;defensive&quot; skill would be huge.</div></div><hr />

I think you're completely confusing the impact of this with previous &quot;group role&quot; issues.   The reason that I say this is that we are talking about when using the disc, not a single one of those abilities will be used.   Seriously, what Paladinis gonna be switching targets and rooting adds when they're tanking a raid level boss?   <br />
<br />
ASSIST ME WITH &lt;INNORRUUK&gt;  &quot;Oh wait, while I'm doing this, let me stop and res this wizard&quot;...<br />
<br />
See, the only &quot;potential&quot; impact that has raised objection has NOTHING to do with single group settings, nor should it, because in essence that's what this is about is single group settings.   Knights SHOULD bring something of value.<br />
<br />
Also, while survivability is binary, that doesn't exclude the reality that levels of safety are more or less linear, and if there's enough of a difference, and there IS with the plan presented, then it's as illogical to use a knight to tank raid level targets as it is to use a recruit warrior with 3khp less than your top tanks.   <br />
<br />
Who the hell in their right mind would use a warrior who has 3khp less than their top tanks to tank guild level raid targets?   The answer is no one, and who in their right mind would use a Knight with a disc that is half as effective as your warriors?   The answer is no one in thir right mind would.    <br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, the fact that they have the skills that you just mentioned argues AGAINST them tanking because then not only are you using a FAR less effective tank, but you've also removed all of those abilities that apparently have so much value.   If those are of such value, then you'd be a moron to remove them from use by having the one who can use them distracted by tanking AND have someone who's a BETTER tank but NOT able to perform those tasks not tanking.<br />
<br />
Can't you see how inherently crazy that is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Except that:<br />
<br />
 1) Most Knights are ~1k of Warriors at that level, not 3k. Not to mention the AC may actually be higher for a Knight in some cases, due to the ability to use 1h+shield and still maintain reasonable aggro.<br />
<br />
 2) If your case was an absolute, no Knight would EVER tank a boss mob EVER. This is not the case already, therefore your theory is disproven even BEFORE you give Knights /defensive. Why don't you ask all those guilds why they tank everything with Knights during the farming of the content? Are they all insane? Is YOUR guild insane?<br />
<br />
 Because Sony has now given us '6-man raids', which is to say group limited content with raid style mobs at the end, you HAVE to take into account what GROUP functions the Knight brings AS WELL AS the RAID abilities. You are increasing their RAID abilities without decreasing their GROUP abilities, and that will unbalance these trials in their favor, as WELL as skewing group content back towards them.<br />
<br />
 Further, I submit that Knights bring things of value to 6 man content prior to /defensive, even in these trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">There are 3 basic reasons that knights tank raid boss's<br />
<br />
A) Being bored or to prove a point... to have &quot;fun&quot;, after doing something for so long (farming time or mobX) it get more boring, guilds sometimes switch things up to when they are way past the content.<br />
<br />
B) *Rare Case* The mob has low DPS but has something that makes it so its harder for a warrior to tank. CT in fear, TZ in Tactics are main mobs like this. (But warriors work fine for both)<br />
<br />
C) All warriors are dead, undergeared, or lack proper skills to do it.<br />
<br />
I'd never put a knight, even with 25% defensive as a tank over a warrior when learning new content, or if the boss was challenging enough. No raid leader would if they really want best chance at winning the encounter. You want the person who has the most HP AC Mitigation and superior discs to tank raid boss's, this will ALWAYS be a warrior (Except in the cases's i stated above) even if you gave knights 25% defensive, hell even if you gave them a better one)<br />
<br />
That said I do think Shaiel has a point about the potime/ikkinz drop thing, it would create a seperate problem in long run. A potential way to solve this is to have it be either Potime ir something like Uqua, or Ikkinz 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rather than redefine this truth<br />

<br />
No, I'm making you think about the details because the details are where you'll learn that there's *no* reason to use a *significantly* lesser tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Give knights some form of defensive, and warriors lose any significant edge over the knights in raid or group situations. It would be a coin toss as to which to use. First non-afk tank (warrior or knight) would be designated to MA or MT or whatever.<br />
<br />
That statement is complete garbage, and since again you REFUSE to provide any specific circumstances why, I'll point out to you in precise detail why this is absolutely not the case.<br />
<br />
IN EQUAL GEAR Vs. DB = 200, DI = 100 mob:<br />
<br />
Warrior takes up to 500 points PER HIT less than Knight.<br />
Warrior has larger hitpoint pool than knight by 1khp<br />
Warrior avoids more hits than knight<br />
Warrior has BETTER AGGRO over time than knight (Assuming Time aggro set)<br />
<br />
The warrior is ABSOLUTELY safer than the knight under EVERY SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE.   <br />
<br />
This is *if* the knight has the disc.  If you're telling me that there's no substantive difference in an up to 500 point per hit mitigation difference, then the mob you're doing is trivial anyhow, and the knight can already tank it, and you should stop bottom feeding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In groups, people would pick knights because they can do other things than just tank, and would also be able to tank nearly as well as warriors in all situations. Their utility in things other than tanking would give them a massive edge in group desirability.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you something... do knights currently have a &quot;massive edge&quot; over warriors in exp groups in every other zone outside of Kod/Ikkinz?   See, because in order to verify your claims, you have to see if when discs aren't an issue, if your premise applies.  The answer is no, knights do NOT have a &quot;massive advantage&quot; over warriors in exp content.   That was only true when there was the major aggro disparity, and their tanking while undisced is pretty close to ours.<br />
<br />
So, if it's NOT the case when discs aren't an issue, then FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, why would it be an issue assuming they got a disc that allowed them to be HALF as good as us yet ensure personal survivability?    It's a total no-brainer.<br />
<br />
 It wouldn't have such an immediate reaction in guilds, but as people retire and new people are recruited, guilds would start to heavily recruit a new knight over a new warrior down to the point where a few token warriors are kept around for good ol' times' sake.<br />
<br />
You just love spinning stories with no support don't you?   The entire scenario you just painted, while colorful and interesting is not based in any reality whatsoever.    What you're telling me is that guilds, when retirements occur, will automatically snag tanks who are NOT capable still of tanking cutting edge content nearly as safely as a warrior BECAUSE THEY CAN FUCKING ROOT AND HEAL 10% OF A PLAYER'S HITPOINTS?   <br />
<br />
Why recruit a class that has such a small edge over another in 1 area, and have absolutely nothing else to offer the guild? It would be like giving shaman nothing but the ability to slow, and then chosing between adding another BST to the guild or another shaman. Since BST can slow just as well as shaman in most situations AND do melee damage, when all the shaman has is a barely superior slowing ability, why the hell would a guild choose a shaman?<br />
<br />
This example is another example of you tossing stuff out that contradicts your own position.   Beastlords can slow almost as well as Shamans can, and druids can heal better than shamans can, yet NO ONE uses beastlords to slow on raid level targets, and NO ONE has replaced shamans on raids.   If your position were accurate that people are willing to take slightly lesser abilities for the side benefits, then Shamans would've been phased out of guilds in PoP.   They haven't, thus contradicting your position.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the interesting thing is this isn't even a valid comparison.   The beatlord can slow to within 5% of the Shaman, whereas if the comparison were to be valid, you'd have to say that a guild would be willing to forego a Shamans' slow if a Beastlord only had a 35% slow, which is asinine.<br />
<br />
Upgraded gear, upgraded spells, upgraded &quot;tome&quot; abilites. Not an entirely new skill. That's the difference you fail (or don't want) to see. You're proposing to add an entirely NEW SKILL through not 1, but 2 expansion &quot;end game&quot; zones (Ikkinz trials are semi-end game, for the current situation of GoD). You can't expect every knight who wants this ability not to cry &quot;foul&quot; or ask for an entire line of the ability with the lower levels of it more easily obtained.<br />
<br />
I'm amused at this.  So what you're saying then is that things cannot be implemented into EQ where there's no precedence?    Well, there's no precedence to a discipline being of such high value for content that's resctricted to 6 people, yet it showed up.   Instancing had no precedent before it was implemented.   Hell, /disc defensive had no precedent before it was implemented.   Using your standard, every expansion would be an exact replica of the old world.<br />
<br />
<br />
You completely missed the point. Never before has a single CLASS been required to get to the end-zone of the previous expansion; completely separate from a guild.<br />
<br />
Ok, fine, I get it so if there were a &quot;right click&quot; which acheived the same goal then there's no objection?  Ok that's fine, make it right click.<br />
<br />
 Proposing a new skill as you have stated would require every knight who wants to play in GoD to have access to the PoTime, and yet put no such restriction on any other class. You don't think many, many knights wouldn't get royally pissed over this? Especially those not in Time and recruiting with a GoD guild?<br />
<br />
Which guilds are doing Kod + GoD that aren't gonna be going to time?  Which guilds are gonna move straight from open zones into GoD?   This is progression, if you want to &quot;gear up&quot; then you go where the gear is.    Funny, I remember early in Luclin when mobs had 20 bazillion hitpoints, my guild going back to VP every week to get rend robes.   <br />
<br />
<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Actually, the knight community is pretty solidly behind the idea. You do what it takes to get what you want. Pre-Time knights have no business expecting to tank in KodTaz + content, period. Hell, Pre-Time warriors shouldn't be either. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Show me where there are knights (&lt;--- plural, not just a select few) saying, &quot;Let's have a tome drop in Ikkinz 2 trial with a turn-in mob in the PoTime!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok...<br />
<br />
Short List of people who have hopped on board, or at least with a version which has similar requirements (some more strict than others)<br />
<br />
Brael<br />
Gryfalcon<br />
Kether<br />
Kaev<br />
Derringer<br />
Brik (who actually suggested a specific drop from Quarm as a &quot;reagent&quot;)<br />
<br />
And that's just those off the top of my head.  I'm sure I could search for some more.<br />
<br />
Pre-Time warriors can definately (although with difficulty) beat these trials. You don't think that's a good thing? Ok, make it harder. Oh wait, now the knights would need an even better &quot;defensive&quot; ability to pass them with the reliability you seem to want them to have. Where the hell do you come up with the idea that non-Time warriors shouldn't be able to tank these things, but Time knights should?<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a single knight on any forum or in-game make the claim that a Pre-Time knight should be able to tank these encounters.    Not a one.<br />
<br />
Litterally forcing a guild to complete the end-zone of the previous expansion in order to progress on to the next has NEVER been the way EQ works. Entire skill sets and spell lines have never been denied a class that wasn't able to get to the end-zone. The outcry from knights unable to access Time and thus not obtain this &quot;defensive&quot; skill would be huge.<br />
<br />
Again, 2 things.  <br />
<br />
1. You're preaching the non-evolution of EQ<br />
<br />
2. This is outside the realm of reality since I've seen very few objections to this, and any objections I've seen have been rebutted BY KNIGHTS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">lol<br />
<br />
I've seen you say a Knight equipped as well as Gilfalas should be able to do these.<br />
<br />
Several of the people you've listed have gotten these flags - proving it can be done.<br />
<br />
YOU haven't managed to rebut these points made in one form or another by many posters.<br />
<br />
1. A limited number of encounters affecting a limited number of players is the &quot;problem&quot; - fix the encounters. If SoE can't make balanced 6-person group encounters now, the problem will crop up in the future affecting other classes in other ways. The problem is encounter design.<br />
<br />
2. Knights lost Tanking ability and DPS to gain a spellbook. It's spells and mana that are to be used to restore them. Knights need spellbook revision for their raid role anyway. Why pretend that these two mobs aren't part of the larger spellbook usefullness issue?<br />
<br />
You are preaching the wrong fix for the wrong problem.<br />
<br />
A couple of encounters are unbalanced. Knight spellbooks from heals to the size of DD's have not kept pace with new expansions and tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">I don't think all of you saying these trials are Knight beatable understand the difference between beatable and beatable reliably.<br />
<br />
If you try long enough eventually you can beat it with a Knight.  No one in their right mind would do that when they can just swap in a Warrior for the named and then swap out, instead of playing chance with fate and hope the Knight doesn't get unlucky.  Beteeen Defensive and Furious and the fact that all trial fights end well under 3 minutes (Furious automatically shaves 10% off the mob's health easily) the Warrior advantage is too big.<br />
<br />
But this is a problem with the encounter not the class.  Even if Knights have mini-defensive, it is certainly possible to design a trial such that it is only Warrior tankable (say, bump mobs to 2500 max hit instead of 2200).  Then what?  Give Knights defensive as well?  There should be stuff in this game that are only Warrior tankable, but they really shouldn't be in 6-man encounters that everyone needs to do (or at least appear to, given you can't turn in Sliver of the High Temple without the trials).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">1) Most Knights are ~1k of Warriors at that level, not 3k. Not to mention the AC may actually be higher for a Knight in some cases, due to the ability to use 1h+shield and still maintain reasonable aggro.<br />
<br />
Being able to use a 1h + shield hardly rivals a hardcoded -5 DI differential (in essence, up to 500 points of damage PER HIT).   Perhaps you're completely missing my point here that the knight &quot;version&quot; is 25% mitigation vs our 50%, which scales with mob difficulty.     The advantage knights would have over other melee clases is the same advantage we'd have over them.  The use of shields isn't really relevant.<br />
<br />
2) If your case was an absolute, no Knight would EVER tank a boss mob EVER. This is not the case already, therefore your theory is disproven even BEFORE you give Knights /defensive. <br />
<br />
Actually, that's not true, there's a few mobs that are pretty much designed around knight tanking and the melee DPS reflects that.   Mobs with special &quot;features&quot; such as Cazic in Time, or Slows or who cannot be hit like Rathe Councilmen.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the ONLY time people use knight tanks *EVER* is either experimental or because they're doing trivial content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don't you ask all those guilds why they tank everything with Knights during the farming of the content? Are they all insane? Is YOUR guild insane?<br />
<br />
Hmm, which guilds?   I'd be very interested to know this.  I gurantee that any guild doing this is doing content WELL below their potential.   The only guilds I know of are those that are full of casual level 65 players doing mobs like Doomshade.   AO did it in time a few times, but not for any other reason than to show that it could be done.<br />
<br />
Because Sony has now given us '6-man raids', which is to say group limited content with raid style mobs at the end, you HAVE to take into account what GROUP functions the Knight brings AS WELL AS the RAID abilities.<br />
<br />
Trust me, nothing that knights bring to groups in these trials comes even remotely close to the justification for bringing a warrior.    Soon as you hit one of those Yellow Con Kyvs, the group is not thinking about how thankful they are that Pallyboy is able to root something, or if his stuns worked how cool it would be, or how it sure is great that he can heal for almost a whole hit from the mob.   They're wondering if they're gonna make it.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You are increasing their RAID abilities without decreasing their GROUP abilities, and that will unbalance these trials in their favor, as WELL as skewing group content back towards them.<br />
<br />
Name me any group encounter outside of GoD where this would affect anyone.    There isn't ANY group encounter where a 40 minute refresh half-as-good as-defensive disc would be a point in which a choice hinges on.<br />
<br />
In the trials, warriors would STILL bring the power of /disc furious which when coupled with defensive, blows everyone the fuck out of the water.    Nothing that a Paladin or SK can do can even remotely match the power of those 2 being unlinked.   Warriors would still be a much greater choice in Ikk trials, but it would be POSSIBLE with a knight without relying on the RNG.<br />
<br />
Further, I submit that Knights bring things of value to 6 man content prior to /defensive, even in these trials.<br />
<br />
Of COURSE they bring stuff of value.   They should bring stuff of value, but we're trying to get to the bottom of what impact on warriors that knights having a 40 min refresh halfway defensive would have.   The answer is that the only impact that I can REALISTICALLY see is... that some groups would succeed without a warrior.   That is NOT a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

That statement is complete garbage, and since again you REFUSE to provide any specific circumstances why, I'll point out to you in precise detail why this is absolutely not the case.<br />
<br />
IN EQUAL GEAR Vs. DB = 200, DI = 100 mob:<br />
<br />
Warrior takes up to 500 points PER HIT less than Knight.<br />
Warrior has larger hitpoint pool than knight by 1khp<br />
Warrior avoids more hits than knight<br />
Warrior has BETTER AGGRO over time than knight (Assuming Time aggro set)<br />
<br />
The warrior is ABSOLUTELY safer than the knight under EVERY SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE.  <br />
<br />
This is *if* the knight has the disc.  If you're telling me that there's no substantive difference in an up to 500 point per hit mitigation difference, then the mob you're doing is trivial anyhow, and the knight can already tank it, and you should stop bottom feeding. <br />
500 points her hit advantage?  Huh?  How in the world do you come up with this?  I would love to see how warriors take 500 less damage per hit versus knights if they both have defensive.<br />
<br />
Bottom feeding?  So, clearing Ikkinz raids is bottom feeding.  Because they could all be done without a single warrior, and the only place warriors are truly desired are on the mini-bosses.<br />
<br />
You want details?  There it is.  Warriors are not required except for bosses, and even then, &quot;required&quot; is too strong of a term.  Do we tank better?  Yes, and that's the way it should be.  But knights can already do the same, if with more difficulty.  Again, the way it should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
The warrior is ABSOLUTELY safer than the knight under EVERY SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE.  <br />
<br />
And?  That's the way it's supposed to be.  We're better at it, and we better be, since it's our only role.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me ask you something... do knights currently have a &quot;massive edge&quot; over warriors in exp groups in every other zone outside of Kod/Ikkinz?   See, because in order to verify your claims, you have to see if when discs aren't an issue, if your premise applies.  The answer is no, knights do NOT have a &quot;massive advantage&quot; over warriors in exp content.   That was only true when there was the major aggro disparity, and their tanking while undisced is pretty close to ours.<br />
<br />
So, if it's NOT the case when discs aren't an issue, then FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, why would it be an issue assuming they got a disc that allowed them to be HALF as good as us yet ensure personal survivability?    It's a total no-brainer.<br />
<br />
You're confusing advantage in tanking in with advantage in group desirability.  I never said knights would become the better tank.  But they would have a larger advantage in group desirability due to being able to tank normal mobs AND the big hitters (if they got a disc) AND supply supporting roles.  Taking on big hitting mobs with single groups used to be the realm of the pure tank; a knight defensive would take that away.<br />
<br />
<br />
You just love spinning stories with no support don't you?   The entire scenario you just painted, while colorful and interesting is not based in any reality whatsoever.    What you're telling me is that guilds, when retirements occur, will automatically snag tanks who are NOT capable still of tanking cutting edge content nearly as safely as a warrior BECAUSE THEY CAN FUCKING ROOT AND HEAL 10% OF A PLAYER'S HITPOINTS?  <br />
Again, go back to the only reason why warriors are even needed on the &quot;cutting edge content&quot;: we have defensive.  Give that ability to knights and they WILL BE tanking the &quot;cutting edge content&quot;, if they're not already.  Run into an especially tough mob?  Break out the couple warriors left in the guild, then throw them aside again for the rest of the raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
This example is another example of you tossing stuff out that contradicts your own position.   Beastlords can slow almost as well as Shamans can, and druids can heal better than shamans can, yet NO ONE uses beastlords to slow on raid level targets, and NO ONE has replaced shamans on raids.   If your position were accurate that people are willing to take slightly lesser abilities for the side benefits, then Shamans would've been phased out of guilds in PoP.   They haven't, thus contradicting your position.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the interesting thing is this isn't even a valid comparison.   The beatlord can slow to within 5% of the Shaman, whereas if the comparison were to be valid, you'd have to say that a guild would be willing to forego a Shamans' slow if a Beastlord only had a 35% slow, which is asinine.<br />
<br />
No one uses bsts to slow?  We sure as hell do.  They can take a much better beating than a shaman and let the shaman focus on debuffs/buffs/DoTs.  We're down to 1-2 shamans per raid, and it doesn't slow us down at all because we have 1-4 Bsts per raid.  The thing is, shamans have OTHER SKILLS, not just slow.  Warriors have nothing other than tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm amused at this.  So what you're saying then is that things cannot be implemented into EQ where there's no precedence?    Well, there's no precedence to a discipline being of such high value for content that's resctricted to 6 people, yet it showed up.   Instancing had no precedent before it was implemented.   Hell, /disc defensive had no precedent before it was implemented.   Using your standard, every expansion would be an exact replica of the old world.<br />
<br />
You still missed the whole point.  Yes, new skills get added.  Yes, the game evolves.  But you're proposing to add 1 single skill for only 2 classes that crosses 2 expansion end-game zones and is REQUIRED to &quot;bring things into balance&quot;.  If you don't see something wrong with this, there's no help for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, fine, I get it so if there were a &quot;right click&quot; which acheived the same goal then there's no objection?  Ok that's fine, make it right click. <br />
<br />
It wouldn't object to that method of obtainning the skill, but I would still object to the skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which guilds are doing Kod + GoD that aren't gonna be going to time?  Which guilds are gonna move straight from open zones into GoD?   This is progression, if you want to &quot;gear up&quot; then you go where the gear is.    Funny, I remember early in Luclin when mobs had 20 bazillion hitpoints, my guild going back to VP every week to get rend robes.   <br />
<br />
We've done Time once since GoD came out.  Out of all the quest steps known about in Kod'Taz at this time, we average out to about 60% done for everyone in the guild.  Time serves no purpose other than a dead-end farm, and there's no way you'll see guilds going back to reflag recruits for Time access if they're already doing GoD stuff.  Ikkinz raid 4 is is loaded with Quarm+ items and the rest of the raids are P4-Quarm quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a single knight on any forum or in-game make the claim that a Pre-Time knight should be able to tank these encounters.    Not a one.<br />
<br />
Where did this comment come from?  I certainly never said pre-Time knights should be able to do it either.  Re-read what I wrote...  You were upset that pre-Time warriors were beating (with difficulty) the trials and that was wrong since Time knights were having trouble.  I repsonded with &quot;So what?&quot;  If you make it so hard that pre-Time warriors can't do it but want Time knights to be able to do it, you'll have to make Time knights match toe-to-toe with Time warriors in tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, 2 things.  <br />
<br />
1. You're preaching the non-evolution of EQ<br />
<br />
2. This is outside the realm of reality since I've seen very few objections to this, and any objections I've seen have been rebutted BY KNIGHTS. <br />
 <br />
No, I'm preaching to not break the fucking game.<br />
<br />
Then those KNIGHTS rebutting you are correct.  Deny them a class skill because they don't have access to the end zone of a previous expansion?  I know I'd be pissed as hell if that were true for my class.<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of shitty knights you have in your guild, but ours have no problem picking up tank mezzes or even tanking the mini-bosses in Ikkinz.  Do we use them extensively?  No.  Would we if knights had defensive?  Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">But I just remember this arguement. <br />

&quot;Knights&quot; yes it is. we are the ubah tank class now, after all you have defensive Lolz its your only raid ability so we have better group desirability. <br />
<br />
Wow, shoe's on the other foot and knights are screaming NOOOOOOOO , We need defensive now to take everything away from the warrior !!!!1!!one11!!<br />
<br />
Does that mean that their position was the correct one at the time?  I am apparently among very few around here that believes in being consistent, that double standards are bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps this is where you're hung up on this, I don't know.  I have *never* been at ANY time in favor of knights getting defensive.   Defensive is a 50% mitigation modification.  The proposal I support is 25% NOT 50%.<br />
<br />
Tanking a routine Ikk boss, with a DB of 200 and a DI of 100.<br />
<br />
Warrior max hit defensive:  1200  or... DB + ((/ran 1 20*DI)/2)<br />
<br />
Knight max hit with proposed disc: 1700 or... DB+((/ran 1 20*DI)*.75)<br />
<br />
Everyone else max hit: 2200 or.. DB+(/ran 1 10 *DI)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm FAIRLY certain that your other arguments have rested on the premise of knights having defensive, which I do NOT support and am NOT arguing for in any way shape or form.   <br />
<br />
Since the bulk of your other arguments rest on what I think is a misunderstanding of what was being asked for, I'm gonna give you a chance to respond since it's been cleared up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">Well I am a long way off from seeing any of the trials being discussed so my comments are not based on any experience with these encounters only observations.<br />
<br />
Back on November 6, 2003 Frodlin stated:<br />
<br />
The answer is *ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, UNDENIABLY* yes, a resounding yes! There should absolutely positively be mobs that no one but a warrior can tank. Otherwise I want aggro premonitions. I want mobs to sense me thinking about taunting and turning beating on me.  <br />
<br />
in response to this quote:<br />
<br />
Basically what it boils down to is, should a warrior have such an advantage in tanking ability, that no other class can reach the baseline plateu it takes to tank something, given the upgrades that are achieved through farming the zone? <br />
<br />
Reference to above quotes (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=56400#post56400)<br />
<br />
It seems that SoE has taken this statement by Frodlin to heart and has created an encounter that is best tankable by a warrior.<br />
<br />
Now that there is such an encounter in the game, the knights are up-in-arms because they have extreme difficulty with high group risk in winning the encounter.  What we do not know yet, or at least I have not read about yet, is if there are trials/raid mobs that by their nature/design in future content that will result in the warrior being the high risk group member and the knight will be the preferred tank.<br />
<br />
If after moving to the end of GoD, the knights are not able to come back to these trials and have a higher success rate, but are successful after these particular encounters and there is no equivalent mob after these trials that puts knights out in front, then I would comfortably say that the encouter is tuned improperly.<br />
<br />
However, if they can 1) come back and have much greater succcess or 2) there are encounters tuned to a knights strengths after these mobs, then I would say that everything is working as SoE intended.<br />
<br />
While I can understand the knights wanting to have some form of defensive, I mean honestly who doesn't want to take less damage, there just is not enough facts out there about all the GoD encounters to implement a change to the knights at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Interestingly, the supported plan doesn't alter that concept one iota, as there STILL would exist a HUGE gap between warrior and knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">rofl, 2200 down to 1200 with defensive?  I don't know what version of defensive you're using, but it's not the same as mine.<br />
<br />
On average (depending on mob, of course), defensive ends up decreasing melee damage by roughly 33%, not the 45+% you have here (2200 to 1200).  I can always guess a creatures max hit by seeing what my max defensive hit was to within 100hp or so.  You would need to be tanking a mob that hits for 3k+ in order for a half-defensive disc to show a disparity of 500 damage.<br />
<br />
My premises are based on knights having even a 25% defensive.  If you want the skill, make a damn warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm also very curious as to your 180 degree shift on your stance, Frodlin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">Shaiel, do you even know how melee damage is calculated in EQ?    It's a simple premise if you know the DI and DB of the mob, you can PRECISELY calculate every single hit value, no guessing, no nothing.   It's an absolute formula.<br />
<br />
For instance, AoW, Max hit is 1154 non defensive, 704 defensive (incidentally 929 with the proposed knight disc that you claim makes warriors obsolete).   There's no percentage based guesses, it's exact and there's no other way to look at it.  It's simply put, irrefutable.   <br />
<br />
There is NO 180 degree shift, I have been totally consistent on this issue since day 1.   As a matter of fact, I posted the following on PoN this week.<br />
<br />
Oh, I've made it no secret, I believe fundamentally that warriors should be a requirement for tanking through new raid level content. Not a luxury, not &quot;the best choice among many options&quot;, a hard coded requirement.<br />
<br />
With a spread of 25% mitigation, this is totally easy to do.</div></div><hr />

A Paladin posted a spell proposal that was essentially 25% damage reduction 3 minute buff (waaaaaay too high) for 1500 mana as a spell. I modified his proposal to:<br />
<br />
Knight's Resolve<br />
Level: 65<br />
Casting time: 0<br />
Mana cost: 6000<br />
Requirement: 1 Jasper; GoD only<br />

<br />

<br />
A mana cost of 6000 to preclude non high-level Knights from casting this spell (until they geared up) and to preclude casting anything other than aggro spells after it was cast. If you want a Hybrid's &quot;share&quot; of a Warrior discipline, cast like a Warrior at least for awhile.<br />
<br />
GoD Only - no need in previous content has been shown.<br />
<br />
Damage Reduction TBD - to be determined by SoE to meet stated criteria which have not yet been established.<br />
<br />
The Paladin goal appears to be comperable Warrior reliability vs all GoD one-group trial named and one group non-raid named mobs in open zones. And of course since it is not limited to group use it would have application to off tanking harder raids adds.<br />
<br />
15 minute recourse effect. Some zones contain more than one named mob 15 minutes or less apart.<br />

I'm not going to make myself a liar and oppose it if Paladins sign on (I doubt that they will - many PoN posters are exceptionally greedy eheh).<br />

 Why not just give them /defensive? Same duration, same effect on OUR casting! :p <br />
<br />
 That aside, the correct idea should be an autoparry disc, not a /defensive. They traded their mitigation for spellbooks, other casting hybrids get autoparry, therefore they should get a form of autoparry. Combine that with Vie, Runes, self healing capabilities/burst damage capabilities and decent healing and you have a tank that SHOULD be able to tank a sub-192 second encounter.<br />

<br />
I have for quite some time stated and stated repeatedly that Knights give up Tanking capability and DPS as a cost of having a spellbook. Spells and mana should be the cost of regaining as much of either as they are allowed.<br />
<br />
The revised proposal meets many of the criteria of the proposal you supported with a mana cost. Tank like a Warrior/Cast like one at least for awhile.<br />
<br />
(BTW, this idea will be rejected. It can't compete with half-Defensive plus full unfettered use of the spellbook. Yummm)<br />
-----------<br />
Partha,<br />
You don't want to give them Defensive because it's their spells that are powerful and might allow too much unplaned synergy - not their disciplines.<br />
<br />
Knight's are concerned (and rightfully so) that SoE is not about to do a wholesale revision of their spellbook. It might even be that SoE sees them as secondary tanks with already powerful spellbooks. Their best bet is Knight Defensive or the kind of thing described above. I don't like Knight Defensive, which unfortunately can be implimented with &quot;cut and paste&quot;. I believe it would be given to Knights from level 50ish onward and have potentially waaaaaay too much synergy with their spells.<br />

I like the spell idea (LOVE the autoparry more though 8D).  Big problem I see is that is GoD supposed to be the follow up for PoT?  Check my magelo out under mana.  That is just a quick throw together, and doesnt cover every slot as weel as someone else could, but it would allow a ele flagged knight to come REAL close to the mana cost for the spell w/o ever killing one of the 4 ele gods.  Throw in a few augs and swap some gear out and it could be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since mana regens quite quickly, and the costs of aggro spells are minimal, my notion with a 25% spell haste reduction actually penalizes casting by offerring greater opportinities for interrupts FAR more than yours and not only that, it has a 40 min refresh.</div></div><hr />

It will be interesting to see PoN Paladins show distain for it. (And they will).<br />
<br />
Don't worry, I have on good authority that SoE thinks long and hard should they decide to do something like this. There are plenty of levers to adjust.<br />
<br />
That &quot;proposal&quot; raises all kinds of conciderations not raised by the fix and forget Knight Defensive solution with it's 25% DI reduction arbitrarily plucked out ot thin air.<br />

<br />
A fair number of players are discouraged by GoD atm. Knight Defensive is not likely help with customer retention.<br />

If you ask me that sounds pretty good BB. The only quirk in this is the game mechanics on spell casting. Would you still be in favor of this a an disc? <br />
<br />
If SoE can code that memming a spell with a 15min refresh can be cast immediately if it hasn't been used in the past 15mins then it can stay as a spell that's fine.<br />
<br />
Also when you say cannot cast anything apart from aggro spells. Is this during the refresh period also? Or just during the use of the ability?<br />

For starters knights are mostly tanks, the other hybrids are NOT. Don't you think it's LOGICAL for knights to have greater survivability from the offset AND with a few limited abilities to tank better than non tank hybrids? I mean it DOES make sense since knights DO wear plate. <br />

5500 is atainable(i have been drinking!!) by non PoTime geared knights!  Look at my magelo called mana.  it totals out at 5300ish mana and there are still a few slots that can be changed and augs that can be added.  It is all attainable by a ele geared knight WITHOUT clearing PoTime.<br />

Defensive hits us in Endurance. It's out limited resourse. The proposal I made hits Paladins in their limited resource - mana.

Fine call it knights avoidance and it won't have the same name or come from you. :)<br />

Seriously the game is designed where the tanking difference between a warrior and a knight is about 10x more than the tanking difference between a knight and a bst/rng. That isn't logical no matter which way you look at it.</div></div><hr />

Granted there is not a staggering effect on agro but we have a lesser margin of error for a -agro effect, knights have a much grater margin of error.<br />
<br />
ATM defensive drains my END pool under 20% with all elemental gear but BP and the 3 levels of END regen so IMO there is no real cost there, even if I am linking my furrious and felstrike I still have the END to incite a few times.<br />
<br />
Mana is only a limited rosource in groups where your unlikely to have more than one necro if any. They would be getting a massive ability, it should have some 'stiff' side effects to it. And a -agro side effect will keep tanking balanced equal on all fronts because with it they can still use an effect on inc then pop on the dis so they start with ok agro but need to work at keeping it.<br />
<br />
shadowedspawn, I have very little idea on the SK spell line up but it seems like to me that SK spells have a much longercast time and there fore would be more hurt by casting slow makeing a SK far less desirable, the agro reduction idea would hurt both equaly because of the requirement to cast about twice as often to have the old agro level.</div></div><hr />

Shaiel, do you even know how melee damage is calculated in EQ?    It's a simple premise if you know the DI and DB of the mob, you can PRECISELY calculate every single hit value, no guessing, no nothing.   It's an absolute formula.<br />
<br />
For instance, AoW, Max hit is 1154 non defensive, 704 defensive (incidentally 929 with the proposed knight disc that you claim makes warriors obsolete).   There's no percentage based guesses, it's exact and there's no other way to look at it.  It's simply put, irrefutable.   <br />
It's an exact formula for known mobs... I'm talking mobs we've never fought, where the DI and DB are NOT KNOWN.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is NO 180 degree shift, I have been totally consistent on this issue since day 1.   As a matter of fact, I posted the following on PoN this week.<br />
<br />
With a spread of 25% mitigation, this is totally easy to do.  <br />
There is a TOTAL 180 on your position.<br />

&quot;Because, we give up a spellbook for this ability to tank.

Don't know why I continue to reply to you though Partha seeing as how you saying it's bad is no different than the Knights who aren't at the appropriate level of progression saying its good.<br />
<br />
This explanation probally won't come across very well but oh well, the reason people on PoN/SKO say hybrids don't exist is because a 75/25 split in a game such as EQ leaves you worse off in all cases than 100% of one class.  I'm not going to pull a Kunark card or something here but Kunark does illustrate my point with this clearly, hybrids were 75/25 there and look how poor the balance was.  Thats why hybrids don't really exist, you have to think of them as their own classes or else you end up making the class too far behind in all areas to be useful.</div></div><hr />

This will ensure that only a few Time geared Knights will ever be able to use it.  Also as procs add into DPS a silence is cutting DPS down.  Say you have a SK using Cudgel of Venomous Hatered w/ the highest yak aug and WA5.  Now add in SA3 w/ Black Shroud.  You have just cut his DPS down a bit due to proc and heals he isnt going to get let alone the life taps that most use on a regular basis for the extra heal kick.<br />

<br />
Actually, I'm most comfortable with a position of relative balance.   I don't think that there's inherent &quot;rightness&quot; based on the class of a person making an argument.   The double standard is fucking amazing, regular defensive warriors at 55 or hell, 65 who aren't gonna be in GoD really wouldn't be affected by my proposal one iota since they're not going to be grouping or raiding in PoNightmares or BoT with knights who'd gotten the disc anyhow.   <br />
<br />
What's amazing to me is you fucking know this, yet gloss it over as some &quot;classwide issue&quot;.   It's not a &quot;classwide issue&quot; it's an upper end issue where NOT ONCE have you shown me, NOT A SIGNLE FUCKING TIME a rationale for this replacing a warrior ANYWHERE on a raid level mob.   You haven't shown me what Paladin skill justifies going from a warrior tank who can /disc furious to full defensive, to a knight who would even if this were implemented, be a significantly worse tank than a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
I note you didn't take issue with my other comments<br />
<br />
Oh don't get me wrong, I take issue with just about every comment you make, particularly accusing Paladins on this board of &quot;greed&quot; because they have pretty much stopped believeing that you're interested in anything other than blanket dominance over them.   They believe as do I that you're nothing but a festering pile of hypocracy who &quot;supports half defensive&quot; when it doesn't matter to you, but then when it actually becomes meaningful, high tails it out like the two-faced bullshit artist you've become known as.   Don't confuse skepticism with greed.   <br />
<br />
Is that Deepwater Armor on your arms? Just wondering<br />
<br />
If by this pathetic little comment, you're insinuating that because I happen to believe in class balance, that I'm a &quot;closet paladin&quot;, then you're barking up the wrong fucking tree.   <br />
<br />
This is what really fucks your little insinuation... the fact that I spent 2 and a half years, from when you were levelling up your warrior twink, identifying warrior issues and fighting for them.   Yep, I'd rest my history of being an advocate for warriors against yours any day of the week.   Your fabled &quot;history&quot; basically gets it's illustrious start with the fucking whinefest that phase 1 warrior improvements weren't enough, without ever testing them, without jumping in and seeing for yourself, but with sitting on the sidelines like the little ex-paladin cheerleader you are simply yapping up cliches and pretending you had credibility.   You are the chihuahua of warrior advocates, one who growls and tugs at pantlegs, yet has no fucking meat to his bite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">Uhm pretty sure warriors would have been tuned, frodlin or no frodlin. <br />
<br />
And personally I find these 2 never-ending knight threads laughable, like any dev is going to read through 50 pages of talk  between a handfull of people(frod/brael and the choir) of whom only a very small percentage got a clue. They probably just flip to the last page of the thread like I occasinally do to see what people are bitching about at the moment.<br />
<br />
As for the defensive disc proposal to knights, I think its a BAD idea. It is our only really unique skill and should stay that way. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, giving PAL/SKs some sort of short duration riposte disc or fortitude thing I wouldnt mind as much. That particular skill is already farmed out to alot of classes in one form or the other, so why not them too.<br />
<br />
Also what exactly is the problem you are trying to &quot;solve&quot;? I just did K3 today, with Pal+SK+Bard+Cleric+Rogue. Without the paladins BSS and assist heals and 11k LOH on the first named(Hexxt Sightsliverer) I am pretty sure we would have been toast. <br />
The SK with 10ish K HT also pulled her weight IMO, although could have been replaced with any other DPS(Wiz/Ranger etc).<br />
<br />
So IMO these guys DO have a role on the trials(at least Paladins do, SKs could use a bit more help). It just might not be the &quot;glory&quot; role of being MT, but they certainly arent useless.</div></div><hr />

 Show us a rationale for changing classes with all the inherent possibilities FOR breaking content that entails and changing 'balance' that makes it the obvious choice over retuning the mobs.

Your fabled &quot;history&quot; basically gets it's illustrious start with the fucking whinefest that phase 1 warrior improvements weren't enough...<br />
Suggesting I only spoke out after SoE had changes in test is a bald faced lie. The threads are still there. Want me to link them?<br />
<br />
When the survivability issue had little or no life in it I started threads and discussed it guite a bit. I discussed the aggro issue quite a bit also Frodlin.<br />
<br />
Yep, I did argue that a ranged taunt ability just like the Paladin one would be better (without a stun effect). I argued that HP's would be better than &quot;-1 DI&quot;, I poked fun at the Dancing Star powerups.<br />
<br />
Paladins now argue our aggro is better so they deserve something, if Knight's get &quot;-5 DI&quot; at need and can MT 99.9975% of all known mobs it kinda makes &quot;-1&quot; look a lot less meaningful for any mob that dies in under 3 minutes. Dancing Star powerups? What Dancing Star powerups?<br />
<br />
Yes, the Paladins with little or no PoTime equipment that want Defensive don't like me. They've pointed out that I argued quite a bit about the Aggro issue. Check the Magelos of the Paladin posters - feel free. How many look to be ready for advanced challanges?<br />
<br />
Now I normally don't get in pissing contests. So why don't you take your broken little Knight Defensive proposal and limp your sorry self back to the PoN Class Balance board where they like your idea (stay away from the Lord Protectors Citidel though, that's for high level Paladins and they seem to be a little more sensible).<br />
<br />
Whinefest??!! For someone who feeds hope of getting Defensive to low level Paladins that go &quot;Whaaaa we need Defensive.&quot; every couple of weeks and whenever the facts change look for another freaking excuse to have it you seem oddly at home among whiners.<br />

BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u223"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p223">Frod is right.  In many places I posted that initially I was expecting Discord to be a blending of LDoN and POP.  So far its fallen very short of it.  In the end something like Defensive maybe needed because I don't see SOE being savy enough to figure out how to make these things challenging with their caveman design princples (Ung...HIT HARDER...bunga).  To do this you would need to redo each and every encounter in Discord (and I mean everything) and I really don't think SOE can handle that.<br />
<br />
Beyond this, Warriors are no more or less any class for their abilities they have.  Warrior didn't give up healing to be Warriors any more than they gave up being able to feign death.  At the risk of being a tantology, Warriors are defined as Warriors.<br />
<br />
The point of this thread is not what Warriors can do but what Paladins seem to lack.  If you can't see how Paladins just don't fit in many of Discord events (and I do mean stuff beyond trials progressions) then you are either being blissfully ignorant or beligerent.  It has nothing to do with Warriors.  Warriors are fine tanks now.  Warriors will be fine tanks no matter what happens to Paladins.  If you think fixing these problems is will do irreputable harm to your class then you guys clearly don't believe in your class.  I never once believed that giving Warriors their changes to improve agro would ruin Paladins and it did.  Why are some of you so sure fixing Paladins will break Warriors?</div></div><hr />

Why would someone who has gone on record as saying Warriors don't need more survivability they need utility before the Phase 1 Changes think they had much credability with Warriors? You've made it pretty clear you want 3 equal tanks with Paladins having nice Cleric spells and Warriors having &quot;Tendon Slice&quot; if that good. I particularly like your posts on the topic 'Defensive should be Removed from the Game'. Is Derringer going to speak with the &quot;voice of reason&quot; next?<br />
<br />
Paladins don't need more survivability, they need more utility. Their problem is not that they can't tank named high DI mobs as effectively as Warriors can- they aren't supposed to, it's that their backup tank/utility role has atrophied.<br />
<br />
Paladins are fine in normal experiance groups. They have good enough tanking ability to MT all of PoTime. There's no question GoD mobs hit harder. Add Tanks may need 2 healers in their group.<br />
<br />
What Paladins can't do is MT high DI mobs like Warriors - that's the Warrior defining ability and something Paladins have not been able to do for 4 years and reinforced by the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change not much more than 2 months ago.<br />
<br />
I posted a Knight Mitigation proposal that would allow Defensive like mitigation on demand as much as SoE thinks you should have. It's ignored because it empties the manabar (except for enough mana to maintain aggro) - Tank like a Warrior, then cast like a Warrior.<br />

We was allways able to tank nameds. Stop your high DI mob bullshit. And again for the not so smart people. We have 16 classes. We have 6 spots. Hello, you can not have a 100% need for a class in one spot. You know the moment you have a 100% need and you can asgood say sorry GoD is high DI we can tank you can not tank. It is okay it is high DI mobs. I say it is broken. It is broken because i sit on me ass and wait on warriors to log in and then i have to fight against the ohter 13 not needed class that this warrior join me and not  one of them. If you dont want that we can tank, okay give us utility but this dont fix the 16 classes/ 6 spots problem. Then you have to let ranger, monks etc. be maintank. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SHARE YOUR SPOT WITH OTHERS ASLONG WE HAVE MORE CLASSES THEN WE HAVE SPOTS AND SO NO CLASS SHOULD BE 100% NEEDED. That is the mainproblem. And yes the problem exist with clerics to, but the maindifference is that there exist way, way more clerics then warriors and so every guild miss warriors to make GoD groups and not clerics. I sit on me ass most of me time because this bullshit. If you cant see how broken this system is you ether are an idiot or you simple think it is okay because it give you 100% domination over the other classes.<br />
<br />
Damm warriors get invited in our guilds in less then 1 minute when they log in. Knights sit arround for more then 60 minutes and most of the time we log off then without a groupe. If this isnt broken i dont know what you call broken.<br />

Face it, you are a HYBRID, not as good at tanking as your main class, get over it. Your spellbook has a price, and I personally find it revolting how the greedy Knights avoid paying the price for it. That is decreased tanking ability, everything has a cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Sure, why the hell not.<br />
<br />
 Max druid heal is 4650, Max cleric heal is 7500. That does not include focus effects or AA's. That's 62% of the cleric heal, not counting in the 10% bonus Clerics supposedly get.<br />
<br />
 Max Pally tanking under defensive is X. Max Warrior tanking under defensive is .5X. That's 53% of the Warrior tanking, since Warriors get an inherent 5% to begin with.]<br />

 I never once believed that giving Warriors their changes to improve agro would ruin Paladins and it did. Why are some of you so sure fixing Paladins will break Warriors? <br />
<br />
 Because Warriors lack the utility of Paladins. However much you may decry it, against all but the most cutting edge content, the advantages of that utility outweigh the tanking drawbacks it cost.<br />
Remember, this is much why Fading Memories helped make monks unloved - a core ability was given to another class that worked too much like the core ability and had not enough of a penalty attached.<br />

I'm not sure if it was in this thread or one of the other two similar ones where the idea Frodlin had was originally presented but it evolved and I was thinking about the idea of an Ikkinz drop with a turnin in Time, this might be ok right now but as time goes on new people being picked up in guilds have a decent chance to not be time keyed, the thought of always having to go back and time key Knights to get their disc is a bit upsetting so I would suggest also putting a turnin NPC for this in Qvic somewhere so if a Knight gets picked up later on and doesn't have a Time key they won't be so screwed.  Just one slight adjustment that should be made to the proposal.</div></div><hr />

The aggro change given to Warriors that was not part of the normal course of events was the Incite line. I rather doubt that the Anger augs and WA5 were part of the change. But nonetheless:<br />

DBoW(Force of YKesha), EoE(Strike of YKesha), Symbol of the Planesmaster, Raex BP, Crystalline Silk Net, Bow<br />

Many Paladins and a couple Warriors stated that at the high end of the game Warriors handled aggro just fine. Are you suggesting at the high end of the game a Warrior could not obtain and hold aggro without the Incite line, Anger III augs, and WA5? If not, how then with already adequate aggro at the high end game did the Warrior aggro changes unbalance the game at the high end? Oh, they didn't. I didn't think so.<br />
<br />
Taragor,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you don't think Warriors with Defensive have an interest in wether Paladins get a version - they do. When SoE thought about Warrior aggro changes and read what players thought, they were undoubtedly sensitive to Paladin sensibilities. The Incite line in fact resembles a suggestion on PoN made by Paladins rather than a stun clone that didn't stun but aggroed like it did suggested be some Warriors. I expect they will be just as sensitive about Warrior sensibilities should Knights get &quot;burst mitigation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Weaponshield, spellbook improvements, or my suggestion which Paladins show no interest in are all solutions that do not involve giving Knights a piece of a central defining Warrior capability unique among tanks.<br />

Seriously if you call warrior log in, get tell. Move to GoD. And Knight log in, asking for groupe, searching warrior, waiting 30+ minutes, log of or wait another 30+ minutes balance it dont make sense to talk with you. <br />
<br />
I logged in 6 times and logged off 30+ minutes later without a groupe.  One time i found a warrior and made a groupe with roque, warrior, cleric, wizzard, enchanter, paladin(me). We move to GoD and then the cleric which should come asked who is 2. healer and i asked him i am assist healer. He said he need a better 2. healer. After 15 minutes i gave me spot to a 2. cleric and logged out. GoD is damm frustrating for knights.<br />

 If you're trying to do Ikkinz trials with a pickup group, you deserve to fail. If your guild is flagging people and pass up pallies deliberately, they deserve to fail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u240"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p240">Arbosch and other Knight posters,<br />
<br />
One week into the new expansion Paladins on PoN were already clamoring for Defensive. This is despite reports by several members of advanced guilds that their Knights had in fact already tanked the Ikkinz trials. The clamor by PoN posters for Defensive (or a peice of it) continues even though each set of reasons (and there have been several) tend to be far less convincing when examined.<br />
<br />
Currently, most high level Knights conceed that their problems in getting flagged are confined to two trials. I assume these are Ikkinz 1 &amp; 2. I've heard that DD has been adjusted, but I don't know the details.<br />
<br />
In reading about and listening to one of my guildmates, one of the Ikkinz trials pretty much &quot;requires&quot; 2 tanks - there are two mobs that must be tanked at once. One of those tanks is generally a warrior. The other can be a Knight.<br />
<br />
I think one thing that is happening is that under geared Knights are attempting trials and some are failing repeatedly and predictably. This would help create the impression that Knights in general suck and not not these undergeared examples of Knighthood.<br />
<br />
Knights do not suck if you check you will discover the cream of the crop Knights are flagged and the top guilds are making good progress (up to a brick wall in later guild events).<br />
<br />
Some of the trials are more of a crap shoot for Knights (any of the tank classes can and do fail). But they only have to be passed once IF AT ALL (still something unanswered). If I thought the dice were loaded at the craps table, I would move over to Baccarat and try my luck there.<br />
<br />
The &quot;action&quot; is not confined to any particular GoD trial or even GoD itself. In fact one group efforts in my guild are directed at getting the last few stragglers flagged for raiding and one group camping spells (not augs although they do drop, and certainly not the crappy items which even our twinks are uninterested in for the most part). The majority of our members are back to doing LDoN (guaranteed 40HP augs) or PoEarth (the slackers are still finishing off the useful Gates AA Abilities).<br />
<br />
When /lfg during early PoP I most certainly did not setup shop in the PoJ trials except to try to pass any trial once - despite the fact some nice items dropped there. I got my experiance and items in content I could handle.<br />

 Max druid heal is 4650, Max cleric heal is 7500. That does not include focus effects or AA's. That's 62% of the cleric heal, not counting in the 10% bonus Clerics supposedly get.<br />
<br />
 Max Pally tanking under defensive is X. Max Warrior tanking under defensive is .5X. That's 53% of the Warrior tanking, since Warriors get an inherent 5% to begin with.]<br />
<br />
The difference Parthe is that their % remains equal at all times within their functionality.<br />
<br />
IE: There will always ONLY be a 3000hp (give or take a few hp) difference between both spells.<br />
<br />
Defensive on the other hand cuts the damage output of incoming melee by half, but it SCALES since it doesn't have a maximum working %<br />
<br />
IE: War vs Knight under defensive<br />
<br />
Mob X 4k/6k/8k/10kmdpr (mdpr = melee dmg per round)<br />
<br />
War: 2kmdpr /  Kni: 4kmdpr<br />
War: 3kmdpr /  kni: 6kmdpr<br />
War: 4kmdpr /  Kni: 8kmdpr<br />
War: 5kmdpr /  Kni: 10kmdpr<br />
<br />
As you can see from this simplistic comparison, (simplistic because other factors affect those numbers like gear/effects/skill caps/etc not to mention opening discs) <br />
<br />
Though the percentage between the 2 remains constant (50%), the actual physical dmg difference increases. THAT is why comparing cle/dru to war/kni abilities doesn't work. It's also why defensive is so powerful in regards to any and all other abilities in the game. Because it's the only thing that truly scales 100% with the environment. <br />
<br />
I'd also like you to note the following:<br />
<br />
-First mob a paladin can be healed by a druid or cleric to 100%<br />
-Second mob pal can be healed to 100% only by a cleric<br />
-Last 2 mobs neither class can heal a knight to 100%<br />
<br />
-First 3 a war can be healed to 100% by a druid or cleric<br />
-4th requires a cleric though would only be 350hp short with a druid<br />
<br />
<br />
So again for simplistic purposes. (gear/effect/skill caps/etc)<br />
<br />
A knight only tanks about 25% as well as a warrior under defensive. NOT 50%. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, Taragor, you're a melee. You don't do your damage at range, you're melee, whatever else you want to call yourself.<br />
<br />
My point was that kngihts were not created as a melee (dps) class as the other hybrids were. We were created as a tanking hybrid. Saying that BECAUSE dps hybrid classes only got X  means knights shouldn't get something different is flawed reasoning. Especially when you factor in the fact that we didn't even get that X.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">Taragor,<br />
<br />
You are primarily a melee. A melee that because of player convention tanks. A Warrior and Cleric based plate wearer that has roughly equal preferance in normal experiance groups and because Warriors have Defensive and &quot;-1 DI&quot; a comparative disadvantage vs. high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
It is this Warrior capability that makes Warriors the Primary Tank with MT duties on raids and gives them a preference vs. any high DI mob (in the absence of any other mob special ability) anywhere.<br />
<br />
Warrior - base DPS + Defensive (and related abilities including &quot;-1 DI&quot;) that has major advantages vs. high DI mobs. Generally raid MT's or in line to MT.<br />
<br />
Knight - a Tank hybrid without Defensive (and related abilities) that can not easily tank high DI mobs that instead cast priestly spells (support/healing) or necromantic spells (DPS).<br />
<br />
The three tanks are equally accepted in normal experiance groups. But, in the most brutal battles (high DI mobs) Warriors shine.<br />
<br />
The specific encounters can be adjusted, but this would not address two issues that exist separate from these trials.<br />
<br />
1. Plate tanks are not sufficiently differentiated from non-Plate tanks and GoD adds can hit harder than adds in previous expanions.<br />
<br />
2. Knights should have a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability.<br />
<br />
A better solution is giving Plate wearers an always present mitigation advantage (Plate AC bonus?) compared to non-Plate wearers that ocassionally tank.<br />
<br />
AND Knights can be given scaleable &quot;burst mitigation&quot; by SoE if they can prove to SoE it's needed. Their step-brother, the Ranger, has Weapon Shield - an entirely appropriate ability that does not intrude upon Warrior preference vs. high DI mobs. There IS precidence that can be used as a guide found in this Warrior based hybrid.<br />
<br />
Any solution should avoid as much as possible disturbing both the lack of preference in normal experiance groups and intruding on the Warrior class defining ability - the only Tank that effectively acts on DI to more effectively tank high DI mobs.<br />

<br />
The stand down was for the just below the Uber Warriors to low end warriors without access to enraging blow weapons. We had problems holding aggros, not those with the time to waste playing EQ 40 hours+ a week! The &quot;high end&quot; Warriors, very well did have no problem holding aggro (or very little problem). I know, my roomy has a fairly high end Warrior, SoD/BoC combo held aggro fine. Course he bought the SoD on PA, and plays 60-80 hours a week (not an exageration) so he got the BoC. 6 BoCs and 6 Helms dropped while we farmed Kael, Warriors who played 40+ hours a week got BoCs, those who didn't got the helms.<br />
Of course all these Ubers consider themselves &quot;great&quot; players. Thats why I just pummel them in duels. One was talking smack in NRO while we were both &quot;lfg&quot;, I left his dead carcass out there after a nice duel.<br />
I see way to much bias towards the so called &quot;high end&quot; game here. I guess its okay that SKs plain dominate PvP amongst tanks, and PvP WAY outweighs GoD in number of players involved and $$$. But SOE doesn't see it that way. I think they are stupid for not booting out of the game the ones creating the most whining, at the supposed &quot;high end&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The Knights are lying to you again. The REAL reason no one wanted Knights in a group then was the 40% exp penalty they brought. Even when the penalty was removed many less knowledgable players thought it was still in effect. Knight whining further destroyed the classes (SK and Paladin) by exagerating their weaknesses. Some Knights listened to the idiots preaching DEXTERITY affected &quot;to hit&quot; and other stupidity, plus Knights having to much caster gear on hurting their tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt say Dominate.  I have been beaten by a war twice and 2 pallys in the 4 years I have been dueling :D  If it wasnt for the HT nerf no one would ever duel me.  I dueled a guildie rogue and monk 2 times each tonight.  I used HT for the fast kill the first time I dueled the rogue.  I won all four fights, and i am about the 2-3rd worst geared knight in my guild.  Its not alwyas about what you have but how you use it and play.<br />

Defensive plus a few more HP's on Cobalt armor made well-equipped Warriors the preferred raid MT. This mostly raid only Warrior superiority plus Knight complaints of group inferiority, which ended up being a self-fulfilling prophecy, eventually had groups looking for &quot;real tanks&quot;.<br />

<br />
 Um, no. The Knight still tanks at 50%, it's the healing efficiency which suffers. <br />
<br />
 But let's run the numbers with a 'mere' 25% defensive, shall we?<br />
<br />
 Warrior 2K, Knight 3K<br />
 Warrior 3K, Knight 4500<br />
 Warrior 4K, Knight 6K<br />
 Warrior 5K, Knight 7500<br />
<br />
 In your original example, in the most extreme example you gave, you determined:<br />
<br />
 /Defensive Warrior + Cleric = Knight + Cleric + Druid.<br />
<br />
 In the example above, even with the most extreme example, I've determined:<br />
<br />
 /Defensive Warrior + Cleric = /Defensive Knight + Cleric.<br />
<br />
 So, by your logic, they would tank equally? :p</div></div><hr />

Ok I have stayed out of this discussion because I said my peace and was happy with that.  Now I have to say something about Doomflayer and his mouth.  Not really sure how I want to go about this so I will just make some points on Dooms lack of knowldge on this subject.<br />
<br />
1) The xp penalty was actuay 20% for Knights.  SK's usualy got a double whammy from thier Race.   That is where the 40% you quote comes from.<br />
<br />
2) Lots of Warriors concentrated on Dexerity just like Knights did.  However all of those that did figured out they were wrong.  Not because they were Warriros or Knights but because they looked at the facts and changed thier play style.  <br />
<br />
3) Well since back around the time of Kunark since there was only a limited amount of Gear you could look at a Tank and tell what they were wearing.  This means Knights and Warriors shared some of the same equipment.  Usualy the biggest difference was class only gear.  This means we didn't run around wearing caster gear.  We had roughly the same equipment i.e. Fear gear, Kunark plate would be seen as similliar.<br />
<br />
4) As for whinning you need to look at yourself before you whine about others.<br />
<br />
5) I would like to apologize to any of the Inteligent Warriors out there since I do not mean to insult you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Great theory, Partha, if cheal was the heal being used in the areas where knights have the issues. Waiting 12.5 seconds between heals = dead tank, no matter the class. Try again, with Holy Light. It runs about 4.5k,  w/ appropriate Foci/AA, iirc. Knights wind up relying on the RNG - In this case, healer crits. Not a good thing.</div></div><hr />
