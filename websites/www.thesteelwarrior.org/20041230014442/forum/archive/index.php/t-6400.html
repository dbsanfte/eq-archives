<br />
I've read that we get a chance to stun with warrior kick after level 55. Is there a message that goes with that?<br />
<br />
If not, some developer ought to implement one. I recommned this: &quot;Percent Tee takes a foot where it matters and staggers in pain.&quot;<br />

<br />
That's the only sure tell sign that your kick stunned. I can say that from my experience kick stuns more often than not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't recall ever getting the feeling that kick stuns more often than not, but it's just eyeballing/observation sorta thing, and it seems like you could parse it fairly easily on another character, but I get the impression that PCs are a lot easier to stun than mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real problem with eyeballing stun is that the stun lasts about 2 seconds, but mob attack delay is 3 seconds (or 5 seconds once slowed).  So only rarely does your stun actually delay the mob's attacks.  When a mob is fleeing or casting, you get a much better sense of how often your kick causes a stun, and it does seem quite reliable in those cases.</div></div><hr />

Me either, the only time it doesnt work is if the kick was a miss, a message would be nice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen kicks not stun quite often, usually in higher level areas though.  It seems to be random which will and won't get stunned.  I'd love an aa that would increase how often it stuns.  A message that it stunned would be nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant kick can and will stun anything bash can, if its a succesful kick, kick stun wont work when bash wouldnt either on high level or unstunnable mobs. <br />
<br />
Bash is better for stuns only because it caps higher therefore has a higher hit to miss ratio, it wont stun anything a kick can not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kick stun is all or nothing.  If kick stuns something it will always stun it (assuming kick lands).<br />
<br />
An easy way to verify kick works is just run up to a mob, kick it, and walk backwards.  If kick lands and it is stunnable, it is very noticeable.  But since the kick stun time is short, and a melee round delay does refresh while stunned, the mitigation aspect of kick is almost nothing unless you know exactly when a mob is going to make another melee attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is always the same for that mob, however which mobs are unstunable by it, and which can be stunned seems to be random.  I've had a kick stun not interrupt a mob that could be stunned with a spell stun.  But if it did stun the mob once, could continue to stun it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't kick stun have a level limit of 55, like most spell stuns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, your kicks get the ability to stun at level 55.  AFAIK, there is no level limit with regards to mobs you can interrupt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kick stun seems to work up to around level 65.  However, at level 65 most things are flat out immune to kick stun, and immunity to kick stun doesn't tell you anything about whether a spell stun will land on it.  Of course if something is immune to spell stun it will be immune to kick stun too.<br />
<br />
I have seen it stun Razorfiends that are running so it for sure works up to at least level 62.  The higher level stuf is harder to verify, due to lack of level 63+ mobs that run.  Well, LDoN Hard is not a bad place to find them but it's pretty silly to let anything run on LDoN hard.  Pretty sure I have interrupted CH at least some of the times on LDoN hard with kick though so that puts level 63 at least as stunnable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interrupting casters isn't a surefire way either. Try a normal LDoN mission, and kick/slam every time the mob tries to cast. You'll notice that when it lands, it normally interrupts them. Then take a cleric mob and try to stun it like that while it's CHing. Notice that it nearly never works. Stupid cleric mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When kick works it always works and it is pretty easy to verify that.  You'll either always interrupt it or not at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking about inviting my wife to test this with me. She plays an epic'd druid, so I could have her cast that 9 second-casting DoT and while the cast is under way, give her a swift one in the gut.  <br />
<br />
I'll record how often a successful kick has a stun, and then how often the stun interrupts the cast.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'll really owe her after this. But if it advances science, it's probably worth all the hours of farming crap for the various tradeskills she's addicted to ....<br />

<br />
Will dig around in my log file, but it happened last night.<br />
<br />
Kick successfully landed (You kick a %t for xx points of damage)<br />
<br />
%t regains their concentration and continues casting.<br />
<br />
BTW to qualify your statement, I agree with you about PC's and not being able to channel through a stun, but I wouldn't think twice about Mobs having this ability.<br />
<br />
Oh, and persistent casting gives a chance to channel through a stun unless my reading comprehension hit 0 recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs can't regain their concentration and continue casting....once they are stunned their casting is instantly interupted.<br />
<br />
You kick %T for 20 points of damage<br />
%T's casting is interupted!<br />
<br />
The only way to continue casting through a stun is to have the new GoD AA and that's for player characters only as far as I've found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaruk</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: I thought I read somewhere that relative body mass affects the success rate of a stun on a bash, slam or kick, i.e.  a halfling would have a harder time stunning a barbarian than an ogre would. ----This true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ isn't that advanced lol. Body mass has nothing to do with it. In fact I don't think anything in the game has mass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A mob will never channel through a stun unless it can't be stunned.  I have never seen anything channel through Time Snap or Pestilence Shock (stun 68/65) unless it was immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I think a Stun spell is different than a kick stun, I have had BoT mobs channel thru my ghetto bashes or kicks, even normal LDoNs cleric mobs have channeled thru my kick landind with a &quot;soandso regains their concentration...&quot; and finally CHing themselves, and I was the only meele on the group (no others meeling).<br />
I've seen it plenty of times, like Donnel mentioned, so I dont think that a mob can't channel thru a stun kick or a bash. Im pretty sure they can't channel thru spell stuns tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs can be immune to the stun effect on kick/bash but not immune to spell stun.  Kick will never stun a mob that's immune to kick stun no matter how many times you try.  The mob will always regain its concentration and continue to cast.<br />
<br />
Though if a mob is immune to spell stun it is always immune to kick/bash stun as well.</div></div><hr />

However, just because they channel through does not make them immune. I have personally kicked and interrupted 3 spells only to have the CH channel through. Is it so hard to think that a mob might have some kind of persistant casting AA? Most of the time We fight the enemy 6 on 1, without some way to channel through a spell alot of the time, most mobs would never get to cast spells, which would seriously tone down their difficulty. Sounds like a design decision to me to keep the mobs in line with the difficulty they were supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

I've not been able to interupt CH's even landing 2 slams during the casting, when earlier in the fight I was interupting spells.</div></div><hr />
