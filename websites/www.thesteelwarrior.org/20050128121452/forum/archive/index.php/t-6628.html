<br />
I've been looking at getting a Royal Attendant Breastplate. It has type 1, type 2, and type 3 augs. I vaguely remember a nerf to this (I believe it was 2 type 2s and a type 3 originally) but since I wasn't playing EQ, I ignored it.<br />
<br />
Now here's my dilemma, what is a type one aug? I've never seen one drop and I can't find one for saale anywhere. I was told that type 7s fit in any slot but then why are some augs listed as type 7 and some are listed as any? Additionally, what are some items with type 8 aug slots? I see type 8 augs for sale but can't find any items to put them in.<br />
<br />
I know this is a bit of a n00b question but I just recently came back and can't find the info on this anywhere. :(</div></div><hr />

Generally they are stats or resists, like +10 Stamina or +10 MR... underwhelming indeed.<br />
<br />
Type 8 augs are only found on better-than-elemental gear (Plane of Time, Kod'Taz and later, and equivalent LDON raids).</div></div><hr />
