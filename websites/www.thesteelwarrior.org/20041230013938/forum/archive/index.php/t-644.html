<br />
I can't quite say how awesome a feeling it was combining my components in the scabbard to make them, but it *really* beat the hell out of my rogues epic ;P<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm not here to try and brag about it, but more to tell something to those of you who are still working on it, and may be getting discouraged. One of the biggest facters I had to deal with were other people telling me it wasn't worth the trouble, and that there are better weapons out there, and it totally bummed me out.<br />
<br />
But, damnit guys, it was worth it. And I'd like to thank all of you who contributed to the information on this board, especially Korby Ubertank, and the guide he wrote on the quest.<br />
<br />
Its great guys, get it, you won't regret it. And, like Korby said: &quot;Sure, the epic isn't a Blade of Carnage, but hot damn, it's still a sexy weapon.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I still haven't given up on my dream of finishing my epic but don't really see it in my future unless I buy the MQ of several items, which in my mind would cheapen the accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so what, theres better items out there. big deal.<br />
<br />
when you see the tank walking around with the lightsabers you know he went though the hell it took to get them. (i am not talking about the supertwink frogs who were uberguild hobbies)<br />
<br />
I only have the ancient blade, block of ore and the unjeweled hilt. I am far far away from completing this bitch of a quest but i WILL complete it. If I am wielding a BF and a BoC bt the time i do it, big deal. I'll still carry the epics around when i aint fighting.<br />
<br />
Nowadays epics are about saying I DID IT and FUCK YOU to everyone who says &quot;blah blah its not worth it&quot;<br />
<br />
Big Gratz to you and everyone else who sticks it out and finishes the quest.</div></div><hr />

If the guild is still working on epics for other classes then the warrior epic is VERY viable weapons.<br />

<br />
Uh ... you do realize that Everquest is designed to make you and your guildmates waste time, correct?<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop embellishing other warriors to take up the mantle and complete a quest of this enormity for eye candy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enormity?<br />
<br />
Everything is either tradable or MQ-able except for ONE piece. And that one piece is easy enough to get whenever your guild is off doing Cleric Epics. Your guild does value cleric epics correct? If so, then doing the queen in between multiple Overking spawns is pretty trivial.<br />
<br />
The rest of the quest is easy.<br />
<br />
Time consuming, yes.<br />
<br />
But certainly not hard or enormous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah sure, let's make the blue blade effect a right click effect when it's a worn effect. Next time just try to get a clue of what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
I used my epics for about one year, i still use the 2h in some situation (xp group in BoT works pretty good there), i never regreted the time and effort i put in my epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he meant something he could click himself with while using a more powerful weapon in its place, instead of having to wear it to benefit from the buffs. <br />
<br />
I always see warriors with the red 1hs blade ... how is the 2hs blade for taunting? What does the proc do?</div></div><hr />

DPS isn't great, but the proc rate is terrific and the taunt is just fine, for those of us who never killed the AoW or bosses in Ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive been working on my epic. when i got my first red scale i looked ahead and saw everything else that was required and never thought id be able to do it. now im down to fear ball, spiroc blade and the queen and all of which my guild are capable of doing, just a matter of trying to schedule the raids. So recently i have started to believe and feel that the end is in sight.<br />
<br />
to those that think its a waste of time, i would disagree. my guild isnt up to AoW or poi dragon at this stage and there isnt anything else comparable for aggro (and no, i dont have 300k to buy a BoC). i would not dream of doing this and taking my guild through all the raids if it was a waste of space.<br />
<br />
i am already thinking ahead to all those nice aggro combos i can wield with the red blade.<br />
<br />
sure the dps isnt great, but frankly, if red blade procs or 2hander procs and gets me my aggro, then i dont give a damn about my dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am proud of the fact that so many other people rallied around me to help. <br />
<br />
I am proud of the fact that I led all of the raids myself, and it was our first ever killing of Sev, Spiroc Lord and the Queen of Chardok.<br />
<br />
I am proud of the time I put in to complete all the steps and the fact that I never had to push anyone to do anything.<br />
<br />
In fact, I am proud of the fact that I didn't listen to people like you :)<br />
<br />
The only people that see the epics as &quot;trash&quot; are those that play this game just to get as far as possible as quickly as possible. <br />
<br />
They don't seem to realize that the anticipation of rushing the Queen of Chardok for the first time ever, or having someone send you a tell that Sev is up and your alliance is already mobilizing and they have defaulted the scale to you, or allowing the Spiroc Lord looting to be open roll to all the warriors on the raid, and having your number come up last out of 7 warriors is all part of the JOURNEY. The STORY. Your LEGACY. <br />
<br />
It's the journey that makes this game special. It's the stories that make this game worth playing. The only thing you are ever playing for is your legacy. Because sitting here in the old man's home in my rocking chair, I can tell you...It's the only thing left over when you stop playing :)<br />

Of all the epics there were 2 useless ones.  Pally, and Ours.  I didn't MQ any of my epic quest.  I did enjoy the journey to obtaining them.  As I stated, I also got wrapped up in the epicness of the blades and looked past their utterly useless stats/procs.  But not long after, when the ewww and aww of the pretty blue and red passed I found myself with weapons that just don't compare, and you don't have to go to Vex Thal or the Elemental planes to beat these blades.  Looked at Primal?  Looked at the Willsapper?  Looked at jeez, I dunno, a friggen Shadow heart?<br />
<br />
Doesn't it bother you that most classes WILL use their epics in one way or another to very close to end game?  Doesn't it bother you that the Ranger epic is A) easier to obtain, B) provides 40 percent haste and C) procs a friggen SLOW!?!?!  At level 64 I STILL use a 36 percent haste item, rely on others for slow and get ZERO utility from my &quot;epic&quot; blades.  The often touted proc on these blades sucks, it just sucks.  Fire based!?  Please.  It's constantly resisted.  <br />
<br />
Verant shafted us, accept it, destroy them (or for heavens sake stop questing towards them) and never forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Of all the epics there were 2 useless ones. Pally, and Ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
SK epic is rather useless.<br />
<br />
Necro epic is no great shakes.<br />
<br />
Earthcaller is easily replacable, and usually is replaced.<br />
<br />
Wizard epic has limited uses.<br />
<br />
Enchanter epic is rather pointless at this stage of the game.<br />
<br />
Monk epic just got gimped in PoP, due to non-stacking with SoV and with SoV/SoT giving better overall performance. Not to mention naked fists outperforming 9/16s.<br />
<br />
Mages get better pets in PoP, leaving their epic less useful.<br />
<br />
Sooooooo ... what are you left with?<br />
<br />
Cleric epic. I guess that's indespensible.<br />
<br />
And Druid epic, I have absolutely no clue about how that helps a druid. I stay away from Druids. They scare me.<br />
<br />
It really shouldn't surprise you, though, that KUNARK era weapons lose their usefulness by the Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
&quot;Looked at Primal?&quot;<br />
<br />
I look at Primal and I see it being superior to the epic, yes. It's also harder to obtain than the epic.<br />
<br />
And Warriors still get shafted in Primal. Or did you not notice the monk primal ratios?<br />
<br />
&quot;Looked at the Willsapper? Looked at jeez, I dunno, a friggen Shadow heart?&quot;<br />
<br />
YEAH ... cause PIERCING weapons are what warriors dream about.<br />
<br />
240 skill cap is oh so fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't it bother you that most classes WILL use their epics in one way or another to very close to end game?&quot;<br />
<br />
See above. Most classes lose their epics along the way, just like warriors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't it bother you that the Ranger epic is A) easier to obtain,&quot;<br />
<br />
ROTFLMAO. Shattered Emerald of Corruption is much harder to acqurie than a Green Scale.<br />
<br />
&quot;B) provides 40 percent haste&quot;<br />
<br />
The ATK boost and the haste from Swiftwind locks a ranger into a 13/21 offhander for a long, long time. Much longer than a lot of rangers would like. It's a blessing and a curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;and C) procs a friggen SLOW!?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Earthcaller procs the slow. Earthcaller is much harder to obtain, because you need the Shattered Emerald of Corruption. Earthcaller is a 14/24, JUST LIKE the warrior epic. Combined, both epic swords don't put out that great DPS. So earthcaller, for the rangers who do finally get it, is just a utility weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;At level 64 I STILL use a 36 percent haste item, rely on others for slow and get ZERO utility from my &quot;epic&quot; blades.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rangers rely on others for slow when it counts too. If you want a slow proccing weapon, Truncheon of Doom is available, after all. What kind of UTILITY are you looking for from an epic weapon?<br />
<br />
The warrior epic provides hate procs with aggro generation. It helps a warrior do his or her job. For Kunark era and Velious Era content it's just fine. Post-Velious, well Primal and Blade of Carnage are suddenly available. It shouldn't be that big a deal that you can progress beyond your epics by Luclin.<br />
<br />
&quot; The often touted proc on these blades sucks, it just sucks. Fire based!? Please. It's constantly resisted. &quot;<br />
<br />
Resists still generate aggro.<br />
<br />
Compared to the other stuff that's available PRE-Enraging Blow, the warrior epics are just fine for what they are.<br />
<br />
There's no need to defend them. You just seem to expect way too much from them.<br />
<br />
So you outgrew your epics? Big deal. So has everyone else at that stage of the game you're playing at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vyle</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thank you CSR Wubao.  Your right, I should thank the gods of Everquest for allowing me to have glowing blue and red blades.  Oh hey, you got a little something on your mouth there.. lemme wipe that off for ya.  Why are your knees so dirty?  I digress..<br />
<br />
Your assessment of the other class epics is complete, and utter BS.  Any warrior that thinks other epics (besides Pally) are just as worthless as ours needs to set down the crack pipe and look into them.<br />
<br />
Primal _IS_ much easier to obtain than our &quot;epic&quot; weapon.  Zlandicar, yeah thats a tough fight.  MoTG, Prog?  Please.<br />
<br />
Piercing skill gripe.. Another thread please, a few skill points don't mean jack diddly crap and you damn know it.  A slow proc (sapper) is, say it with me: 'useful' and holy crap its actually a great taunt, and OMG it is rarely resisted! <br />
<br />
Your breakdown of the Ranger epic is ludicrous as well.  How difficult is their 40 percent portion?  Sweet.  Last I checked CoF (36 percent) still goes for about 60K.  I still see 60+ warriors with friggen FBSS and those stupid ~20 percent haste gloves.  I don't know about your situation but from my experience most guilds don't doll out the 41 percent haste items to Warriors.  They go to the top 2 or 3 warriors and then EVERYONE else comes first because tertiary warrior DPS is a joke.<br />
<br />
So again, wipe off your knees, clean your face up and try to see the real world.</div></div><hr />

Lot's of people in smallish guilds can kill in Chardok a hell of a lot easier than they can get primal or better.  Also, lots of said warriors in smallish guilds are still using their epics in PoP.<br />

<br />
You sound like you don't play everquest.<br />
<br />
If you did, you'd know a lot more about the epic quests, what's involved for the other classes, and how useless their epics really are at level 65.<br />
<br />
Even a cursory glance at everything you've written on this thread shows either 1) You ebayed your high level warrior or 2) You're just pissed off that you did a quest to get a weapon that's outdated 3 years later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Primal _IS_ much easier to obtain than our &quot;epic&quot; weapon. Zlandicar, yeah thats a tough fight. MoTG, Prog? Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warrior epic is MUCH easier to obtain than killing Zlandicar.<br />
<br />
I got one on my ALT.<br />
<br />
The warrior epic was easier to get than my MONK'S.<br />
<br />
Just because it was hard for YOU doesn't mean it was hard for everyone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Piercing skill gripe.. Another thread please, a few skill points don't mean jack diddly crap and you damn know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
It means a reduction in DPS. Pure and simple mathematics there. It's an inferior weapon skill, and eventually 13/20 becomes an inferior ratio.<br />
<br />
&quot; A slow proc (sapper) is, say it with me: 'useful' and holy crap its actually a great taunt, and OMG it is rarely resisted! &quot;<br />
<br />
A slow proc is useless. It gets overwritten. It gets resisted. It's on a piercing weapon that you don't connect with as much as a slasher. And it draws just as much aggro or less than the red blade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your breakdown of the Ranger epic is ludicrous as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Have you done the quest? Because your grasp of the ranger epic, the RARITY of the drops involved, and exactly how difficult parts of the quest are is seriously lacking.<br />
<br />
&quot; How difficult is their 40 percent portion? Sweet. Last I checked CoF (36 percent) still goes for about 60K.&quot;<br />
<br />
Last I checked, warriors post 60 like to use weapons BETTER than 13/21 in their offhand. If the blue epic gave 40 percent haste, warriors would be stuck with it. You know, the crappy weapon you hate so much? You'd hate it even more.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked 36 percent haste item MAXES YOU OUT HASTEWISE with full raid buffs.<br />
<br />
There's not much of a difference between 36 and 40 percent haste at this point in the game.<br />
<br />
Except feeling better about yourself, I guess.<br />
<br />
Which is what seems to be your biggest problem.<br />
<br />
So much anger and disappointment locked into ONE warrior quest, for three swords.<br />
<br />
It's kind of funny really. The quest is EASY. Time consuming, but easy. It's much easier to acquire a warrior epic than it is anything you've mentioned. It takes a little bit of time and some effort. When your guild is at that stage of the game, it's even easier since most of the drops come in zones where EVERY OTHER EPIC HAS DROPS.<br />
<br />
Fear ... Hate ... Sky ... Chardok ... red dragon scales. So many epics are involved in those zones or those monsters.<br />
<br />
So you're stuck trying to get a green dragon scale.<br />
<br />
Whoop de freakin dooo. Sev is 100 times easier to drop than Zlandicar or Vaniki.</div></div><hr />

So afraid that someone will shine the light of truth upon it.  So afraid to face, once again, the shaft of Verant plunging deep into the Warrior glory hole.<br />
<br />
Don't you people get it!?  Im saying that I was one of you Epic fanatics.  It cost me valuable levelling time, ass favors to guildies and most importantly face.  You have to take this whole &quot;epic&quot; nonsense out of the equation and look at the resulting items!<br />
<br />
Don't be like me.  Don't waste your time and the time of others.  Time is valueable in this game.  Level, help your guild do meaningful encounters with meaningful rewards!<br />
<br />
Sure, if your a pampered baby like Superchump (look at the magelo of his pet warrior twink) then by all means by your epic with Multi-quests.  Shit its just plat then, by all means blow it out your ass, stimulate the economy.  But if you are one of the guys, like me, who busts his ass for every drop of gear you get and god-damn fucking earns it, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THESE BLADES!<br />
<br />
How dare you bluebie bastards accuse me of ebaying, I have 103 days played on the most difficult race of warrior on the most difficult of servers.  I earned my fucking epics!  Blood, sweat and tears went into those hunks of shit that I cannot even bring myself to destroy.  The viciousness of this thread, this very thread proves my point.  You all create this hysteria and hype surrounding these weapons.  You should all be ashamed of yourselves.</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised you're not taking part in some red server hazing event, like a Jihad, between your posts here. It's probably past your bed time though eh? School lets out soon though, so I s'pose you can makeup for all that lost VALUABLE levelling time you wasted.<br />
<br />
And btw ... how much &quot;work&quot; is EQ to you? You busted your ass with blood? Doubtful. Sweat? Then turn on the AC. Tears? Stop crying it's just a video game.<br />
<br />
And your bits of time, and scraps of pixels are no MORE valuable than the time and pixels I've spent gaining platinum.<br />

But comfort yourself all you want if you think you're more valuable than my twink. It's all part of your immaturity.</div></div><hr />

My guild isnt an uber one who goes around killing AOW and SSr basement so the Epic is my best weapon.  I still use it to this day.  I prefer the 2h version.  It gives me great agro, less riposte, and decent DPS.</div></div><hr />

Vyle, you're just mad because the warrior epic won't kill another player in 1-5 swings. Hey guess what, its meant to be used on MOBs NOT Players! 500pt hate generation is god damned powerful pre-taunting blow/enraging blow. Added in with any combo of wavecrasher, frostbringer, hell even a nuking proc and you can hold agro god damned well. But you say your epics are shit, so Im wrong. Please to be getting your head out of your ass and actually paying attention for a change.<br />
<br />
Wubao's synopsis is dead on about all the other char's epics. Hell even ROGUES hate their epic after a certain point. Why? 15/25 in the primary hand JUST like Rangers' Swiftwind in secondary. Sure you'll backstab for 500 (Pre-chaotic) but your overall dps is shit when compared to that rogue using the 15/20 acid poker.<br />
<br />
So I say again, please to be getting your head out of your ass, wipe the crap from your eyes and pay attention. What they are saying is absolutely correct. You're just to freakin hard headed to see it.<br />
<br />
Now to remain on topic of the original poster, very big congrats Treise!<br />
<br />
Edit: I gotta learn how to spell :D</div></div><hr />

The only thing that sucks in this thread is your attitude, level of maturity, inability to relate to others, your social skills, lack of understanding of others' viewpoints, your language, your imagery and your standing in this community.<br />
<br />
Did I miss anything?</div></div><hr />
