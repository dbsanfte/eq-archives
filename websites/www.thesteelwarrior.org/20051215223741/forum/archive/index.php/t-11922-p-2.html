Joined up shortly as a group and reset the timer.  Joined again with 3 people and the wait reset of course with about an hour and a half wait.  Waited 3+ hours before the third person in group gave up and logged off, then waited 2 more hours with just two of us and still no dice.  So after it said I had 5 hours in the queue with an estimated wait time of ~2.5 hours, we gave up.  Logged on a few hours later, tried again with a 1.5 hour estimated wait time and got in at the 2 hour mark.  Maybe we'll start to see a population shift with people ambitious enough to start over.  Not like it takes *that* long to get to 60 with some decent gear....then just do your gearing up from honor kills $$</div></div><hr />
