Please post your ideas on AEs and comment on the ones already posted.<br />
<br />
My current ideas are...<br />
<br />
Toxic Fumes<br />
---------------<br />
Resist: PR -50<br />
Duration: 3 ticks in shortbuff window.<br />
Effect: consume 1 short bear per tick.<br />
(This will make use of the alcohol tolerance skill. alcohol tolerance increasing items could even be implemented for these mobs and dorfs might even get an innate bonus to this skill :D)<br />
<br />
Shortsighted<br />
----------------<br />
Resist: MR<br />
Duration: 3 ticks in shortbuff window.<br />
Effect: all ranged skills over 100 is lowered to 100<br />
(Thos means casters and rangers need to get closer to a mob to be able to cast spells and shoot arrows at it)<br />
<br />
Egoism<br />
---------<br />
Resist: MR -100<br />
Duration: 10 ticks<br />
Effect: Target yourself each tick.<br />
(This means all need to be aware of their target, especially healers that might heal themself and nukers that might nuke themself)<br />
<br />
Cursed<br />
---------<br />
Resist: MR -75<br />
Duration: 10 ticks<br />
Effect: Imbue curse proc on target, which procs AE cancel magic with a range of 50.<br />
(This means especially melees have to be aware of the procs. You can continue fighting, but you might dispell yourself and others around you, and thereby actually do more damage to your raid than to the mob. This effect should be somewhat easy to dispell, but somewhat hard to resist)<br />
<br />
These AEs can of course be mixed abit and beefed up with DD and DoT damage. :)</div></div><hr />
