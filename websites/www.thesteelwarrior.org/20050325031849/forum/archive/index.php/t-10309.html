<br />
 i myself run 2ghz athlon, i used to lag for up to 5 minutes in AH just turning near the bank / AH.<br />
<br />
<br />
With this Tweak i no longer lag in IF,  Altho i do get NETWORK lag from IF still =P just too many damn ppl!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, here's a copy and paste of  the tweak from my guild forums.  It works 100% true.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
I came across this forum post explaining how this simple program allows you to change some settings to make it run smoother.. While i dont completely understand what it does, it HAS made my WoW run alot Smoother in cities even, and other games..<br />
<br />
here's a paste of the forum post.<br />

!!!PLEASE READ!!!<br />
<br />
go to the link for the tool and click i agree, extract all files to a folder on your desktop, open the tool, on the very bottom it will say VGA compatible controller and then say your video card next to it.Under latency it will read 256 (most read 256, some read lower, either way this works for all) you want to change this number to 64(right click and go to quickset latency) , for the most part this tweak<br />
makes it so that the agp bus does not hog all the cpu, which in turn will result in a smoother gameplay by freeing up the cpu resources to run the program/read the HD etc. (from my understanding atleast) you will not get higher benchmarks or lower benchmarks i have already tested this myself and so have many other gamers. Some of you may already have the value to 32 or maybe 128, however 64 seems to be the sweet spot so i suggest changing it to this value. Once you are done go to settings&gt;apply and then settings&gt;save<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand there is a bug relating to ATI cards where the value may not stick when you reboot. If you have this problem please make sure you have saved the settings, if it still does not work let me know, there is an alternative program out that does the same thing. I have not tested it yet so i will not post it. GOOD LUCK!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how this would work. From my experiences on playing 3 vastly different computers, most of the graphical &quot;lag&quot; comes from the game trying to frantically load everything it needs into RAM. You turn and you need to see something else, so the game tries to load it. You only have so much RAM, and eventually the game needs to start using virtual RAM, which is just a file on your hard drive. HD Access is significantly slower than RAM access, and when you start using that, your frames go down the toilet until the game and windows agree on some middleground where everything WoW needs is immediately accessible in RAM, and the stuff that can wait or doesn't need to be changed that often sits in your virtual RAM.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it yet, so it just *might* do something, but every &quot;miracle&quot; tweak i've ever seen has never worked, and only people who don't seem to know much about computers, or have no real way to parse differences in performance seem to claim they work at all. Maybe theres somebody out there with a boatload of RAM and a slow processor that this tweak might work for, but I doubt even that.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed that playing with 512 vs 768 RAM is markedly different, especially around the AH, even though the chip speed on the two comps were roughly the same.</div></div><hr />

I recently upgraded to 1.5 Ghz memory....and zero lag, anywhere.  Even in mass PvP.  Gotta love that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the first thing you want to do if you want WoW to run better is to get more RAM. WoW eats RAM like nothing else, and that little amount can make a HUGE difference. I'm planning on getting another 512mb stick this weekend after playing on my roomate's computer, which is basically the same except for RAM difference.</div></div><hr />
