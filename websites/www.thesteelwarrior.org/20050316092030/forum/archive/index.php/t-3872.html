<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to help a guildy get his scabbard and subsequently his epic, so I decided to MQ my note to Kargek to him for the scabbard. He had the Spiroc Wingblade and since thats MQable I assumed it worked vice versa. (BTW I am not really interested in epic anymore, it would be fun to complete but basically would end up bagged...) We did the proper steps and he got nothing. <br />
<br />
Since its always done the other way around Im not sure if anyone really cares, so its just a heads up and to let anyone know who might be interested in doing something like this.</div></div><hr />

Only possiblity for error in the one I tried to do was the person whom I was doing it for had not previously spoken to the quest giver. I had assumed he at least hailed him for the quest for the scabbard when he began the epic quest. Havn't asked him about this yet but its possible the MQ would not of worked because of that.</div></div><hr />
