<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:32 2004] You say, 'Hail, Trelak'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:32 2004] Trelak says 'Greetings stranger. What can I, Trelak do for you? Surely you are the strangers that I have heard whispers about . . . the ones that have struck back against our enemies? Perhaps we can aid each other? I am an armor smith that has crafted many fine pieces for the more prestigious officers in the dragorn militia. Many of these pieces have unique magical qualities that I crafted into them. If you are [willing] to recover them, I can recapture most of this magic and create new pieces for you.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:42 2004] You say, 'willing'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:42 2004] Trelak says 'Good, very good. When The Darkening came upon us, I could see by the ferocity and viciousness of the invaders that they would not be easy to defeat. So I took as much as I could and hid out here preparing for the time when our warriors would have need of me. If you help me, I will craft superior pieces of plate armor fit for our mightiest fighters for you. I can provide a [helm], [sleeves], [bracers], a pair of [gloves], a [breastplate], some [leggings], and a pair of [boots].'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:49 2004] You say, 'helm'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:49 2004] Trelak says 'Before I can make you a plate helm worthy of Makyah himself, I will need you to bring me some food. I was so busy with taking all of my tools that I did not have time to stock myself with enough sustenance to see me through this ordeal. From time to time I have seen kvy archers eating from a small food sack. I think if you bring me two of these sacks I can continue my work for quite awhile. Your main task though will be to bring me a certain piece of metal I have long had my eye on. There was a certain dragorn elder by the named of Patorav, a wiser and kinder noble did not exist. Wherever he went, he always carried with him a fine [walking stick].'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:51 2004] You say, 'walking stick'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:51 2004] Trelak says 'This was no ordinary walking stick. The top held a jewel of some mystery for I would always see Patorav whispering to it, but I am more interested in the bottom tip, for it you see was sheathed in a strange metal. I witnessed Patorav striking the ground with the tip only to see it penetrate any surface it encountered. The hardest stone, the most durable metal, nothing could withstand his walking stick. Thus, I have always held an interest in it as the enchantments contained therein may prove to be beneficial to my craft. Though Patorav fell during the noble's march through the causeway, his stick may yet exist. Find it and bring it back with the food and I'll reward you.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:54 2004] You say, 'sleeves'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:54 2004] Trelak says 'Though I managed to bring nearly all of my tools before the Muramites overran our lands, I did forget to bring the enchanted tongs my mentor gave me. I secretly returned only to watch the Muramites destroy my shop and steal what was left. I saw the leader of this pack of dark thieves place my tongs in an embossed leather sack . . . Which was probably stolen as well. I want you to bring me this sack so I may retrieve my tongs and perhaps other possessions he stole from me. I also want you to repay those brutes for wrecking my shop and home. Bring me back two noc right hands so I know they will no longer steal from me or my people ever again.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:59 2004] You say, 'gloves'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:00 2004] Trelak says 'One of my people's most famous warriors was Makyah the Fierce, who had no equal when it came to the battle arts. Enemies would routinely pause momentarily when he strode upon the field. After the portal exploded though, no trace of Makyah was found. I am more interested in his axe though, which may yet hold salvation for my people. It is my hope that the enchantments and techniques used to create the axe might be used for other purposes. Find and return Makyah's axe to me so I may use it to help my people. To remove the enchantments properly though, I will also need two yearning crystals. With the proper ceremony, gems such as these can be used to transfer charms from one object to another. Come back when you have recovered these and I will give you a pair of gloves that I was crafting in honor of a dragorn elder.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:04 2004] You say, 'leggings'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:04 2004] Trelak says 'When I tried to go back to my shop to retrieve my tongs, I found it overrun with a mob of thieving Muramites. At that moment I, a mere smith, vowed revenge for destroying what it took me a lifetime to build. I did not know how or when I would accomplish this until I crossed paths with you. You will be my instrument, exacting the revenge I cannot achieve on my own. Find the leader of this particular group of Muramites and repay it ten fold. Return to me with the medal it smugly wore -- a medal it no doubt stole from some other hapless dragorn. You also must bring me three blackened discordling tails as proof that the rest of this group has been slain as well. Do this and I will give you a pair of plate leggings that I have been working on for some time now.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:34:16 2004] You say, 'breastplate'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:34:16 2004] Trelak says 'Many good friends and loved ones perished in the invasion. One of my good friends was a famous hunter, Jayruk. He and I went on many hunting expeditions together protecting our lands from some of the more wild and dangerous beasts. I was not skilled enough to take care of a bazu mind you, but at least I could remove the threat of a few murkgliders. Jayruk, however, had no equal. I could regale you for hours of tales of how he narrowly escaped death, but I shan't waste time. Simply know that I wish to pay my respects to my good friend and for this I require the hunting vest he so loved. I will also need three dragorn ceremonial candles too. Return to me with the vest and the three candles and I will give you a plate breastplate that I was crafting for myself. '<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:15 2004] You say, 'boots'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:15 2004] Trelak says 'As much of my customers were dragorn warriors, over time I came to befriend many of them. Though most of them perished during the fighting, some were captured by the Muramites and tormented in their Proving Grounds. This was once a serene place where our elders would meditate . . . A place of peace and tranquility that my people looked toward Dranik's spirit for guidance. Now it is a place inhabited by the foulest horrors where resistant dragorns are tortured. One such dragorn was a noble warrior named Ethask. Thrown into the labyrinth unarmed, he fought off a horde of discordlings and kyvs, breaking their bodies with his bare hands. Seriously wounded, he still managed to find an exit through sheer force of will. Just as he was about to exit that black pit, a soaring [Muramite] cowardly struck him down from behind. Mortally wounded with the axe still lodged between his shoulders, Ethask crawled through the exit only to perish on the other side.'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:58 2004] You say, 'muramite'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:59 2004] Trelak says 'I know little of this particular Muramite save that he received a medal for his dastardly deeds. Find and slay this Muramite so the spirit of Ethask may find the peace it longs for. Return once you have done this with the Muramite Cruelty Medal as proof that this monster shall trouble my people no more. Also bring me two kyv hunter rings to celebrate Ethask's victories.'<br />

<br />
There are a few NPCs in Dranik too. Maybe there are lesser quality quested armor, being the one already mentioned the best.<br />
<br />
I hope they did like Velious and have different difficulty quests, I really wouldnt mind doing them if they are attainable by my family guild or casual group of friends, even if its the lowest of all the quests.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that is the bard finished result.<br />
Really curious about these set armors now :p</div></div><hr />

According to alla's, Velitorkin drops Dragorn Elder Sceptre http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31691 .<br />
<br />
Maybe this is the 'walking stick'.</div></div><hr />

I hardly hunt in any zone besides mpg, and not every mob in there gives the correct faction, so it is slow going.<br />

Anyone know the bracer text from the npc?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chain, Leather, and Silk all require mostly the same parts and they appear to be way easier to obtain then the ones in the quests on this thread.  For intsance, none would require anything more than a group - and certainly not a level 85 raid mob.   Only plate has not yet found their quest guy for the tier 1 armors it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chain has found their NPC for this (the higher level) quest. <br />
<br />
Would be great if someone would get the bracer text for this, and find our &quot;lesser&quot; quest NPC.<br />
<br />
The easier quests also require just Warmly faction, and the harder quests require Ally.</div></div><hr />

He doesn't respond to me about the quests, but he IS the guy for Tier 1 Plate based armor, he wants the same RARE no drop items as the other Tier 1 armor quests....</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:43 2004] You say, 'Hail, Vorkiev'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:43 2004] Vorkiev says ''Hello, Kurim.   I am Vorkiev, a former smith of Dranik.  Word of your battles against the Muramites has passed from ear to ear across Kuua.  You bring hope to the dragorn who long to be free from the shadow of Mata Muram!  Perhaps we can be of [service] to one another?' '<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:46 2004] You say, 'service'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:46 2004] Vorkiev says ''A decade ago my forge created great suits of armor to protect Kuua's strongest warriors.   When the Muramites came, however, they sought to conscript me to make armor for their captains.  Rather than comply, I fled into the wilderness to live as an exile.  I have no regrets about my decision, but I do long for the old days, back when the land was green and the dragorn stood side by side against their enemies, instead of kowtowing to these forsaken Muramites.  There many tasks I need accomplished that I am unable to see through myself due to my exile.  If you can help me, I can reward you with finely crafted plate armor for your [hands], [wrists], [arms], [head], [chest], [legs], or [feet].  What say you?''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:12 2004] You say, 'hands'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:12 2004] Vorkiev says ''I appreciate your enthusiasm.  Be careful though, this will not be easy for I require a rare item that is entrusted only to the Muramite captains.  Harbinger's Spire was once a dragorn lookout tower which Mata Muram has since claimed and bent to his own purposes.  He uses the spire as a beacon to receive news on his domain.  Some of his captains possess infused crystal shards which can be used to send messages from Harbinger's Spire.  If you can capture one of these infused spire control shards along with the satchels of two discordling messengers, it may disrupt the Muramite chain of command long enough to afford me a chance to return home for a day.  I have not seen many of my kin since The Darkening fell upon Kuua and I long to know if any of them are still alive.  Recover these items for me and you shall be rewarded with my finest plate gauntlets.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:53 2004] You say, 'wrists'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:53 2004] Vorkiev says ''Did you know that dragorns were created by the death of a single dragon named Dranik, the great father?  The first dragorn to walk Kuua created many things in his honor.  Among these creations was a fearsome battle standard painted with a drop of blood from each of Dranik's firstborn sons.  The last dragorn armies to carry the banner fell to the Muramites.  No one can say where the Blood Standard of Dranik has gone, but the recovery of such an artifact would leave me in your debt.  Return with this banner along with two Ashlock branches, so I can remake the haft.  From there, I can reward you with a powerfully crafted wristguard.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:03 2004] It begins to rain.<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:32 2004] You say, 'arms'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:33 2004] Vorkiev says ''The armies of Mata Muram are but one aspect of Discord's deep shadow.  The Darkening ravaged not only the denizens of Kuua, but the landscape as well.  Many of our old landmarks no longer stand and the sky -- once blue and vast -- now seethes with ash and storms.  If you can find a map of Old Kuua, one drawn before the coming of Discord, I will be in your debt.  Return with this map along with two ukun quills so I can take notes on the map.  My exile is long and there is no end in sight.  I would like to reorient myself out here in the wilderness.  Do this for me and I can reward you with some of my finely crafted arm guards.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:11 2004] You say, 'head'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:12 2004] Vorkiev says ''When Discord first impinged upon our world, sentiments of treachery and paranoia crept into our lives.  Dragorn turned on dragorn and longstanding friendships ended in bitter squabbling.  One dragorn, Noble Yemall the Arcane, kept his wits enough to realize what was happening.  Yemall toiled tirelessly to counter the effects of Discord.  Although his efforts were ultimately in vain, it is said that he was able to author a treatise before the Muramites seized him.  This treatise, entitled The Duskfall Chronicles, contains his reflections on the nature of Discord and was likely seized by the Muramites.  Retrieve this treatise along with two bristling ukun hides to use as book covers so I can bind the book and protect it from the elements.  Hopefully the knowledge in this book will help me to survive in Kuua on my own, now that Discord is seeping further and further across our world.  Do this for me and my best plate helm shall be your reward.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:14 2004] You say, 'chest'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:15 2004] Vorkiev says ''The chest piece is the most-prized piece of my collection.  For this I will require a special favor from you.  Before the Muramites came, the High Council of Eight ruled over Dranik.  The eight nobles, lead by Jelvan the Eldest, each carried scepters that were said to be carved from the bones of the first dragorn sons.  It is said that these scepters will glow as long as their owner is alive.  I have not seen or heard from the council since the Muramites overran our city, but I have heard that these scepters were handed out by Mata Muram as trophies.  If you can recover one of these scepters along with three shorn murkglider tentacles to disguise it from the searching Muramites, I can keep it with me.  Its soft glow will remind me that there is still hope for Dranik.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:17 2004] You say, 'legs'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:17 2004] Vorkiev says ''Kuua was not the first world touched by Discord.  There have been many others.  I know this because I have heard the Muramites tell stories of past conquests.  One of the stories they tell is that the last ember of a Discord-ravaged city will burn for many years, long after the ruins of the city itself have been covered over by time.  Some say it's the city's spirit slowly dying.  Others claim it to be a side effect of the Discord's lingering magic.  Regardless, these embers are highly valued by the legions of Discord, for Mata Muram rewards them to his fiercest captains as war trophies.  If you can bring me one of these embers along with three Dranik incense burners to hold it in, I will reward you with my finest set of plate grieves.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:20 2004] You say, 'feet'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:20 2004] Vorkiev says ''When Discord first descended upon Kuua, many of my own kin turned traitor.  Most dragorn who marched against Dranik were already in exile and seeking vengeance for their punishment, but a handful were established dragorn who conspired against us from within.  These established dragorn did the most damage to our defense efforts as they worked against us without our knowledge.  There is talk of a traitors' stone which is etched with the names of all dragorn who conspired with the Muramites in those dire days.  The Muramite captains carried these stones and used them to determine which dragorn to slay outright and which to spare with a life of slavery.  If you can bring me one of these Kuuan traitors' stones, along with two kyv bowstrings so that I can hang this rock of traitors for all to see.  Although the dragorn have been occupied for the better part of a decade now, this may still cause stir up trouble for the Muramites.  Do this for me and I can grant you my plate boots as a reward.''</div></div><hr />

Hello, tier 2 bracer reward.....  that is officially quite nice compared to vadds bracer, worthwhile upgrade imo, doesn't blow away all other tank bracers though.. time will tell how common the anguish quest pieces are for completion, too early to see if this is on par or weak for its rarity... looks bout right in line for raex-&gt;vadd-&gt;gladiators progression though.... 1 trial away from anguish flagged =)</div></div><hr />

Most of the NO DROP pieces for these are pretty doable from the named in WoS or RCoD.  I have the arms piece.  For now, at least, getting the trash drops seems a bit harder just because most folks probably sell them as vendor fodder. <br />

The first dragorn to walk Kuua created many things in his honor. Among these creations was a fearsome battle standard painted with a drop of blood from each of Dranik's firstborn sons. The last dragorn armies to carry the banner fell to the Muramites. No one can say where the Blood Standard of Dranik has gone, but the recovery of such an artifact would leave me in your debt. Return with this banner along with two Ashlock branches, so I can remake the haft. From there, I can reward you with a powerfully crafted wristguard.'' <br />

Well, I was gonna ask a Tiopat question but since the event is broken atm I guess no one really knows how hard he is since there's a decent chance he's been changed since last time he was killable.<br />

Ahh one question, does anyone know if mobs in certain zones give more faction than others.  I've spent a little time killing greenies in DS for faction, but several people have told me (in game) that they give next to no faction and that it's a waste of time.  Since I do more research than 99% of people I know/talk to in game, I was gonna ask here since the chance of some random person in game knowing more about this than me is very small,  but I'm sure someone here knows what the deal is.</div></div><hr />

Now I've been grinding green cons in Dranik's Scar for a few hours a couple of days and I'm up to Indifferently. Most of the Quest NPCs in Dranik's still won't talk to me at Indifferently, a few will, but they are just the ones giving out the minor faction increasing quests I suppose.<br />
<br />
I've yet to partake in killing any of the 'raid' targets in OoW, so I don't know if they grant faction hits, but I'd guess they did. Epic quest mobs don't seem to give hits, at least I haven't noticed any faction hits when killing epic mobs in OoW.<br />
<br />
Been wondering if I should try killing mobs in Causeway instead, but since they are mostly all dark blue cons at lvl 70, I'd probably have a lot lower kill rate or might not even be able to kill a single one on my own, heh.<br />

Basically I think I'm going to stick with grinding the green con Ukun, Noc and Kyv in Dranik's and then hope to find out if raid targets yield a faction hit when they are killed.</div></div><hr />

Elemental bard+cleric could clear all the kyvs and the two towers on the hill to bloodfields prior to repop, I'm sure a war/enc/druid group could ae them np.<br />

Given i've gotten something like 9 augs and 4 slugworms aeing them up to warmly might give others some incentive to help you out.<br />

And don't get confused between the factions - you start off maxed to riftseekers and children of dranik the second to step into oow for the first time - this is totally unrelated to the Dranik Loyalist faction, which is the one that matters.<br />

Was ally within a week of oow release.  Speculate the reason for that is that named or certain trash give bigger hits.  Have been named farming a lot.  <br />

The kyv bowstrings have been the hardest item so far.  Only approx 8 kyvs spawn in all of nobles and it's a rare drop.  Finally just ended up camping more named and trading a rune for 3 bowstrings.  Unfortunately the gauntlets aren't as good as the other pieces when upgrading.  The huge plus to all these pieces is AC.  My hp haven't changed much but 50 AC diff from the last 2 pieces is nice.

It takes a while to aquire faction,  I did mine in mpg and it was roughly 100-110 aa's worth so around 2,000 kills.  Some gave no faction so this number is only a ballpark figure and prob is a bit high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First quest npc I conned was scowling. I don't think any mob gives neg loyalist. Dragorn models give + overlord - Children, Everything else gives - overlord + rift + cod + loyalist. Though I think I killed some murkgliders that gave nothing. Nocs, Kyv, Ukun, Golems, Snakes ( IE god mobs) all gave plus loyalist. <br />
<br />
Kyv hearts can be turned in for faction hits but it's almost not worth the effort. I was amiable, spent several hours killing, mostly + loyalist mobs, still amiable, turned in 4 hearts, still amiable. I think they only give the same faction as killing a mob and are rare as hell. <br />
<br />
Amiable does seem to be longer with these mobs then with other factions. Many guildys were in amiable hell for about a week with pretty consistant killing. I personally went from dubious to amiable in 2 days, maybe 16 hours total killing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally found the right forum i guess lol.  Been reading through this, see a few of you are looking for info on faction/drop rates, vigdis (been reading your poetry btw, i like it), ratfink,frostpaw etc.  Anyway, when oow first came out, i looted any no drop stuff i could find.  figured it was for quests, just didnt know for what, and i spent a lot of time in WoS cause that seemed to be where all the new armor drops were.  Anyway, by the time i found out about this oow armor, i realized i had almost all the ND stuff.  However, that seems to be the easy part of this clusterfuck of a quest.  The tradable stuff is godawfully hard to find.  The way i found all mine was by making /auc and /2 (bazaar for me) hot keys stating that i was buying those pieces, and just spammed em every 5 mins or so when i was on and they turned up eventually.  thats the best advice i can give.  As far as dropping, RCoD, especially the zone in area near the historian, seems to be the best spot.  WoS rare hill or cubby to a lesser extent.  I have yet to see any piece from the bowlord rorn camp in RCoD, nor have i seen any pieces drop in MPG.  Heard rumors as well that NC is good for picking up the hard to find bowstrings, but i cannot verify this.  Honestly though, best way to get the pieces is through the bazaar.  people seem reluctant to sell the piece for 1cp to merchants, so they put em up for &lt; 1k in baz and they just rot there, as these quests STILL are little known.  Snap em off through baz, or through other players works best.<br />
<br />
Now, the other hard part of this shit, the faction.  omg its awful.  My advice is do NOT waste money buying glider fluid of kyv hearts for the hand ins, they are slackass faction, very tiny hits.  If you pick up the pieces along the way, great,  turn em in, but save yer bling.  Rampshaking D-scar is also pretty slow faction, as the mobs dont give big hits, granted you are killing a lot at once.  Best places i have found are RCoD at bowlord rorn camp in the NW tunnels, MPG at the BHR/TF camp, and to a lesser extent WoS rare hill (north of the wall) and the firepits instanced.  I'm sure NC is decent faction as well, and theres an assload of GoD mobs that give the + loaylists, so im sure its $$ faction if you and a few of you rampshaking buds vaporized that place a few times, but again, i havent done it.<br />
<br />
ANYWAY . . . good luck, just focus on the goal if you need that extra kick in the ass to keep grinding.  Its worth the push if you arent a raider like myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just did 7 faction quest turn ins (6 stolen insignia's and 1 feran skull).  I moved from dubious to ...  dubious.  And I've been dubious for a few grinds.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the feran skull turn in mob has KOS dragorn around him, so you'd need help to clear him out or risk death (they love to snare you).<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />

Why the heck do they even put these quests in when they are borderline useless?  The drops for them are as rare as the armor drops from what I've heard, and they evidently give crap for faction adjustment and no cash, no other reward - just faction.<br />

Standard is becoming a headache though.  been sitting at rare hill in WoS . . . watching people get xp . .  for hours . . . waiting . . nothing . . . argh!  Need that second bracer too, oh well.  So, new info:  Ashlock much much more common at the RCoD entrance area, this confirmed.  Near ungi as vigdis said in a dif thread.  Factionwise, I wondering if rares are a bigger hit than reg mobs.  If so, WoS MIGHT yield better faction, or very similar faction to RC stuff.  Dunno how to gauge such a slow faction though, hard to tell if no visible change for days of work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The faction part of this quest is starting to annoy me.  Within a day or two of OOW coming out I was level 66 + 10% and about 90 AAs (not too sure about number).  I am now sitting at level 69+ 40%, and have 120AAs.  I would say about 99% at least of that XP was earned in OOW.  Do not think I killed many, if any mobs that gave negative loyalist faction, but did do some time in camps with nuetral faction.  Over the last few weeks since I became aware of the armor quests, I have pushed hard to mostly do camps with positive faction and I am still at dubious.<br />
<br />
I also have made a point of siting in Dranik Scar cherry picking green mobs that give me good faction when between groups and have soloed hundreds of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this rate, my children will have grown up and I will be playing EQ3 before my faction is up.  Time consuming is one thing, but pusing completion out past my lifetime is crazy.   I have to assume that I am missing something, or that some camps must provide a bigger faction hit.<br />
<br />
Some people in game have advised me to go to MPG as they got good faction there quickly, but I am not at the magical 10k mark to tank there yet and cannot  group there yet.   Yes this is nice armor, but the tier one armor is not that overpowering.  I have a lot of ornate armor and the Rallos Zek helmet so the improvement is no that much (none on helmet). <br />
<br />
Is there a camp or zone pre MPG that seems to give a big faction imrovement?  On the positive side, it is not as if I am sacrificing time to improve faction, I would be in OOW anyways.   Some of the older faction quests involved a mind numbing amount of time kiling mob that neither gave good xp or loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if you're not actively choosing spots with lots of hits, yes it is going to suck.  Firepit has good density, and the RCoD instances seem possibly even better than PG (faster killls, higher mob density).  WoS is absolutely terrible for faction (the best camp has what, 6 factioned mobs?).<br />
<br />
I've yet to see any indication that higher lvl mobs provide a bigger hit than the greens in DS, and that's with two warmly+ chars (one got faction mainly from ae'ing DS, the other from pg/instances).   Most ppl got their faction in pg because they're the type of ppl that can sit down for a few hours at a time and just grind it out, and it comes naturally.  If you kill in wos/dranik camps where there aren't a lot of faction mobs, no, your faction won't move at all.</div></div><hr />

i mean,  the people who should be excited about these quests havnt been to the EP's yet, so can't we just be happy we're getting upgraded in the right direction without the uber elitism that being in an uber guild comes with? rejoice casual players, it may take ya a month to grind faction and collect bits, but thats hella better than starting/joining a guild, breaking into any of the said zones, and spending the time to farm up stuff.</div></div><hr />

1.5sec casting time, 5min recast, and lasts 2 ticks? Skill Damage Taken(-15).<br />

It used to take a raid to farm thurg armor in kael arena. it used to take a raid to kill for ornate bps (for my guild it still does) and some people with decent kits (not amazing stuff, not even entirely ep/vt geared people) have even one grouped the bp mob. It's quite doable, if you have a few groups of friends to help you. fact is theres not much you can do without a few friends in EQ, not as a warrior, anyway.</div></div><hr />

This is just simply untrue. It may have taken a guild effort of low 50s to take out arena mobs, but a single group of level 60s could do it. I personally got a Champion's BP during velious with one group of 60s. Additionally, with a shaman, you could do HoT with one group. I never did it during velious, but mid luclin (without any luclin raid gear so it may as well have been Velious with some aa) I farmed HoT and equipped up a group full of ToV armor.<br />
<br />
Same goes for PoP, although I do admit it was thanks to overpowered pets who were nerfed mid expansion, but I got my BP with a single group using charmed pets. Also, the wing bosses for the legs were easily one groupable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, amittedly I may be overestimating the mobs that drop BPs and legs from OoW, but none of them look remotely one groupable except for Toirpat, but hasn't he been buffed to be a raid encounter?</div></div><hr />

Overall will be very nice upgrades for me. I will say Im a little dissapointed there are not BP and Legs available to single group encoutners (maybe 2 groupable would be ok too?). Would have been cool if they came off named mobs in MPG/Riftseekers. Make em tough/rare/hard to get to/whatever, but would love to be able to complete a whole set of Armsmaster's.</div></div><hr />

Someone said they tried it in one of the various posts relating to faction, the quests, etc.  Mob was &quot;uneffected&quot;.<br />

Too bad - I already bought one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While kael armor was 1 groupable, the bp and legs were rare as hell..  So the fact that they just made the fight harder kinda offsets people just farming arena for a set block of time.  Made it so you could get em in 1 mob instead of 3454357934875987... ya know? =P<br />
<br />
BTW, up to amiable, and like 6 hours of chain pulling MPG mobs... still amiable... then after pulling every mob i could find in DS, hitting furious, and then having everyone else ae em..... still amiable.<br />

I mean DAMN man =P  less genocide for 1 tier of faction</div></div><hr />

Now you just have to kill 3454357934875987 to get the faction instead of the drop :)<br />
<br />
What they should do is meld the two theories and put legs and BPs as rares on easier mobs, and common as extra loot on the small raid mobs. This will allow everyone to get the pieces with the obvious time advantage going to the raider.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if the link was posted already, just didn't feel like sifting through all 8 pages to find it.  Show all the pieces needed for tier one and two armor, where to get them, and the ally links.  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

More AC than Kuuan, otherwise I think Kuuan Infantry Greaves are still a bit better due to saves.   I'm mixed, the AC is nice but thats about it =p</div></div><hr />

Does this seem absurdly low to anyone else?  On drinal kyv hearts are in the bazaar at 7-9k usually.<br />
