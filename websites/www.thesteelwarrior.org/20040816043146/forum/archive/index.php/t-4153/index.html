<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just some thoughts I was having today...What would it take to fix the class? Well...I decided this is how I'd do it:<br />
<br />
1. DoT taunt<br />
2. Innate 25% Shielding - starting with 5% at level 30, 10% at 40, 15% at 50, 20% at 60, 25% at 65.<br />
3. Remove the defensive discipline. Keep the evasive discipline as it is.<br />
4. Innate 20% bonus on hp and ac for items with SHD and PAL on them.<br />
5. Unlock offensive discipline timers and bring their timers down to a minimum of 10mins, maximum of 25.<br />
6. Reduce the ability for a mob to riposte a warriors mainhand weapon by 50%<br />
7. Tactical Mastery / Strikethrough should not only hit through a riposte, it should prevent the riposte from ever occuring.<br />
8. Sta over 255 should follow the trend pre-255 (warrior only)<br />
9. Instant cast, 3minute re-use hate skill...200hate@lvl30, 300@40, 400@50, 500@60, 600@65.<br />
<br />
And for the nerfs...<br />
1. Take away the ability to taunt with spells that don't effect their target (stun, snare).<br />
<br />
That's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>judor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Solid idea's<br />
<br />
I would like to make a few comments though<br />
<br />
-I would remove evasive too, but give us a stonestance instead.<br />
<br />
-Increase taunt range to say 50ish rather then mele range. increase its refresh time maby to compinsate(if DOT taunts are added as well)<br />
<br />
-remove the 230 taunt cap, and put some mods on war items<br />
<br />
-if they keep planing to put agro procs on all our weapons(god i hate that) at least give us a AA similar to vanishing blade that is on/off. And have the procs do damage as well.<br />
<br />
I dont mind if knights are the agro kings, but they shouldnt be able to tank as well. Ok taunting skills for warriors should give us HUGE defensive skills as a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
Also my theory on SOE logic. I dont think we will see any changes till the next expansion is released(or VERY close). SoE will tend to wait till they can balance out a whole new expansion rather then going back and rebalancing a previous one. Why waste 2 weeks rebalancing stuff that will be trivial in 2 months? Least that is my theory based on the past=p. Basicaly, i would expect the same old shit at the end of the month when they release some &quot;ideas&quot; on melee balancing.  They will probably be good ideas, aimed at shutting people up for 2 months. Im not aiming this as a SOE hate post, but it seems to be the trend which is getting frustraiting. At least if the communication was open there wouldnt be as huge a thing(communication as in deadlines, how high of a priority, even throwing out rought ideas) about this cause we KNOW its getting worked on. As of now i dont believe SOE has even started melee balancing other then to say that it needs to be done. It would probably take a day to plan out what to do if you knew the limitations of the engine(not to mention the 1000's of posts here on the subject which help). New LDoN raids are neat and all, but considering the scope of who benifits from those vs who would benifit from these balancing its HUGE(not to mention all the bitching that would stop).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd change #4 with some kind of conversion for mana=% of hp for Warriors ie. 2 mana=1 hp or something<br />
<br />
Also take a look at how the stamina bar could equal a manabar for Warriors. It's useless now really. make it worth something along the lines of spec skills in DAoC ( like berzerkers did for their spec's ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>newtank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trading defensive/evasive for a lower but always up mitigation benifit makes sense.  By lowering the high end mitigation relative to knights the low end can be raised without sore feelings.<br />
<br />
I like the mana idea elsewhere where if you are at 0HP you dip into mana before dying so if you had 1000 mana as a non-caster that is a extra 1000 hp padding/insurance against dying.  Not sure if kei or FT should work for war with that or not...Probably should.<br />
<br />
I think a good utility option would be a bezerker like ability that increases offense as your hp declines starting from 1HP under max full health.  Add some ability to block hp out so that you can choose where your max hp are and you have a very interesting strategic choice to make.<br />
<br />
Example war with 5000 hp can choose to block say 1000  hp so that he effectively has 4000 hp but plus 200 atk or plus xxx shield or plus 15 damage shield.  This would give warriors more strategic choice without being unbalancing (the numbers are not necessary the right numbers for 1000 hp but you get the picture).  I think playing a war would be more fun if instead of focusing on increased mitigation they focus on increased utility.   Perhaps an interupt melee whereby a war can interupt a mob so it doesn't atk or lower the mobs atk thus allowing warriors to stack better in non-tanking roles.  As long as their is some drawback to the utility there is a lot of room to make warriors fun to play and slightly more powerful.  <br />
<br />
Another thing SOE should look at is riposte.  Riposte and parry should scale with weapon speed of the defender relative to the attacker.  Fast weapons should allow you to riposte more easily and thus be more defensive in nature.  Slow powerful weapons should be easier to riposte against and harder to riposte with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. Take away the ability to taunt with spells that don't effect their target (stun, snare). <br />
<br />
This would leave SKs with virtually no ability to aggro at range... this might be what you want, but just pointing this out.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
For warriors... I think they need some way to aggro without having to melee and maybe interupting mezzes. Or perhaps an auto turn off attack skill like for pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Virtually no ability?<br />
<br />
I guess those pure hate spells w/ 200 range are &quot;virtually no ability&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still don't see how a DoT taunt would work...<br />
for damage, a dot could always be a little plus, but for Aggro.. <br />
I dont want to start kiting mobs in circles until my dot dealt enough aggro so that the shaman can cast a slow, that would be .. bad.<br />
And for multitanking, a dot taunt won't work for that..<br />
<br />
<br />
The only idea here that would actually fix the current warrior's problem, is no.9.<br />
And you can use it only once per mob, or every 2 mob if chainpulling...<br />
<br />
And as for changing mana into anything for us, no... seriously... think...<br />
You want to ask SOE to put mana/int on every warrior armor out there afterwards???<br />
Everything without mana will become crap for melees, it's ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're assuming the only warrior problem is snap agro Bunnie, which it isn't. Snap agro would be great, but the biggest issue is that knights can tank as well as we do, AND have snap agro. Warriors can live without it, as long as we have an edge in the tanking department, which the others help.<br />
<br />
 The purpose of a dot taunt would be to have progressive agro, as well as the ability to taunt mobs other than the one you're currently attacking.  Managed correctly furors taunt dot would let you keep agro on 2-3 mobs besides the one you're killing...Thats assuming your groups hate buildup doesnt surpass your taunt dot on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They don't work at 200 range, Raaj. If they did, we'd use them. Shortly after the release of the spells, I was consistantly out aggroed at range with them. By a warrior using a darkwood compound bow. <br />
<br />
However, very few mobs are completely unsnareable. Thus Snare aggro is still mostly reliable. Unsnareable mobs will require terror and spears, and if you really need to move it, probably Asystole. <br />
Still viable. Ugly as hell, but viable. <br />
<br />
However, if you're going to take away my current use for Fear, give me higher level fear spells that, you know, work on a level 55-64 mob. Fear was an excellent escape spell, and in the right places, viable crowd control. It's ludicrous that we lose tools by leveling, both fear and bash stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont consider snap aggro as the fix, actually I'd much prefer seeing it the other way around, Knights = aggro, Warriors = survivability.<br />
<br />
But for it to be that way, our bonus has to be quite outstanding,<br />
aka permanent defensive/evasive.<br />
<br />
The problem we have now, is that Knights can tank almost as good as us, with infinite superior aggro.<br />
Give us one small skill with hate that works only every 3 minutes, and Knights will still have infinite superior aggro.<br />
<br />
Giving us 20% innate shielding is a step in the right direction, but too small, and it will require content tweeking as well...<br />
using Evasive will now go stacked with a higher shielding %.<br />
So on high raids, warriors will be overpowered for 2minutes time...<br />
yet on group levels, knights will still be the preffered choice...<br />
What is 20% shielding, when the mob is hitting on the shaman???<br />
<br />
Aggro, Survivablity and Damage, they can all be improved, but while contained within balanced limits. All while giving warriors something more to do then just, hit a certain button every minute.<br />
Disciplines, as simple as that. The melee's spells...<br />
<br />
They can give that boost of aggro we need if we got a triggerhappy shaman,<br />
they can give that boost of shielding we need if we got no shaman,<br />
they can give that boost of damage we need if we arent tanking....<br />
<br />
Most of the ideas you proposed, Raaj, can be wrapped into disciplines... only disciplines are a hell lot more flexible then skills and innate abilities.<br />
Just look at where the spells brought the casters...<br />
imagine if our disciplines were upgraded, as were the caster's spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The thing you have to keep in mind is that disciplines are what broke this class to begin with.<br />
<br />
The Innate shielding at 25% is basically half defensive - permanently. The agro skill will help with your shaman getting beat on. Having offensive disciplines unlocked will allow you to do better dps WHILE in that half-defensive state.<br />
<br />
Keeping the evasive disc in the game to stack with the 25% shielding is because it's only half defensive, and some mobs you'll want a little &quot;bonus&quot; for a short period of time. The def/evas discs were meant to be just that - a bonus...they were never meant to be a staple of the class.<br />
<br />
Now, when you've got this huge survivability compared to a knight (350hp from sta, an extra 20% off every items hp and ac, 25% innatea shielding, and the ability to do a little burst dps with fellstrike or mightystrike - you ALSO have your instant hate button (coupled with ae taunt). You bring ENOUGH to the group to warrant grabbing you, but not enough to totally phase out knights since your agro just isn't as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Um, how much aggro do you need to pull a mob? i was under the impression that getting it moving in your own direction was fine :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goladus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">However, if you're going to take away my current use for Fear, give me higher level My theory on why it's taking so long to get this balancing done is that they are trying to figure out ways to both nerf Knights and compensate them enough so that they won't mind so much and might perhaps be more fun to play afterwards.  I don't think it's at all unreasonable for them to fix this problem by simply rearranging the way SK spells work in general, hopefully in most cases for the better although you may lose some aggro holding ability.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I've brought it up on these forums yet but when they nerfed mage mod rods, they also added a series of other spells that had not been originally intended to go in to the expansion(the summoned belts and proc weapons), and also increased the power of the Planar pet heal spell.<br />
<br />
I think that Warriors would also have less problem with what you guys call &quot;snap aggro,&quot; if there was a reasonable mana(or time on raids) penalty for using it.  Warriors wouldn't need quite so many drastic changes if snap aggro was something that they had to use sparingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the closest they will come to nerfing knights spells is that spells that were not designed to be agro control and have no effect may be nerfed.  For example fear spells that are always resisted just as the low level 10 pts dot had its agro nerfed.  But in general Knights agro will be greater than war agro as it has always been.  Possible exception of pally stun being nerfed.<br />
<br />
I really think warriors are more likely to be redefined away from super high mitigation unless the new expansion moves away from slow so that super mitigation means something.<br />
<br />
If war has meaningfully more mitigation than both knights then either agro or dps has to suffer.  Traditionally warriors had higher dps than knights but lower agro control.<br />
<br />
The problem is that without decent agro the rest of the group isn't able to act for some period of time and the mitigation has to be amazingly high to compensate.  Which means if mitigation goes up agro needs to go up and either dps has to go way down or warriros are totally unbalanced relative to knights.<br />
<br />
Which would you prefer?<br />
<br />
A)  Defensive warrior with constant ~25% advantage over knights on mitigation.  Good agro control but consistantly 25% or more lower dps.  Loss of Defensive and evasive. Mana pool acts as last resort HP and at 0HP you dip into mana.<br />
<br />
B)  Defensive warrior with constant ~25% advantage over knights on mitigation constant agro control issues.  Higher long term DPS than knights good long term agro control. Loss of Defensive and evasive.<br />
<br />
C)  Warrior with DECREASED mitigation. Loss of Defensive and evasive.  Much higher DPS and utility.  Damage shield type ability.  Improved shielding abilities.  Mob debuff abilities.  Bezerker type survivability with real increased dps as hp declines.  Some form of increased soloing abilities.  Mana pool acts as last resort HP and at 0HP you dip into mana.  similiar agro with sk.<br />
<br />
D)  Ability to rapidly scale between A,B and C with penalty for doing so.  Traditionaly pally-&gt;A, SK-&gt;C and War-&gt;B but if B isn't working make warriors able to scale between A,B,&amp;C with a penalty to offset the utility.<br />
<br />
E) Warrrior retain defensive/evasive and supream role in raids as tank.  Knights retain supream role as exp tank.  Warriors get minor upgrade from SOE but all your present issues remain.  Quarm is made 50% more dps war gets 50% better mitigatimon and the uber guilds can still use pally to tank quarm.<br />
<br />
F) Warriors are made supream raid tank and supream EXP tank SK and pally gain ability to solo like old school necro.  All sk and pally are lvl 65 with maxxed AA in no time chosen over warriros as exp tanks.<br />
<br />
I would prefer D as I think it would make warriors more interesting to play.  But I think the melee rebalancing is going to feel like a nerf to a lot of warriors who think of kunark/Velious as balanced.  Keep in mind SKs lost soloing and soloing exp as part of the tradeoff with higher dps.  We have already had our nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I still don't see how a DoT taunt would work...<br />
for damage, a dot could always be a little plus, but for Aggro.. <br />
I dont want to start kiting mobs in circles until my dot dealt enough aggro so that the shaman can cast a slow, that would be .. bad.<br />
And for multitanking, a dot taunt won't work for that..<br />
<br />
A taunt dot is the most promising and creative idea proposed, precisely FOR multitanking.    <br />
<br />
Let me explain.    Some warrior AA skills were designed with chaotic combat and multiple targets in mind.   AE Taunt and Rampage were both designed to affect multiple targets simultaneously.   Contrary to popular belief, AE taunt wasn't designed to be &quot;the one reliable taunt button if your target isn't too tall&quot;, and rampage wasn't designed to collect faction in LGuk so we could all look like wood elves.<br />
<br />
I use both AE taunt and Rampage *very* often precisely for what they're designed for (well, aside from the one time I broke 11 mezzes at one time in VT to see how the enchanters would respond).   If a mob splits, I rampage for initial multiple aggro.   if there's a number of unmezzed mobs around, I'll rampage or AE taunt.   It's something that I can do that NO ONE ELSE IN EQ can do as effectively as me.<br />
<br />
I want to do something more effectively than anyone else.   The inherent PROBLEM with AE taunt and rampage is their extreme temporary effectiveness.   What I mean is, if I dont' like a cleric, I can kill them easily simply by AE taunting.   The next heal that lands will be their death.<br />
<br />
I want very badly to be able to effectively tank multiple mobs without this killing my clerics or anyone else who does something.   I want to have the ability to be able to retain aggro while tanking 2-3 mobs THROUGH a complete heal, so that the aggro generated by my dot to exceed the hate generated by the heal.   This would make me DIFFERENT from a Paladin, SK, Ranger, Beastlord, etc in LDoN where tanking is simply &quot;whoever has a few hitpoints&quot;.    Why shouldn't I be able to be the only guy able to tank 3 mobs, so that while 3 tanks are great, 1 tank who does the job of 3 is also great.  The 'risk&quot; inherent in this is I'm taking 3x the damage as the next guy, the advantage being that I can create all sorts of different grouping combinations.<br />
<br />
What exactly is wrong with warriors being able to do &quot;ghetto crowd control&quot; by causing lasting injury to their opponents?   <br />
<br />
No, to me hate dot is the #1 &quot;fix&quot; that could possibly be done for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At the current state, you can easily tank 2 mobs, and decently tank 3 mobs, by simply switching targets now and then...<br />
<br />
All you need is a EB proc on one mob, a couple hits, and you can switch targets, with that mob sticking on you through a couple CHs. This is actually more effective then a dot aggro.... because a dot aggro would take time to establish good enough aggro, but usually... when you got 3 mobs on you, you need a  heal asap.... and not in 10 seconds or so... when the dot will have gotten you enough aggro.<br />
<br />
Say you got this DoT aggro ability:<br />
-3 mobs are inc.... you target first one and dot (lets assume the recast timer on the ability is instant, otherwise it would be a total crap ability)<br />
-You then try to target a the second mob (hope the 3 mobs dont all look alike, or you'll lose track), and dot it...<br />
((during this time the melees and shamans dont do anything, or theyll easily get aggro))<br />
-You then target the 3rd (or was that the 1st? ack).. and dot him, and stick on him, you then call assist.<br />
<br />
These 3 mobs are still not slowed, the shaman has to wait quite some time before slowing, because he can easily overaggro the aggro dot.....<br />
<br />
So you got 3 unslowed mobs on you, the cleric had no choice but to already heal you... which probably has taken aggro on one of them...<br />
sure, after a few seconds of bashing the cleric, he'll get back on you... (although any cleric could of just cast a root, and move away)...<br />
<br />
but after around 1minute into the fight, the aggro dot will have dealt enough aggro, for the affected mobs to permantently stick on you...<br />
ya...<br />
but after one minute the mobs are already dead...<br />
-----<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, paladins stun while on inc, they can easily get the 3 mobs on them.... <br />
1 stun on each mob is all thats needed, to keep the mobs on them throughout the fight...<br />
everyone assists the knight, almost immediately... <br />
the first mob dies to the immediate dps, when the cleric has landed maybe.. what? 2 heals?<br />
2 mobs left... even a warrior with a decent weapon, can tank 2 mobs at once easily....<br />
---------<br />
<br />
With a DoT aggro, we'll still be utter crap when it comes to aggro.<br />
What use is tanking 3 mobs, when the mob you call assist on, will always turn back to the ranger or the wizard or the monk?????<br />
<br />
And what 3 mobs are you going to tank at once, unslowed??<br />
LDoN mobs? The easy mission only?<br />
<br />
Sure, it can be a nice toy...<br />
It will be fun seeing new tactics for boss encounters, where the Warrior is sent to dot aggro the mob, then kite him around for a few, so he can establish good starting aggro.... <br />
not.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to do something better then anyone else in the game...<br />
why not just ask for the ability to tank unslowed mobs decently???<br />
Can anyone explain to me why, a slower, is an absolute necessity in 90% of EQ??? especially PoP?<br />
<br />
That is why we got a problem now...<br />
Slowers are a necessity...<br />
stick a slower with a paladin, and a slower with a warrior... youll bring the two tanks on par.<br />
If the warrior could live without the slower, then maybe we could consider ourselves real TANKS, and not just one  of the 10 classes that can stay alive against a slowed mob</div></div><hr />

Why not a warrior gimp slow?<br />
<br />
If you got a 20% slow insta clicky ability you would get agro and tank better until shaman slow lands.  Could be a clicky on gear.  That isn't gonna offset balance with knights and it might even make your soloability better.  But I would call this utility and most knights support you getting utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we had a slow ability, i think it would have to be more than 20%.  It doesn;t need to be on par with all the casters slows, but at level 65 a 20% slow isn;t going to do much in terms of mitigating any damage, and soloing a mob with a 20% slow you must be kidding!!!  I am not sure there would be much aggro with a slow like that either (ie wavecrasher)  Something like 40-50% would be more realistic (trunchen of doom anyone).  Ideally then we'd also need some self healing ability something like mend.  The only problem i see with that kind of solution is it is really bluring the line between caster and melee.  I want to be a warrior not a hybrid or a caster.  Still it is something to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Anyone that says a warrior &quot;just needs an EB proc&quot; is out of their goddamn mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Generally 3 Things I'd do..<br />
<br />
1) Ranged Only Aggro - Enuff that a warrior can use it on Incoming, and have the shaman get a slow attempt in or a quick heal and not get waxxed, that has  like a 1 minute Refresh, and can only be used out of Melee Range... (Maybe around 600-700 hate?)<br />

This would make it so Aggro control etc is still needed, and the progression of geraing up warrior taunt, and having upgrades increase your guild DPS is still there - and the Benefit of having a Knight tank is still more aggro  - but not such a great advantage. (Maybe Mess with Cease a little - I personally use FoA, and I think it should be using those level stuns once you get into PoP) I dont know enuff about SK spells to comment on them so i wont.<br />
<br />
2) PoTime Itemization, I dont know if this is codable using current engine, but Basically make the Phase 4+ loots be 90% (General Number) of that they are for non warrior class's, AC/HP Wise if warrior is on it. (Pal Only or Hybrid only etc items should stay <br />
<br />
3) Somehow to get multi target close ranged aggro easier. (Maybe make AE Taunt a taunt that works same as taunt does but an area with a little increase % Rate, and make an additional AA that is a single Target Gaurteeded Taunt (What AE tuant is mostly used for) Or Something - havnt put too much thought into this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Pukrup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hello all my first post on Steel Warrior,<br />
Has anyone thought of a line of Warrior-only buffs<br />
stackable with Virtue/Brells and all the ac/atk buffs? I think this would give us an advantage in group and raid as a Tank (what we are there for) and not take away from other classes (so what the casters have to buy another spell.... boo hoo go ks everyone in Rathe a while). Spread the wealth so Shammies, Clerics, Droods,and Chanters get some that are in line with spells they already have but are Warr only (kinda like the Pally/SK/Ranja self buffs)<br />
Just the 2 cents of a 59 Warr (please spend wisely lost alot of blood getting that 2 cents)</div></div><hr />

It's fairly simple to deal with taunt dots, but it DOES take some skill.   Let's take your scenario....<br />
<br />
3 identical looking mobs come into camp.   Target the closest and do some damage, now it has a different display on it's health bar as the others.    Target another, do some damage and add dot.    Now one is higher than the other two while both are locked onto you.   Now, attack the 3rd, no need to apply dot really since the 3rd would be the one you're tanking.    Voila, it works beautifully, caused you to actually have to make skilled decisions and conscious choices.<br />
<br />
Something goes &quot;wrong&quot; and you either rampage or AE taunt and all is good.<br />
<br />
Really this isn't much different from what enchanters have to do.   Also, I guarantee one pally stun will NOT maintain aggro throughout a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&quot;why not just ask for the ability to tank unslowed mobs decently???<br />
Can anyone explain to me why, a slower, is an absolute necessity in 90% of EQ??? especially PoP?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmmm.<br />
<br />
That's actually one of the best questions regarding the whole issue of tanking I've seen asked on this board. Ever.<br />
<br />
It's also very difficult to address.<br />
<br />
If you make warriors great tanks against unslowed mobs, you then create a potential problem with raiding.<br />
<br />
If you make warriors great tanks against unslowed mobs, you also gimp knights again, as groups will start to form up without slowers (basically the biggest hangup in grouping these days has been finding a slower and healer on at the right time and LFG at the same time).<br />
<br />
It's a tough call.<br />
<br />
There's all sorts of ramifications here.<br />
<br />
That's not to say I don't AGREE with you though.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd like to see EQ get away from slow being such a stupid necessity.<br />
<br />
By forcing the playerbase to GROUP as much as it currently does, the CONTENT needs to be much more flexible, so that you really CAN have different group makeups.<br />
<br />
So if tanks are to share the role, then warriors, paladins and SKs should all be able to tank unslowed mobs.<br />
<br />
And slow casting classes should be able to do more effective things in a group besides cast slow.<br />
<br />
And THEN, grouping gets a bit easier for the WHOLE cast of classes in the game.<br />
<br />
But that's just one perspective ... my own. And I have no clue if it's even close to viable, because as I said, messing with that begins to unravel a whole bunch of twine, called EQ combat and group makeup.<br />
<br />
heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&quot;Also take a look at how the stamina bar could equal a manabar for Warriors. &quot;<br />
<br />
Are you *sure* this is what you really want?  The total lack of stamina meaning anything was very annoying to casters for a long time.  Instead of nerfing you guys and making it important, they boosted what a caster can get out of his mana bar (ie-his stamina bar).  It would not be out of line for you to suffer serious melee problems if the stamina bar was empty.  Frankly, if they had made that bar important years ago, casters would not have needed the boost they got and they wouldn't be *so* powerful now.  Also, you would have to completely remove every &quot;invigorate&quot; item or spell from the game (unless they were fairly poor like the caster mana versions).  Not to mention you would have to add ways to improve regeneration for it via spells (kei like) and items (ftlike) AND you would have to assign it a stat that increases it, which probably shouldn't be the obvious (stamina) because getting hp and stamina from the same stat is fairly poor.  AND you would have to suffer for having any effect that helped it on an item, minus endgame gear.  That is alot of work that would have the same problem as caster focus items on implementation (ie- there were so few items in game that did it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Frodlin,<br />
how much time do you think it takes to kill a mob? <br />
<br />
By the time you've got all 3 on you, the first one would of died.<br />
<br />
By the time you kill one of the 3, the dot on the first mob will have hardly generated as much aggro as one paladin stun.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not discussing the fact wether it takes too much skill to do or not. With enough skill, you don't need damage differences to find your way through 3 identical mobs.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to show is it's complete uselessness.<br />
<br />
By turning on one mob, damaging it a bit, turning on the next, damaging a bit, and finally on the third... you can already tank 3 mobs simultaneosly. I know, Ive done it... and I'm sure you have too.<br />
And I'm sure you know that the biggest problem in this situation, is some dps class hitting on one of the mobs that you're not actively aggroing... in which case he gains aggro. (which would happen regardless of a aggro dot or not)<br />
<br />
If you have the decent equipment, you already can multitank 3 mobs...<br />
if you don't have the decent equipment, you wouldnt survive multitanking anyhow...<br />
<br />
And as I said, it would still help a tiny bit in multitanking, I'm not saying it's 100% useless....<br />
but :<br />
<br />
1)paladins will still do it better then us (unless the dot would generate around 1000hate within 10seconds, and be insta recast)<br />
2)warriors will then be forced to DoT and then kite boss mobs around for some time, for maximal efficiency.<br />
3)and the possiblities of exploiting it for aoe exping is a bit obvious too<br />
<br />
All this coupled with the fact that, slowers will still have to wait a long time before slowing, even though it's 3 mobs hitting you this time.... and warriors were already having trouble with 1 unslowed mob...<br />
<br />
And rooting will still prove a HELL lot more efficient in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">People only fight slowed mobs because slow is incredibly overpowered and make what should be a challenging fight a walk in the park.  Slow should never have been stronger than 35% maximum.  Its one of the most basic things broken in EQ, its why beastlords and rangers can MT as well as a warrior at the high end.  Taunt is pretty broken too though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I agree with slow being one of the major faults of our imbalance.<br />
<br />
It would be fine if non warriors needed slow, and not warriors.. Tanking would finally have a true distinct meaning.. <br />
but nah, they preferred having everyone need Slow...<br />
<br />
Though Taunt is not broken. It serves it purpose nicely... the problem is it's the only tool we have.<br />
Taunt is made to get you the mob's attention, no matter where you were on the hate list.<br />
It's not, and never should be considered, a tool to keep a mob on you.<br />
Problem is we have nothing else to use...<br />
<br />
Its like saying the screwdrivers are broken, because they don't drive in nails properly....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think when they created the skill taunt way back when EQ was being designed that it was actually created to keep aggro on the warrior.  Thats why its recast time is so short.  Back then holding aggro was much easier and not holdling aggro was much less costly.  Mana regen was non existant and downtime was inevitable.  I think taunt needs an upgrade.  Give it a small amount fixed aggro on a success or failure that works at range.  On a success it would still put you on top of the list(that part would not work at range) and then add the small aggro.<br />
<br />
Its like saying handheld screwdrivers are broken because they upgraded the screws and you require a power screwdriver for them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>gazarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If warrior are given ability to tank unslowed mob as good as knights tanking slowed one, the result will be group with 1 healer, 1 war and 4 dps which will be much greater xp wise than group with knights, healer, slower and 3 dps. And if a group make up has an advantage xp wise to another group make up, its just a question of time until some class become obsolete again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well no.. because Warriors still have to watch aggro.<br />
DPS won't be able to go full speed, and since the mob is unslowed... loss of aggro would be lethal.<br />
<br />
Shamans and Enchanters would just become expendable :D <br />
<br />
I'm sure if you compare 4dps + warrior aggro,<br />
and 3dps + knight aggro... you'll realise there's not much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>AvatarofWar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Can you all just think about the ideas you put up? Ok give us a spell or change our disciplines or nerf other classes so we are better. There is only one true answer to our problems. Give us the ability to AGGROVATE everthing more than everyone else and keep it. Staying alive is not our purpose, Damage over time is not our main purpose, The FOCAL POINT of the GROUP is. SOE can just change a number and instant presto we hold aggro on everything. They just dont care to do it. We dont need to change our abilities so much, just make it WAR ONLY SUPREME AGGRO , sony just doesnt get it.:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Centhios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I believe that they should try to make it so Warriors / Paladins / Shadowknights would all be equally desirable as raid tanks or group members, with Warriors being slightly advantaged in raiding. The reason why I made a paladin was to be able to tank as well as anyone else, to possibly become MT in a guild, etc. With warriors becoming superior - I doubt that will happen. There should be a balance as far as aggro and tanking abilities go. currently there's problems - but giving 20-25% permanent damage evasion? or other boosts? that's ludicrous. at least give pallies / sk's a 15% boost then. if you give a huge bonus like that to warriors, just balance it out a little. that's all i'm saying<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wyvernwill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Knights are never the first choice for MT'ing new mobs nor mobs that are extremely difficult, nor should they be.<br />
<br />
When guilds get to the point that a Paladin can tank something like Quarm, there's a good possibility that Warriors can still easily do it and still do it far more effectively.<br />
<br />
Theres a fine line between where something is not trivial and trivial... Not trivial being the point where Warriors are the only ones that can handle it and trivial being the point where anyone with enough AA can handle it, be it a Paladin, SK, or Ranger or anyone else that has enough hps and can draw the agro.</div></div><hr />
