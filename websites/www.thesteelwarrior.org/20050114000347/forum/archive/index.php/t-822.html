Best things to help would just be to work on ND and try to get on some more ToV raids to get Myrmidon to upgrade your champs slots...plate drops like it's going outta style there.  ND would bring you up to 3850, and from there, it's just a hop, skip and a jump to 4khp, which is respectable for anyone.  <br />
<br />
For 40k, I would definitely spend money on a solstice earring and if you can get one (Price dropped like a rock on CT a few months ago) a Mosquito leg earring.  Buy slots in the bazaar that you can't upgrade with Myrmidon first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Myrm armor is very nice, and will provide you with a lot of upgrades. Push your guild to hot. You shouldn't have trouble tanking there, you have ~100 hp less then me and I do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vindi bp Benevolence bracers and Mym legs is what i'd shoot for.  If yer guild isnt vindi-able im sure if you hang around kael long enough someone will let a bp rot on their way to statue or aow.  Also ya needa do something about that hammer.. maybe try for a Swiftblade of  Zek, they cant be too hard to find anymore.<br />
<br />
edit: also try and score a champions helm.  better than Myrm if you dont have capped sta.<br />
<br />
I dont really know how hard all that stuff is to get these days.  Havent really played in ages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres new plate greaves dropping in Veksar, 40ish Ac and 45hp.. tradable, i sold a pair for 10k in the bazaar a few days agon, look for those. Would be a solid investment.<br />
<br />
Replace the boots with some with HP.. use your judgment, but  get some HP there.<br />
<br />
Search about for a good cheap earring, Mosquito ears are getting below to 15k mark i bet.<br />
<br />
Weapons. Swiftblade of Zek and possibly a Snowchipper or something else with a nice proc and some HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a 53 with full deity armor and some major twink gear could possibly beat 3500... but would be a stretch.  Mosquito earring is a good call since it will upgrade you a lot of hps in one shot.</div></div><hr />

-Champ's Helm (Thurg Quest)<br />
-Vindi BP, if you can't get that, use a Worn Wind one from Gaukr Sandstorm in BoT<br />
-Those Shoulders that drop from the Trial of hanging in PoJ, or <br />
-Bracer of benevolence<br />
-Heirophant's cloak</div></div><hr />

Heh not really. With full FH and his/her spare slots filled its not hard at all. Most of the catch is diety related<br />
<br />
As for money, I would go for GSOT asap Mino, its a great weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FIrst item I would recommend is a Greatstaff of Thunder. It will get you 85hp plus it is a far superior agro weapon over your current set up. Once you have that, in no particular order:<br />
<br />
Mosquito leg earring<br />
Fine Heraldic boots<br />
Fine Heraldic greaves<br />
Fine Heraldic bracer x2<br />
Fine Heraldic BP (until you can get Vindi)<br />
Darkwood Bow of Suffering<br />
<br />
Those items should take you over 3800hp without any AA work. It sounds like your guild is either capable or near ready for Vindi. Hold out on a Vindi BP. It is better than Myrmidon's and you will probably for near the rest of your EQ career. Get a cultural until then, at least you can sell that when you do get a Vindi.<br />
<br />
I know you only have 40k to work with, but you should be able to get all of the armor for basically the time it will take you to gather components. If you can get enough components for say 2 or 3 attempts, many smiths will take that in trade for 1 completed piece. You get your armor cheap, and the smith gets some extra pieces to sell for profit. Lucky for you, human GM smiths are pretty common compared to other races.</div></div><hr />
