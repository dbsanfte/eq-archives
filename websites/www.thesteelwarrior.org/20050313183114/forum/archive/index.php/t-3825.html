My thought is do it REAL late night or weekend days when minimal people on so they dont feel excluded, obviously were gonna want best tanks, clerics, bards so forth to have a better chance but the other people want to raid also. Any suggestions or helpfull advice coming from your LDon raiding experience ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we've tried a few ways so far... though I'll admit that LDoN doesn't seem to be popular at all.  Some people do like it though.  <br />
<br />
We've tried late night raids.  We can't do early raids because LDoN raids take too long.  The late night raids have gone fairly well, but we've had to recruit people out of guild to fill in some key classes, and that doesn't work so well in a DKP guild.  Plus you get some random people who can screw up, etc.<br />
<br />
Last time we tried 2 raids at the same time, on a non-Time day during prime time.  We had planned to do one 'easy' elemental raid in MM, and one Mir tougher raid at the same time.  But too many people couldn't do the MM raid because they had done it within the last 5 days.  So after both raids were formed, we both ended up doing the 'hard' Mir raid... which left one raid force greatly more powerful than the other... you can guess how that turned out... the first force finished, but late... and got some mostly rot drops (type 3 AoDaring, 10vs all type 3, shit we can't even use without LDoN armor, etc)... and the 2nd raid group wiped 2 times and didn't even come close to finishing.  We also had at least one cleric who had to log, and one LD for 80% of the mission... which left us really short handed...<br />
<br />
I think half the guild is eager to try new stuff and wants to see all of LDoN and get all the great raid augs.  Then half the guild simply hates LDoN and would rather /q than do LDoN raids.  Personally, the 3 hour time limit (requirement), and the often VT-like yard trash clearing really makes me extremely tempted to /q when LDoN is called, much more so than even PoWater...<br />
<br />
I'd be happy if they added some damn LDoN raids that were 1 hour in length.  It already takes a damn hour just to travel, setup raid, pick mission, etc atm.  And being 'forced' to stay at a raid for 4+ hours sucks.  People who have RL stuff, or EST people who need to log early, either can't do raids, or end up leaving in the middle and screwing over everyone.<br />
<br />
PS: My suggestion is that if you still haven't finished PoP, or some elem stuff is up, do that and skip LDoN.  It will save everyone a lot of head aches :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course yes this does mean people are bored 5 of the 7 days we arent in PoTime. But on the other hand, doing LDON raids is soo not worth it atm. The are too many booby-prizes, they take too long to complete(even if you win), and in general remind me of VT clearing(except in VT you got rewarded at the end.. here you just get shit).<br />
<br />
I prefer watching re-runs of old TV-shows, or *gasp* doing homework over LDON raids.<br />
<br />
I am *really* hoping they fix those raids soon, or it will be a damn long wait until the next expansion... And tbh, I dont know how long people in guild will want to stick around in EQ if PoTime is the only worthwhile thing left to do.</div></div><hr />

LOL.<br />
<br />
I recently got flamed for suggesting a system of that nature on Monkly Biz to a couple of people who were moaning about LDoN's 36 person requirement.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

72/2 = 36.  Double your pleasure.  Too bad that usually means one raid ends up with 2 clerics, 4 enchanters, 3 druids, 1 warrior, and 6 necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikkon</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did our first succsessful ldon raid last night. Everyone seemed to have fun, and the loot was decent enough nice caster shield and 50 hp aug and some other stuff.  Took us just over two hours. Was an offday so could only talk 28 or so people into doing it but shrug. Seems like a fun thing to do on offdays or late night shit when people wanna raid but theres nothing up or you dont have the numbers on do do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a stupid idea then, its still a stupid idea now.<br />
<br />
I doubt it would even work in reality.<br />
<br />
36? Some way to limit the numbers entering the channel? Someway of ensuring that more then 1 person doesn't enter at a time? Anyway of ensuring that the right classes even join? How do you do DKP? Does everyone get? Or does no one get?<br />
<br />
LDoN raids suck, the ONLY way to do them is to choose 36 people, because you NEED some people more then you need others, you don't need the 6th necro, but what if he joins before the 6th cleric, so then all of a sudden you going to change the rules, its no longer 'First to join channel' it becomes &quot;First to join channel...once we have the people we need to take&quot;<br />
<br />
Who decides what people you need to take? Ahh all of a sudden we are back to square one, someone has to decide who goes, and that someone is going to get flack no matter what they do, because people will ask the one question that will cause drama.<br />
<br />
Why did they get chosen and not me.<br />
<br />
You can criticize that all you like, feel free, but you know it will happen.<br />
<br />
LDoN Raids = Drama.<br />
<br />
Thats the be and end all of it.<br />
<br />
The reason that idea is stupid and will remain stupid wherever it is repeated Wubao is because it doesn't even attempt to deal with the drama that is caused by LDoN raids being limited to 36 people.<br />
<br />
You can piss and moan and throw your hands in the air and claim maturity and whatever you like, but any guild leader will tell you something simple....Guild Drama = Bad News.<br />
<br />
Its not wanted, its not useful, it serves no purpose, it is a problem and the more you can cut out the better, happier place your guild will be.<br />
<br />
LDoN raids and randomly choosing people does not equate to cutting out drama, it is just fostering it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's for damn sure.  We just had a vote in our private forums.  No more LDoN raids AT ALL 46%, Only ONE LDoN raid per week 53%.<br />
<br />
Pretty sad when a new expansion comes out and the top raiding guild on the server has about 1/2 of their people who would rather stick forks in their eyes than raid LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elidroth</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN was never intended to have raids in the first place. It was only added when the raiding guilds started to make noise. Hence.. it's fucked up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you could make LDoN raids punishment detail !<br />
<br />
Every time someone does something stupid on a raid they get condemned to 1 LDoN raid before they can have the DKP from the raid they did something stupid on.<br />

<br />
Make an intern Event Ldon 2 Raids the ppl. choosen one by one from 2 designed Raid Leader and start the same Ldon Raid looking which raid will be the winner... Problem solved.<br />
<br />
2 Raids same stuff and extra fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 raids generally results in one raid being stacked with the best players and best class balance, and one raid being screwed and gimped.  Thus one raid will do considerably better than the other, and the players in the gimp raid will generally be even more pissed off than general with LDoN raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe just divide people up equally out of whatever 72 you have?<br />
<br />
6 warriors = 3 in each<br />
4 enchanters = 2 in each<br />
8 necros = 4 in each<br />
<br />
and so on and so forth, theoretically each would be just as likely to win or lose.<br />
<br />
But then I guess you would have people claiming favoritism for one raid or the other, although if everyone is somewhat equally geared it shouldnt be that big of a problem.<br />

<br />
Though we had to tweak our RPP distribution to make people log for LDoN raids :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to post an update on this issue.  Currently NO GUILDS on Fennin Ro do LDON raids.  They all either have better things to do, or would rather log off than do LDoN raids.<br />
<br />
We have finished getting almost everything we need from Elemental planes.  So on non-Time days, we almost NEVER raid anymore.  We tried doing 1 LDoN a week, even though the guild vote for doing just 1 LDoN raid a week, was 54% NO, 46% YES.  But the raids were just such a pain for everyone involved that we have stopped doing them completely.<br />
<br />
We are still the only guild in Time on the server.  Half of the guild is currently playing FFXI, waiting for a new expansion to come out that doesn't totally suck for raiding...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah my patience with LDON raids is beginning to wear pretty thin too, and so is the attendance for them. We have attempted most of the PoTime lvl raids a few times now, and are close on some of them, and others stuck. All in all we have wasted a shitload of time for no reward at all.<br />
<br />
Quick review:<br />
<br />
MM - Valdoon - Seems doable, but not easy. Best attempt 40% on final version so far<br />
<br />
Miragul - Lost comrades - Very nice raid and puzzles EXCEPT for the super lame protect some dead chicks corpse part. Like 10 wild animals charge, impossible to taunt and they rip her apart in 1 min, and you fail+get ported out of dungeon.. very gay.<br />
<br />
Miragul - Synarcana - Hmm, well seem doable, but raid composition matters alot for this. We got very far on final dude on the raid where we had 6 wizzies+2 mages.. the week later we came back and had mostly melee people and got our asses kicked.<br />
<br />
The 5 day retry on fails suck imo. It means that by the next time you get back to the raid, you either dont remember exactly what you needed to change, or maybe you come back with a totally different class-mix/people, and thus have to start all over again and &quot;re-learn&quot; it with that particular combo.<br />
<br />
If I could change LDON raids I would do 3 things:<br />
<br />
1) Allow people to join/leave them mid-raid<br />
2) Change respawn time on fails to 1 day, so you can work on 1 raid a particular week, instead of having to work on several different ones spanning several weeks<br />
3) Tune the final parts of some of the encounters, OR, have more in-game clues/lore on how to defeat them. I mean, on some of these raids there are no rhyme or reason to what takes place and its pure guesswork.<br />
<br />
As far as I have seen its only 3 guilds(FoH/AL/AO) that have defeated any LDON raids besides Valdoon(which a few more have gotten). This imo could point to some of the other raids needing to be tuned a bit, considering the length of time they have been accesable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the clues and such are pathetic.  You basically have to fail a lot of the raids at least once, if not multiple times to figure out what the hell is going on.  Miragul - Lost comrades is a perfect example of that.<br />
<br />
We have also won some and lost some, but it's never enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szlia</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CQ won Prison Break! Yay us! :P<br />
<br />
That's like the only one we seriously tried to beat though... there are others we tied 2 or 3 times and a number we checked just once (loosing after 5min in Guk was good fun :P). The guild motivation is pretty low for these though :/</div></div><hr />
