<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fieldweeble</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there, I've got a couple questions I figured you peoples could answer for me!<br />
<br />
First off, I quit EQ right before PoP was released. Then, about a month ago, I started playing again, from scratch. My character is level 36 now, and my good friend is being a &quot;pet cleric&quot; along the way, so I've got constant cleric-groupage. Now for the questions --<br />
<br />
How do the planes work? once you get 46, do you just go to whichever one you like?<br />
Are the planes too difficult for a warrior-cleric duo? Do you need a huge raiding group, or maybe a full group of powerful people?<br />
I heard you have to get &quot;flagged&quot; to go to some planes. How does this happen?<br />
Are there some planes that are expecially good for flat out EXPing, and some that are good for gear mongoring?<br />
<br />
Answers are greatly appriciated, I'm really anxious to see what the deal is -- perhaps someone could post a link to a site that explains this stuff? :P<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks in advance,<br />
Fieldweeble Feldwebel</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can tell who here hasn't been to plane of justice recently!<br />
<br />
:b<br />
<br />
At 46, with a warrior and a cleric, your best bet is to grab a monk of similar level, and an enchanter of similar level and go kick the ever lovin crap outta first floor PoJ.<br />
<br />
Split pull, mez adds, and rake in the XPs.<br />
<br />
Good luck, have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah alright I forget about Justice, I only ever went there to do trials, was 60 with 100aa already when PoP came out.  That would be a good place to go at 46 instead of what I previously mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, I was only teasing ya Cryst.<br />
<br />
A lot of people forget that PoJ exit has become quite the XP group hotspot for high 40s to high 50s.<br />
<br />
In fact, most of tier 1 is filled with level 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and some in tier 2... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone want heroic bond /laff</div></div><hr />

Giving credit where it is due, was absentminded of me to forget anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought AA's came out with PoP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All other AA's came out with Luclin. No levels, so different T sink! :)</div></div><hr />
