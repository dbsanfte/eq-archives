<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets hold a skull session that's not being pre-screened by the SoE Dev's.  What do you think of the changes?  What do you think should be fixed first to balance warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What is the &quot;Styles system&quot;? Is that the name of the new melee Combat Abilities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its what I've been calling it I guess.  Its just the same melee combat system DAOC had, and there the &quot;responses&quot; to &quot;openings&quot; were called styles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll take option #6: Let's see how the new changes affect things before we start asking for more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want to see how the new system works before I have any comments on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where is the &quot;Summon: Cup Cake&quot; ability? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Then call it what SHOULD have been fixed first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem with this poll is it only fits your views on things. Many others im sure see it differently. Its not about what should and shouldnt be done FIRST, its that something needed to be done in general. Something IS being done to address us and I would like to see how these new changes pan out before I make a comment on anything relating to what SHOULD be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not sure how.  I tried to include neutral and at least somewhat mutually exclusive choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't see how I can answer til the changes go in on the 16th.  The provoke line sounds great, the unlinked discipline timers sounds great, the mitigation change sounds good, and so far the opening system sounds almost useless but they said it's going to change significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I want interns hired at SOE. I want those interns to be put to work. I want them to go into the item database, and MAKE SENSE OF THIS CRAP.<br />
<br />
I want monks to get robes again. And wrist WRAPS. And pants. I want that crappy leather to be GONE from my person. I am not a druid!<br />
<br />
I want someone to explain why monks received no class based armor in Kunark.<br />
<br />
I want someone to explain why 6 AC pants mean a damn thing to a monk with a mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
I want someone to explain where the idea of 60 AC pants came from.<br />
<br />
I want answers on Windblade and Centi Longsword. Who is responsible for those initial drop rates?<br />
<br />
It's a biiiiig item database. And there's a lot of ground to cover. But the longer SOE keeps waiting to tackle the issue of ITEMIZATION, the bigger the database keeps getting.<br />
<br />
And since the NEW system will be bringing ENDURANCE into play, and SOME itemization has to be tackled (+END items will involve someone going into the database and coding items with endurance) ... then it's the PERFECT TIME to tackle the WHOLE issue of itemization.<br />
<br />
Start with North Temple of Veeshan and go from there.<br />
<br />
I mean come on ... how many knight weapons per capita have to be in a zone before someone says &quot;You know maybe this mob can drop a melee item instead&quot; ?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also I want an explanation on ARMOR drops. I want one SOON too. It's LONG overdue for someone at SOE central to at least APOLIGIZE for the leather and chain drops in Kael ... the chain drops in HoT ... the chain drops in Sol Ro tower.<br />
<br />
It's like they HATE rangers and rogues getting ANY armor. But my god, I have silk coming out of my buttocks! And I can't spit without hitting a mob that drops a piece of plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I want a banker at every Wayfarer camp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have a question: Will the current items with Mana be replaced by Endurance for Meeles? What do I do with the 500 mana I have on me when this whole Endurace based stuff goes live? Do I need to get new items with Endurance? Will the Warrior only armor (Champ, SS, Kael, Ornate....) have Endurance now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">think the poll is a little slanted<br />
<br />
&quot;styles&quot; also known as combat moves and several other things+ the new discplines+ our exsisting agro power looks great to me, kinda wonder why people are upset even before tryin it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We need to have more options for what types of Coffee we can make. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I want to get rid of annoying polls with self-serving choice selections. I think polls in general should be removed from the board, and only put up by mods for special occasions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mahalito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;&quot;And I can't spit without hitting a mob that drops a piece of plate.&quot;&quot;<br />
