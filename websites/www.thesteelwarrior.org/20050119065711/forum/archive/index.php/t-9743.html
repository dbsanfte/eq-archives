<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking for some ideas of possible farmable/bazaarable gear (and or augments) to bump my ac up, with minimum loss of hp (though thats not very important). Magelo is to the left, prefer not to do LDoNs, but I do plan on getting 4 more of the ac augments (maybe 3, I want to keep my agi 12 cleave 2 augment if possible since agi is one of my weaker stats) <br />
<br />
I'm not KT flagged yet, still missing 3 and 4. Would prefer to avoid GoD trials if possible, they've never been very kind to me.<br />
<br />
The slots that I most desperately want to replace are shoulders, and earrings if possible, and though not as &quot;urgent&quot; arms, hands and neck.<br />
<br />
The few ideas I had had were the 20 ac aug from rekamu as well as his earring, and horn spiked shoulder pads maybe for shoulders. Any thoughts would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Note: Also, haste is not a problem. If there's a really good belt out there, dont let the haste on my current one bar it. I will switch to tribute haste, if need be.</div></div><hr />

Also, could do that Ornate Inlay crest neck from MPG 16ac/120hp.<br />
<br />
Celestial Lorica 72ac/140hp BP from RS is supposedly one groupable, but i have no firsthand knowledge of whats required to get it or how common it is.<br />
<br />
Depending on how ya feel about the Armsmaster's quests, you could upgrade a couple slots there...arms and hands.</div></div><hr />

Charmer of Fire, Sorcerer of Fire, Vicar of Fire near birds)<br />
<br />
Ornate Inlay Neck Crest is 1 groupable from MPG as well (Discordling Enchainer Kuroun)</div></div><hr />
