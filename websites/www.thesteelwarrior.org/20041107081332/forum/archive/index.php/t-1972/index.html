<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I semi-retired my warrior and switched to a Necro now.<br />
<br />
What made me even MORE sad is I actually enjoy playing my Necro. I was impressed by the power I gained from every level/spells/AA I advanced. I have never experienced this in my entire warrior life... I used to be happy when my warrior broke 8k HP<br />
<br />
But guess what.... my necro just got his lvl60 spell recently - Funeral Pyre.... the enjoyment/Power out of this single spell outweight any single piece of gears I have ever acquired in my entire warrior life such as 41% haste, 100hp item, epic, TB weapon....etc... and how hard is to get that spell???  Absolutely easy relative to my warrior gears.<br />
<br />
I put in so much effort in playing my Warrior... all the exp/AA/gears/weapons.. every single HP and AC I was trying to get.... all these became a joke now because the class is not needed 95% of the time.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">necros are fun as hell...<br />
<br />
and as i always say: have fun man..you're paying 12.95 a month so why not enjoy it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your 12 bucks a month.<br />
<br />
I personally enjoy my beastlord and wizard a lot now...something about fighting with the spirits of nature, and nuking shit is cool to me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My alt is a necro, I luv em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My alt is an enchanter... sure PoP has been kinder to enc's than warriors, but since the charm nerf and because my enc is a twink and therefore has no FT or any decent gear the only advantage the enc has is being able to get groups.<br />
<br />
Once you're in one its just a case of stand, tash, slow, sit, wait for next mob (or if there's a warrior tanking: wait 10secs, stand, tash, boggle, slow, boggle, recast rune, wait 20secs, sit).  Haste every 45mins, C3 every 2.5 hrs.  <br />
<br />
Raids are worse cos then you're reduced to being buff bitch for the most part.  Very occasionally you get to mez something, but if an add does get brought to camp you have to take turns with the other 3 chanters as to who gets to play CC this time.<br />
<br />
Given the choice I'd be playing my warrior in every group I get, and I still do often enough.  Only takes a couple of tells with the slower to make sure you both understand eachother's expectations and most groups run smoothly enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats, Sony devs HATE melee chars, they have a esp big hard-on for warriors and monks. You ditched one of the classes they HATE for one they LOVE. They will NEVER do ANYTHING to fix warriors except give 1% of the warriors equipment to compensate. Necros can solo or group, warriors can not solo and now are the red headed step children of groups, can't tank (due to no aggro control) and can't do DPS, monks call themselves &quot;rogue lite&quot; well, warriors are &quot;rogue extra-lite&quot; and you and I aren't dieting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just remember...mage &gt;&gt;&gt; necro:D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OT: Wasn't Rumblingdeth banned?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, Necro/Mage/Beastlord would be a close contest for pet contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I personaly have played every class other then BL to lvl 15+ some of them 55. I enjoy 2 boxing warrior and druid more then anything. There is skill involved there is a lot of versetility and I get to do a lil bit of everything. Buff pull heal tank sometimes kite adds ;) I do admit out of mana classes when I am not 2 boxing Necro is my most fav class. Mages werent as fun for me. After Necro I'd say I enjoy playing monk. FD lets me explore so much content with relative ease its just cool. For me warrior is to stay. I did seriously consider switching main to monk, but that just didnt happen and 100 some AAs and gear later its not going too. I kinda liked playing SK too, but playing undertwinked mele class is not that much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i'm sorry to say this but i'm practically retiring dobbo to some exp (if not lfg for 30 min or less) fletching tradeskill raid man and rm killer just seems game has lost it's touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm sad becasue..<br />
<br />
I semi-retired my warrior and switched to a Necro now.<br />
 <br />
<br />
That's funny, because about 2 years ago now I was sad because i retired my necro and switched to a warrior and haven't looked back.<br />
<br />
My how the times have changed.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can  rumble stop  bitching and crying.  YOu quit the game and yet you can not let it go move on.  GOD he makes the furur look like a happy go lucky guy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ah well Haass...to each their own</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am having a lot of fun playing my bard lately.<br />
He was created in october 2000 but retired due to computer problems in then end of 2001.<br />
Somehow twisting with the old UI got my interface stuck randomly. Not good for a bard.<br />
But now it is fun to be able to solo and not spending hours lfg.<br />
