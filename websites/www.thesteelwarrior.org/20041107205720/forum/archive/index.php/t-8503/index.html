<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>solarax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im gonna throw out some terms used in the military when processing someone for punishment just so maybe we can adopt thier use<br />
we have the first one but many people use it in diferent ways resulting in confusion<br />
Mitigation .normaly mitigation in the military is when you are givin a chance to say why the charges should be dropped because they are incorect and you should be set free or not punished. this is diferent slightly from the second term extenuation . so maybe we could try defining mitigation as avoidance .<br />
<br />
extenuation is when you , instead of saying how the charges are false ( not trying to avoid damage) you say that the charges are true and you have a reason for commiting the act that is beyond normal circumstances so you should be forgivin or given less punishment  ( reduce your sentance or the damage taken as a result of your actions) which as a tank could result in high ac lowering the damage you would take .<br />
<br />
now i know its complicating things for the simple people that just want a general term but in the end adding 1 term would make simplifying the names and formula much easyer for comunication perposes .<br />
<br />
just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought the meanings were clear to those invoved in the discussions, but it seems not all understand.<br />
<br />
mitigation = reduction in damage taken<br />
avoidance = mitigation to 0 damage, a miss<br />
<br />
Increasing ones AC through items decreases ones chance to get hit for max damage, while also, to a lesser extent, increasing the chance to avoid the attack altogether.<br />
<br />
Various defensive skills and AAs also can increase avoidance and mitigation.<br />
<br />
EDIT: To parallel your examples.<br />
<br />
mitigation could be seen as extenuation to the point of mitigation.<br />
Arguing why a persons actions, though illegal, were justifable.<br />
<br />
Man comes home from work to find his wife and children dead and finds the murderer in his house. Instead of calling the police as he should, he grabs his pistol and shoots the killer armed with only a knife, killing him.<br />
<br />
In thise case, extenuating cirumstances mitigate the crime. A crime of passion that hardly anyone would condem a man for. Of course, this is entirely dependent upon local laws whether this is illegal. In most states I think it is. Mississippi law however reconizes this situation. One must only show that the was a significant threat to property or person. A home owner can shoot anyone tresspassing inside his home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">avoidance = mitigation to 0 damage, a miss<br />
<br />
You can not mitigate a hit to zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Skills and AAs will net you a set amount of avoidance. If you can't mitigate hit to 0, making it a miss, then avoidance will always be the same %. If this is so, then increasing AC will not increase your avoidance %.<br />
<br />
Are you suggesting that no matter how high a character's AC vs mob atk, the mob has a set minimum DPS of DI + DB minus a set % of avoidance?<br />
<br />
If so, I'd like to see your proof, because I'm quite sure a lvl 1 skelly hits a lot less often than a lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haaas is right, a hit can't be mitigated to 0. Even with max mitigation, a mob will always do it's damage bonus. AC through gear helps to mitigatate which means you'll get hit more for minimum damage, but not below. Only AC via agility or +Avoidance items effect your avoidance rate.<br />
<br />
A level 1 skelly hits a lot less than a level 65 skelly for 2 possible reasons. <br />
<br />
1. His attack skills are lower.<br />
2. It's theorized that level itself is used in the formulas.<br />
<br />
If number 2 is true then only 2 things effect a mob or players hit rate, his level and his skill level. (That's not counting the opponents defensive abilities)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Increasing ones AC through items decreases ones chance to get hit for max damage, while also, to a lesser extent, increasing the chance to avoid the attack altogether.<br />
<br />
AC from items and spells NEVER produce avoidance.<br />
<br />
Avoidance comes from only four things:<br />
1) Skills (parry, dodge, riposte, block)<br />
2) Agility &gt;= 75<br />
3) Avoidance mods on items<br />
4) Base CLASS tables of avoidance<br />
<br />
As your AGI increases, your AC increases (because AC as displayed is a combination of avoidance and mitigation.)<br />
<br />
Edit: Since it was later asked, I was answer about the level 1 skeleton.<br />
<br />
The level has been proved to be involved in the hit percentage.  The lower level the mob is compared to your level, the more often it will miss.  The higher level the mob is compared to your level, the more often it will hit.  This has been proved several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>solarax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">vikken i think oyu are missing the point of my post. <br />
<br />
mitigation and extenuation are diferent and we incorrectly use the term mitigate because mitigate means avoidance as per UCMJ article definitions and terms . it really isnt a problem until people start using intracut formula to describe situation for instance parsing which is multiple staged and the definitions need to be clear as possible for better comunication and better proofs. the problem werun into and i saw it on the monk boards was the definitions got a bit muddled because a slight mis comunication.<br />
<br />
just because people miss use a word and it gets firmly ingrained doesnt mean we cant start using a better naming convention but i realize at this time none will change because its just to wide spread. its almost like trying to teach mannars to the youth of today ( some of you old farts like me will know what im talking about)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I understood your point correctly and responded accordingly. Just because the UCMJ defines those words as they do, does not mean it should be so elsewhere. Those terms were defined in the UCMJ for the purposes of legal terminology. Definition in legal documents and proceedings are commonly used in other places also, however, a definitoin in a legal document does not proceed other definitions except within its bounds. The fact that legal documents  commonly use definition is reconition that a word can have other equally valid meanings. Definition does not exist without scope. In thise case, mitigation and extenuation definition in the UCMJ is limited to the scope of the UCMJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm retired Infantry.What does that have to do with EQ?<br />
<br />
Webster's Mitigate - to soften,to make less severe or painful,to alleviate or extenuate...<br />
<br />
Sounds right to me.Not to mention this is a clearly understood term by many eq players in common usage for quite awhile.<br />
<br />
Mitigation - how well you lessen the damage of hits.<br />
Avoidance - not mitigation in eq terminology.Rather,your chance to cause complete misses.<br />
<br />
Your code of service discipline's choice of wording has nothing to do with eq.These words as used now are plain , easy to understand and in common usage.Why play with them to imitate your paricular administration?Not that anyone would be likely to adopt new terminology for such a reason.Remember KISS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First of all, this thread is retarded.  You can't just start making up definitions of words, or decide how you want to define them.  That's not your job, someone else already has that job, and he wrote a dictionary.  Lets use those definitions, k?<br />
<br />
Second of all <br />
<br />
If this is so, then increasing AC will not increase your avoidance %. <br />
<br />
This is 100% true.  I don't know what else you're trying to say in your post, and quite frankly I think you're confusing yourself, but go take your warrior and let a decaying skeleton whoop on you for a few hours.  Remove your armor.  Rinse and repeat, and you will find that he hits you the exact same percentage of times as he did when you were clothed.<br />
<br />
You can not mitigate a hit to zero.  Avoidance is avoidance.  Mitigation is AC.  They are seperate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You understood me correctly, I thought increasing AC through +AC items would improve avoidance after a certain point after mitigation benefits had moved all hits it minimum. I assumed this was the way it works since I found it hard to believe, and against intuition, that the maximum benefit of mitigation AC could only move all hits to minimum (DI + DB for standard hits). <br />
<br />
I've yet to find a thread proving conclusively that this is the case, and not just an assumption made from parses setup analyze other combat mechanisms. So, I took it upon myself to try an gather this information in a formal manner.<br />
<br />
I've already run 2 tests against the same subject with sample sizes of 5000 hits. I was unhappy with the variances that I saw, so I will be running the tests again tonight. My first runs were with 104 agi, 800AC, and the 1200AC. I forgot that I was wearing a parry mod cloak, and due to itemization, I had a hard time find a selection of gear that would give me an adequate range of AC tests at the same agi.<br />
<br />
I'm running the new tests now, first with 600AC, 1 agi (all agi, and hopefully, all avoidance AC with it, removed by using encumberance), then I'll run again with 1200AC. Both will have sample sizes of 10,000 hits.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this is remove all doubt as to what the AC on items does, and that is mitigation. I'll be posting the results in another thread, that can hopefully then be moved to the library.</div></div><hr />

I know you've only been around for a couple of months, but trust me, this has already been done.  This board just isn't old enough to catalog all the data we learned years ago and then got pushed off the EZboard TSW before we could preserve it.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if it's in the library or not, but this has been determined to be governed essentially by only three things: your weapon skills, your AA's, and the mob's relative level (or skills, which are based on level).<br />
<br />
Even in Luclin, where melee performs terribly, I think our miss% is the same as everywhere else.</div></div><hr />

I hope you mean to do the 1200 ac parse with 1 agi also?  Otherwise you will find a difference in avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aramir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">From dictionary.com:<br />
<br />
mitigate:  To moderate (a quality or condition) in force or intensity; alleviate.  To become milder.<br />
<br />
avoid: to keep from happening.<br />
<br />
These two words seem to be totally adequate for the discussions when their common meanings are used.  A specific UCMJ definition would only serve to cause more confusion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Impossible you say?<br />
<br />
 You can not mitigate a hit to zero. <br />
<br />
This is the most basic premise of Calculus...a limit can approach a value but can not obtain it...so you can mitigate a number infinitely but it will always have a value (in this case approahing but not reaching zero).  So in essence in appear great minds think alike...although separated by 500 years (well minus all the apple stuff).<br />
<br />
Yeah but this has as much relevance as the rest of this ass-hat thread. Military manual definitions (UCMJ= Uniform Code Of Milirary justice?) of legal terms...come on already :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, except that I couldn't reach 1200AC @ 1AGI with my current gear, so 1100 will have to do. Yes, that means that when I say 600AC and 1100AC, I mean exactly those values. I'm anal like that sometimes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've finsihed the 600AC parse with 12000 hits, I had to leave town while the 1100AC test ran, but it was at 6000 when I left. If the client doesn't crash I should come back to an amazingly large sample.<br />
<br />
Preliminary analysis does comfirm that AC has no effect on avoidance. I'll be back home in Monday to finalize the numbers.</div></div><hr />
