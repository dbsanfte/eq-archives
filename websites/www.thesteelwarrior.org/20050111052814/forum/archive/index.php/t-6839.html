I do agree there is a problem with the tankability of the class types.<br />
<br />
I believe the answer should be in AC values.  In GoD I know we warriors have found AC invaluable compared to hp (not factoring in defensive or anything like that)<br />
<br />
So hopefully they make AC more and more Valuable, in which spells could provide viable tanking ability by providing paladins with a higher AC then Warriors, Shadowknights could recieve a similiar ability with perhaps less AC, but more DS built in.<br />
<br />
By making mobs and encounters more reactive to AC values you'll fix alot of the inequalities with the tanking classes and other classes.  <br />
<br />
oh, and then dresss wearers will get plastered like they ought to.</div></div><hr />

Shadowknights already have a rather nice spell to boost their ac, providing it's not resisted(which is uncommon, -50 disease adjust).</div></div><hr />

Before we try and add to that, lets give them a chance to make it work.</div></div><hr />

(Granted, for my AC level my HP pretty low) AC definatly helps for average DPS, i can notice difference I think, but deadly one or two rounds can still come</div></div><hr />
