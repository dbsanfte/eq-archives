This appears to be the GoD quest BP. In Abysmal Sea there are NPCs of every class who give you some items to obtain and they will craft armor for you. Vadd is the warrior NPC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
You know, the weight thing may force a few monks to eventually get Packrat. Fine, whatever. But 20 weight on a WARRIOR BP when by the time a warrior gets it, he or she is well past the point of caring about armor weight?<br />
<br />
Get a new trick Sony. The packrat one isn't gonna work.</div></div><hr />

Nobody's found even minor pieces like bracers and boots, let alone a bp.  They listed the class bps in a patch message recently (kind of a blunder there).  Pretty easy for a persistent person with time on their hands to mine a link once they have the item name.<br />
<br />
I think the patch message listing those bps said they'd had the Cleave effect (presumably III) removed.  Supposedly Cleave is being fixed and will be put back on items.  Kinda odd there isn't an Echo of Anger type effect on it as well though - guess they didn't really finish up the item.  That or they thought Raex BP was too overpowered.</div></div><hr />

And for any warrior to even get close to getting this he has to be in one of the top guilds on the server.  I know a druid on my server that has gotten the druid abysmal tunic but I havent seen links for the minor pieces so thats kind of puzzling.  The druid tunic has more hp than the time bp for warriors and has around 53 ac i think.  Its pretty nice with an effect for their dots.  Since the effect cleave was removed it has no effect but they will probably put an effect back onto it in the near future when warriors start getting them and complain.</div></div><hr />

Yes, he did. You can find it right there in the thread TOPIC:<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what just popped up on Lucy &quot;<br />
<br />
JUST POPPED UP on Lucy. The lucy database. Fished out of a database. It's made ... with drops ... from zones that if you poke around, you'll realize no one likely has access to yet.<br />
<br />
So before YOU start to know-it-all-bash, consider maybe reading a thread's topic as you click on the letters?</div></div><hr />

I wondered... will they put END on WAR (or MNK or ROG) only gear from previous expansions? I mean, Velious, Kunark or PoP. It has been stated that they will put END on existing items... whats better than putting them on gear that is only for meeles?... isnt that the most logic idea? Since this BP is a quested one and class specific, just like all those others.<br />

Btw Grimmlokk, that sign cracks me up every single time I see it :D</div></div><hr />

I know it was mined. Almost everyone here knows it was mined. But someone felt the need to attack me. I bit back.<br />
<br />
The data popped up because it was mined. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out.<br />
<br />
Or is someone gonna post some proof that it wasn't mined? That'll shut me up. In the meantime, it's right in there with Staff of Shattered Dreams.<br />
<br />
Besides ... Raex's was mined out of the database long before anyone ever set foot in an elemental zone. It's all part of the &quot;gimmick.&quot; SOE didn't even try to shut down item mining in PoP until after the &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;aaah&quot; factor had died down.<br />

<br />
follow this link:  http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newitems.html?type=new<br />
<br />
Lucy has this page up of the newest items collected, thats where I first saw it, tonight there is a link of the same BP bouncing around as well as the 70/35 halberd (with augment in it).. which leads me to believe they were not mined...  Who cares if it even was mined, perhaps someone in one of the big uber guilds actually got a BP in Yxtta or Qvic already?  Its not an impossible thought seeing how fast some guilds are ripping past the flagging parts of kod'taz already...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say it wasn't mined? Prove it. People have been mining links since the expansion was launched.<br />
<br />
Regarding Lucy ... well ... gee ... what's Lucy famous for? Or have you not noticed the Opening Skills are STILL listed in the database, but don't exist in game?<br />
<br />
I don't really CARE that it was mined or not. But people got on my shit. So I give it right back. Many of these links you see floating around are MINED. There's even a thread on this very message board detailing how to mine and manipulate item LINKS. But hey ... whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clerics have had a pair of group resist (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4050&amp;source=Live) spells (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4049&amp;source=Live) in the spell database since pre-ldon, that don't yet exist in the game. Mages waited a long time for their luclin pet heal to go from an entry in the spdat to actually in-game.<br />
<br />
Hopefully mined, since it's not much of an improvement over Raex. Adding Improved Riposte 2 or 3 and a taunt mod would make it a more solid choice (though probably not enough for someone to give up echo of anger). If it's mined, don't expect the final version to be the same as what's on lucy now; the original mined Raex BP had 190hp and click avatar.<br />
<br />
What I find odd is that the person who submitted the Vadd BP also submitted the original, mined, Raex BP.</div></div><hr />

Actually they do exist in the game.  I still have them all and I can put them into my combat window.  I just never get any openings anymore :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
In addition, if I understand Dima's posts on creating item links, it's not really possible (or at least, not feasible) to &quot;mine&quot; for links anymore since they made some changes to the linking system to prevent it. If you do know how to mine the DB for items, tell Dima, he would really like to know.</div></div><hr />

Not on my server they don't. Your server and my server have a slightly different makeup.<br />

<br />
Yes and no.  Given that you meant the LUCY/alla tool and not the Magelo tool ;) ... the LUCY tool will collect your items, and also vendor items when you shop, or stuff you click on from /ooc links, etc.  So a mined link, shouted and passed around, could wind up in the LUCY database.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Job search is getting depressing. Too much time for everquest has made the game more annoying. Kind of odd how that works out, eh? I used to think I never had enough time to raid, play, level, etc. Now I've got what I wanted, tons of time ... and eh, it's not all it's cracked up to be.<br />
<br />
Plus this thread just pushed my buttons wrong. I actually don't mind when people dig up or mine links. It's always fun to see new stuff. It's just I've been following what little Gates progress is out there and have seen no one completing any of the armor quests yet. So I was skeptical of it being a link from an actual in-game item.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong a little skepticism, right? I mean, the items is what it is. And if no one has one right now, it's not that big a deal. Sometime in the very near future, this quest will get completed. And these BP's will be out there. So that part don't bother me.<br />

I don't have any problem with you saying it was mined (via item links or someone smart enough to run some tool against the EQ client), however you stated that 'the original poster' (who is me on this thread...) mined it, when all i did was link an item saw on the lucy new item page. <br />
<br />
Furor's comment in the overlord forum about this item, if true, also mean the actual item should turn out to be superior than this one appears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't say you mined it. If I gave that impression with anything I wrote, it was definitely a mistake on my part.<br />
<br />
I was trying to say it &quot;popped up&quot; into the Lucy database because someone mined it. That someone, I didn't think was you. People pass around links like crazy these days. I just figured someone mined it ... it got passed around ... and ended up in the database.<br />
<br />
Anyways, sorry this whole thing got derailed and totally twisted out of control. It's an interesting BP. And no matter where the links come from, I think we all get a thrill out of seeing the new items.</div></div><hr />
