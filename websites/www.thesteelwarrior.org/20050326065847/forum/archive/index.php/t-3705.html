The xp is slowing dow here, and I was wondering where I should head to next. My magelo is here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=744031). Right now I'm looking for more xp then money, but money is always a good thing. I'm also guildless, so I always hunt in pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

Reason why?  They're split enough that you can solo a little there plus you get dungeon bonus.  pp for the fine steel weps and coin drops.  Only bad think is the run to the bank.  You can sell though in the zone.<br />

EDIT:  Holy Crap!  Ninja how that little frog guy in your sig know all that stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">being an iksar warrior myself i did alot of kunark zones since it was before pop and travel was really tough, not to mention there werent alot of places to sell/bank. i stayed &quot;home&quot; until around lvl 40-45 when i really stared traveling.<br />
OT you can get pretty good exp until 40 if you get a decent group to chain pull. when i ran through i made sure i was puller to ensure the mobs stayed on me and to make sure the pulls kept coming. you can probably get one of those arrow summoning pouches and a decent ranged bow and pull near the SF zone, top of the hill to the FM zone, the corner between the 2 zones, or the 3 sarnack runes near the trench. each of those camps you can easily keep mobs rolling in with arrows and sow.<br />
CoM is really good exp until 40, but i havent been there since they added more content and you'd need a more well rounded group, not to mention it an adventure just getting out there. <br />
FV has a few nice spots, but you'd have to get past those dracnids who usually have sow and damage shield and traveling through SonH is usually hopeless unless you really know your way around, might be diffreent now with the LoY maps.<br />
solA/B would be jsut about the same as CoM, need a well rounded group and a decent puller.<br />
EJ you can probably do with a small group, but no one really groups there as much as the more accessable zones, again, that might be different with the PoP portals, i wouldn't really know anymore.<br />
Crystal Caverns i hear is pretty good if you do geonide, never went there myself at the approite lvls, but they drop lower lvl gems at a rather common rate which are good for cash. spider caves are also pretty good exp and usually easy to pull.<br />
Dawnshround is pretty standard, usually a couple of groups spread out there, i personally dont like the exp, feels a little slow and the mob traffic seems patchy in spots (lots of mobs one second then nothing a min later).<br />
<br />
personally, i like the earlier dungens better for exp. the mobs usually have lower hp than the newer exp zone mobs and are more likely to be grouped in more consistant lvl ranges. indoor zones also have mobs closer together so you dont have to run around too much for mobs and also have dungen exp bonuses. of course the draw back would be that if you get a bad pull you cant realy run unless your close to the zone and it can be harder to find a safe spot to set up camp.</div></div><hr />
