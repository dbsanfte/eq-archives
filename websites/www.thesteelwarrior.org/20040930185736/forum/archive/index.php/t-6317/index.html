<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As some people have reported in the thread in the Tavern about the update on 3/23 that requires DX9 <br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6287<br />
<br />
There are definately some quirks to the new collision detection.<br />
<br />
This led to some serious complications when corning boss mobs last night in Ssra Temple.  My guild did both Arch Lich and Emperor and in all cases where we cornered the mob (Exiled, Arch Lich and Emperor) where we had a significant raid force behind them whacking away, pets, etc. the mob WENT INTO THE WALL!<br />
<br />
The worst problem with this was on the Emperor where, once pushed into the wall (corner off to the right of his throne where we always fight him) is that he summoned the MT into the wall as well which caused him to be ported to the &quot;safe spot&quot; and end up at the zone in.<br />
<br />
So, be wary when corning mobs - they might just go right through the corner!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks to finding that post moments before engaging the Emp last night I tanked him in the middle of the room which worked fine. <br />
<br />
Did a full VT clearance last night too and the only time we had an issue was on TVK. He summoned the first tank into the wall and under the earth. Then I took over and FELL through the wall without being summoned. Nearly cost us a complete wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same thing happened in BoT all night last night...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, same stuff happening all over nameless. We raided ssra last night, and the same stuff was happening. Many other guilds wiped all over the place, and most as a result of dx9.<br />
<br />
Also, auto-duck whenever you get too close to a wall, player, npc, etc etc sucks.<br />
<br />
I bet SOE fixes this next week, and calls it the &quot;Conclusion of melee part 2.&quot; Just wait and see...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skurge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We kept pushing the Avatard of Smoke through the wall in Plane of Air last night.  Took a good 2 minutes to get him out and centered instead of walled.  MT also fell through the world once.  We had a monk landsharking for a bit also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was up in BoT with my main last night doing the Towers.  Had a mob pushed through a wall and was hard to get him to come back.  After that we had our MT and our main Cleric both fall through the wall and end up under the world.  We tried several times to CoTH them back to us but it didnt work.  We ended up having the warrior and cleric duel, warrior leting the cleric win, and then trying to summon the corpse back out from under the world.  It didnt work.  Kinda ruined our raid for the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Braddox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Has anyone tried the rz event since the patch?  I am curious if these same problems are occuring in tactics.  We did emp last night, but we were aware of the cornering problems there so we just pinned him against the wall and had no issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">stickied for now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ernie... not trying to bust your bubble or anything, because I'm having the same issues (took a 20k fall in ssra earlier when i got summoned into a wall then fell to basement) <br />
<br />
but how do you cornertank a perma-rooted mob like AL? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">did ginto, fennin, water, coirnav no problems other than arrow lag from the wall they created and would not go away and mobs warping. Fennin warping on to me was interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braddox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since I hadn't heard about any issues with rz or tactics we decided to go ahead and try it.  We had one mob pushed into the wall in the tz fight area.  We had one person fall through the wall.  And finally, rztw warped to me on pull and ended up getting pushed into the wall during the fight.  I managed to get him out of the wall but I wasn't able to corner him after that and it caused range issues for casters.  So, unless todays patch fixes the issue, yes tactics and rztw can be added to the list of mobs and zones affected by the collision problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">While i have noticed the problems in BoT, we did plane of time yesterday, and killed inny on the first try ever =P much better when you can wall him and still range attack =P<br />
<br />
However for bot, i fell underworld about 3 times, whilest fighting Named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think it is safe to say this is happening everywhere. I've seen mobs pushed in to walls everywhere from BoT to LDoN to Time. There is a glitch in the collision detection system, until that is sorted we'll just have to be careful corner tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol, aye, everywhere.<br />
I met a true first-character new player the other day who was also very polite (talk about rare spawns!), so I hopped on my lvl 4 beastlord mule and we went to Blackburrow.<br />
On the Qeynos Hills side, at least, wandering gnolls would warp into the walls. Sometimes you could slide along the wall autoattacking and kill them, but they'd die in there, so you couldn't loot them. But mostly they'd just vanish and we'd have to sit down and wait for them to regen up and return to hit us some more. Been a while since I've fought in Blackburrow, hehe, but I don't think they used to do that.<br />
A bit confusing for the new guy, who wondered how exactly you're supposed to kill mobs that just disappear into walls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">DiD Bot Plate tower last night and didn't push anything through the wall at all.<br />
<br />
In fact, the new cornering Dynamic worked like a charm. The ranger pwned the hell out of Eindride the whole time Melee were pushing the mob into the corner.<br />
<br />
By the way, Mobs don't go even close to where they were before, so going all the way back into the corner leaves you at the edge of their target rings.<br />
<br />
So try inching forward a little :)<br />
<br />
Liking Collision Detection a lot more now.<br />
<br />
The rewind thingy doesnt bug me too much, but have gotten bounced to the bottom of the world once.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think this is on all zones. We were in Greigs cornering him on the stairs.  Three - four people where sucked into the wall and ported back to entrance. Good thing that he droped the BP's and they couldnt use them. But we also had a problem with those 12 adds. Normaly we dont have a problem getting 1-3. Depending on how manny warriors we have on raid. But when we had our 3 the rest of them would warp into the room right as the first 3. Not all just 6 at a time. Was verry wierd. made for a fun raid IMO~. I cornered all of my mobs that i had. Had no problem of going in the wall tho. Just people getting sent back to entrance while fighting Greig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just another confirmation - Bertox (Time) warped into the wall last night, stuck, and nobody could damage him. Then he warped somewhere completely out of sight and stayed gone for ~30+ seconds, regenerating a good chunk of his hp in the process, before he decided to warp back to the middle of the guild and continue the fight. It was... interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Guardian cats in HoHb do the &quot;fall through wall, summon MT to bottom of world, thus warping MT to zone in&quot; trick.<br />
<br />
Seru is completely hosed now.  The entire zone pauses for 20-30 seconds at random times.  Chat still works, but PCs and NPCs are frozen.  Seru also has a &quot;south park'esque&quot; animation and goes right through walls.</div></div><hr />

When I got tired of waiting for a GM I incited one of the fire elementals in the first tower room so he came down and beat my ass.<br />
<br />
Now, since I had already fallen victim to the stupid collision detection problem, why couldn't I be lucky enough to get the &quot;mob kills you and you appear at bind with all gear and no xp loss&quot; bug too?</div></div><hr />

They were doing well, had him down to maybe 1/3rd of his health and were still in great shape to finish him.  Then he warped back to his spawn point and started summoning.  Woot.  <br />
<br />
Any idea when they're going to fix this sh**?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Did Bertox last night, the MA was having lots of problems cornering the kings, the corner kept pushing him out.  Interesting thing is, I ended up tanking 4 or 5 of the kings and I never once had a single problem with the corner...wedged myself in, looked up, raid pushed him to me, and king died no problem.  The weirder thing about this is, our MA is a dorf and I am a Barb...I was only shrunk 2x, no illusion.   He didn't have a problem with Bertox himself tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We attempted bertox last night too, didn't habe a huge problem cornering kings, one warped in the wall and came out a few seconds later. On bertox we had him down at about 40% when he decided to warp into the wall and summon the MT oor of heals. While in the wall we could not melee or nuke him, but he had no problem eating us alive one by one since nobody could get aggro on him. He finally came out of the wall about 30 seconds later, half the raid force was dead and he had a grand time feasting on what was left. Just for fun somebody /peitioned we were just raiding bertox and he's  using that new DX9 exploit to kill us all, HAELP!  Guide actually responded and pretended he had never heard of the wall warping issue and said he would bump it up to a GM for us....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Braddox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Bleh thats bad news.  My guild is in vt tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">VT aint that bad just A. keep mobs off walls. B. Keep mobs off walls C Keep mobs.... Get the idea im sure :p<br />
In regards to Seru I love his new waddle, think his legs got fused together in a freak accidnet or something. I did not have any issue wedging him in on the pillar I use, did you try using the corner? I use the 2nd pillar  from door facing him to right coming in. Never have had a problem even with dx9 BS pinning him in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Braddox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">VT was horrible for us.  Mobs were warping all over.  It was like every melee on the raid was using a knockback weapon.  It was impossible to keep a mob directly in front of me.  We only did blob 1 and cleared a bit towards the next named before the servers were brought down.  I can honestly say I was relieved.  That was the most miserable raiding experience I've ever had in terms of simply trying to melee a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fafnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My halfling cleric bot fell through the wall in Ssra last night (in the tunnel where most folks camp C1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Turgan7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I had the same problems in LDoN. Mobs got pushed back as if I used a massive knockback weapon. Constantly got OOR messages and if I stepped foreward to get closer it just get pushed further. Never had those problems before DX9 patches and didn't change weapons since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>AnielaCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">We did Thalls in VT last night, and tank couldn't get into the corner, no matter what.  Then we went to PoHate and did Inny, he kept warping all over the place, and one tank got thrown to safe spot. &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
Funny tho, we have done VT after the original dx9 patch and had no problems... well apart from mini aten trying to go through the wall. O_o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Torment, on 4/1, was still bad, but much improved.  Cornering was not possible, but I only fell through the floor once when summoned in a corner (and was conveniently summoned back up).  I held Saryrn in a corner of her room without incident.  Running up stairs in her tower while shrunk was still a difficulty though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">4/1/04 Kubanyr Hailstorm in Wall Again, 3 tanks got popped out to GY.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">We did Emperor in Ssra last night, our MT got shoved through the wall, fell for over a minute, then landed at zone in.<br />
<br />
It's one thing for cornering to have changed with the changes to collision, etc, but people falling through geometry is just a bad bug.<br />
<br />
There's no excuse for this, and it needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I agree Ayida; We can deal with no cornerring if we have to, but the pushing through walls is total BS.  In the last two weeks we've had numerous times where people have been pushed through walls. In Sol Ro's chamber last night we had 10 people get stuck on top of the trap door; they sunk half way through it and were not able to lev or jump out even with grow.  Later I was MT'ing LMM with a wall pin and apparently my foot went through the wall and no heals or bard song landed..Half my guild is considerring quitting eq over this garbage.<br />
<br />
The fact that Sony ignored the reports from Test server and put this Live is inexcusable.  And not a word from them acknowledging that they realize the problem exists and are working to correct it.<br />
<br />
Hard to believe the developers are so out of touch at a time when they should be trying to improve the game to prevent migration to WoW when it goes live.<br />
<br />
After 5 years of being a dedicated EQ player, I'm at my limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">One thing that is rather much more important than the cornering problem I discovered last night....I finished up Sol Ro flagging the other night on my cleric.  I went to do the hailing in the library in PoK, and I was unable to use the elevator.  Every single time I tried, the elevator would go up, but I would stay put.....as in I was &quot;falling thru&quot; the floor of the elevator.  I was unable to do the hailing, thus unable to complete the Cipher of Druzzil and get the flags neccessary to enter Sol Ro, even tho all else was in order.   Minor inconvenience when it's my alt cleric, but what happens when my guild kills RZtW (should be soon now) and NONE of them can finish their elemental flagging cause nobody can get to the Grand Librarian?   This I would call a bit more than a minor inconvenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">April 2nd, did Guardian of the Seal in the Hole, and all was normal in regards to cornering.  Then, moved on to Grieg, and it was completely fubar.  Had ppl falling thru the world on the way to grieg's room, corpses popping a few minutes later at ZO.  While fighting grieg himself, about a bit less than 1/2 or so of the raid  got popped to zone-in, one by one.  Shortly thereafter, grieg himself fell through the world.  Some ppl still had him on track, but was out of range, and nowhere to be seen, jumped back up to 100%, from around 85% or so.. didn't regen quickly, just jumped instantly.   A few moments later, he was back in his room at 100%, and a few seconds after that, he warped back onto what was left of the raid on the stairs, and wiped us.  We called it a night after that :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Have had problems corner tanking mobs ever since the new collision system came live.  On what was to be our second Emp kill in ssraa, Everything was going sweet.  I had solid aggro, was working him toward the corner.  Heal rotation was solid.   Spam healers for the 4k dd was on the ball.  I had called assist and it was only a matter of time before he dropped.   Flawless execution by the whole guild.  I get him into the corner, he gets pushed THROUGH me and into the wall, summon's me into the wall, and I get punted to the ZL.  Same thing for the ST, and the TT.  So then at 60% life, during what would have gotten the rest of the guild VT flagged, he proceeded to kick everyones arse.<br />
<br />
Last night on Cursed Cycle, I couldn't get Cursed corner tanked either.  He would get shoved too far through me and I couldn't hit him, and he would turn around and face the rest of the guild.  SO to keep aggro on me I stepped out from the corner and onto one of the side walls.<br />

I do not know why they messed with something that really wasn't broken in teh first place rather than fixing things that WERE broken......typical SoE.</div></div><hr />

I've tried corner tanking in earth(where I worked myself over the invisible corner cutoff and ending up falling through the earth) tactics and ssra so far and haven't been succesful yet.

<br />
We did Vex Thall 2nd floor last night (yay! 2nd AHR kill for us!).  I tanked for some of it as we did our usual &quot;everyone gets in the game&quot; rotation through tanks.  The guy before me and the gal after me had some trouble cornering.  They were either vah shir form, skelly form, or half elf, all max shrink.<br />
<br />
I'm a gnome.<br />
<br />
I was able to corner tank robes and 4 arms, but they were basically standing right on top of me.  I was looking up, while walking backwards into the corner, but I could hit them and their back was to the raid force.  Same with Mini-Aten (ohh the view!) and the 1 aten blob I tanked.<br />
<br />
However, on the 2nd aten blob we did, switched over to Lady Kaelynai (max shrink half elf Warrior) and she couldn't hit the blob when she was in the corner.<br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt; guess we need to get everyone a few gnome potions!  :D <br />
<br />
Everything I've tried to corner since the 4/14 patch I've been able to: Giants in BoT, Ogre's 'n stuff in Tactics, occassional stuff in LDoNs that get pushed into a corner and Vex Thall, so workin ok for me.<br />
<br />
I guess your mileage varies by what race you are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I found large models like RZ, and MM are very east to corner tank now, but smaller models tend to get pushed past me. My biggest complaint now is on crowded raids I tend to get stuck on every freaking person in the raid, if I walk too close to them I get stuck and and need to sit before I can move again, it's hell running though a crowd trying to get to a mob than needs some tankin!</div></div><hr />

At the cost of a buffslot you get a 3 hour NPC illusion (clips through players) that's already tiny.  Oh and 65 atk isn't bad...</div></div><hr />
