<br />
Personally I think aggro-lock shouldn't be in the game at all - Not for any class where working to gain aggro is a good thing, heh. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, So long as any tank class can virtually garantee aggro, there will never be 'balance'. Heck, if it's dangerous to use a single tank 'cause the slow can't land early thats one more reason to add an extra tank player as backup isn't it?<br />
<br />
Loss of aggro lock would no longer cripple a knight imho since they can tank pretty damn good, maybe that favours warriors slightly more for the prime tank slot (that is all we do after all  ) but if grouping a second tank makes good sense then the extra abilities the knight can also bring to the table suddenly got a whole lot more useful for LFG purposes.....and they're still perfectly reasonable tanks in the absense of a warrior. This isn't kunark anymore, the difference in tankability is far less glaringly obvious than it was back than.<br />
<br />
Perhaps abilities would continue to need tweaking etc but as a basic model this makes a whole lot more sense to me than giving aggro near enough to knights that we can compete with thier aggro lock, thus perpetuating the 'single tank, no danger' methodology thats prevalent atm.... and causing so much competition for that single slot...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMO they need to pick one.  Either no tank should have good aggro control, or all of them should.  I think it's pretty obvious they aren't going to re-instate our former advantage in mitigation/avoidance.  In the absense of that we should either be given equivalent INNATE aggro generation ability, or knight aggro generation should be nerfed to be on par with ours.  Simple solution?  Set knight taunt = warrior taunt, remove all aggro from knight spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If knights don't have better agro capabilities they lose their primary group function.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Knights being second-class warriors?<br />
<br />
In case you didn't know knights are supposed to be less than warriors in all things melee.<br />
<br />
SK's can already pull ( Important job that is not tanking omg!! ) and they can do it damn well. With spiffy tools that let them do it, such as harmshield and FD. So they have something to offer to a group when not tanking ( or while tanking in some cases ).<br />
<br />
Paladins have &quot;less&quot; useful things such as root, rez, buffs and healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to mention that stuns wouldn't cease to have utility - they'd just be used for their intended purpose - stopping a mobs attacks whilst gaining aggro via other means.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't get me wrong, I think knights should be significantly better at aggro control than warriors.<br />
<br />
Being able to lock aggro permanently on every single mob for near zero mana cost, while many people won't invite a warrior to group because they're scared of dying to ping-pongs is kind of unbalanced though.<br />
<br />
Trivial aggro lock lets casters ignore aggro control almost entirely, which isn't good for the game as a whole never mind tank class balance.<br />
<br />
If your SK or paladin locks aggro on a mob so everyone can unload full blast nukes on it, he should have to med a couple of minutes or so afterwards.<br />
<br />
It's kind of like giving warriors permanent /disc defensive with no timer or aggro penalty, then leaving it that way so after a few months no healer would agree to group with a knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can see the idea of leaving SK's with the ability to generate aggro almost as well as they can now - an utter lock still seems a bit much - with the previso that it be an ability that they grant to another tank thus the group trades off 'safe' aggro generation with tank DpS....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Val stirring things up is always a fun thing:) .  A couple comments from this thread I think sum things up very well from my point of view:<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
IMO they need to pick one. Either no tank should have good aggro control, or all of them should. <br />
<br />
I think agro lock(or as near as knights are to it now) is a bad thing for the game, but either way, at least balance it out some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With aggro as it stands Dakkin I'm not even sure giving a warrior permanent defensive mitigation would actually over weigh the advantage of locking aggro in a group...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The people who want agro the least, should be the best at getting it.<br />
<br />
The people who want agro the most, should be the worst at getting it.<br />
<br />
Robes should generate the most agro, followed by leathers, followed by chains, followed by clerics and bards, followed by knights and warriors.<br />
<br />
What is unbalanced on this list?  Knights are significantly better than warriors at generating agro when they should be similar to warrior at it.  They should have to use taunt to get agro, IMO.  Knights have incredible spell utility and decent tanking ability.  That is all fine to me, if they had the same problems getting agro as warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Robes should generate the most agro, followed by leathers, followed by chains, followed by clerics and bards, followed by knights and warriors. <br />
<br />
Knights excluded, that's how it is already.  A Mage pulling a mob with Firebolt of Tallon (2000 damage bolt) will hold agro even through a shaman slowing it or a druid snaring it in transit.  The difference is that the mage will immedietly die and the paladin will not. :)  A mage could never, unless very lucky, channel FoT while tanking a mob.  <br />
<br />
Point being though, you take away agro lock from a Knight and you take away their existance of being a class.  Shadowknights reverting to pulling?  Pfft, gimme a break.  A monk, ranger, druid, cleric, bard, and necromancer can do that job as well, and not to mention that not every camp requires a special pulling technique.  Even a warrior can pull most camps these days with a good arrowshaft down the mob's throat.  And paladins playing medic?  Any cleric/shaman in the group can already do that with ease.  <br />
<br />
Also, agro lock is just simple mathematics.  You either have agro or you do not.  I really can't see any other way to change that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did you miss the part where Hulanta said that knights are the exception there?  Or did you gloss over that part?  Knights are the only caster class (spells give agro) that can take the punishment practically as well as a warrior.  Agro from spells ISN'T the downside that's intended in most cases, only in very few.  Whine over those diciplines as much as you care to, just remember knights have other ways to counter it.<br />
<br />
Point being though, you take away agro lock from a Knight and you take away their existance of being a class.  The only class I know of designed around agro control now is the shadowknight, and using the spells designed for it that takes a lot of mana.  Check any official guide for paladins tho and you'll see no mention of agro.  Agro certainly isn't the be-all end-all about any of these two classes, one look at their spell lineup will show you just everything they can do(because you ARE judged by everything you can do, no matter how much you choose to use them).  Saying a paladin, at least, is worthless without agro lock is like saying a shaman is worthless without the ability to slow. (Provided you actually took the time to learn anything about shamans other than that they can slow)  Try educating people about your abilities rather than desperately cling on to the one thing you know they understand, no matter how unbalanced that may be.<br />
<br />
[B}And paladins playing medic?  Any cleric/shaman in the group can already do that with ease.[/b] Then if we ask for paladins to lose heals, it wouldn't affect them at all, would it?  <br />
<br />
Just lower the agro on those spells for Knights.  Is that so hard to see?  Knights will still have superior agro gaining abilities, but it'll be closer to the tanking difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with most of the posts here.  Personally, I don't like the fact that paladins/sks can hold aggro effortlessly and pretty much indefinitely.  I think aggro management is one of the few things in EQ that takes much skill, and trivializing it takes away from the game.  I wouldn't even mind if they had high aggro spells, but they should be mana-intensive enough that they couldn't be used every fight without significant downtime.  <br />
<br />
Paladins and SKs SHOULD be able to tank in experience groups.  If they can't tank in exp groups, they have no role whatsoever.  They should be equally desireable to a warrior, but for different reasons.  This is a tough balance to achieve though, and I don't know how to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on your kidding me right?<br />
<br />
Kinghts are a HYBRID of the WARRIOR class and either a cleric or necro class!<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is that a Knight who is PART warrior should be able to tank better than a FULL warrior? Let me get this through your thick skull they are SECOND CLASS WARRIORS by their defination!<br />
<br />
You know what makes them wanted to groups? They get the added bonus of spells to make up for them not being full fledged warriors! While as it sits they are also wanted because they can aggro lock mobs at will!<br />
<br />
It is complete and total BS that anyone can even imagine that a hybrid class should be able to tank as well as let alone better than its parent class! YES at the moment they do tank better than us. I dont give a hoot that they migrate damage less than us, they ACTUALLY HAVE THE MOB PISSED AT THEM WHICH MEANS THEY ARE TANKING!!!!<br />
<br />
A warrior is suppose to tank mobs, thats it that is our jobs, we have nothing else! I picked a warrior so I could tank mobs for my cleric wife! So let me tank the mobs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sheesh, I think ya'll are making this too complex!<br />
<br />
I'm not going to think any more about this, because I feel I've figured out what the problem is and how to fix it.  I'm sure if they ever do *try* to fix this, they'll do something other than what I see as the fix and screw even more up, but oh well!<br />
<br />
I spent the last 4 days, 18 hours a day, leveling.  I gained 4 levels.  I was making all my groups and maintaining them.<br />
<br />
One day this shaman insisted on bringing his pally friend.  Okay great, no more worrying about casters screwing up.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the pally just stood there, turned on auto attack, and chain casted his stuns.  No longer did we have a situation where casters COULD even screw up.  As a mater of fact, it took away the ability of the casters to make mistakes!!<br />
<br />
Basically broke everything.  Talk about boring!!!<br />
<br />
Anyhow, along comes a lvl 60 warrior.  The pally was lvl 56.  So, ofcourse the warrior takes over the MT job because he has WAY more HP.  The pally get's all pissy and says &quot;I&quot;m not stunning at all.&quot;  When the warrior winds up loosing aggro cause the stupid ass casters were SO USED to the pally aggro, guess what, the pally still dont stun out of spite.<br />
<br />
NEways, fix the friggin stun to be zero aggro and problem solved.  Make the sunts which generate aggro cost HUGE amounts of mana, so that IF they are going to be used for aggro (which is an xploit anyhow if u ask me), they pay for it by being OOM for a while.<br />
<br />
The warrior is the meat shield.  ONLY the warrior should be the primary meat shield and the knights should be there ONLY if the warrior goes dead, LD, warrior is afk and a mob wanders into camp, or to help with aggro if a caster screws up, OR if there's an add an no chanter is in the group (offtanking).<br />
<br />
ANyway, there's my 2 cp.  Paladins *_ExPlOiT_* a game issue by using stuns for something other than what they are intended for thereby trivializing the XP group, for one, and also raid situations.<br />
<br />
To fix, change pally stun aggro so that it's not so attractive of an exploit, or no exploit at all by making the stuns zero aggro or make them cost a whole friggin mana bar to get aggro with them.</div></div><hr />

Paladins *_ExPlOiT_* a game issue by using stuns for something other than what they are intended for...<br />
 <br />
<br />
According to paladins this is the sole intended design of stuns. They were designed exclusively for maintaining extremely large amounts of aggro.<br />
<br />
Now, if you believe that.... <br />

<br />
I'd love to hear a paladin in deep denial state to someone who matters at SOE &quot;Paladins' purpose in any given group is to be the MT and maintain aggro with stuns,&quot; lol that would be hillarious.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I mean come on.  Verant designs a game where agro IS a factor and something which is supposed to be managed.  They've created an environment where tank classes want the aggro and casters do not want the aggro.  Verant intentionally put aggro into the game as a factor for groups to have to deal with.  It makes the game way more interesting.  Who in their right mind would think, for one second, that Verant intended paladins to be the fix for ALL the players' aggro woe's bye using low level spells for what they were NOT intended to do??  Who would honestly believe that verant put in a system where casters have to pay attention to _what_ and _when_ they cast, then create a situation where, if you've got one particular type of tank, you don't have to worry about what and when you cast on the mob?  Why create such an elaborate aggro system and then create a class which can subvert the entire system?  Who's idiotic enough to believe this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This statement is so ignorant it’s not even amusing anymore. Paladins and SKs are tanks, period. They aren’t second class warriors. In an exp group situation, they should be able to perform the role of tank as well as a warrior, but DIFFERENTLY. They give up about 800-1000 (on average) hps, some DPS, and discs (at least useful ones) to gain a spell book. In many situations right now, the knights have the better end of that deal, but that doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t be able to do the job of a tank. Sorry, you don’t have a monopoly on the tank slot in exp groups, and you shouldn’t, and those of you that keep saying you should only serve to further warrior’s developing rep as the new monks (aka, whiny bitches). Don’t give me this crap about “But tanking is all we do, we should be the best at it.” In exp groups, tanking is all SKs and Paladins do as well, they are about as likely to get chosen for their “utility” as a warrior is for their DPS, less actually. When was the last time you stood around and said to your group, “Ok, all we need to fill out this group is a knight for some of that UTILITY!” You are going to have to compete with knights for exp group tank slots, suck it up and deal with it.<br />
<br />
The problem right now is that warriors are an inferior choice for that slot usually, compared to a comparably geared knight, I know this all to well, and have spent far too many hours of my life arguing this on the Paladin board. Warriors need something to bring them back up to parity with knights in exp groups, but if you want to see the return of Kunark, well, forget about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aggro Lock.  I agree knights tank just fine.  Sure, they *might* have a few less HP or AC depending on their gear.<br />
<br />
I thought the point of this thread was the fact that paladins are much more highly sought after because they trivialize aggro management.<br />
<br />
If there's a pally in a group I make and he has anywhere near the HP and AC and level I do, guess who tanks?  That's right, the friggin pally.  Why?  makes more sense.  Sure it's an exploit; however, if the casters screw fido then it's no big deal.  Whereas if I'm the only tank and the casters get aggro, one might die or the whe gorup might be wiped (well, that's how it's supposed to be in the first place!)  Hell I might have 500 more HP than the pally and I'll still let him tank.  Because why?  Casters dont have to worry about aggro.  Because the majority of the casters I find for pickup groups dont wanna think about aggro management, most of them I've played with would prefer the aggro lock of a pally so they can sit back and cast whatever they feel like casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It has nothing to do with casters being &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;ignorant&quot; in my opinion, it's simply more efficient. It's more efficient when a mob can get slowed on inc, and when dps people can go full burn, or shamans can throw a couple of dots because they don't have to worry about aggro. It's not because they are dumb, but because they are smart enough to maximize efficiency. Holding back for a warrior to get aggro = less dps = slower kills = less xp. It has little to do with people not knowing how to play their class, warrior simply don't have the tools to do the job as well as knights right now.<br />
<br />
Using stuns for aggro is hardly an &quot;exploit&quot;, anymore than FD pulling is a exploit. It is an unintended side effect that has evolved into an integral feature. I suppose all the warriors out there using weapons with stun procs for aggro should put them away because it's an exploit, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sorry, you don’t have a monopoly on the tank slot in exp groups <br />

Of course not, we do not have stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Weapons procing stun being nerfed?  I'd sacrifice all weapon procs if paladins had their stun aggro brought inline with what it should be.<br />
<br />
You have a point gimmel.  I'm sure I'm oversimplifying the issue of casters prefering pally's.  But I also think you're wrong.  It's not so cut and dry.  I feel there is more than one factor in choosing a pally over a warrior, all of them centered around stun aggro.  I feel that, from my sampling of casters in groups I've made, casters a.) see the pally as more efficent because of aggro lock and b.) see the pally as an easier time dealing with the XP grind because they can subvert the aggro system.  THere's probably even more reasons why, but both are valid reasons why I've seen casters prefer a pally.<br />
<br />
People not only choose efficiency, but also choose the path of least resistance (the latter being MUCH more typical of human nature).  The path of least resistance is the pally tanking, because suddenly the casters don't have to worry about aggro.<br />
<br />
So you're saying NO casters prefer palies out of laziness?  I got news for you, more than 50 percent of the people around you are prone to laziness.<br />
<br />
But I do agree that there are other factors, such as XP grind efficiancy, which affec the casters preferring the pallies.<br />
<br />
As for stuns being used for aggro being, somehow, not an exploit, I just dont get that at all.  Could you please explain to me how it's not an exploit to subvert an entire (and probably the bulk of) subset of the environmental AI in EQ?  I personally feel FD pulling / splitting is an exploit as well btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Fine, you call it an exploit, I call it smart use of well esablished game mechanics.

Point out where I said they were not tanks???? Oh, If you are refering to the point where I called them second class warriors, they are second class WARRIORS!<br />
<br />
They give up about 800-1000 (on average) hps, some DPS, and discs (at least useful ones) to gain a spell book. <br />
<br />
Hmmm a bit exagerated if you ask me! Seeing how both knight classes can solo, I would say that they cannot be giving up too much!<br />

I have never said anything about nerfing knights. As a matter of fact I have included in many of my post the fact that I did not want to do that. <br />

<br />
We should do it better! I am a one job class, there should be some benifits to me doing that job (seeing how it is my only ability) that is better than someone who is a HYBRID of my class! Now just incase you dont understand let me state this one more time I DO NOT WANT KNIGHTS NERFED, I just want to be able to hold aggro just as well as they can!<br />
<br />
Knight have the ability to tank, hold aggro, heal, group heal, pull, buff and a lot of other things (thats both knight classes rolled all up in one, in case you cant see that) I have well ummm.... lets see... to take a beating WHEN I am actually able to get the mob madder at me than another group member.

<br />
Well, here's what I deem an exploit.<br />
12. You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the in-game &quot;/bug&quot; command or via the eqtesting@soe.sony.com email address.<br />
<br />
Notice this relies on the definition of bug?  Notice how SOE keeps their definition of 'bug' intentionally vague and implies anything which gives you an unintentional benefit?  This would be pally stun no?  As for using /disc, AA abilities, and skills which were *intended* to build aggro, how is that an exploit?<br />
<br />
Also, how is an AoE group an exploit when the ability to AoE is obviously designed into the game (what else are you going to use AoE damage spells for? Are they only supposed to be used when the caster feels suicidal?)  I mean, I could see you arguing that AoE stun and aoe heal could be intended for something else if aoe damage spells weren't in the game.  you *could* use aoe heal to heal a whole group outside of an AoE group.  You *could* use AoE unlimited target stun as an emergency measure while waiting for evac to go off, and I could see that argument being used if there were no aoe damage spells.  You *canNOT* use unlimited target AoE damage spells for anything other than an AoE group and nuking 50 greenies (I used to AoE group a lot with my wizard).  So, there are basically 2, count them 2, situations where a wizard would want to use a PBAOE.  Do you *really* think SOE designed the PBAOE line of spels for situation 2, nukin greenies?  Because AoE unlimited target damage spells are intentional, it kinda shoot down the argument that AoE groups are un-intentional, eh?  I mean, why would they put PBAOE spells in the game just to nuke 50 greenies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Do you honestly think that the designers intended AE taunt as a way to make tank switches trivial? Or as a way (in conjunction with a weaponshield ranger) to build up huge initial agro with very little risk? Or for AE spells to be used to kill 30 mobs at once? Those abilities are not being used in ways that SOE intended, but that doesn’t make them bugs or exploits either. It’s making intelligent use of the tools you have. Is stun agro out of whack? Maybe, but calling it an exploit is just silly. The addition of Cease to the game clearly shows that stun agro was intended for paladins, at least by the time of SoL, and is not just a leftover from inherited cleric spells.</div></div><hr />

Nice how you failed to mention that they are a hybrid of another class as well. They don't get their aggro abilities from their warrior heritage, they get it form their caster heritage. I can pull aggro just as well as a paladin, because paladins get those abilities from my class.

It's pretty obvious what is considered an expoit, and what is not. People get warned and banned for exploits. Features that have been in the game for 4 years and are well established class strategies are not exploits, regardless of whether they are intentional or not. It's bizarre that you still think that FD pulling is an exploit. SOE has made it quite clear that while it was not intended, it is now considered a part of the monk class. Heck they even gave them Rapid Feign to make them better at it. How you can argue it's an expoit at this stage of the game is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

Wait a second.  The 3 mob limit applies to outdoor area's no?  I can still pull 50 friggin mobs at once, today, in a dungeon.  I think the 3 mob nerf was intended to address tradeskill items from outdoor zones being easily attainable by aoe damage to greenies.  I could be wrong on the reason why, but still, they haven't nerfed dungeons to limit you to 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
How do you figure that by nerfing two zones which folks AoE in, they are nerfing all AoEing?  Back when my wiz was level 48 I used to LOVE going to CoM to AoE group.  If you're argument is correct then they should have nerfed CoM, Sebilis, etc.  So, you're saying that because Sony doesn't want you AoE nuke grouping in Acrylia (which just happens to have a bunch of raw matierials for trade skills) and the grey, that Sony doesn't intend AoE nukes anywhere?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but you STILL haven't addressed my statement to defeat my argument.<br />
<br />
Why did sony put massive aoe damage spells in the game if they didn't intend for these spells to be used?<br />
<br />
I already established that there's only 2 uses for these spells.  We are operating under the assmption that SOE didn't intend these spells to be used to wipe out massive amounts of greenies.  So, these spells must be intended to wipe out massive amounts of exp mobs.  Granted, this is an assumption and if you'd like to argue this point first (did sony give wizards PBAOE spells to nuke 50 greenies?  Or, did SoE give wizards PBAOE spells to nuke blue mobs?  If blue, how so because one nuke will wipe them out, they MUST have a group healing and stunning to use these spells if they are to be used on exp mobs), the intention of AoE damage spells by Sony, I'd be glad to go down that path with you ;)  I've done it many times over the past four years :P<br />
<br />
Once you figure out that Pbaoe spells were intended for AoE groups, you'll figure out that the Pbaoe group was intentional because sony intentionally made these spells in the game and they have no other purpose.<br />
<br />
After you figure out that aoe gorups are intentional, can we get back to the point please: Paladins have aggro lock and it's overpowered: )  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Gimmel said:-<br />
<br />
 Paladins and SKs are tanks, period. They aren’t second class warriors. In an exp group situation, they should be able to perform the role of tank as well as a warrior, but DIFFERENTLY <br />
<br />
TANKING has two elements to it - gaining and holding the mobs attention, and taking the damage. It doesn't matter what way you gain the mobs attention, it doesn't matter how you go about mitigating the damage, the only thing people are interested in is the ease with which you perform your tanking function.<br />
<br />
Paladins and SK's back in Kunark were paper tanks, letting them gain aggro was considered very bad because the mobs would take down their hp's very fast in a time when healer mana was a much greater factor in group balance. Fast forward to POP and Knights have been upgraded so that the idea of having one tank is no longer a byword for inefficiency and believe it or not i think that's as it should be. Not only that, but mana is fairly cheap these days in an exp situation, even a 1K difference in hp's adds up to less than 5-10 seconds delay before the cleric casts a heal and thats with the mob slowed, with fights lasting a minute or less the difference in maintenance between a knight and warrior is fairly negligable. <br />
 <br />
There will be no return to kunark. Knights are proving every day that they can tank for exp groups, which is fair enough.<br />
<br />
Given that we can see here that Knights and Warriors have a degree of parity in taking damage lets now turn our attention to the other part of the equation - gaining the mobs attention. It is true to say that control of the mob is the most fundamental need of a tank since if you cannot get the mob to try to hit you it doesn't matter if you have 5000 hps or 50 000.<br />
<br />
Given the speed with which unslowed Pop mob chew's through HP's, slowing at the earliest possible point is very important to a group. As we all know, with a warrior tanking,  slowing on incoming will almost certainly see the slower taking a few rounds of damage every other pull causing inconvenience as the cleric has to waste effort and mana to fast heal that slower, the group needs to reposition, etc etc. If the mob resisted that slow, then not only must the healer waste mana but there is a more than negligable chance that the slower will be looking for a rez.<br />
<br />
Into this situation we place a knight, he is not much more difficult to keep on his feet than the warrior, he can get the attention of a Mob AT RANGE and 9 times out of 10 keep the mobs attention through nukes, Debuffs and slows all before the mob even reaches the group. Since the mob is already slowed before contact, you the cleric don't need to be partucularly careful about heals because the DPS of the mob has been sufficiently neutralised that healing is fairly routine.  <br />
<br />
So lets go back to the second part of your quote, I'll put in bold the part that particularly interests me:-<br />
<br />
<br />
They aren’t second class warriors. In an exp group situation, they should be able to perform the role of tank as well as a warrior  <br />
<br />
Ok, you reckon that Knights should be able to perform the role of tank 'as well' as a warrior. Let me remind you again what 'the role of the tank' is - To control the mob by gaining and keeping aggro and too be able to take the damage that the mob dishes out. <br />
<br />
Knights can take the damage, so can warriors, so we're cool there.<br />
<br />
But hang on, what about the ability of the tank to control the mob?  <br />
<br />
Taking the above examples of the difference in mob control does it not in fact appear that the warrior's performance of the role is by far  Inferior  to the knights?<br />
<br />
Can you seriously tell me that a couple of extra seconds between heals is worth giving up the massive superiority in mob control provided by a knight? <br />
<br />
By your own measure the ability of warriors to 'perform the role of tank' is massively handicapped in comparison with a knight. It's not just neccessary that a knight can tank on a par with a warrior it's damn well important that a warrior can 'perform the role of tank' as well as a knight! For warriors to be balanced with knights it's neccessary for there to be parity in aggro generation as well.<br />
<br />
It's at this point in the arguement that people point to warriors having their special raid function and say that this means that the warrior hybrids should be better in exp groups. Tell me Gimmel, do you think it would be balanced for paladins to be better exp group healers than clerics since they are warrior/cleric hybrids and you as a cleric have a special raid function? What about druids, you could call them a wizard/cleric hybrid really, they nuke but not as well as wizards, they heal but not as well as clerics, why shouldn't they perform better than you in an exp group to make up for their lack of a distinctive raid function? Why don't Beastlords slow and buff better than shamans in an exp situation?<br />
<br />
That wouldn't be balanced though would it?<br />
<br />
Can somebody somewhere please tell me why a warrior being slightly better at tanking than a knight is so terribly wrong? How can the guys who made the choice to have the fancy spells that've been of so much aid to them throughout their play, (I'm talking reduced downtime, ability to travel, ability to solo or escape threatening mobs, stuff like that, not just exping) persuade themselves that they should be better than their full blooded tank parent in all but massively specialised situations? <br />
<br />
What was the point of the sacrifice warriors made to be 'THE TANK' when they are no longer the first choice to step up and take the beating unless it's a freaking GOD you're tanking?<br />
<br />
/deep breath<br />
<br />
ANYWAY, back to the real point of this thread. With damage taking being fairly balanced between knights and warriors, for warriors to regain an even playing field they need similar parity in aggro to knights. <br />
<br />
Because nobody really likes a nerf, most people have put forward the idea of increasing warrior aggro to make it more on par with knight aggro-lock. It's my contention in this thread though that aggro-lock is ultimately bad for the game, it trivialises the management of aggro, trivialises the encounters with mobs since they can be slowed before offering any challenge to the group and generally makes exp. far too 'safe'. Worse still with so many tanks lfg, since the encounters are so safe and the mobs never get away from the tank you only need one guy that's able to take the damage.<br />
<br />
What though, if you were to balance aggro generation by reducing the tanks control down to the level that warriors currently have? If nothing else it would bring an element of skill and risk back into the game and perhaps it might have fringe benefits for tanks in general when lfg.<br />
<br />
No more instant slows without risk, higher chances of your tank taking a dirtnap to an unslowed mob, more effort required from the group to avoid the mobs attention.  This would lead to more mistakes and reactive play wherein greater generalisation of abilities and 'defence in depth' durability wise would be an asset. <br />
<br />
In short more pluses to making use of a second tank type character, especially one like a Knight who's 'fairly' durable and brings additional 'get out of jail' cards to the table. You've got a warrior? hey theres a SK lfg - bit of extra meat can't hurt and he can feign pull too... What ? the warrior had to leave... there's a Pally lfg grab him, the SK can pull and tank, the pally can help with his fast heals to make sure the CH lands, use group heals to keep everyone upright and pull the mob off the slower, and we don't need to worry bout rezzes if things go wrong....<br />
<br />
Given the breadth of additional abilities that knights bring to a group (and hopefully an atmosphere where having a second tank with those abilities makes sense) it doesn't seem unfair for a warrior to be best choice as main tank, it's what we do.<br />
<br />
Chaos is more fun than safety!<br />

This I think is wrong.<br />
<br />
In an ideal world, when I need to fill a tank spot in an exp group, I should not care whether is it is a sk, pal, or warrior. This is clearly currently not the case, knights have a clear advantage right now. Warriors do have a tanking advantage currently, they have a bigger hp pool. This is an advantage, and yes, as a cleric I can tell you it adds up over time. The problem is that currently that advantage is completely overshadowed by the knight aggro advantage. You should be hoping for a balance that looks something like this:<br />
(warrior damage absorption) + (warrior aggro) = (knight damage absorption) + (knight aggro)<br />
You shouldn't have the same aggro control as a knight, but the difference should only be as great as can be made up for by the increased durability of a warrior. Currently that equation is all out of whack.<br />
<br />
When I say warriors and knights should tank differently, I mean that in general the lesser hps of a hybrid should by overcome through the use of heals, stuns, lifetaps, and superior aggro control. Currently either the hps gap isn't big enough, or the aggro control is too great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">(warrior damage absorption) + (warrior aggro) = (knight damage absorption) + (knight aggro)<br />
You shouldn't have the same aggro control as a knight, but the difference should only be as great as can be made up for by the increased durability of a warrior. Currently that equation is all out of whack.<br />
<br />
Hokey, that sounds fine on paper, but answer me this, at what point does not always controlling the mob become  'ok' compared with always controlling the mob? personally if i was a cleric i'd live with a bit more mana cost to be sure i didn't hardly get hit or have to break a sweat healing the other members of the party. With aggro as it is further hp upgrades are fairly meaningless. <br />
<br />
You reckon you've seen a marked difference in warrior vs knight tanking? the figures i've seen don't seem to work with that - assuming joe average buffed warrior has 5.5k hp's, various people in the know have said that equally equipped warriors average around a 10 to 20 % hp advantage (i think) 20% of 5.5k is 1100 hps which sounds good on paper, but given mob damage output how many extra rounds does it take to knock that off - also given that people generally start to cast CH at around half health you could argue that the 'advantage' is actually half the overall total - and 550 can be lost in one hit not one round.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if knights use different means to offset their hp dis-advantage all the group cares about is how that translates to tanking performance - and if indeed they can offset the hp loss with spells why are they bettter at aggro?<br />
<br />
Headache isn't it :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Rahwain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Given the speed with which unslowed Pop mob chew's through HP's, slowing at the earliest possible point is very important to a group. As we all know, with a warrior tanking, slowing on incoming will almost certainly see the slower taking a few rounds of damage every other pull causing inconvenience as the cleric has to waste effort and mana to fast heal that slower, the group needs to reposition, etc etc. <br />
<br />
This is getting silly, the number of times I see this type of attitude.  It is very understandable, as tanking an unslowed mob dead is not mana efficient for the cleric, but let's get away from tanking untill dead for a moment.<br />
<br />
I hold a mobs attention fairly well in an xp group, the times I lose aggro have already been listed, chain nuking and slowing on or right after pull.  Both are NOT needed.<br />
<br />
In PoP I have yet to take a med break because the cleric is LoM unless they just finished virtuing the group.  Ever.  End of a fight the cleric has MORE mana than the damage does.  Letting a mob hit me for an extra 10 seconds unslowed is NOT going to slow down the xp in the group, and it will maintain better aggro.  Oh, this includes clerics that are usually landing cheals at 65% or more.  That is a bigger draw of cleric mana than me getting a few more unslowed hits.<br />
<br />
I have tanked PoP xp mobs dead while the slower was afk or LD, with the damage coming in from the rest of the group.  It isnt that bad as needed, and I will grant that I wouldnt want to make a habit of doing it, but it is no reason to get in a panic and evac if slow isnt available for a fight.  <br />
<br />
So let's look again at the problem.  Slower getting aggro?  Take a moment longer before slow lands.  Cleric running LoM?  How often are you chealing?  Wizard pulling aggro because they have bard song, VoQ, and cant sit the fuck down or at the least use one of their concussion spells?  Tell em if they want a knight for their tank so badly go find one, I'll get a mage to replace.<br />
<br />
Knights might have aggro loc at present, but the situation wont last forever.  They will get nerfed or we will get upgraded.  People whining that Knights are superior technically atm isnt going to help.  You want to do something constructive, do as others have posted and work on ideas that would make Warriors your dream class again.  Until then, go LFG as you normally do, get xp and talk about what you're gonna spend that new aa on.  Tell your guilds that if you want their warrior to be useful on raids she/he needs to get some xp (on the chance that your guild wont group you because you're not a knight, kinda silly eh?).  Still cant find a group?  It's not that you're a warrior, instead of a knight.  Perhaps all your whining has turned your friends off.<br />

Warriors getting an aggro upgrade would thrill me, but a lot of people that are fucking up the xp groups getting a skill upgrade would thrill me more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Rahwain, noooo! :) The reason i digressed back to the old tired arguements was to make clear my thought process on this. The point of the thread is that things are not balanced atm and perhaps (instead of improving our taunt like you and so many others have suggested) to consider wether it might be better for all tank classes in the long run if aggro lock didn't exist because it makes duplication and defense in depth that much more attractive and gives more meaning to the additional utility a knight can provide to a group. <br />
<br />
How can one not address knight issues when considering such a fundamental change in the balance?!?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Attacking it from another viewpoint, at the moment the biggest single concern is lots of tanks lfg, only so many groups and those groups are only seeking one tank. What we need to foster is more plurality in group make up, much like the druid CH's made it suddenly that much more viable to use a druid as group healer despite the fact that clerics are 'better' overall group healers.<br />
<br />
I can't see how trivialising the ability to control a mob helps make adding a second tank more worthwhile, if there's more risk of mistakes, tank death etc surely adding a bit of insurance in the form of a second tank (particularly one with additional flexibility) is more attractive in this scenario than it was before?<br />
<br />
Atm warriors still get groups 'ok' but if there really isn't much of an advantage (as various other classes have begun to believe) how long will that remain the case? - can you refute my arguement without just saying 'well i get groups ok atm so there can't be a problem'?<br />

And the reason knights are dragged in, is that it's a problem of *relative class balance*. If there were no tanks but warriors, yeah, we'd be fine.  But there are, and they are better than us in exp groups. And that's a problem.<br />
<br />
And yes, groups could do more to limit their aggro, like slow later, debuff later, throttle back dps, etc. But why should they when there's a knight around? And how might that style of play affect *their* fun? If you were a dps class, would *you* want to throttle back just to support a warrior when you could get a knight and not have to?<br />
<br />
I've stuck my toe back in EQ, and tanked a few groups in BoT, HoH, Veksar and a PoV. It is SO obvious knights are better exp tanks that I have to think anyone who argues otherwise is simply engaging in wishful thinking.</div></div><hr />

Gimmel realizes that there's a problem, he's said so at least 3 times.   He's also said so about a gazillion times over on Pally boards.   He's stated that currently knights and warriors are in an out of balance situation which favors the knights, all that he's saying is that in the matter of balance, that it's inherently unfair to exclude knights from tanking, as that's their primary role in experience groups, and I happen to agree with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I have no problems with a knights tanking.<br />

I feel they should make acceptable tanks and adequate replacements for warriors.<br />
<br />
What I see as a problem is that normal everyday non-uber warriors are NOT acceptable to replace normal everyday non-uber knights as tanks in xp groups. Not because they can tank, but because we cannot tank as well as them for the current xp dynamics of Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
When all we have is tanking, being a poor second choice  to replace a knight is not ballanced.<br />
<br />
AGGRO-Lock is the problem. either all tanks need it, or no tanks need it. As long as one has it and another does not, things will remain horribly unballanced</div></div><hr />

No one said we wanted to be choosen ever time over a Knight! As it stands there are blatent reasons however to pick a Knight over a Warrior! We want this changed, it seems that every single post is nit picked on by you and you pull out what you want to read and read it how you want it to say, gee!<br />
<br />
1) I would like to hold aggro just like Knights<br />
2) I dont want knights to be nerfed to my status on aggro lock<br />
3) I do one job (tank) as it stands due to aggro lock, i suck at it<br />
4) I should tank better than a HYBRID of my class<br />
5) Saying all you bring to groups is aggro lock is showing me you dont play your class very well<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have the same aggro control as a knight, but the difference should only be as great as can be made up for by the increased durability of a warrior.<br />
<br />
Why, so Knights can tank better than the class that they are a HYBRID of? BS, plain and simple! We are knights parent class and our ONE job is to tank. We should be able to do it better than knights, period! The only way we can accomplish this is to have the mob pissed off at us, i.e. aggro locking!<br />
<br />
So knights telling me that it's parent class shouldnt be able to do the same job they can is BS! Then Knights telling warriors that if they can do the same job just as well, knights will be the red headed step children of Norrath makes me want to laugh. It seems pretty blatent that they dont know how to play their class and what they truely bring to groups!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Then retire your warrior now, because you are never going to be happy. If you can't see that giving warriors the same aggro control as knights would be unbalancing, would turn knights into a second choice for exp groups (you know, the spot you have now), and would destroy their raid role as CC tanks...well...have fun in dreamland.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you don't get the fact that I AGREE that warriors need help, LOTS of it. But the things that you are asking for are never going to happen, deal with it, and they shouldn't. And they aren't necessary. You don't need aggro control that is as good as knights to compete, but you do need it to be significantly better than it is (or theirs needs to be made much more mana intensive, which is looking more an more to be the better solution for the health of the game to me).<br />
<br />
I've said before that members of a class are usually lousy judges of how &quot;balanced&quot; they are, every class seems to think they have something horribly wrong with them. I think the better judges are those that depend on that class. From my perspective, as one who depends on the tank in my group, warriors need help, but if the changes that some of you are asking for went in, I would never want anything but a warrior as my tank, and I don't think that is right either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I was in BoT the other day, tanking.  My buffed HP was 7163, not the best in the game by any stretch, but certainly not the worst.  My AC was around 1340, again certainly not the worst.  I was using Gauthwhatever, sword of the sky, as my weapon.  It's not a super duper aggro generator, but does okay.  And it's off a boss mob in NToV, is Warrior only, and you'd think it'd be designed a little more with Warrior problems in mind, but it isn't so there you are.<br />
<br />
Anyway.  I was tanking a Krieger.  The Shaman, who had debuffed the Krieger first, gets resisted on slow 4 times.  Now this is a level 65 Shaman.  Who has already resist debuffed the mob.  And gets a resist 4 times on slow.  3 of those 4 times I successfully pulled the mob back off the Shaman and onto myself, but it cost the Shaman some HP, which the Cleric used mana to restore.  I'm shielding the Shaman, which is also costing me some HP.  And on the 4th time, the damn mob wouldn't come back to me, I didn't have AE taunt available, and the Shaman died.  Krieger still unslowed.  Cleric is blowing tons of mana on me with fast heals trying to keep me standing.  He's soon OOM.  I die, he dies.   The rest make it out.  This was after three hours of fighting in BoT with no previous problems.  And we'd taken out something like 3 Kriegers previously.<br />
<br />
So, was I an idiot for not being able to taunt the mob off the Shaman the 4th time?  Was I an unskilled player because I didn't have AE taunt available?   Was the Shaman an unskilled player for getting 4 resists on slow?  Was I a retarded n00b because I only had 7163 HP, 1340 AC, and a moderate aggro generating weapon off a boss mob dragon and shouldn't have been in BoT?  Was there some reason that my group deserved to have a partial wipe because of our lack of skill?<br />
<br />
Why exactly should a Paladin in that situation have done better?  Why exactly should it have been a situation where the Shaman could have slowed 4 times or 5 times or 6 times and had a very good chance that the mob wouldn't pong to him or if it did that the Paladin could with almost 100% assurance require aggro very quickly?  Why should the Paladin's stuns have been of more benefit since it would have stopped mob DPS completely during at least part of this engagement?   Granted the Paladin might have had 600-1k less HP than I did, but he would have been able to fire off a group heal which would have healed him, the shaman, and generated significant aggro to compensate.  Why exactly should all these things be true?<br />
<br />
Aggro generation is part of the problem but only part of it.  As it stands now, combined with aggro generation, the hybrid complete package is just better than the Warrior's complete packaage, unless that Warrior is geared to high heavens and even then it is questionable.<br />
<br />
Frankly, even without the difference in aggro generation, there is some question as to whether or not the Warrior brings enough to the table.  Factor in the difference in aggro generation, and you'd have to almost be a fool to go for a Warrior before a Paladin, even if the Paladin isn't quite as well geared.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">My 2cp on aggro generation:<br />
<br />
I think the problem with knight aggro comes from mana (as others on here have begun suggesting). The game evolves; once upon a time, before Luclin, we only had short lasting clarity which could not be extended with AAs and focus items. <br />
<br />
The problem really is c3/c5 and FT items (now before any enchanter comes over here, I'm in no way advocating any further nerfs of c3/c5). <br />
<br />
Ok what does this have to do with knights? Quite awhile ago, in an enchanterless group if a knight wanted to pull what they do now, they would run OOM and have to med out a few fights or a couple of minutes. I even remember having a SK friend of mine getting mana problems in an enchanterless Seb group (I was tanking) just because he was the snarer. <br />
<br />
Now, enchanterless group or not, most of the 60+ crowd is walking around with permanent c3 (or higher). Enchanterless group? Someone in your group probably has access to an enchanter and EQW or a 2nd comp. If not, run two mins over to PoK or nexus and there will almost certainly be someone casting it.<br />
<br />
Yet knights are still using spells that they used just out of the newbie yard, let alone the uber level 50 prekunark game. I'm of the belief that better than warrior aggro control should be a selling point for a knight to tank in a group (and they should make viable MTs for exp groups, as should we). However, I think where we rely on randomness for aggro, knights should rely on mana. If they want aggro for sure, they should have it, but at that pace of spell casting they should run OOM. Thus they get downtime, which slows down the group. If they don't want to lose more mana than they are regening while standing/fighting, they should hold aggro a bit better than us, but by no means have aggro lock. <br />
<br />
I guess the best way to go about this is to make their aggro spells cost more mana /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, a very small minority of warrior's have said this very thing.  Taken from page 1:<br />
<br />
The warrior is the meat shield. ONLY the warrior should be the primary meat shield and the knights should be there ONLY if the warrior goes dead, LD, warrior is afk and a mob wanders into camp, or to help with aggro if a caster screws up, OR if there's an add an no chanter is in the group (offtanking).<br />
<br />
If that does not meet the criteria of being chosen over a knight everytime then I don't know what does.  <br />
<br />
I firmly believe that some nerfing of Paladin Stuns is in order (make us use our higher level stuns).  I cannot comment on SK spells since I do not know them.  I also think that similarily equipped warrior-knight ac/hp difference needs to be addressed.  I would also like to see knight spells reduced in aggro a little (not a lot).  What fun is it fighting with no chance of dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Sorry to break it to you folks but we will never have full parity in groups, we'll never have 33% of groups taking a warrior, 33% taking a paladin 33% taking an SK.  The cold hard truth is that someone is, for whatever reason, always going to be the favoured tank. <br />
<br />
Nobody questions the healing orientated cleric being the prime healer in the game, why the heck do people suggest that warriors should not be the primary example of a tank class - NOT the only one no, but the aknowledged specialist. How can anyone in their right minds suggest that the class specialised in one role and one role only should be third out of three for tanking suitability? Given our one note role it seems perfectly fair to have a minor leg up on our tanking brethren does it not? <br />
<br />
I don't want to be God, i just want to have a clear purpose for being. <br />
<br />
What you may not credit is that i really don't want to put the boot into knights i have a whole bunch of knight friends in game, but I cannot understand why people feel a warrior with spells should (in normal run of the mill circumstances) be better than a warrior who gave them up to be the overall best choice.... <br />
<br />
Bah, whatever.<br />
<br />
I think it's fairly safe to say that what all tanks really need to see though is more stackability between tanks, so that if you have a tank already you still think it's a good idea to have another in group. <br />
<br />
Safe exping like what we're seeing atm (where the mob is never out of control and neutered before it even reaches camp) totally destroys any possible need for more than one tank per group. The result being that whoever is the current flavour of the month gets the group and the other guys look in vain. <br />
<br />
Given that aggro lock trivialises the experience as it does and promotes this 'one tank' only method of exp grouping I don't see how we can ever consider it balanced in game. If that means a total revamp of knights so that they aren't gimped by the loss of aggro-lock then i have no problem with that.<br />

<br />
Let's say for a minute that the answer was a simple one.  Pretend we are the people who are going to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Here's the problem:<br />
Warriors should be choice 1 for meatshield only roll in group<br />
Paladins are now first chioce for meatshield because of aggro lock<br />
<br />
Solution is assumed:<br />
Make paladins have less effective aggro lock (nerf) to the point where Warriors have a slight advantange over the paladin for aggro control.<br />
<br />
How-to:<br />
Change mana requirements for stuns so that they cost more mana with each level.  This way, paladans can still get a mobs attention; however it takes nearly full mana to cast the stuns necessary to get the mobs attention.<br />
<br />
in the above solution, the paladin would still be desirable; however, they would no longer be desirable for exp group FOR THEIR AGGRO LOCK because their aggro lock means tank downtime.<br />
<br />
THEN the warriors would be preferred slightly.  Then the aggro lock would exist for those situations where it's necessary, but would be undesirable to use for regular XP getting.<br />
<br />
Well, great in theory but that wouldn't work without one caveat.  You can't go breaking pally stuns completely.  THose lower level 0 second stuns DO serve a purpose, right?  Spell interruption.  I say they'd have to change whatever stuns they want used for the intended purpose (spell interruptions) to be Zero agro.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
EDIT: forget the caveat.  It wouldn't break thier stun line of spells to make the mana cost scale up with level.</div></div><hr />

Firstly, i'd like you to accept that a warrior does not need to be raiding all week to be allowed access to PoP and level 65. Raids and exp do not compare for balance purposes. The two different gaming  experiences should be balanced against themselves as much as possible, not each other.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I think it's fair to say that as with all choices people will make value judgements about which class fills it's role 'the best'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Honestly, <br />
<br />
I think it is rather obvious that aggro-lock is an exploit of the system. The fact that any class can use what is supposed to be a detriment, IE AGGRO from a situation to an advantage is wrong. <br />
<br />
If anyone disagrees with this... just ask the wizzard to chain stun the mob next encounter.. see how BENEFICIAL the aggro lock is supposed to be, or the Cleric since the cleric has the exact same spell line as paladins.<br />
<br />
STUNNING a mob to gain aggro is supposed to be a detriment, for pal it is not, so clearly there is a problem here. <br />
<br />
The fact that it is so glarring and that the entire exp game in  EQ has revolved to such an extent that people do not ACCEPT anything BUT Aggro-lock is not as much the paladins fault as it is SOE's fault for not fixxing it.<br />
<br />
AGGRO-LOCK is NOT good for the game, not because it relegates warriors to red-headed third class ghetto tanks. but because it completely dumbs down the game. There is no longer any fear. No longer do people need to worry about aggro, the pal/sk will keep it. we just hit the NUKE hotkey and chain cast 5 nukes in a row... no fear no worry..<br />
<br />
If they will not remove aggro lock, which for a multitude of reasons is harder than just making knight stuns aggro free, then all tanks should get it.<br />
<br />
I dont want it, but to compete, I have nothing else to give the group if I dont have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I think it probably should more properly be stated thus:<br />
<br />
(warrior durability + warrior spells + warrior special abilities + warrior aggro control) = (hybrid tank durability + hybrid tank spells + hybrid tanks special abilities + hybrid tank aggro control)<br />
<br />
Currently that formula doesn't quite work.  If you say that Warriors are a 10 on durability, then Hybrid Tanks are a 9, maybe an 8.  If you say that hybrid tank spells are a 10 then Warriors are a big fat 0.  If you say Warrior special abilities are a 10 (assuming that defensive/evasive is a 10) then hybrid tanks are a 5 (loh and harm touch are special abilities, there are some marginal disciplines for the hybrid tanks).   If hybrid tank aggro control is a 10 then Warrior aggro control is a 5.  So we end up with this:<br />
<br />
Warriors - 10 + 10 + 0 + 5 = 25<br />
Hybrid Tanks - 8 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 33<br />
<br />
And to the best of my understanding 25 != 33.<br />
<br />
As far as Warriors thinking they are the best of the three alternatives for a pure tanking role, if they're not what will they get as an alternative?  A fast casting heal to compensate?  A nice DoT to compensate?  A couple of stuns or a hate increaser spell?  If Warriors aren't the best in the durability department, really what else might they have?  Are we going to see more special abilities thrown their way as compensation for the fact that don't stand out in durability, they get no spells, and their aggro control bites?</div></div><hr />

Hate quoting so much, but - you lost me.  I think you have your numbers don't jive with your formula, warriors with a 10 for spells hrrrmmmm.<br />
<br />
And I do have to argue your formula - you list hybrid tank spells and hybrid aggro control as two seperate items when in fact they are really the same thing.  Any spell that does not fit under aggro control is either under special ability or not something useful to a group:<br />
<br />
(warrior durability + warrior special abilities + warrior aggro control) = (knight durability + knight special abilities + knight aggro control)<br />
<br />
I would rate it as <br />
<br />
Warrior:  10 + 5 + 4 = 19<br />
Knight:  9 + 5 + 10 = 24<br />
<br />
I don't see knight special abilities (including utility spells) bringing any more to a group then a warrior's.  Knight durability should probably be an 8 and aggro should probably be a 6. <br />
<br />
The question remains, would a group be satisified with a heftier meat shield that did not have as much aggro.  I really have no idea - groups will always take the path of least resistance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine, reverse the two middle numbers in both.  I made an error, one that should be fairly obvious I would think, since the 0 must be for Warrior spells, which don't exist, unless people are going to get into that whole clicky item BS arguement.<br />
<br />
I don't see knight special abilities (including utility spells) bringing any more to a group then a warrior's. Knight durability should probably be an 8 and aggro should probably be a 6.<br />
<br />
I listed Knight's special abilites seperately, which do not include their spells, because spells are not limited usage abilities to the degree that things like Defensive, Lay of Hands, Harm Touch and other disciplines are.  Even the Warrior ability of /shield is much more limited in usage than hybrid tank spells.  Therefore spells and special abilites are not the same.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to argue that hybrid tank spells are equal to the Warrior defensive discipline, like so many have tried to do in the past, don't even.  The comparison is completely laughable, and frankly I'd expect you to be too intelligent to even try.  The flexibilty and usefulness of hybrid tank spells is whole categories  greater except in that rare situation where you're tanking a boss mob.<br />
<br />
The question remains, would a group be satisified with a heftier meat shield that did not have as much aggro. I really have no idea - groups will always take the path of least resistance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Gimmel has it right.  In the balanced game you would have multiple classes capable of tanking using different methods.  In a balanced setup, the only time it matter which class you pick are in highly specialized situations.<br />
<br />
The idea that Warriors should be &quot;the one and only tank&quot; is just as bad an idea as Clerics being &quot;the one and only healer&quot;.  The farther we get away from either of these the better off guilds and groups are.  They need to start breaking up CC and Debufing more but now I'm diverging from the topic. ^_^<br />
<br />
The situation is balanced between SKs and Paladins.  Both classes can take monster damage while holding agro in using different mechanisms.  What is more balanced than this setup!<br />
<br />
I believe here lies the key to fixing Warrior woes.  Some new mechanism needs to be created that is different than Paladin or SK to hold onto agro.  Nerfing Paladins and SKs will not generate better grouping experiences.  Giving Warriors more options will.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that for at least Paladins all of that agro generation comes at a price.  The more spells a Paladin tosses around, the more DPS will be lost.  Even with the special Hybrid Casting Timer every attempt to cast costs melee damage reguardless if it goes through.  This isn't necessarily true for SKs though: the more spells they use the more damage they can generate but the costs come at higher mana drain.  It is an interesting and balanced setup between these Paladin and SK classes because neither is automatically better than the other.<br />
<br />
If Warriors can find a way to generate hate beyond melee then situation will get closer to balanced.  It will probably have to be something new and beyond what is currently in EQ's framework but it should play something like the interaction between Paladin and SK generation.  None of the three classes should be &quot;the best&quot; in general.  They should all be different.<br />
<br />
Glatius is also right: something about Hybrid flexibility is compelling.  Even if agro lock is nerfed Knights might still might be more compelling to use in exp groups.  Warriors can only bring tanking and melee damage.  Both SKs and Paladins can do that PLUS other useful bits too.  Warriors need to do something MORE than just take in and lay out damage.  There are events where melee damage is undesirable or negliable.  I urge all Warriors out there to push for skills and abilities beyond melee.<br />

Loss of aggro lock doesn't mean a knight can't taunt, it just means he can't do it 'better' than a warrior. In another thread Brik the SK is telling me how it was possible for him to tank 'ok' just using taunt and a warrior equippable weapon so apparently that's first hand info that knights would still be able to do the job!<br />
<br />
You call for more flexibility for all tank classes and that's something I've been a proponent of in the past. What  I don't want to do is kill the knights flexibility advantage however. There is some truth to the obverse of my arguement above. i.e.  if a warrior does have an advantage in the tanking role he should pay for it by being less flexible. Some small tricks to give a non- tanking warrior the ability to contribute to the groups success beyond hitting attack would be nice admittedly.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just don't see the trivialisation provided by total mob control as being healthy for the flexibility and 'tank stacking' we're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Creating parity by upping warrior aggro by 'enough' or by a 'different' method (?!?) doesn't help with the problem that groups atm don't really need to add flexible muscle to help with the security of the group - One group, one tank means all the other tanks (warrior and knight) are lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>raznor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Let me see if I can answer a few things here: <br />
<br />
Spell casting is essential to a knights ability to control agro we can't do it on taunt and melee damage alone.  The best example I can think of is if a 60 warrior grouped with a 55 warrior and let the lower warrior tank.  Midway through the fight the 60 warrior's damage would pass the 55 warrior and he'd have to back off and let the other warrior get agro back, this might happen a few times during the fight and the result is next fight the 60 warrior should be tanking.  This is what it would be like if a knight tried to tank without agro spells, I can't speak for Brik and what he does and I'm sure there are ways to get around spells (procs) but in general it takes melee+spells for a knight to tank.  <br />
<br />
Is there something screwy with stuns?  Yes, no doubt, many paladins load cease and desist to create agro during fights and there is next to no difference between the hate made on our top stuns and the first two stuns we get.  The end result is the ability to make all the hate we need to tank with for next to nothing mana wise.  I've posted this once here already but what needs to be done is the hate generated on our stuns needs to be scaled so their effective in the range they should be used in.  So by 65 the stuns you need to use are your top stuns, not cease and desist, the only things these should be remotely good for by 65 is pulling.  This also fixes the problem of cheap mana agro, the cost on our stun spells are pretty much appropriate in relation to the level they are available at, it's just a matter of making it so we have to use those spells. <br />
<br />
As for the suggestion that paladins are somehow taking advantage of something that was supposed to be a detriment to thier class you need to look at the evolution of the class.  When verants made the knight classes I believe their intention was to create a secondary or offtank position in groups.  The problem started when people realized this wasn't the best way to compose an exp. group.  The ideal group is a tank, three damage dealers, a slower and a healer.  At the time the paladin had a line of lower cleric spells that wouldn't stack with higher cleric's spells and clerics were healers 95 percent of the time in groups, their damage was horrid, they had spells geared for fighting casters and undead that are still a  huge minority in EQ and their tanking ability was a shadow of what a warriors was.  The two things they could do is heal in a pinch and take over tanking fast by stunning and taunting, it was basiclly an &quot;In case of an emergency, break out this class.&quot; and noone wanted it.  <br />
<br />
Paladins were gimp and simply put we wanted to be able to fill a viable role in exp groups and that meant tanking.  So over three expansions we received self only buffs, group buffs useable with clerics, group heals, skill increases to fix the gap beween a warrior's mitigation, hp and damage and a larger variety of stuns.  Yes, stuns were originally meant to stop the mob from attacking and to prevent spell casting but over time it became a means to hold agro without dual wield and the damage of a warrior.  Things started to go well for knight classes in luclin, we could tank in exp. groups, we still had few stuns that actually stunned post 55 but it was all good but, POP changed alot. <br />
<br />
Mobs went from high hp and moderate damage to massive damage dealing and moderate hp.  Slowing, which you could get away with not having at times before became just as paramount as healing.  Agro, which groups could afford to give time to develop and losing it wasn't a nightmare is now needed ASAP.  All this equaled the worst possible combination for a warrior to deal with but for knights it brought into play abilities that we've had from the get go, instant agro.  To sum it up we started as something and evolved into something else, just like the monk becoming a pulling class, FD was supposed to be a way to avoid death but it turned into a strategy to single pull.  Same thing with stun, it was means to stop a mob long enough to top the hate list in an emergency but it's evolved into a way to avoid damage and control agro as main tank.  Whats needed now is revision to a class that has seen few changes over the last few expansions and to look at how knights are functioning right now. <br />
<br />
First of all agro, tecnically speaking, over a long period of time a warrior can actually make more agro than a knight, they do more melee damage, spell agro is finite give them time and a warrior will make more agro.  In a group situation if a knight is llimited to how many stuns he can drop before his mana bar decreases over time (right now we really aren't) as the group exp grinds he may actually only make as much agro over the period of a fight as a warrior, the difference is ours spikes at the beginning of the fight and we control it.  If there was a way for a warrior to take that damage over the period of the fight and spike it at the beginning, a big chunk of the warrior's problems atm would be fixed.  The idea I suggested on a previous post was giving warrior the ability to do a burst of damage through melee that cost stamina, have a fatigue effect that wouldn't allow invigor to be cast on the warrior for a period of time.  The result would be you could spike your damage over slow at the cost of damage later in the fight.  <br />
<br />
The other thing I think needs changing is mitigation, warriors need to be on a separate table that enables them to mitigate damage about 10 to 15 percent better than the same level knight with equal stats without any gear and let itemization expand that difference.  The reason I feel this way is I can use a chain stun at 62 and stop a mob from doing anything for about 14 seconds, 14 seconds imagine the damage a knight can avoid from pop mobs that won't touch them for that time and that will only hit them once they are slowed (Also a real slick pally with the mana regen for it can drop a heal over time on themselves during this)  Warriors have nothing to compare to this, currently with the skill gap the edge a warrior has in mitigation is about 1.5 percent, if I'm not mistaken, armor can expand that to about 3 percent.  It's a drop in the bucket, 3hp less damage per 100 points of damage is not enough, the damage a paladin can avoid at the begining of a fight and the damage and self healing a sk can do should be comparable to the extra damage dealt plus the damage naturally mitigated by a warrior.  Now some people have posted that sony will not adjust a the warrior's mitigation because they're tanking affects the balance of pop raid encounters all I have to say to this is bullshit, if it affects the encounters then adjust the encounters appropriatly.  The warrior class is not working like it should be, the strengths you have are no longer matching the classes that share the same role in groups, it should be fixed and using raid encounters as an excuse for not fixing it is a load of crap. <br />
<br />
The goal I'm shooting for here is for knights to be equal to warriors in grouping situations.  This topic has been going round and round on these boards to a point of nausea and unfortunatly it doesn't seem like much progress has been made.  The bashing of each other, disagreement and the over all frustration is really putting a crimp on a board that is typically a wealth of knowledge for anyone that tanks.  Instead, I end up scrolling through 6 pages of &quot;@#$%%$## pallies ^%&amp;^*&amp; their agro!!!&quot; Enough already, take the ideas that are there and that have been recycled several times here, get on sony about this and don't let up till it's fixed. <br />

PS:  If you see Angre post, congradulate him, he's gettng hitched soon.  <br />
 <br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">OMG... Raznor must be a troll...<br />
<br />
well at least a warrior posing as a paladin...<br />
<br />
he just stated in very good terms what warriors have been saying and paladins denying...<br />
<br />
Here are a few ideas I have....<br />
<br />
1.) they made KEI/Virtue etc, spells UNABLE TO BE CAST on targets lower than XX level. Why can they not make Stun spells with a similar restriction? Well more than stun, snare and flash of light also come to mind. It just seems very odd that such low level spells are the staple of high level casters. Make these spells not affect the mob in any way, no resist, no effect , no aggro. NONE... now because of this they may need to add higher level versions of the spell with associated mana costs/delays. etc. Look at the mana-pool of a lvl 9 paladin, take the cost of his stun spell, and scale that up to a level 65 paladin and make it compareable. That would be balance. A level9 paladin cannot cast chain cast the stun because they will go oom relatively fast, the same is not true of a level 65. <br />
<br />
<br />
Make Low level spells, that have higher spells in their spell chain UNCASTABLE on targets above a certain level.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) Why does any other class have a taunt key? I never understood that. every other class has built in ways to add aggro or remove aggro... all casters have spells, some have aggro down, others jolts, others stuns/da's, FD's etc... Every class has a way to remove aggro or stop the damage so that another class, ie tank can regain it.. oh even pure melee have these tactics, evade and FD.... EVERY class has their own, unique and specific form of aggro control, EXCEPT warriors who WANT and NEED aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove the Taunt key from all other classes, they dont need it.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.) Fix the taunt key #1. Give it a message. Succeed or Fail. Make a message so everyone can see. example...<br />
<br />
==&gt;&gt;Landrain pushes Taunt button while targetting a fire mephit.<br />
<br />
Landrain makes a rude gesture at a fire mephit, the fire mephit roars and attacks Landrain!<br />
--or--<br />
Landrain makes a rude gesture at a fire mephit, the fire mephit seems not to care and ignore Landrain!<br />
<br />
What would this do? Well tell us and everyone else just how often taunt FAILS in comparison to their fizzle rates. But also it would stop the annoying  from running around with sow on, in no discernable pattern, yelling Taunt!Taunt!  when of course we were taunting but now they have the mob chasing them and OOR of taunt!<br />
<br />
<br />
Give us a pass/fail message and an emote.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.) Fix the taunt key #2. Range,Range,Range... Give us a range on taunt, how about range equal to skill level? or a flat 100' but the current range is just sad. Especially on the mobs with stupid silly or wierd  hit boxes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give our Taunt at Range.<br />
<br />
<br />
5.) Fix the Taunt key #3. AGGRO modifiers. I suggest either modifying the current taunt button or adding a new skill button for warriors. <br />
<br />
[i]<br />
Modify -- Either modify the new taunt to give us top aggro + xxx, where xxx is either fixxed or it could be a RNG based upon our taunt skill. This would allow us to at least have reasonable form of pure aggro generation.<br />
<br />
ADD NEW -- add a new skill button. Taunt II, or ( Innoruk's Endless Instablity ) &lt;&lt; poking fun at KEI&gt;&gt; this skill would be on a timer, and when it is pressed it  would always add XXX hate aggro to a warrior. I would say 1pt of hate per skill in taunt, with a refresh every 18 seconds, is NOT unreasonable. This is less than the warrior epic and gives all warriors, esp those epic less/no TB/no EB a way to generate pure aggro. Why are warriors the only class with no innate aggro control?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Essentially, this would remove aggro lock from the game, and give warriors more tools to manage aggro. Aggro-Lock is bad, Aggro Management is good. All other classes have their methods of aggro management, its been 4 years give us ours.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not think any of these are unreasonable suggestion. All of them can be coded easilly into the game. The numbers may need adjusted some, since no one truly knows the aggro system of EQ, all we have to gauge by is EB/TB and other spells with numerical hate effects. an innate ability  equal to half our epic at max skill does not seem unreasonable or overpowering. the rest of the taunt fixxes are way overdue. And the removal of the hate exploits of lower level spells needs to be done, and i do mean exploit not nerf, no one can reasonably and with good logic explain to me how that is NOT an exploit, the argument fails. It is not a nerf it is a return to the way it should be.test</div></div><hr />

Multiple posts mention that &quot;Warriors should always be the choosen tank&quot; so I point out what is wrong with that.<br />
<br />
As for loosing agro lock, fine lets imagine EQ where Paladins and SKs generate zero additional agro from any and all spells.  Knights are still more flexible: Paladins can park and heal, SKs can still generate additional DPS and debuf.  Nothing a Warrior can do compares to either of these.  In fact a case can be made that if none of the classes can generate solid agro Knights would be wanted because both can still buy debufers additional time and attempts without agro control.<br />
<br />
The solution is not killing Knight agro generation.  The solution should be figuring out a way for Warriors to do something similar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats funny! <br />
<br />
Add up the amount of DPS that is lost by casting spells then subtract that from the rest of the group that is already beating the crap out of the mob compared to if a warrior that was there and his DPS only while he gets aggro!<br />
<br />
Let's say that Pallys do 150dps (this is high just to give them an inflated ammount of damage actually lost)<br />
<br />
So in the two seconds that it takes to cast &quot;Quellious' Word of Serenity&quot; wow, they have lost 300 points of damage. Meanwhile one proc of the cleric hammer (who is full mana and bored from not haveing to heal anyone but the pally) and two ranger slashes cover that, let alone a wiz nuke or what ever!<br />
<br />
Giving us the same aggro lock that knights currently have will not eliminate knights roles in groups unless they do not know how to play their class! (which I am starting to think is the case, from this thread)<br />
<br />
I have to love the ignorance that makes people think that its 100% ok for a Warrior Hybrid to tank better than the actual Warrior!</div></div><hr />

Um...do they have more hps than you? Higher AC? Higher defense skills? Do they take hits better? No? Hmm...interesting.<br />
As I said before, you conveniently ignore the fact that hybrids are hybrids of warriors AND something. They get the ability to take punishment from warriors (and aren't as good at it, though perhaps too good), and the ability to get aggro that casting spells generates from thier other parent class. The total package might be too good compared to warriors right now, but the total package should be as good as warriors. To say otherwise just shows that you aren't interested in balance at all, but just being the top dog again.</div></div><hr />

Very true Gimmel.  SKs and Paladins have always had these abilities.  From L9 to L65 either class has access to these skills from the start of their casting abilties.  It wasn't like we logged into EQ on POP release day and were hit with the realization we could lock agro.  It was always there.  It wasn't until people saw the POP monster design that casters needed that extra level of protection.<br />
<br />
In the Kunark Age, grouping in Sebilis it was far more about getting clean pulls and solid crowd control than controling agro.  In the Velious Age it was all about getting clean pulls.  In the Luclin age it was about being bored out of your mind in stupidifyingly long fights. ^_^<br />
<br />
In POP you can easily get clean pulls without a Monk and bring extras under CC.  Unfortunately, POP monster design is part of the problem since nearly all monsters are designed to be tanked one way: heavily debuffed.  If Warriors don't change and the monster don't change it doesn't matter how much agro Knights have or don't have.  Warriors will still be ill suited to handle these types of monsters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is perfect if you ask me.  If the stuns used for aggro consistently took a bubble of mana per cast throughout the life of a paladin, they would still be able to get aggro quickly when needed, but they would not be able to infinitely chain cast them for unlimited aggro.  If you are casting multiple stuns for aggro every fight you will have to stop and med every 5 or 6 fights.  Knights would still have better aggro generation than a warrior, but it would have a significant drawback, since most groups don't seem to find the gap between knight and warrior tanking ability to be signifigant in exp groups.<br />
<br />
I would be 100% against anything that would make any tank class be able to have guaranteed aggro all the time, including the low mana/high aggro spells hybrids have now.</div></div><hr />

You're describing our entire playing experience, although you don't realize it.  Warrior DPS is only roughly about 20% greater than a Paladin's given similar weapons and buffs.  Our ability to successfully taunt is higher, but not staggeringly higher.  And people have to constantly do exactly what you describe when we tank, back off and let the Warrior get aggro.  It just so happens that most of them have tools specifically designed for this function, FD, jolt, evade, and so forth.  Tools they don't have to use with a Paladin.  Why exactly should that be, do you think?  That there should be a tools provided for most of the classes likely to gain aggro regularly so that they can lose it, if in fact they aren't intended to use those tools?  Something is amiss, wouldn't you say?<br />
<br />
First of all agro, tecnically speaking, over a long period of time a warrior can actually make more agro than a knight, they do more melee damage, spell agro is finite give them time and a warrior will make more agro.<br />

Hmmm... let me quote someone here, how about Biggwinz:<br />
Kinghts are a HYBRID of the WARRIOR class and either a cleric or necro class!<br />
<br />
That fact is a common fact that I like to point out all the time in reference to the fact that a Hybrid should not tank better than its parent class! We should be better at tanking, PERIOD. Not holding aggro makes us worse!<br />
<br />
I have also commonly be an advocate for not nerfing the Knight classes. As it stands I think that knights are pretty well balanced! Knights are Balanced - maybe in the grand scheme of things their DPS could be upped to compensate for the growing gaps between caster and melee, but that is a different topic!<br />
<br />
What I have a problem with is our ability to hold aggro (tank)! We should be the best tank out there period! No I am not going to dicker with you on that fact either. We offer tanking and that is it. We dont have pulling abilitys, heals, stuns, buffs or rez's to offer groups. WE TANK! We should be the best at that!<br />
<br />
Let's say we actually get what we would like and have the ability to hold aggro. Does that lessen any of your abilities? Does that change in any way shape or form you abilities to tank? (Which by the way you have proven you can already do!) Has it taken away your buffs,  heals or all the other benifits you bring to a group???<br />
<br />
OH, your one of the types that has to have the perfect group? Thats BS, I've done it all, from having no chanters, no slowers, no cleric! Letting us be the tank we should be does not take anything from you! All it does is improves our only ability to the level it should be. You can still tank and you can still get groups. All it does is improves a class and adds the warrior back as an option for tanking!<br />
<br />
This is not balance between warriors and knights this is balance period. You gave up hps, ac and migration to have a spell book, not to be the best tank in the game! You are way more balanced than warriors are at the moment, so quit trying to hold us down!</div></div><hr />

Knights have already proven that they can hold aggro and can actually be efficient on the clerics mana while they tank!<br />
<br />
You are not required to have the best group make up in order to be mana efficient and have the exp flowing, but you are required to have someone who can hold aggro in order to keep people alive!<br />

<br />
This is generally true, although with the change furor recommended, it would make that statement incorrect.  I'd recommend reading his proposal in the outhouse.<br />
<br />
<br />
It will just deny knights groups (again).<br />
<br />
While the statement is simplistic and knee-jerk, there's some truth to it.  Yes, more often than now, warriors would be taking knights' places as experience group tanks.    The reson is because as it stands now, not enough warriors, particularly in relation to server populations are getting that spot.   If there's 300 groups, and 100 Paladins, 100 Shadow Knights and 300 warriors on line... in a balanced world, there wouldn't be 200 warriors LFG.<br />

There would be 500 tanks of which any combination therof would have those 300 positions.</div></div><hr />

Strange...it seems to me the problem then isn't Knight agro abilities but a more general Caster ability.  Do knights generate infinite agro?  Maybe.  Do Casters generate even more agro (infinite agro+ ??)?  Most certainly.<br />
<br />
You fail to see the larger picture.  Melee in general, for all classes, is in bad shape compared to Casters.  Casters and Hybrids got some nice enhancements to their AA, gear, AND SPELLS.  What did Melee get?  Just extentions of old melee skills and gear.  Unless you attempt bosses or run in elementals the gear isn't that compelling.  If there are some nice Warrior AA skills that compare to free group heals please correct me. ^_^<br />
<br />
So a Caster can spend a night in Valor gaining etherals, AA to make their casting more effective, and deal effects they already had from previous expandsions.  A Warrior in the same group gets to do more of the same.  That is what I call unbalanced and it has little to do with agro or Agro Lock.<br />
<br />
Agro Lock is a giant red herring.  Ignore it...that isn't the reason why Warriors are in bad shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Sorry, I smell something here and it's not flowers. First you say that because you are not the best tank, you never get groups, but once we're (knight in my case) not the best tank, we'll magically get groups?<br />
<br />
There's one tank slot in a group. Making warriors better tanks won't change that. It will just deny knights groups (again).<br />
<br />
Well, your logic seems clear enough.  It's perfectly fine to deny Warriors groups as long as Knights are getting them.  But if Warriors should start getting the lion's share of the groups (again), this is bad, evil, just can't be allowed to happen.  So as long as the imbalance favors your class, you're cool with it?  This clearly appears to be your message.  Sounds extremely self serving to me and hardly a logical basis on which to argue.  You can't change things because it will be to my disadvantge!  Uhm, hardly.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should go back and rethink what you're saying and what you intend to say.  Because telling Warriors that they should be happy being a second choice to hybrid tanks because making them a first choice over hybrid tanks will take groups from the hybrids isn't really a strong arguement on a Warrior board. <br />
<br />
It's kind of like discrimination, attempting to explain to the ones being discriminated against that discrimination is a good thing because if they weren't being discriminated against then the non-discriminated individuals wouldn't have their advantages is kind of not going to get you a lot of agreement.  I'm hardly interested in sitting in the back of the group bus because you want a front seat.<br />
<br />
You can offer up two arguements here that will hold some value.  Either Warriors should be the first choice of tank, which would be a kick in the pants to hybrid tanks, or both Warriors and hybrid tanks need to be roughly equal.  Trying to convince us that we should be an inferior choice and be happy that we be so because it benefits you isn't going to be very compelling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I am saying is: The reason Warriors are turned away is due to the fact that we do not have the same mob control that Knights already have. Do you understand, that sink in? Hello McFly! <br />
<br />
Read and understood.  Do you understand what you are asking? Evidently not.  You want to maintain the warrior discs, the AC and HP advantage while removing the knights' only edge for groups.  Ever took off your warrior helmet and thought what that means? Evidently not.  Trying straining to remember how often knights got groups back in Kunark, maybe it will help you understand what your proposal means.<br />
<br />
Warriors CAN hold aggro.  Yes, they have disadvantages over knights. Heck, I'll even say the balance has swung too far right now. They also have advantages. Redressing the disadvantages - nay, removing them will put it back to the time when knights were inferior in every respect to warriors.<br />
<br />
You want to talk about balancing warriors? Talk across all levels.  You need help soloing (not that melees can solo worth a damn in PoP) and in groups, you need to lose some raid advantages. Don't address one aspect of the problem and call it a fix.<br />
<br />
Frodlin:<br />
Agreed that the disadvantages should balance out more.  When I see a proposal that does that, I'll be behind it. Furor's problem not only doesn't solve the snap aggro problem (being at the end of every tick), but it's a HUGE DPS boost (to jack up my overall DPS by 10 costs me more mana than I get from KEI - and I don't use KEI).<br />
<br />
Valeris:<br />
Point taken regarding lock, but think about this.  You are assuming that everyone has KEI.  I may be the lone voice in the wilderness, but I've never paid for a buff to be cast on me.  If my group has it great, if not, I live without.  Any proposal that balances a KEIed knight versus a warrior forces knights to become crack addicts to compete. A system that prevents knights from buying snap aggro would fix the problem better than screwing knights. I like DaoC concentration points myself. <br />
<br />
Any solution that removes the advantage in snap aggro puts us back in the same place we were in Kunark. Sure, knights have almost as much HP and close to the AC of warriors, but seriously, have you played a knight to know what it's like when you're &quot;almost good enough&quot;?  I'll give you a hint: it's pretty much like the situation you find intolerable now. The reason knights get so defensive when they see these proposals is because they know exactly what you are going through, and don't see attempts to coexist, but attempts to keep all the advantages you still have and take away their one advantage.  Maybe that advantage is disproportionately large, but changing things to back to the way they used to be isn't going to be well received. <br />
<br />
And stick your attitude about if I'm not broken why should I care about fixes. I never saw any warriors fighting to bring knights up to parity back when the shoe was on the other foot. You were content to hog all the exp group slots and raid slots. Not so funny when it's happening to you is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, not true at all.  I've been saying for a long time warriors give up too much for defensive - unfortunately, whatever your feelings about defensive it also grants warriors a total lock on raid tanking.  I don't think putting knights back as second string tanks will balance the fact that warriors are still totally out of wack (defensive and nothing else). I don't see any proposals here that aren't attempts to return to the status quo and make warriors the only possible tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game has changed hugely since Kunark.  Many of the things that were stacked against the Knights are now gone.  Many of their major weaknesses previously are now at most minor inconviences.   I'm not convinced that if Warriors and Knights had identical aggro control that the Knights would be unwanted.  Group heals still have value.  Stuns will still have value.  Fast heals still have value, and so on.  Aggro control is merely a side effect of spells that have other very beneficial effects other than the aggro generated.   Obviously you think that the only thing Knights offer is aggro control.  I happen to think they offer a lot other than aggro control.<br />
<br />

<br />
Raid advantages?  Have you ever raided as a Warrior when you weren't the MT or high up on the MT list?  You know what you do?  You stand around waiting to be called in against the mobs and add in your half assed DPS that is only higher than a Paladin's, that's what you do.  You can't heal yourself, you can't life tap, you have to have a healer if you're taking any AE damage at all or eventually you just keal over and drop dead.<br />
<br />
There are perhaps 3 Warriors on a raid with a real job to perform.  The rest of us just kind of stand around and take up space, at least most of the time.  I know for a fact that Paladins have far more functionality on a raid than a non-MT Warrior ever will.  Yet you guys constantly bitch that you don't have a raid role.  What you mean is that you don't get to MT.  You want to be the main tank.  Because if that isn't what you want then you have no room to bitch about raid roles when non-MT Warriors have even less than you.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well friend, hate to break it to you, but if I'm forced to make a choice between Warriors or Knights getting to ride up front, yeah damn right it's going to be Warriors.  I'd like to think there was another alternative though.  But given your attitude and the attitued of people like you, maybe there isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casters don't tank...aggro lock for them is a bad thing, so there's nothing wrong with them having it.  Wizards are great at holding aggro, but nobody is choosing them as tanks in exp groups.  Even rangers and beastlords having infinite aggro potential is meaningless, because they don't want aggro, and if they do tank, they will be a major drain on healing compared to a warrior.  The combination of infinite aggro capability and near warrior tanking ability is what creates the imbalance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Originally posted by Glatius2 <br />
So, got any of your own that might actually fix the problem without putting Knights back as second string tanks?  We're doing the best we can, if you got something better lay it out.  <br />
<br />
First thing I can think of offhand is another KEI nerf &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
I know that while I have decent snap aggro I don't have the mana regen - since I don't buy buffs - to hold it for extended periods when people get really determined to be stupid and pull aggro off me (slow on incoming, leg hump, dual wield proccing weapons and wack taunt repeatedly, you know all that stuff). If people are smart about slowing and nuking, I don't have aggro problems, but neither do the warriors I group with. Changing this would be a major rework of the game engine.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think the biggest problem after KEI is the fact that the playerbase is lazy. They read that knights are the best tank so their exp group will have a knight tank by god. In my experience, I have no problem letting warriors tank (even when they shouldn't - they read that warriors are tanks so they must pull aggro off pansy knights that are 6 levels higher with 700 more HP and 200 higher AC) they do well enough for the zones I'm in - which isn't 3rd and elemental tiers. I can't make people smarter.<br />
<br />
Next problem is the total reliance on slow. If you have a slower you have a group, otherwise, you're just some tanks and maybe a cleric LFG together. Snap aggro overshadows the AC/HP gap because you have to slow right away. Slowing is the complete heal of PoP - with it, you have a group, without it, you don't. Changing slow at this point (by lowering percentages) would require reworking pretty much every encounter out there (except for the unslowable ones). This is the most feasable change yet, but still tough.  I 2 box a cleric and a shaman, and there's no comparison. Slow is overpowering.  Either make it zero aggro - I suspect making it zero aggro, while totally unrealistic - I want to punch my screen every time I get slowed - will do a lot more to fix the problem than anything else.  The mob is going to be slowed.  It's that simple. If the slower dies, the slower dies, but it's going to be slowed. Or, make it lower percentage slow so it's not so essential. Zero aggro might be a better change from a balance perspective, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
Last problem is lack of tank stacking. If there was some way to make tanks stack better.  Some thoughts:<br />
<br />
- an improved shield combined with low aggro mana efficient group heals - so spreading the damage is good and warriors have a means to do so. <br />
<br />
- Improving warriors' innate DPS isn't the answer for stacking.  Either they will do rogue DPS and invalidate the class or they won't and rogues (or whoever) will still take DPS slots.  <br />
<br />
- Add a tactics type AA (actually a level 30 disc type ability - NOT on the defensive timer - or maybe it is so one warrior would have to save the disc) so that warriors are able to coordinate attacks to get close to rogue DPS when there's multiple warriors in a group.  Say a 10 percent boost per warrior in the group after the first one. So a 5 warrior group has rogue DPS (and a cleric but no slower).  You could even add a (smaller) bonus for knights - say 5 percent per knight, but the knight doesn't get the DPS boost. 3 warriors for DPS slots with a knight tank would give a 25 percent damage boost.  Respectable, plus you'd have tanks if things went south instead of people in paper armour.  If you were forming a group, it might be worthwhile to grab a warrior over a knight because (especially on pick up groups) as you swap people in and out warriors LFG are more likely to keep your DPS up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">while removing the knights' only edge for groups. <br />
<br />
So a Knights edge should be that they can tank better than their parent class?<br />
<br />
If you think that aggro lock while tanking is their only &quot;edge&quot;, I would have to disagree! Actually  Glatius explained it rather nicely a post above.<br />
<br />
If both classes were given aggro lock, either class would fill the tank roll and playing my shaman it would not make one lick of difference to which one I picked!<br />
<br />
As a shaman I can already be main healer in a group. In PoP I do require some down time but not much. So having to choose between the two - a pally can help with heals and buffs to top of their ability to tank!<br />
<br />
So yes I have taken a look at both sides and yes I know what I am asking. I am asking to be able to actually tank as well as my Hybrids can!</div></div><hr />

It would in no way change the tankability of either class. IT would remove an EXPLOIT from the game<br />
<br />
So you're saying Wizzards, Druids, Mages et al are also exploiting for generating aggro from their nukes? Stuns are SPELLS, and what do spells do *gasp* generate aggro. You take that away from stuns you give us permission to lock mobs at will with no reprecussions.<br />
<br />
Granted that reprecussion is a benefit its called aggro. If you want to take the aggro from spells im sure all casters would be very happy with you. Otherwise, calling using stuns to generate aggro an exploit is silly. <br />
<br />
Further, it is absurd to think sony will take that from us, especially when they have given a whole line of hate spells to Sks with that very specific purpose.<br />
<br />
Ask for an improvement, stop trying to make something so natural seem like an exploit because you're wrong.</div></div><hr />

No, I know there's a lot more that knights have to offer to a group, but given the amount of time I've spend educating people (&quot;what's this recourse thing&quot; - I'm a SK not a paladin thanks), I realize that most people that play this game don't have room in their heads for more than a simple concept or two. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">As i keep saying though, we have to accept there will never be a complete balance. <br />
<br />
Lets get away from the idealised situation we've all (including me) been using to illustrate our points. Knights and warriors can and do find themselves in groups together, groups do not always have a perfect make up and heck a lot of the time it's more fun that way. If a knight finds himself secondary tank in a group he can :-<br />
<br />
prevent a mob from attacking for 10 or more seconds<br />
spot heal<br />
snare<br />
group heal (with incidental AE taunt) <br />
crowd control via root or kiting<br />
FD pull<br />
add damage by dot and pet<br />
buff peoples health <br />
Buff peoples attack values <br />
Buff the aggro of the main tank<br />
Reduce the aggro drawn by a healer<br />
provide additional mana to the group<br />
Heal himself without using up the maintanks healers mana<br />
offtank<br />
<br />
Not all at once and not in every situation, no but the possibilities exist. Non of these abilities uses aggro lock.<br />
<br />
The warrior can:-<br />
<br />
/shield for minimal advantage whilst increasing the damage taken overall<br />
offtank<br />
hit 'a'<br />
<br />
Now this secondary tank warrior feels pretty damn useless all in all. Given this situation i do feel it's fair(er) for the warrior to be the first choice to take the main tank slot, because in any other situation he can't contribute a goddamn thing that really notices. <br />
<br />
Knights can tank fine in the absense of a warrior (it does happen sometimes) There is now a bigger payoff for a full group and not every bugger is gonna wait on a perfect set up, generally in any group i'm a part of (unless there is a must-have class missing and we need to save the last spot for them) we'll pick up anybody that's lfg. <br />
<br />
Can't tell you how many times a pally heal or an SK taking on the burden of tanking have saved my arse over the course of this game. I'm regularly grouped with a SK friend who does all the pulling for us. Every spell cast by a knight in a group is one moer thing than i add to the mix.  So given we live in this imperfect world what we need to do is maximise the value of a tanks utility skills to a group.  Giving one set of tanks aggro lock whilst another languishes in the background is unacceptably unbalanced. However a world where all tanks have aggro lock or 'just enough to be competitive with aggro lock' (I still don't think that'll work, we'll either have 'enough' and take over again or too little and remain screwed) is in a way even worse.  A world where the monster only hits who the group wants it to hit is totally antithetical to stacking tanks because even if you guys get in my group your own input will be nearly as useless as my own :P<br />
If the mobs never get out of control, there's never a need for aggro control, spot heals, LoH, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense? Ah well i'm rambling i guess. one thing that can't be denied, you can make a favourable impact in a group in a secondary capacity, you can feel useful. Not so the warrior, he was designed to fulfill one role If one class can tank and has  any potential in another role no matter how slight, then a character with specialisation in one thing only should have first shot at the spot, denying him that is utterly unfair. I honestly believe I'd feel that way if i played a pally, no matter how much i thought SoE had screwed me :P.<br />

&quot;Utilty&quot; is not a valued group slot. Nor is it usually worth the lost DPS. Tank + healer + slower + dps + dps + dps is what most people shoot for.

If a knight gets recruited for his utility he makes a readily appreciable impact on his group, if I get  recruited for my DPS I'm making the mob die about 2 seconds quicker, woah i feel like such a valuable member of the group :P<br />
<br />
Glad i still treat this game like a game not a job where i tweak my group efficiency like you do Gimmel. <br />
<br />
Different scenario for you, i'm looking to fill a group in zone, i have a shaman with me already, a rogue, a bard and a mage. A paladin and a warrior are lfg in zone which will I add first? Seems like that paladin did have an advantage (however marginal).<br />
<br />
We've already established that the game isn't very fair, does making the tank class that is most common and most helpless without a group a third class citizen make things any fairer?<br />
<br />
I'd LOVE it if everyone interchanged beautifully well it ain't gonna happen though. The cold hard truth is that I slogged my way through 63 odd levels without any of the benefits of spell casting because I was under the impression that missing out on perks in exchange for a solid role in a group was considered fair. Apparently i was mistaken.</div></div><hr />

[/quote] several people have come into this thread and made some rather ass backwards comments, which I am going to paraphrase here:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
WAR, PAL, and SHD are all tank classes, and should all be equally viable replacements for each other in an exp group setting<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...now we have reached the part of the thread where I tell you, the halfwits making these comments, to shut the fuck up. no, seriously, shut the fuck up. you, with your pathetic ideas about 'fariness' and 'equality' and 'cant we all just get along?' you, who wouldnt know class balance if it was sittin in the parking lot, waiting to give you gonorrhea.<br />
<br />
there is THE tank class, and then there are the 'servicable replacement' tank classes. and the second you get these categories confused (for the developers, this happened sometime around Velious), you no longer have a right to talk about class balance. freedom of speech does not extend to fucking retarded opinions, sorry.<br />
<br />
When the warrior leaves your group, you should have a clear set of options. either A you find another warrior and life goes on, or B you find a &quot;servicable replacement&quot; tank and life goes on, but just not quite as swimmingly. ANY OTHER SITUATION - such as the current one, where warriors are the third choice - is unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Why, you ask, as you sit there FD'ed reading this messageboard, Shadowknights? Why, you ask, as you med up after rezzing yourself, Paladin?<br />
<br />
BECAUSE WE GAVE UP EVERYTHING TO BE THE TANK CLASS, AND IF WE LOSE THIS POSITION, WE GAVE UP EVERYTHING FOR NO REASON.<br />
<br />
Remove all agro from PAL and SHD spells and you know what youd have? Warriors would be the preferred tank.. PREFERRED... what a concept. Its called Balance. [/quote]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is exactly how most knights feel in a decent exp group where they aren't tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>gwyidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Allright, as a paladin (61), here is my take on the issue.<br />
In exp grps that i have been in, PoD, PoN, PoI, etc, i have always tanked, unless there is a higher level tank in the grp, as it should be. I have always noted that when i tank, i can hold agro near flawlessly. The only time anyone else besides me gets dmg, is either on AoE, or on riposte. When that happens, im the one who heals them. Sometimes we get a warrior to fill out grp, and even if hes not higher, the healer will usually want him to tank, unless hes drastically lower lvl, since i want the group more than i want prestige i dont make a fuss. As soon as he starts tanking, i start healing a whole lot more. Its a simple fact that warriors cant hold agro nearly as well as knights, obviously, you all know that.<br />
What is important here, is not that our stuns give us agro, there are other ways to gain agro. One of them is obviously doing damage. Paladins ( i dont know about SKs) do jack sh1t damage. commonly in a group, when im not MT, i can stop attacking, med a utility spell and cast it on someone, and then remem whatever i was that i had before, and there will be no change in the amount of hp the mob is losing. Unless im fighting undead, my damage contribution to the fight is minimal. Warriors are greatly superior to a paladin in the damage dept. Also, warriors have higher AC and HP. They just do. They also have defensive. Paladins have no discs worth anything. I dont care what you say, none of our discs mean jack. Defensive is what makes warriors special. I have never, not once, seen anyone BUT a warrior tank on a raid. It has been done, but it hardly ever happens. Perhaps on an undead mob a paladin will tank  because its hard to NOT get agro with slay. Warriors dominate the uber world. Paladins dont tank on raids, warriors do, simply because they can tank phenomanally better than paladins can. warriors will always be the prime choice of raids. From what i hear, that is what a lot of people spend time doing, raiding. What have i tanked? &quot;ummmm PoD stairs mobs. &quot;What have you tanked? &quot;Emp, RZ, 4 or 5 other gods... cant really remember&quot; <br />
If you want to talk xp grps only, well, you can have our stuns... (perhaps i should speak for myself... you can have MY stuns) tbo i cant remember the last time i stunned to interrupt a caster. (isnt this the root of the problem?). I dont need stuns, a wonderful spell called Flash of Light gains agro just as well, or better, sure it has a few drawbacks... such as if I leave agro range while the mob is blinded, it runs off and brings a train, but thats only if i leave agro range. Its really easy to stay in there. <br />
I bring a lot of benefits to a grp, other than perfect agro management. I run backup healing, i perserve cleric mana, i have a unique buff, i can off tank, root, rez, fear(Undead only). none of those means anything in the face of increased DPS. Take away the ability to hold Agro without the risk of FoL, and what you have left is either a high risk tank, or a low dps knight who brings to the grp what everyone else in the group can already do better.<br />
everything i bring to the group besides tanking and agro management can be done better and more efficiently by a pure class. I simply eliminate the inconvienience.<br />
<br />
TBO, you guys have all the glory and the fun of tanking. You get the big mobs, the ones everyone wants to kill because they drop badass loot, and they are prestiegous(sp?). Because you tank the big mobs, you also need to be uber, meaning you get first pick of the guild loots. Raids are called because they cant get a warrior online. Paladins get to sit in xp groups for dozens of hours getting &quot;uber&quot; aa's, that we can use on less than 5% of the games mobs. Realize that even though we can hold agro flawlessly, that doesnt mean we have complete dominance. When you say knight, you mean Paladin and Shadowknight. Neither of us have complete controll of groups. Its not like groups ONLY take paladins or ONLY take SKs. They take both<br />
Raids take ONLY warriors.<br />
<br />
you guys want to be viable for xp groups? fine. I want to be viable for raids. <br />

Hahahahahahahaahaaaa. You aren't viable on raids? Gimme a break. You might not have quite so defined (read: one dimensional) a role as i do but you seriously need to apply a little effort if you feel useless :p Wanna know how hard i had to work to feel like I was contributing to the raid when the other 10 (higher level) warriors were online? (minor exaggeration: we had about 10 warriors in guild average of 4-5 per raid)<br />
<br />
I've quit raiding btw, didn't have the time online to keep up and frankly feeling like a fifth wheel didn't do much for my enthusiasm. now the only place i can experience eq is in a group situation, is it fair for someone who can't raid to be gimped because those who can hapen to occupy a 'prestige' position? If anyone seems to be motivated by envy here it certainly ain't the warrior.<br />
<br />
Right at the start of the post you tell us how the cleric who ignores your advantages through ignorance asks the warrior to tank, you then go on to show how despite loosing the tanking position you're actively helping the group to succeed, look at the positives of your situation just a bit more before you go all green eye'd monster on us dreary old meatshields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Gimmel old boy, if you still have warriors as main tank then why is removing aggro lock (which trivialises the game and makes for less use for a utility type tank, i.e. less enjoyment for him assuming a warrior in group) a problem? or are you also getting hung up on raids versus exp?</div></div><hr />

Therefore, using your logic, Clerics should be completely unwanted for groups because of course they play such a vital role in a raid.  And Shamans should be completely unwanted for groups because of course they play such a vital role in a raid.    You could indeed make the same arguement for Enchanters as well.  Using your logic, because all these classes have a very well defined and vital raid role, they deserve to be screwed blued and tattooed when it comes to getting groups, just like you say Warriors should be.<br />
<br />
Hello McFly!  That arguement doesn't fly!<br />
<br />
So quit crying about the fact that you usually need at least one Warrior when taking on a boss mob.  It's our raid role, our only raid role, very few of us actually get to fullfill it, and the rest of us are as about useful as tits on a boar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>gwyidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">I dont know about the rest of paladins, but personally, i soloed or duo'ed from.... about 30 to 50, and even when warriors dont have defensive, they dont need it for the mobs they fight. Warriors skills cap higher, they have more innate STA and hp modifiers, pre high end loot, it would be real hard for a paladin or SK to exceed warrior stats without twinking. and yes, you must suffer because a lot of wars raid, because i suffer because they do. Warriors raid = guilds accept them at lower levels. several of the high end guilds on my server accept war apps at 61, and pally apps at 65. because we arent needed. If this was not true, i would not be without a guild right now. I have been without a guild for at least 9 months. As ive said before, the key of the argument isnt about luxury, and about allieviating inconvieniences. It about the situation that when it comes down to it, what class do you absolutely have to have. In an xp group, a tank, and in a raid, a warrior. If you think about it, you warriors have it good. you get a portion of the XP grps (ok, not an equal portion with SKs and Paladins) and you get ALL of the raids. Speaking strictly on the MT role. you can bet that no matter what happens, warriors will still be the only ones to tank on raids. meaning that any increase that warriors recieve in gaining XP grps takes more of what little the SKs and Paladins have, because XP grps is all they've got.</div></div><hr />

wanna tell me that having given up all the use you gained from spells I still shouldn't be a better choice to tank is fairer?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Funny enough i did duo quite a bit back then - with a paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Khondor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">I would have to agree with Valeris on most of what he has stated. Being able to lock agro by any tank class is just not very good for the game. It used to be that you learned your class hunting in dungeons, then the easy route came and everyone unlearned thier class's and played in outdoor zones. Now in PoP the outdoor zones even offer some sort of &quot;risk&quot; and to make a tank be able to snag agro at will, just makes it easy for dumb players to multiply. <br />
<br />
I have some thoughts on the subject though that I wouldnt mind seeing an opinion on. Forget about the warriors agro for a moment please, lets just all agree its messed up bad for now. you can look at the agro situation with Knights in two ways I believe. 1) Knights have spells that cause too much agro generation, and its causing them an unfair advantage. or 2) Other casters spells are not causing enough agro to make the Knights have to work for thier money. <br />
<br />
I dont know how easy it would be to make Knights spells not cause so much agro, and if they did nerf them, how would that effect the weapon combo's a LOT of warriors are using to gain agro at the moment anyway. Not every warrior has a EB weapon, a LOT of warrior's use weapons with effects right out of a Knights spell book to generate more agro. Nerfing the spell agro component on those Knights would very likely nerf the proc on many war weapons. <br />
<br />
2) God it seem like a HORRIBLE idea to generate more agro on slow or heal's, but making more agro on Dumb_wiz_001 over nuking, or psycho_ranger_002 for out damaging even the rogue risk free is not a bad idea. I believe making more agro happen to detrimental spells is a good idea. I know they tried this once, and it failed misserably. <br />
<br />
This would actually put the warrior in worse condition I know that. But you see the bottom line here IMO is the war agro situation is already broken. The main reason you cant add more agro to a damage dealing class at the moment is because there is no warrior alive going to taunt off a freaked out PoP mob when it gets its hooks on a caster.  A knight can do it, but up the agro just a tad more and not even a knight could save that guy.<br />
<br />
A second reason I would not like to see the Knight class nerfed is, I have a 55 paladin. I had him in sebilis back when that was the &quot;place to be&quot; years ago, and I still have nightmares for how screwed up it was for them. After being told by another paladin that was forming a group, sorry bro, we need a real tank I rolled up my warrior. My warrior is now 65 he has all the nice stuff, he is in the high tier planes and Im very proud of that character. I rarely have issues getting a group, even if some people prefer a Knight class. This may be because my warrior is in really good shape, but I dont think thats the case, I think its because a warrior is still considered a damn good tank in PoP. I for one am willing to share the tanking chores in pick up groups.</div></div><hr />

Glat:<br />
In my experience, ie, tier one pop grps, the group makeup is not Tank, CLERIC, SHAMAN, ENCHANTER dps dps its<br />
tank, healer, slower/mezzer, dps dps dsp<br />
Each of the classes you specifically mentioned that has a very clear raid role, shares its groups with others. In pod stairs for example, 3 days in a row i xp'd there for 6+ hours without a cleric healing. I had a druid two days, and a 2nd shammy the third. One of those days, we didnt have a chanty, we had a shaman, and on one of those days, we had a bard slowing and mezzing. these groups werent perfect. At a lot of times the situation got quite hairy. and we died somtimes. But what im trying to say is that you can include warriors on that list of classes that have a clearly defined, absolutely necessary raid role. and, just like chantys, shamans, and clerics, you can include them on the list that has to share XP groups.<br />
granted the ideal group will always be, Cleric, Chanty, Shaman Tank, dps dps.... but i hardly ever get totally ideal groups, and i bet a lot of other people dont get them ALL the time<br />
and warriors get xp groups, dont kid yourself into thinking they dont. I see warriors lfg less than i see enchanters lfg. so either they arent trying, or they have a group. <br />
<br />
Val:<br />
Warriors arent gimps, in pure tanking (read: damage absorbing) ability, paladins fall far short of a warrior standard (at least i do). we make up in the extra healing required on us, by ensuring that none is needed on anyone else.<br />
and as i said before. None of our utility we bring to a group is somthing that cant be done by anyone else. or, everyone does what we do better and more efficiently. they are just lazy and we make their lives easier.</div></div><hr />

With that said when will things ever be enough there has to be zome stopping point right? Verant has stated warriors are the baseline do you really think that the baselineneeds to move up to accomidate a ballance issue? No one likes nerfs we all deal with them and cope. Now don't get me wrong I am not saying warriors don't need some improving but when is it enough?? is it enough when anyone can single handedly kill all the mobs in eq? I mean the way I see things classes are always whinin about how they need a spell upgrade or a epic upgrade so on and so forth (cept warriors i must say up untill recently they don't whine much) but there has to be a point to stop there has to be a baseline and unfortuantely for the warriors (if you see it that way) they are the baseline.<br />

Are we absolutely certain that with knights tanking as it stands people wouldn't consider them for a group over a warrior if the additional stuff he could do would add to the party? <br />
<br />
Given that I still hear people tell me &quot;well we could do that if we had a tank&quot; I'd say that yes, taking away knight's aggro lock (or at least the perception of same) would result in kunark group styles again.<br />
<br />
Knight's have had aggro lock since the day the game came out.  It was never considered useful, even when the knights had more HP and AC than the warrior that the group waited for before doing anything.  Why? Because warriors have defensive, so we need a warrior. Even when the warrior was level 52 (hell, level 40), warriors still had defensive.  Try pointing out that this warrior didn't and you'd get blank stares. &quot;but, but, warriors have defensive, we need a warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warrior died because he ate every enrage? He still had defensive, accept no substitutes.  Warrior never disced on the raid and died repeatedly? Still has defensive. Maybe he's saving it for something. Better let him tank.<br />
<br />
I honestly doubt the ability of the powergamers to do anything but select the &quot;best&quot; class for the job and then set the conventional wisdom that you &quot;have to&quot; have that class. And I don't expect the typical gamer to do anything but blindly follow the conventional wisdom.</div></div><hr />

Apothes, I'm not looking for upgrades because i think perhaps taunt skill is fair enough where it stands, i'm not looking for increased HP advantage over knights cause that would be a major step back towards kunark, If we can't boost warrior aggro generation up to the stellar hieghts of knights, then balance suggests we need to drop knights aggro back to around our level. and again i have to ask the question: why should knight mob control be better than ours if that makes us obscelesent outside raids?  <br />
<br />
Pardon my ignorance by why not?  Why shouldn't Warriors generate control like Knights?  How is making groups suffer better for the game?<br />
<br />
Glatius provides a stellar example of why your stance is folly (hopefully he won't be too mad I reposted ^_^):<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm tanking in BoT. A Krieger is pulled, one of the tougher mobs in the area. The level 65 Shaman resist debuffs this very hard hitting mob and then attempts to slow it. 4 times he casts slow. 4 times he gets resisted. 3 times I successfully taunt the mob back onto me. The 4th time taunt failed and I was unable to taunt it back before the Shaman died. My AE taunt was unavailable. I had been shielding the Shaman, but the timer ran out. And as a result of the Shaman not getting slow to stick on the mob and dying, I died, and the Cleric died. Everyone else made it out.<br />
<br />
Now, the Shaman did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. There was no question of skill here. We were all doing our jobs as we should. Yet because my aggro control was so unreliable we had a partial wipe. I don't consider having people randomly die because of the unreliability of taunt and other Warrior aggro generation to be a good thing. The Shaman couldn't hold off. He couldn't do anything that would reduce the aggro from these spells. The mob needed to be slowed. Normally the first or the second would have stuck and things would have been controllable. But this time it didn't work out that way. Now, can someone please explain to me why it is a good thing to have such an unpredictable situation that when things go just a little wrong through no fault of your own that having deaths result is a fun thing and adds to the excitement?<br />
<br />
So what Valeris wants everyone to believe is that the game is better off if everyone has wild agro.  I would rather believe Warriors need a boost.  It is interesting to note in this example, even if I was robbed of every agro generating skill I could still act to save the Shaman.  I would heal.  I might get root to stick.  So taking agro away from Paladins in situations like this makes Warriors more attractive because...?<br />
<br />
Once again I want to point out your quest to tinker with agro lock seems misguided.  The real problem with Warriors is need something more.  Hacking other classes won't fix any of Warrior's current issues.  It ignores them for what you mistakenly believe will be better shots at groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Actually you're making my case for me, thanks!<br />
<br />
Everyone bills the warrior as having enough of a mitigation advantage that he would be a good 'safe' tank, I'm willing to trade on that versus the flexibility you just so eloquently pointed out you provide. it certainly can't be worse than the current balance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">In fact if you think about it, the more the shit hits the fan, the less you can rely on the perfect group to pull things off without incident. The more incentive to stack the hand in your favour. Efficiency suddenly becomes less important than survival ! i like having a pally in a group as an example, if i go down then there's someone to step up in my place, plus he has LoH or fast heals to save party members when the clerics busy healing me, he can stun to buy time and share tanking with me if things get tight -thats the type of group experience that gets the blood flowing not this 'sit here for debuff and die' situation that Aggro lock encourages....</div></div><hr />

It is all about trade offs, a  hybrid needs better gear then a warrior to tank in the same place, but he can hold agro better.

<br />
This is not my experience in BoT.  Maybe if the Warrior has 10k buffed HP it might be true they don't have to slow as soon.  But for the average Warrior who is pushing 6-7k, it isn't.  They just can't wait that much longer, a few seconds perhaps, and that's hardly enough for the Warrior to even begin to lock aggro unless there are some lucky procs.  But maybe what you mean is that with my 7100k buffed HP and 1340 buffed AC and a two handed warrior only sword from NTOV, I and people like me, shouldn't be tanking in BoT because we can't take the beating from an unslowed mob you believe every Warrior can take.<br />
<br />
And yet you contradict yourself.  Doesn't slowing the mob make it more tankable?  Doesn't slowing the mob reduce it's DPS?  Now how can you possibly claim that a Warrior needs less gear than a Knight when the Warrior in your scenario is going to be fighting an unslowed mob initially while the Knight fights a mob that is slowed immediately?  75% slow is a huge DPS decreaser and yet you would have us believe that a Warrior in mediocre gear tanks an unslowed mob as well as a Paladin in good gear tanks a slowed mob?  What exactly are you smoking friend?  Send some my way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">Ok gear is over 8200 hp buffed, good gear is over 9200 hp buffed, and it does not take elemental plane gear to get these numbers.  Then you add all the right AA's and tanking in bot becomes easy. <br />
<br />
Now a  warrior with less then 7k buffed and no AA, is going to have a hard time. But a paladin in the same lvl of gear  and no AA's will have  something like 6400 hp if not less, and he will have a harder time living long enough for a ch to land against a unslowed mob.  Many groups do not have a shaman to buff the melee making it even more important to have the right amount of hp's.<br />
<br />
A lot of pop is for the big boys, if you have the gear and AA's most of the experience zones are very easy, if you lack both you will not be able to do you job well enough to be worth invited you into a grp.  That is just the way it is, and no the average lvl 65 warrior does not have 7k hp, the number is way over 8k. My guild is not in the elemental planes  but even our paladins have over 8k hp.<br />
<br />
And yes when pop first came out I did grp with warriors that had very little hp's and the cleric had to start casting CH before the mob came in, and if slow did not land by the second cast the warrior would die every time.  Nothing is worse then grouping with a tank that can not tank 2 mobs long enough for mez to land on one.<br />
<br />
As for saying less gear for a warrior to tank in pop then a hybrid, that is because to make CH worth casting, a tank need a certain amount of hp's which a warrior can reach easier then a hybrid.<br />
<br />
AA make a huge difference in tanking in pop,  when my guild MT first tank mini names in bot, the mobs had to be slowed or the cleric would run out of mana before it was dead. After he got the right AA's he did not even use defence disc since he was not taking enough damage to be worth wasting it.<br />
<br />
A warrior using a 2h none proc sword is going to have a hard time hold taunt, bazaar does drop some nice 1h proc weapons that do a good job. or just go to CT and farm some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any game with randomness in it will have situations where even if you do everything right, it still fails.  In the example you cited, the result of 4 bounced slows was &quot;a partial wipe&quot;.  A couple people lost a tiny bit of exp, and things stopped until after rez and rebuff.  This is not the end of the world.  It is frustrating when it happens, but you go back out there and still end the day up.<br />
<br />
If a group does not do everything right, then they will more often have to stop for rez, rebuff and med.  The idea is to slant the odds furthest in your favor, and reward skill players by having them go thru this situation the least.  And that is a key point.  With some one with agro lock tanking in that situation, there is a good chance no whipe happens.  In fact, there is more leeway to do things less right.  Groups can be a little sloppy.  Casters can overagro because the agro lock person, even if they loose agro(which by definition is rare), they can get it back faster and at range.  The reward for skill is lowered, as the chances of negatives happening are less.<br />
<br />
Lowering knight agro is to my mind the best solution to tank balancing because it rewards skill players, and penalizes unskilled players.  All tanks will have to learn proper use of taunt button and how to time taunts, and proximity agro, and all the other little tricks.  Casters will have to be more attentive to agro, how to time debuffs and slows, how many times to concussion/boggle etc.  <br />
<br />
I actually met a 60 enchanter the other day who did not know what the Visage series of buffs was.  Most notably she did not know that Horrifying visage would help me hold agro(she may have known about the agro decreaser ones).  It was just one of those spells sat at back of her spellbook and was never used.  The really sad part is I know she was not ebayed, as I know some of her friends.  She just admitted she had mostly soloed, and avoided warrior MA's(because &quot;war's are broken&quot;...she did not know exactly how tho).  Knights allow these people to manage to get bye.<br />
<br />
Rarlier in your post, you ask:<br />
<br />
How is making groups suffer better for the game? <br />
<br />
I suggest that it is not making groups suffer, that it is in fact balancing the game, making it better, and increasing the reward for skilled, knowledgeable play.  Will good groups occasionally have a death, or whipe, thru no fault of their own?  Yes, on occasion.  Will bad groups, and bad players die much more frequently than good players and good groups.  I think so, and I think the difference in frequency between these two will expand, and that is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the complaining that melee made about rage, just ended up nerfing the mobs so the weaker melee classes can tank then very well.<br />
<br />
Call me psychotic but I never asked for enrage to be removed - the arguement for it at the time was that since warriors generally had to use two weapons it was a further nerf of our ability to tank in comparison with a knights ability to aggro via spells if we're removing that then lets have enrage back by all means....adds to the chaos ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">One thing you need to realize.  Back in Kunark, hybrids were hurting.  The MAIN reason why they were hurting is because hybrids, at that time, were seen as the sum of their parts.  They were part warrior and a small part caster.  However, they weren't designed very much as a combination of the two...they were literally a weaker warrior with casting abilities.<br />
<br />
However, since then (SoL for the most part), hybrids have been taken away from that terrible situation.  They were given upgrades to their defensive abilities (rangers have 240 defense if I remember right, and knights have practically equal to warriors defensively), and their spellcasting abilities were tuned to be more combat oriented (procs, fast casting spells) as well as unique (hybrid line, specific class buffs).  They were turned from a weaker warrior with spells from their &quot;parent&quot; class...into a Paladin, a Shadowknight, and a Ranger.  They literally came into their own as a class.<br />
<br />
Paladins were no longer a warrior with cleric spells...they were now a Holy Warrior, the scourge of the undead.  True, their spells borrowed from the cleric's in several places (buffs and rezzes), but they were more tuned to be used in combat, with fast heals and procs.  Shadowknights were no longer a warrior with necromancer spells...they were now the Masters of Hatred.  True, their spells did borrow from the necromancer's in several places (DoTs, lifetaps, pets), but they were also tuned to be used in combat.  Rangers were no longer an offensive warrior with druid spells...they were now a true guardian of the forest, archer extraordinare (yes, there's still issues).  As with the others, their spells did borrow from the druids in several places (buffs, DS, utility), but...ah, you know what I'm going to say here.<br />
<br />
Another thing you need to realize.  Back in Kunark, the hybrids not only were very weak as a class...but people simply didn't know much about other classes.  Those that did became far ahead of the rest (uber guilds, anyone?).  How long did it take the majority of people to realize that PotG/Marzin was better than Aegolism?  Clerics were known as the best HP buffers...it never occured to them that the other classes might have something better than one of the cleric buffs.  Lack of knowledge about what the hybrids could do was something that did a great deal of damage.<br />
<br />
People know more now.  Ask your group sometime what they think a paladin brings to a group other than agro control.  Many healers who have a say in the tank know that a paladin can heal, much more so than the other two tanks.  Most damage dealers know that a SK can do more damage than the other two tanks, especially if he has his pet out.  <br />
<br />
Knights have always had agro control...even in Kunark.  Therefor, removing (ior to be exact, LOWERING) the insanely huge agro difference here will not bring us back to Kunark.  Not only have knights had too many upgrades for that to happen, but how can you return to Kunark by taking away something you DID have then?<br />
<br />
Third and final thing.  Back in Kunark, knights were not only weak in comparison to warriors...but they were weak in comparison to the mobs you were fighting.  Knights didn't have as sufficient defensive capabilities as they have now.  Now we can tank mobs...warriors aren't the NEEDED class.  You NEEDED a warrior back then...hybrids couldn't take it.  <br />
<br />
It wasn't so much that knights were just that much weaker than warriors (tanking gap)...it's that knights were too weak to be a sufficient tank most of the time against mobs, not even bringing warriors into the picture.  Knights have been changed tho (see above), and now the Knights have sufficient defensive capabilities to tank these mobs....not even bringing warriors into the picture.<br />
<br />
This is why Knights think it'll be a return to Kunark...they're constantly under the belief it was because they were that much weaker than warriors.  Knights just didn't have the tanking ability compared to the mobs tho, THAT'S why they weren't good tanks.  Warriors had nothing to do with their inability to tank back in Kunark...the gap was there, but knights were just that much weaker compared to the mobs they were fighting.<br />
<br />
As long as Knights keep their sufficient ability to tank the mobs they need to tank, I really don't see why a warrior can't be much better.  If you leave the Knights the ability to actually BE a tank (which means being able to take the damage as they are currently able to), then making a warrior able to take more of a beating shouldn't affect knights in any serious way, and we won't even come close to going back to Kunark-era.</div></div><hr />

AGGRO is not supposed to be a benefit of any spell, THAT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY SAY IT AFFECTS HATE, it is a detriment to the spells. In the old days, read pre-KUNARK and Kunrark, when paladins were paper tanks it was a detriment for them similar to casters, getting aggro was BAD. How do I know this?

<br />
Granted that reprecussion is a benefit its called aggro. If you want to take the aggro from spells im sure all casters would be very happy with you. Otherwise, calling using stuns to generate aggro an exploit is silly. <br />
<br />
Further, it is absurd to think sony will take that from us, especially when they have given a whole line of hate spells to Sks with that very specific purpose.<br />
<br />
Ask for an improvement, stop trying to make something so natural seem like an exploit because you're wrong.  <br />
<br />
Now, what I REALLY SAID...<br />
<br />
 they made KEI/Virtue etc, spells UNABLE TO BE CAST on targets lower than XX level. Why can they not make Stun spells with a similar restriction? Well more than stun, snare and flash of light also come to mind. It just seems very odd that such low level spells are the staple of high level casters. Make these spells not affect the mob in any way, no resist, no effect , no aggro. NONE... now because of this they may need to add higher level versions of the spell with associated mana costs/delays. etc. Look at the mana-pool of a lvl 9 paladin, take the cost of his stun spell, and scale that up to a level 65 paladin and make it compareable. That would be balance. A level9 paladin cannot cast chain cast the stun because they will go oom relatively fast, the same is not true of a level 65. <br />
<br />
<br />
Make Low level spells, that have higher spells in their spell chain UNCASTABLE on targets above a certain level.<br />
<br />
Do i say anything about taking aggro away from spells? no.<br />
<br />
What am i saying? I am saying that using spells designed for level 9 mana pools and level 5-10 mobs SHOULD not be used against level 60 mobs, that have no chance at being affected and being used SOLELY to generate aggro above and beyond what they should.<br />
<br />
I understand that this would take a lot of thought and research into changing. As a powergamer myself, I have playtested for several RPG's and participated in national RPG campaigns as a player and a gamemaster, Making any change to a fundamental concept such as aggro can have huge ramifications...<br />
<br />
THAT is why i have never said REMOVE aggro from stuns, that would be even more of an exploit, than using stuns for aggro.<br />
<br />
However, removing aggro from spells that a mob is IMMUNE to, is something I think does have merit and would not open up an exploit. IE chain-stunning a mob so that it cannot do anything, that would be one possible exploit if stun aggro was removed... but if the mob was immune why should it get upset at the silly caster who is trying to hit him with a spitball from 1000 yards?</div></div><hr />

I'm not calling for a knight nerf, but I really REALLY agree with Redhenna that trivialising the game at high levels so people never have to med, don't have to bother with aggro control etc is a Bad Thing.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of different issues here though:<br />
<br />
1)  Many many people won't take a warrior to group unless they know they've got good enough gear to hold aggro.  Which is a minority of warriors.<br />
<br />
2)  On the other side of the coin we have paladins holding aggro permanently on stun locked mobs for zero net mana expenditure.  A lot of people probably won't take a warrior for this reason too.<br />
<br />
I think it's a good thing for knights to have a (for practical purposes) innate ability to blow a bit of mana to get them safely through slows at the start of a fight, or guarantee mezzed mobs won't turn on the chanter.<br />
<br />
I just think warriors should have something similar too.  Whether it's quite as good as what knights have is irrelevant, you're talking about making warriors safe to group with not turning them into aggro gods.<br />
<br />
And if a knight wants to lock aggro he should be able to.  But he should also have to blow enough mana that he needs to med a minute or two afterwards.  That keeps the ability non-trivial.</div></div><hr />

Really?  Then when I ding 65, in one level, I'll recieve 800+HP?   I doubt it.  I have one level of ND to go and that will give me maybe another couple of hundred HP, which still won't put me over 8k HP buffed.  Now, I'm in helanic tundra and some odds and ends from NToV, we're not talking Luclin loot, but I would say it's at least a little better than the average Warrior.

I'll believe it when I see it.  I've seen groups do this when no alternative was available, but they didn't like it.  And they added a tank as quickly as they could.  So I don't see this as being a real concern as of yet.<br />

<br />
Don't know much about Paladins huh?  Yes, to actually stun the mob it takes a high level stun spell.   However, the low level stun spells still produce aggro, seemingly as much aggro or very nearly as the high level stun spells.   So currently it costs very little mana to hold aggro.  It costs more to actually stun the mob.  But it's still not that huge (FoA is only 65 mana after all).  Keeping a mob stun locked can cost mana, keeping aggro costs very little.</div></div><hr />

Any ranger or bl with all defensive AA done can tank very well in pop. In fact a BL is one of the best tanks, not only can he hold agro with his fast casting lvl 65 slow but he can buff the grp very well.  In fact some of my best grps have a bl as a mt and we are able to get an AA in 60 to  80 min, in hoh.<br />

We are talking about the A grps that net maximum experience very fast, everyone is lvl 65 with over 100 AA's, these types of grps it is all about mana regen, pulling and holding agro with zero down time.  And no you do not need to be in the elemental planes to do these types of grps.<br />
<br />
If you are not lvl 65 yet with all the defensive AA's you are still in school learning to do your job, and any other lvl 65 melee class can do you job a lot better.<br />
<br />
A bl slow is over 3.5 sec to cast, which means fast casting focus effect and bor work to make it an even faster casting spell,  under 2 sec.  So all a bl has to do if 2 mobs are pulled is slow both tank one and his pet tanks the other.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Heh, I hate to break this to every Warrior out there but agro is not an absolute sure thing.  I wonder if Warriors out there think it is just something you &quot;turn on&quot; and forget.  What some believe is &quot;agro lock&quot; is really just a good initial punch and letting agro ride afterwards.  To do true and absolute agro lock would take a lot of casting.  I can't heal.  I can't move.   Melee drops to nill.  Its just too expensive to do beyond initial debuf.<br />
<br />
But reguardless it doesn't matter because Warriors are still too weak in their current state to deal with POP monsters.  Too many are ignoring this and concentrating on &quot;agro lock&quot; and &quot;infinite agro&quot; and trying to pin blame elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Hey lets take agro away from all Paladin and SKs spells.  Do you know what would happen?  Paladins and SKs everywhere would dance with joy!  Suddenly I can do things in raids I couldn't before!  Some monsters are extremely susptable to stuns.  I would gladly sac my DPS to drop the monster's DPS without fear of dying.  Heck get multiple Paladins in on this and its nearly a complete lockdown.  I can stand directly next to a monster and toss heals onto the MT with impunity.  I can randomly root monsters left and right without having them come back later to harm me.  SKs have similar fun without worries.  Joys of joys...TAKE AWAY THE AGRO. ^_^<br />
<br />
So what happens in exp groups?  More or less the same.  Warriors will struggle to regain control when something slips.  What am I going to do?  I'll stun it with a hard stun (which has no agro) and retry Taunt plus continue to melee.  That few seconds of stuns gives me free melee hits and should be a good shot at regaining the top spot on the hate list.  If not, repeat as necessary.  If worse comes to worse I'll just root it and start healing.  An SK will have to comment on what they can do but I suspect they have just as many things in their bag of tricks.<br />
<br />
So in the end, robbed of current agro techniques I will maintain SKs and Paladins still have the tools necessary to protect casters beyond what Warriors can bring to groups.  We will just shift strategies and heck it might make it more interesting.  What are Warriors going to do?  More of the same is what got Warriors into the jam in the first place.  No amount of nerfing will ever fix this.<br />
<br />
So once again I ask, exactly how is the much vaunted Agro Lock a problem for Warriors?  I fail to see it.  The real problem is Warriors lack the skills and power necessary to deal with POP monsters.  Groups are difficult enough to construct and run as is without laboring under the illusions they need to be made even trickier for the sake of &quot;fun&quot;.  Go ahead and weaken other classes if you want.  Warriors will still be in the same bad shape reguardless of where any other class stands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its all about relative power.<br />
<br />
if knights can do it, and we cant, its a problem - if &quot;it&quot; is a fundamental improvement in being a tank (such as agro lock).<br />
<br />
remove agro lock, and the perception will change, and warriors will be #1 tank again, instead of #4 or 5.  thats all it will take.<br />
<br />
the &quot;downside&quot; you propose, is not a downside - its returning spells to their original intention.  I dont hate paladins.  I dont hate paladin stuns.  I just want them to be used for stunning mobs, instead of for retardedly huge agro.  I would LOVE to see a team of paladins working together to stun-lock a raid mob.  what a cool idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">Read my post again.  How is removing agro lock making Warriors better tanks than Knights?  SKs and Paladins bring more to groups to deal with POP monsters than Warriors can ever bring and it has nothing to do with agro generation.  As long as this is in effect Warriors are a poorer choice for attacking POP exp monsters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">Heh, I hate to break this to every Warrior out there but agro is not an absolute sure thing <br />
<br />
True statement, but I think the term &quot;agro lock&quot; refers to the idea that a knight can grab agro to such a point, and with such a low mana cost that it is unlikely that you will loose it.  Also inherent is the idea that if you do loose it, you can regain it with a far higher probablility of success.<br />
<br />
But reguardless it doesn't matter because Warriors are still too weak in their current state to deal with POP monsters. <br />
<br />
Odd, I deal with PoP monsters most every day, and with success.  I have to work harder, have spent more time in attaining an agro weapon than most knights spend in attaining their agro spells, but I do succeed.  I am not  too weak.<br />
<br />
Hey lets take agro away from all Paladin and SKs spells. <br />
<br />
Ummm..no.  The one most common suggestion is to take away agro from spells that do not effect the mob otherwise(low levels stuns being the prime example).  Most of us who are against &quot;agro lock&quot; in fact do believe that knights should retain an edge in agro, just that it should be smaller, and more costly.  Let's try not to exagerate what we are suggesting.<br />
<br />
So in the end, robbed of current agro techniques I will maintain SKs and Paladins still have the tools necessary to protect casters beyond what Warriors can bring to groups <br />
<br />
I think most of us here maintain the same thing.  Knights retain utility beyond what a warrior does, and have many tools that warriors do not.  That being the case, why should equalizing agro be any issue to knights, however it is done?<br />
<br />
What are Warriors going to do? More of the same is what got Warriors into the jam in the first place. No amount of nerfing will every fix this <br />
<br />
The single biggest complaint that warriors have is that knights are preferred in exp groups over us due to the agro difference between warriors and knights.  We have become second string, usefull in exp groups only when there is no other tank available.  What I believe, and I think some others believe, is that lowering knight agro generation, and raising the mana cost of that agro generation would make us more viable in exp groups, without further trivializing game mechanics.<br />
<br />
So once again I ask, exactly how is the much vaunted Agro Lock a problem for Warriors?  <br />
<br />
Because we are in direct competition with you for tanking spots in groups(the only role knights and warriors usually get invited to groups for).  With knight agro as it is, and warrior agro as it is, it leads groups to pick knights first, and most warriors sitting on the sideline with LFG on for hours.<br />
<br />
The real problem is Warriors lack the skills and power necessary to deal with POP monsters. Groups are difficult enough to construct and run as is without laboring under the illusions they need to be made even trickier for the sake of &quot;fun&quot;. Go ahead and weaken other classes if you want. Warriors will still be in the same bad shape reguardless of where any other class stands. <br />
<br />
Again, I know for a fact that I can successfully tank in PoP.  I do it almost every day.  If there were no knights in the game, none of this discussion would be happening.  Warriors would tank, and casters and other melee would manage their agro, and groups would still be successfull.  The only way that I believe warriors lack is in relation to knight agro.  <br />
<br />
Knight agro rewards lower skill players, who now have a much greater margin for error than they did before.  This is why I feel that the issue is not warrior agro, but knight agro.<br />
<br />

<br />
Edited to include a reply to a comment made while I was slowly typing out my reply.<br />
<br />
 SKs and Paladins bring more to groups to deal with POP monsters than Warriors can ever bring and it has nothing to do with agro generation <br />
<br />
I disagree with that statement.  Knights bring a different things to groups than warriors if you ignore agro.  Warriors bring a little better tankability, knights bring utility.  As many knights have commented here, the reason knights get groups is their agro lock, not their utility.  Loosing knight agro lock would offer groups a choice, tankability or utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A student is givin the job of balacing 3 randomthings to each other and when the student is givin the assignment they are told that A random thig is the baseline for the balancing. so the student take the info on random thing A and figures out in's and outs of random thing A than then proceds to do the same thing with B and C now the student finds ouot that there is quite the despartiy between A and B and A and C although B and C seem to be fairly balanced. So the student taking the shortest way to bring all 3 in balanvce raises A up to B and C and brings all things into balance. The student then returns to the proffessor and hand him the finalised balance of the 3 random things. The Professor looks at the studens paper and probtly grades it a F. The student is outraged, and procedes to tell the profeccor all 3 are in balance why have you givin me a F, The professor camly states that when he assinged the project he stated that A was the baseline so being the baseline b and c sould have to change if they were not in balance. you cannot modify the baseline to create balance as it will upset the baseline.<br />
<br />
SoE has always stated Warriors are the baseline for balance. now ginvin the above example (not that great of one I know but been a roiugh day at work) do we raise warriors to reagian balance? do we make a change to the base which all things are balanced off of  to bring 2 things out of many into balance? Do we not take the risk of having then to rebalance everything else to the new baseline?<br />
<br />
I am not saying warriors don't need anything I am saying that if warriors get something it should be to change the baseline not to bring them in balance with a class since the repercussions go way beyond bringing warriors in balance with the one class they are out of balance with.<br />
<br />
Flame away but if you truely think about what I have said how can you say the correct thing is to bring warriors up to par with knights?</div></div><hr />

What do raids and exp groups have in common?  We are talking exp groups here, raid balancing is an entirely seperate issue.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">Warriors as &quot;the baseline&quot; was a concept which grew out of the infamous, yet tragic period called &quot;melee balancing&quot; which changed too many things at once without considering the dramatic impact they'd have over the long-term.  Warriors were never any &quot;baseline&quot; untouchable class prior to that, and that &quot;melee balancing&quot; was a colossal failure, which led to today's mess.<br />
<br />
On to something else which has been a pretty big source of irritation for me as it's becoming a common theme.  That there's some special set of rules which says that &quot;fixing' warriors should or can have no negative impact on another class.  This is wrong, other classes have been &quot;overfixed&quot; causing all sorts of negative impacts on warriors.. we've been stomped on since early velious... and it hasn't been till late SoL/Early PoP up to now that you start seeing warriors go &quot;wait a second, this is BS&quot;.   <br />

<br />
Why don't the warriors dare to think differently? I'd agree with Frodlin's point that every expansion warriors 'baseline' looks a lot more base, but let's face it - aggro lock wasn't an issue in Velious (but knights still had it), ditto Luclin, ditto PoP until people decided that rezzing the slower every time the BoC didn't proc was stupid and took the inferior tanking of knights in exchange for the now critical aggro lock.<br />
<br />
But warriors look at this now important ability and demand a return to the &quot;standard group&quot; - that is, warrior tank - by removing the knight's edge.  Red points out that utility doesn't get groups. Tanking does. So if you wonder why the knight's oppose this so vehemently, that's why. Warriors are still fixated on the Kunark style standard group - with them as the tank. <br />
<br />
While their HP and AC advantages have eroded with the advent of +100 (or +180 or whatever gear), it's still PERCEIVED as a advantage (and I'm sure we remember the thread about paper tanks - your typical healer assumes a warrior has NNNN HP.  Just like you think defensive is useless it's perceived as a raid breaker (and I think defensive is overrated too) and the knight's utility which you perceive as beng so amazing (and I don't play a warrior because I find them one dimensional, so I don't disagree here either) doesn't mean anything to joe cleric and shaman trying to pick a tank for an easy exp group.<br />
<br />
SKs didn't develop fear kiting as a soloing style because of their high demand in groups after all...</div></div><hr />

Even using the higher level stuns only, mana is still not a problem.<br />
<br />
I was all for the monk nerf, the manaburn nerf, the cleric nerf (well they called the druid incomplete heal a nerf) and am in favor of a knight nerf.  Balance is a two way street - bringing classes up to balance with each other trivializes the game, sometimes you have to bring classes down.  I disagree with my brother paladins that aggro lock is a good thing.  I think we should be 15% better at aggro then a warrior (pulled the number from my butt by the way) and SK should be 20%.  What I would personally like to see happen: <br />
<br />
1.  Make spells generate no aggro if the target cannot be affected by the spell.  <br />
<br />
2.  SK spells I refuse to comment on.<br />
<br />
3.  Increase a naked warrior HP/AC gap to - beats the hell out of me.  Naked because I hate using itemization to fix anything.<br />
<br />
4.  Unlink the discipline timers for all classes.<br />
<br />
5.  DPS -  to me it appears balanced between warrior and knights.  Any change here should keep the current ratio in place.<br />
<br />
6.  Rework the /shield skill.  Make it so a warrior can take 100% of a mobs damage (by shielding a single character) for a limited amount of time.  I think 10 seconds with a 40 second refresh might be a good starting point.  Add a hate component - mob should get pissed if it cannot hit its victim.  <br />
<br />
I don't think this would break knights and would give warriors the ability to prevent damage to a groupie while attempting to get aggro back.</div></div><hr />

Aeka - so you're gonna take a cheap shot but can't be arsed to offer an opinion? i thought better of you. Like Red said since you guys are apparently not going to suffer from removal of aggro-lock (yes i know it isn't but it's a handy tag.) Why not dare to think differently?  <br />
<br />
No I made a just because the suposition was funny.  It is ridiculous to think that anyone should be able to tossing spells without conseuqnces.  I laughed.  I'm sorry if that upset you.  And just in case anyone is thinking it: agro lock doesn't allow anyone to cast for free, it just pushes more work onto tank.<br />
<br />
As for suggestions on what Warriors could do, that has been beat to death in other topics.  Some are really worthwhile.  This is a goofy enough thread as is...lets not venture into that.<br />
<br />
I guarentee that many Paladins will be saddened but just peach keen if agro was complete removed from stuns.  On incoming, Paladins will do silly things like chain root (we have more than one you know) and other fun tricks even if they generate zero agro.   People still avoiding the answer on how Warriors are magically made better by this since the fundementals haven't changed.  However groups aren't just up of me.  If the debuffers and healers aren't having fun it doesn't matter how happy I am.  Making players have &quot;more fun&quot; by slowing them down will just as likely cause them to log out.<br />
<br />
Some are still glossing over the fact that Paladins will still have the utility of the spells even if they generate zero ago.  Stuns cause monsters who are stunable to stop what they are doing.  Its free mitigation for me if I'm tanking.  Its a chance to escape for others.  Plus toss in the fact Paladins (and SKs for that matter) are self sufficient because of the mana they carry.  Both offer buffs and effects.  Plus a bigger bonus is that blue mana bar can be turn into HP.  Exactly how do Warriors compete with most of this?  Show me the Warrior skills out there that are as group friendly as these, please.  I want to believe Warriors are just fine as is but I don't see it that way.<br />
<br />
I've spoken my stance.  If you aren't convinced by now you will never be swayed.  I see the Warrior class as need help in big ways where agro is only a part of the big problem.  If one wants to continue to be romantic about how well off Warriors are then nothing I can present will change your minds.<br />
<br />
You want to know what my fear for the future is?  If Lost Dungeons of Norrath is going have encounters as chaotic as some found in POP, then all melee will be left even farther behind which means Warriors take the worst of it.<br />

I guess we're comfortable with our concept(one dimensional,frustrating and boring as it sometimes is), it' s a basic staple of fantasy literature (and this is supposed to be a RPG). if we were to change the character into a support class i.e. leave the knights undisputed king tank then in someways we destroy the whole concept that attracted us. And then there's if you like the problem that what you're basically telling us is that since SoE screwed the pooch on making you useful (although it's not so clear cut as that, i think i've spent less than 8 hours in my entire EQ life in an 'efficiently' balanced group as described by Gimell and you guys when you tell me how you 'never' get a group) all the trade offs we accepted to be 'the tank' were for nothing. <br />

I guess yes we are jealous of our position as 'best tank' it's part and parcel of our whole concept. Take that from us and we aren't a 'warrior' anymore....<br />

<br />
That is an exageration in a big way.  Warriors are fixated on having a  group, becasue right now, we simple are not wanted.  I do not want to see knights unable to find groups as warriors are now, but I would like to see tank classes balanced at least a little better, so warriors are at least competative for exp group spots.<br />
<br />
I guarentee that many Paladins will be saddened but just peach keen if agro was complete removed from stuns. <br />
<br />
Who is suggesting that agro be completely removed from stuns?  I do not think anyone is.  Removing agro from stuns that do not affect mobs has been suggested, but that is a completely different thing.  Reducing agro in stuns has been suggested as well, but again, no one has said remove all agro from stuns.<br />
<br />
People still avoiding the answer on how Warriors are magically made better by this since the fundementals haven't changed. <br />
<br />
If knights did not have &quot;agro lock&quot;, then warriors would be a more acceptable tank in exp groups.  Thje difference in group desirability would be narrowed.<br />
<br />
If the debuffers and healers aren't having fun it doesn't matter how happy I am. Making players have &quot;more fun&quot; by slowing them down will just as likely cause them to log out. <br />
<br />
You are right, we should not slow things down...in fact, let's just give every one 65 and full aa's to make them happy.  Bad idea?  Of course.  The game has to have some challenge, some risk vs reward, or you might as well do just that.<br />
<br />
Some are still glossing over the fact that Paladins will still have the utility of the spells even if they generate zero ago.  <br />
<br />
Again, no one is saying remove all agro from knight spells.  Also, your knight peers tend to believe that without an advantage in agro, even with that utility knights would be second choice for exp groups behind warriors.  Knight utility has been discussed(notably in Val's other thread along these lines). <br />
<br />
Exactly how do Warriors compete with most of this? Show me the Warrior skills out there that are as group friendly as these, please. I want to believe Warriors are just fine as is but I don't see it that way. <br />
<br />
I know, because I have done it, that I can group successfully in pretty much any PoP tier 2 or 3 camp.  From that perspective, I can say that warriors are fine.  We can do our job, do it well, and be a part of a successfull group.  Our only, and biggest issue is that when competing to get that group spot, knights tend to be chosen over us for one reason...agro.  You have utility, we have increased tankability(small, but there).  Without the overwhelming agro edge, I feel that warriors will be at least more competative in getting those group spots.<br />
<br />
<br />
If one wants to continue to be romantic about how well off Warriors are then I can present will change your minds. <br />
<br />
It is rare anyone says that warriors are well off.  But we are only poorly off in relation to knights.  If we simply cannot tank, then why do warriors, once we do get group invites, or grouping with friends and guildies, succeeed very well? <br />
<br />
I've spoken my stance. If you aren't convinced by now you will never be swayed <br />
<br />
You have done nothing to convince me(I cannot speak for others).  You have exagerated what we are talking about, stated that warriors just cannot do our job(while offering no evidence) in exp groups, and offered no good reason to support what you are saying.</div></div><hr />

Someone in the know, is it even possible in the game engine for a spell to stop producing hate? i'm woefully underequipped to answer these questions myself heh.<br />

As to the assertion that people would leave the game if tanks only had control at the level of warriors I can state confidently that groups remained workable with warrior level aggro so that at least is a straw man arguement.</div></div><hr />

She suggests that warriors are completely unable to function, when I think we all know better than that. With all those things in mind, everything she says has to be suspect.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I misread what she is saying.  What she suggests to me is that people will take easy, risk free exp over harder more risky exp.  The facts support this perception.  If people wanted harder more risky exp, then Knights would go without a group and Warriors would be snapped up.  However, we know this is not the case.  Therefore she is correct, people will take easy, risk free exp if given a choice.  What you purpose is to remove that choice.  Thereby insuring that whoever tanks, Knight or Warrior embodies harder more risky experience.  Or at the very least more time consuming experience.<br />
<br />
And I don't believe she suggests that Warriors are completely unable to function, but that the tools the class has received to assist them against the upgraded PoP mobs are insufficient when compared to the tools given to the Knights.  Remove the Knights from the equation and everyone would deal with the weaknesses of the Warrior, no arguement there, but there they are.  And there they are going to stay.  So either they give us more tools, increase the effectiveness of the tools we have, reduce the effectiveness of the Knight's tools, remove some of the Knight's tools, or continue to have us under desired. <br />
<br />
I find it highly doubtful they'll remove any of the Knight's tools.  I wouldn't particularly advocate they reduce the effectiveness of the Knight's tools, although that appears to be exactly what you're suggesting.  I'd hope they'd consider giving us more tools, but they're history in that regard isn't promising.  Which leaves increasing the effectiveness of the tools we do have, which might be possible.<br />
<br />
I still stick with the belief that random deaths because the random number generator didn't favor you is pretty lame and not fun and exciting.  Knights know they can get a certain effect if they push the right button.  There is no random factor to it.  Hit icon X and receive effect Y.  The only randomness to it is do they fizzle and have to immediately hit that icon again.  Meanwhile the Warrior hits button X and recieves effect Y perhaps 75% of the time, if that.  No other real option available to use consistantly.  Nothing that you can say, yes I'm going to get exactly the effect I expect and can depend on, except for things such as /shield and AE taunt which have fairly long refresh times.<br />
<br />
Now, why is it that it's more fun and exciting to have unreliable effects and less fun and less exciting to have dependable effects?  If undependable is more fun, shouldn't fizzles do things like blow up on the caster causing damage?  Wouldn't that be more fun?  Not knowing if that Wizard's nuke will actually cast or disastoreously fail nuking away half his HP?  Perhaps ports should have the chance of failing and porting you into the middle of a random zone such as the grey or plane of fire or some such?  Wouldn't that be fun and exciting?  People would certainly have to be much more alert, right?</div></div><hr />

So an attempt to remove the knight's edge in snap aggro will flip the switch back to Kunark style groups (i.e. &quot;we can't do that without a warrior&quot; ) because that's the easiest way to get experience. There's not 2 easiest ways to get exp.  There is one BEST class for a tank slot.<br />

Except people will decide one is easier.  Therein lies the rub. Either we have today's mess, or Kunark's.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to:<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Valeris <br />
So Kiztent thinks aggro lock is all that makes a knight possible in a group but Aeka thinks they're fine without (or else he's just yanking my chain.) Guys get your story straight will ya?<br />
<br />
Not a matter of getting stories straight.  We have different opinions. Aeka (I guess) believes that people will look at the utility of knights and weigh that in picking a tank against the durability of a warrior.  I don't believe it. Aggro lock is nothing new. And all this utility and aggro lock never, ever mattered because &quot;we need a defensive tank to do that.&quot;  If slowing wasn't so critical, knights aggro lock would continue to not get them groups - just like it did for every day up until aggro lock was deemed essential.<br />
<br />
I understand the warrior's problem, but I don't believe that trying to turn back the clock is going to fix them - and taking away the knight's one (perceived*) edge in getting groups I believe will have the net effect of turning back the clock. By fix I mean a viable solution for all the tanking classes - just as this isn't right, neither was Kunark.  But we need to recognize that the typical player doesn't seem interested (or able) to make complicated decisions about the best tank (or any slot in the group really). Nor do most players (especially with LoY dyes, what a nightmare) have the tools to make informed decisions.  Who knows how many HP those two tanks LFG at the zone line really have? And how much difference does AC really make? Until actual HP and AC totals are shown to everyone who is interested in looking (which our Zek friends won't go for at all) possibly along with some kind of dynamic server reputation, all people have to go on is their perceptions about who is best, whether it is actually a paper tank, or a well kitted warrior who has spend his DKP and plat to maximize his ability, a PLed knight who doesn't understand how to use his aggro spells or one that has played for years and learned how to work with his abilities to excel in groups.<br />
<br />
* - I say perceived in parenthesis because while it is true, the perception that it is true is what is important.<br />
<br />
That being said, there is another problem.  TOO DAMN MANY MELEES. No one wants to play support classes. Jeeeesus. Most groups I've seen are 4 melees huddled around a slower and a healer - with more melees LFG and clerics getting snapped up as soon as they log in.  It's not unusual for my cleric and shaman to get blind tells - without LFG up - to come exp in a given location (&quot;hm, he's in PoK, check if he want to group&quot;).  Despite the perception of knights as the best tanks, my SK, who is higher level (and better equipped not that anyone could know that), NEVER gets those tells - there's already a surfeit of melees trying to scrape up a healer and a slower to get exp. I actually had to log my enchanter in (who doesn't get group requests by virtue of being role 24/7) because 4 melees and a cleric wasn't cutting it for a group. Blargh. I HATE playing enchanters.<br />

<br />
Glatius, an occasional random death is better than standing around with virtually no risk (apart from getting so distracted by the group chat that the heal doesn't land) isn't it? Just going with the flow and removing any impediment to mindless exp sessions just seems, wrong. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u212"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p212">What she suggests to me is that people will take easy, risk free exp over harder more risky exp.

Thereby insuring that whoever tanks, Knight or Warrior embodies harder more risky experience. Or at the very least more time consuming experience. <br />
<br />
Just because people want something, does not make it the best choice.  Charmers did not want to be nerfed, but it was the best choice for the game.  Many did not want the recent KEI level thing fixed, but it was best for the game.  Many want easy, risk free exp, but since it totaly voids the concept of risk vs reward, it is not  best for the game.  Even with a warrior tanking in an exp group, there are limited risks, deaths are still fairly rare in most exp camps with skilled players, and exp comes in faster than it ever has in this game.  How much more do you want?<br />
<br />
And I don't believe she suggests that Warriors are completely unable to function <br />
<br />
This next quote is from her:<br />
<br />
Warriors lack the skills and power necessary to deal with POP monsters. <br />
<br />
I see no other possible way to interpret that.  She falt out says that we are unable to do our jobs in PoP, when I know that in fact I am able, and think most of us here have also been able to do our jobs in PoP.  Knights just do it better, hence all these threads.<br />
<br />
So either they give us more tools, increase the effectiveness of the tools we have, reduce the effectiveness of the Knight's tools, remove some of the Knight's tools, or continue to have us under desired.  <br />
<br />
This is a true statement.  To be perfectly honest, I would not throw a fit at any of those if it improved warrior balance.  I do have one option that I think is best(reduce the effectiveness of knight tools, to the point where they maintain an agro advantage, but it is somewhat costly in mana, and not as large an advantage), but right now, I just want to be competitive again.<br />
<br />
I still stick with the belief that random deaths because the random number generator didn't favor you is pretty lame and not fun and exciting. <br />
<br />
This is called risk vs reward.  If there is no risk, why should you be rewarded?  Random deaths do happen, but if you do everything right, they should be rare.  And let's look at the consequences of that death.  Cleric clicks epic, heals dead person, rebuff dead person.  If dead person is a caster, then maybe everyone takes a quick afk while they med back up.  15 minutes after it happens the dead person has already regained any exp lost.  We are not talking about huge, terrible consequences here.<br />
<br />
Now, why is it that it's more fun and exciting to have unreliable effects and less fun and less exciting to have dependable effects? If undependable is more fun, shouldn't fizzles do things like blow up on the caster causing damage? Wouldn't that be more fun? Not knowing if that Wizard's nuke will actually cast or disastoreously fail nuking away half his HP? Perhaps ports should have the chance of failing and porting you into the middle of a random zone such as the grey or plane of fire or some such? Wouldn't that be fun and exciting? People would certainly have to be much more alert, right? <br />
<br />
Some nice exageration there.  If a warrior has taunt fail, it simple does not work.  No other consequence, other than those that arrive directly from taunt not working.  As to the question at the start of that paragraph, I fall back on risk vs reward.  There has to be some risk, and in return, you get your reward.  This is true soloing, grouping and in raids.<br />
<br />
So an attempt to remove the knight's edge in snap aggro will flip the switch back to Kunark style groups (i.e. &quot;we can't do that without a warrior&quot; ) because that's the easiest way to get experience. There's not 2 easiest ways to get exp. There is one BEST class for a tank slot. <br />
<br />
As I have said before, I do agree that if warrior agro = knight agro, this would leave warriors prefered in exp groups.  I have also stated that I believe that knights should have an agro advantage, just that it should be reduced.  It is my hope that by doing so, tank classes would be relativiely evenly balanced.<br />
<br />
I understand the warrior's problem, but I don't believe that trying to turn back the clock is going to fix them - and taking away the knight's one (perceived*) edge in getting groups I believe will have the net effect of turning back the clock <br />
<br />
And yet earier you had said &quot;Aggro lock is nothing new.&quot;  We are talking about a whole different balance.  Kunark knights had difficulties with getting groups due in large part to warrior defensive advantage.  That advantage is mostly gone now.<br />
<br />
possibly along with some kind of dynamic server reputation <br />
<br />
OMG, can you imagine what this would be like.  Sorry to digress some what off topic, but I just have all these visions of people kissing ass bigtime to improve their reputation.<br />
<br />
That being said, there is another problem. TOO DAMN MANY MELEES. No one wants to play support classes. Jeeeesus. Most groups I've seen are 4 melees huddled around a slower and a healer - with more melees LFG and clerics getting snapped up as soon as they log in <br />

1)  Make the average warrior able to reliably keep aggro through slows and mez breaks.  Make them at least safe to group with, and you'll change the perception that most warriors are too dangerous to invite.<br />
<br />
2)  Reduce knight aggro MODERATELY, not nerf it entirely, so they're still significantly better than warriors at holding aggro but it's not a trivial ability.  For me this has a little to do with class balance, and a lot to do with making the game less trivial at high levels.<br />
<br />
Make knight aggro holding non-trivial and many warriors still won't be safe to group with, so the overall perception of them will remain that of a broken, unreliable grouping class.<br />
<br />
Making warriors safe to group with while knights are still disproportionately better aggro holding tanks should help, but most warriors would probably want more.  Don't expect knights to thank you for suggesting their aggro holding capabilities should be reduced to help warriors get groups though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah let me get to work and I will... and yes fudementally her argument is not sound and I will explain more in a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">All the below quotes come from the last post made by Aeka<br />
<br />
But regardless it doesn't matter because Warriors are still too weak in their current state to deal with POP monsters. Too many are ignoring this and concentrating on &quot;agro lock&quot; and &quot;infinite agro&quot; and trying to pin blame elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Who says warriors are too weak? The pallies? There is no blame to pin there is a thing called game balance and iot is not balanced at this time.<br />
<br />
Hey lets take agro away from all Paladin and SKs spells. Do you know what would happen? Paladins and SKs everywhere would dance with joy! Suddenly I can do things in raids I couldn't before! Some monsters are extremely susceptible to stuns. I would gladly sac my DPS to drop the monster's DPS without fear of dying. Heck get multiple Paladins in on this and its nearly a complete lockdown. I can stand directly next to a monster and toss heals onto the MT with impunity. I can randomly root monsters left and right without having them come back later to harm me. SKs have similar fun without worries. Joys of joys...TAKE AWAY THE AGRO. ^_^<br />
<br />
you know as well as I do no warrior has said take away all pally spell aggro (not that i have seen mind you if you have seen a post that says that please quote it for all of us here. Oh and if you quote me then you would be quoting a pally so I don’t count.<br />
<br />
The spell agro should be cut back I would guess around half of it's current state for stuns. Also mana cost needs to be raised on stuns and stuns if they do not affect a target should cause no agro period.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what happens in exp groups? More or less the same. Warriors will struggle to regain control when something slips. What am I going to do? I'll stun it with a hard stun (which has no agro) and retry Taunt plus continue to melee. That few seconds of stuns gives me free melee hits and should be a good shot at regaining the top spot on the hate list. If not, repeat as necessary. If worse comes to worse I'll just root it and start healing. An SK will have to comment on what they can do but I suspect they have just as many things in their bag of tricks.<br />
<br />
The above reason is why agro needs to be reduced and stuns that don't affect mobs not cause any aggro and raise mana cost it still gives knights a edge while not making aggro trivial anymore. <br />
<br />
The mana needs to go up because there should be downtime associated with the ability to stop a mob from attacking and getting aggro back. the mana cost going up is open to debate on how much that I havent sat down to figure out yet.<br />
<br />
So in the end, robbed of current agro techniques I will maintain SKs and Paladins still have the tools necessary to protect casters beyond what Warriors can bring to groups. We will just shift strategies and heck it might make it more interesting. What are Warriors going to do? More of the same is what got Warriors into the jam in the first place. No amount of nerfing will ever fix this.<br />
<br />
Yes that is what should happen warriors will cost the group less mana in there is no downtime waiting for the pally MT to med up to hold her/his aggro like they do. <br />
<br />
No amount of nerfing will ever fix this<br />
<br />
I call BS on that statement because if you fix the disparity then the playing field is leveled and each class has it's pluses and minuses as it is the knights are all ++ with no minuses where the warriors have some minuses.<br />
<br />
So once again I ask, exactly how is the much vaunted Agro Lock a problem for Warriors? I fail to see it. The real problem is Warriors lack the skills and power necessary to deal with POP monsters. Groups are difficult enough to construct and run as is without laboring under the illusions they need to be made even trickier for the sake of &quot;fun&quot;. Go ahead and weaken other classes if you want. Warriors will still be in the same bad shape regardless of where any other class stands.<br />
<br />
Lack of skill I don’t believe them to be lacking as they perform very well in a raid setting and well in groups knights on the other hand perform well in raids doing heals and dps and such yet in the exp group they perform overly well so much as to make it so casters need not watch aggro at all they can set a macro up to nuck and go afk not saying any do but they could with the current ability of knight aggro. Warriors don't need that kind of aggro SoE would have to spend month's retuning the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The biggest problem SoE has is they listen to the whiners on the boards from time to time and when they make a balance change they make a big one IE taking knight tanking ability from the way it was to kunark and putting it where it is now in one change and that is bad because now agro which we want cause we can take the hits is too much and dumb the game down. <br />
<br />
SoE if you are listening you need to make changes gradually to achieve balance in small steps untill you reach a point you arte happy with it. and go back astep if the last one was too much. this makes nerfs much more not a nerf in the fact the step is small and the players really wont notice it too much and would cry less about nerfs. The problem lies in the swooping balance changes you make then realize they are not good and then have to fox the disparity with a change. take the monk for example had you changed them slowly you would eventually gotten to the point where they are now instead of where you put them then had to un nerf them.<br />
<br />
Balance changes need to be made in small steps not giant leaps if you don’t believe me take a look at the history of balance issues in EQ and where the big changes got us :p<br />

So an attempt to remove the knight's edge in snap aggro will flip the switch back to Kunark style groups (i.e. &quot;we can't do that without a warrior&quot; ) because that's the easiest way to get experience.

Whatever Frodlin.  If I said Velious, would that make a difference? How about Luclin? I had the exact same freaking problem getting groups until PoP for the exact same freaking reason.  Knights aren't perceived as tanks. The only saving grace is that in PoP aggro lock is more important than better mitigation.  If warriors had the same aggro lock and continue to have better mitigation (which they do), knights will still be left in whatever the hell era of the game you want to call it. Pre-PoP, pick an expansion then, they all sucked before PoP for knights as much as PoP sucks for you.<br />

<br />
Truth doesn't matter, perception does. I haven't seen anything to indicate that people are aware of the variance in warrior gear - the paper tank thread on the cleric boards is a perfect illustration of that - the cleric ASSUMED since he was dealing with a warrior, the warrior would have enough hit points to tank. Unless the grouping process turns into a display of stats, people will continue to ASSUME that a warrior has better mitigation, even if that particular warrior doesn't.  Hellllo Luclin (Kunark, Velious, whatever), LFG is now a weird SK only guild again once the knight's one advantage gets taken away. I have yet to see compelling evidence that this isn't the case.  Kazzuk says that 20 percent better mitigation at the top end doesn't matter (where you can compare apples to apples). Suuuure it doesn't.  Want to look at some bullshit? That's bullshit there. You find me a cleric that wants to heal 20 percent more in an exp group, all other things being equal, and I'll believe you, otherwise your arguement reeks.<br />
<br />
You can't tell me that after years of being perceived as top dog for HP and AC - correctly - and having a total LOCK on the tank spot in a group that people will conveniently forget about it once Sony evens the aggro playing field.  That's just plain wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
Like I've said, you're STILL fixated on the Kunark group where the warrior is the sole tank.  You STILL have the same advantages that granted you that slot lock until midway into PoP and you want to take away the knight's ONE advantage that mitigates that lock that you've had until now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">Why don't they just give us taunt2 which is a no fail taunt which generates as much aggro as a pally stun and has the same refresh time as a pally stun? Wouldn't that fix the problem?  That and maybe a 20percent boost over pally AC and HP and defensive skills.<br />
<br />
If we were to go the route of changing all pally stuns to 0 aggro, they are still very useful for other abilities aside from aggro lock (buffs, root parking, backup and downtime heals, resurrection, debuffs (cancel magic), DDs &amp; undead DDs, calm and pacify for pulling).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet you appear to be fixated on maintaining your PoP advantages, come what may.  Did it occur to you that finding a group prior to PoP was difficult not because you weren't perceived as a tank, but because Warriors were still perceived as a valid choice and out numbered the Knights?  Now we're not a superior choice or an equal choice, we're a last choice.  So of course you're getting more groups, because there are a hell of a lot more Warriors in the game than Paladins and Shadow Knights.  Make the Warriors third choice and of course the Paladins and Shadow Knights are going to get a hell of a lot of groups.<br />
<br />
And yes I understand you don't want to return to Kunark.  I have no desire to stay in PoP.  If these desires are mutually exclusive, I can't get out of PoP unless you're returned to Kunark and you can't stay out of Kunark unless I'm forced to remain in PoP, then you're going back to Kunark if I have any say in the matter.

I'd love to, but I don't see a lot coming from the other side.  I understand all of your points - I even think they're valid, but instead of trying to reach a middle ground the proposals I see want to remove the knights advantage by giving warriors an identical ability while keeping all of the warriors advantages intact.

You have far too romantic of a view of warriors.   During Luclin warriors were just as screwed as they are today, except they tended to go to Fungus Grove and solo mushrooms from time to time for exp.   The decline of warriors came *way* before PoP, but you wouldn't know this.   When Cazic Thule was revamped, warriors were the only class in EQ who had their primary skill *disabled*, it was through some silly old world coding, but the effect was... it simply didn't work.<br />
<br />
Kiztent, your  &quot;keeping all the warriors' advantages intact&quot; argument falls upon deaf ears... because warriors HAVE NO ADVANTAGES outside of a raid environment.    <br />
<br />
Your &quot;Knights aren't perceived as tanks&quot; argument is asinine.... because for the last 6 months, knights have been tanking in PoP *just fine*.   No one's going to all of a sudden go &quot;wow, this guy I've grouped with for the last 6 months can't tank any more&quot; if your ARTIFICIAL and OVERPOWERING advantage of aggro lock is balanced out.   <br />
<br />
If you'll look at Furor's proposal, you'll see something that does exactly what you claim isn't doable the changing of potential group dynamics and tanking roles within groups... the only people trying to &quot;maintain an old status quo&quot; are you and others who have an unfair advantage and a motive to keep it that way.</div></div><hr />

Call it what you like.  The direct problem isn't aggro lock or differences in mitigation. It's the total and overwhelming dependance on slowing for an exp group. Aggro lock has been a knight thing since the game started. It never made a bit of difference until fast slowing became an absolute must have ability.<br />
<br />
Removing aggro lock won't remove the complete dependance of exp groups on slowers. It will only make grouping worse.<br />
<br />
Giving warriors aggro lock won't suddenly rebalance the game.  It will just swap back to the way things were and trivialize a bunch of raid content.<br />
<br />
Dropping the aggro on slow would be (without thinking much about it) a better fix. Then aggro lock wouldn't be the must have ability, but knights would retain that ability if it was deemed useful (it wasn't before, but what the heck). It could make raid content easier by allowing bosses to be slowed more agressively (although honestly, shaman are going to slow fast on bosses anyway - you have to - dropping slow aggro will just mean they die less). I have no idea how this would change things overall.  I know DPS classes could go faster and harder with a knight tanking, but a warrior would continue to mitigate better. To me, that's a real trade off. There are noticible advantages and disadvantages to either path (the cleric wants a warrior so he can heal less and play with his hammer, the rogues want a knight so they don't have to dork around with evade and getting slapped around).  Setting warriors to knight aggro and maintaining the rest of the gap that guarenteed warriors groups until PoP isn't a tradeoff. If you don't see this, you've got huge blinders on.<br />
<br />
My suspicion is that this change, or any one like it, would create a certain amount of flux in the grouping process until the power gamers decided what gave them the best experience. Then either knights or warriors would be left in the cold again.</div></div><hr />

dropping aggro on slow = very bad idea if I need to explain ask but I assume you can figure out the concequences of dropping aggro on slow yourself.<br />
<br />
Power gamers will always bend the rules to fit them but the amout of power gamers to the player base is not that big. but if SoE continues to dumb down exp gorups by allowing locked aggro for little mana cost or giving warriors a new ability to lock down aggro then everyone will be a power gamer and eq will be a game any (mentally challenged person can play) I for one do not want that. and no I am not saying someone with disabilites should not be able to play just they should not be able to do it as effectivly as a not disability person this is in mental capacity and it comes accross bad so don't flame me too bad I guess I am trying to say is that proplr need to think and use skill to advance at a rapid rate not have it handed to them.<br />

In that case your arguement that warriors who were considered essential for groups (not good enough - ESSENTIAL) for 3 years won't get suddenly thrown out of groups because of a change in groups dynamics is asinine too.  Except it isn't - we see today that it's quite true and it's the root cause of your complaint.  People will happily throw any class that isn't in favor by the wayside to pick up the &quot;best&quot; class for their groups.

 I think it is rather obvious that aggro-lock is an exploit of the system. The fact that any class can use what is supposed to be a detriment, IE AGGRO from a situation to an advantage is wrong.<br />
<br />
If anyone disagrees with this... just ask the wizzard to chain stun the mob next encounter.. see how BENEFICIAL the aggro lock is supposed to be, or the Cleric since the cleric has the exact same spell line as paladins.<br />
<br />
STUNNING a mob to gain aggro is supposed to be a detriment, for pal it is not, so clearly there is a problem here.<br />
<br />
The whole argument that using spell aggro is an exploit is clearly saying that aggro from those spells should be eliminated (unless they are saying that it's an exploit, but they think they should keep exploiting, only it should cost more mana to exploit, which would be an odd assertion).</div></div><hr />

no one has said anything about 0 Aggro pelase see my long post on a explination of what needs to be done it's on page 15 has a bunch of quotes in it.  <br />
<br />
Umm... No one said anything about 0 aggro?? I did on several posts in this thread starting on page one :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah well you are the exception to the rule ;) and I assume you see now why 0 aggro would be bad or at least I hope you do.<br />
<br />
and like I said my meory gets bad after like the first 10 pages now that we are on 17 I am lucky to remember what everyone said. but i belive the consensous of the warriors is not to move spells to 0 aggro :) I could be wrong It has happend before hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">I think reducing stuns, and only stuns, to 0 aggro would be a great idea for paladins.

So how do we balance the ability of pallys being able to chain stun a mob endlessly? a lot of encounters would have to be retuned. Or are you missing the fact if you take 6 pallys with high end stuns tyhey can keep a mob from doing damange long enough to kill it cleircs would be obsolete druids and shammys can heal the mt enough in thius case for exp groups it would be fine but in raid settings it would break EQ worse then it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">Can pallys not chain stun a mob endlessly now? I don't see how this addresses the issue of class balance, pally's being uber compared to warriors, which is the real motivation behind this thread.  At least if the stuns were changed to 0 aggro there woulndn't be the aggro lock imbalance issue.  THen you could start worry about the fact that 6 pallys can keep a mob stunned indefinitely.</div></div><hr />

If a pally is tanking it then yes they can (but since there are only 3 stuns that work on mobs over 55 maybe 4 not going ot count and one is a AA then one pally can not keep it from doing dmg at the rate you could get rid of the cleric chain.  if there is no aggro this allows 6 or hell even 20 pallys can do that and have the disc war keep aggro. (incase the mob gets some rounds in need someone to tank and not interupt stun castin) hehe<br />
<br />
So do you see yet why this is bad to remove all aggro?<br />
<br />
I want a balanced game that is challenging not a game that has no risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">oooohhh I see you're point now.<br />
<br />
Good one too.<br />
<br />
Hmm... Ok, well, back to the old drawing board.  Maybe if (like I stated on a page in this thread WAY back) if they just made pally stuns require a ton of mana?<br />
<br />
I still think a viable solution is a taunt 2 with no chance of failure and gives the warior as much aggro as a pally stun with the same refresh time as the fastest pally stun.</div></div><hr />

The whole argument that using spell aggro is an exploit is clearly saying that aggro from those spells should be eliminated (unless they are saying that it's an exploit, but they think they should keep exploiting, only it should cost more mana to exploit, which would be an odd assertion).  <br />
<br />
Please if you quote me read all of my statements.<br />
<br />
I mentioned why it was an exploit... and how to fix it... and neither one said to remove all aggro from stuns..<br />
<br />
lets look at this hypothetical..<br />
<br />
If for example I am the lord of fire and you are mister wizard...<br />
I am 100% immune to fire, i take baths in Lava, i wash  my hair with flames, when you cast fireball on me, it tickles and feels good. Why would I ever get upset at you? And why with tall the rest of your part hitting me with weapons, slowing me, casting cold spells (brrr) should I ever choose you to attack first? Either one you cant hurt me, since i am immune to fire, or two you are too dumb to memorize a spell that could hurt me, either way, I would kill you last... <br />
<br />
So now we jump to EQ...<br />
<br />
Uber Giant comes running.. uber Giant is immune to stuns.. you cast a level 9 stun on him, he is immune.. so obviously he makes a beeline for you, ignoring the rogue backstabbing for 1700, the wizard nukeing for 5k, the shaman slowing him 75% and attacks you who is doing ABSOLUTELY nothing by stunning.<br />
<br />
Does this seem correct?<br />
<br />
What I have said, and said over and over, if they want to remove aggro lock, they need to make LOW level spells that have HIGHER level counterparts unable to be cast on higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
ie...<br />
a level 10 spell cannot be cast upon mobs &gt; level 30<br />
a level 20 spell cannot be cast upon mobs &gt; level 40<br />
a level 30 spell cannot be cast  upon mobs &gt; level 50<br />
<br />
these spells would cause NO EFFECT and NO AGGRO if attempted to cast<br />
<br />
etc... this may need tuned but I hope you get the idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">And yet that is not what you said in your post. You clearly said that using aggro is supposed to be a detriment to using stun spells, and that using them to gain aggro as a benefit is an exploit. This would still be the case regardless of whether the stuns land or not and regardless of how much mana they cost.<br />
<br />
So which is it? Using what is supposed to be a detriment (spell aggro) is an exploit (which you said in the part I quoted), or it's only an exploit if the spell doesn't perform it's primary effect because of level/resist/immunity (what you are saying now)?<br />
<br />
Not to mention that for most paladins that are 62+, they don't need to use any low level stun anymore (especially if they have divine stun), so removing the aggro from lower level stuns will do nothing to help the plight of the warrior at that level.</div></div><hr />
