<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have the ability to two-box my Warrior and Cleric. Both level 48. I'm looking for new lands in which to fight.<br />
<br />
I've never been to the revamped CT but was wondering if I could 2-box at the zoneline. What might the perils be? Are there 2 mobs when you zone in or 8 or none? Do the buggers still love to run at 20% health? And can I expect trains to the zone like the good ol' CT?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of waiting until my Cleric dinged 49 just for the 90% rez factor. But I really need some new hunting grounds. I levelled quickly in various dungeons along the way but now I find myself in Dreadlands....and well...*cough* need I say more.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was two boxing here at 60 with lvl 47 cleric used up about 50% mana on single pulls. Unless your gear is as good as mine is now and cleric has good gear +kei +horse I doubt you can two box in CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Szerath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure thats the safest bet for you. The mobs in CT hit fairly hard and fast, it's really adivsable to bring a slower with you. Also the casters here drop a nast /slow dot. If your going to try it, the only cleric spell that will cure this dot is Pureblood from the Loy quests spells. I have trio'ed the zone line with my bot cleric and a guild shaman..but we still had a rough go if we took adds.<br />
Oh and the mobs have gobs of hp...so your fights are going to be long with just you ...really long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haha glad I asked before zoning in.  Thanks for the advice.  Best I go find myself a good spot in some other zone.<br />

<br />
Tooaxe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Szerath:  You say that pureblood cures this dot.. how about radiance?  just wondering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">educational off topic:<br />
cure deases=cure slow you may have to cast it more then once depending on the spell...<br />
radiant cure one = cure slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would try any Kunark zones, OS or KC come to mind.  At 48, with 2 box, I'm sure you'd make some pretty good xp.  The new CT would be nasty for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">City of Mist should be good for you until 51/52ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SolB bats and bugs (especially at the SolA zoneline, because its the least train prone) would take you into the low 50s as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SolB was great to me - I went from 34 to 45 in the pool/window room - train free I might add...<br />
<br />
However upon trying to make the move to the bats...there always seems to be some monk soloing in there...always.  Hence the reason I found myself in Dreadlands...<br />
I do like SolB - I suppose with the pok books its not too much a hassle to poke my head in.  I usually just have a very short window in which to play - i.e. once the wee lad has gone to bed for the evening or is taking a nap kinda deal.<br />
<br />
I guess it's about that time to go get myself some OS keys as well now that I think about it.  Could be a pain trying to zone out the War if its not clear to the exit...with all these expansions I don't know how empty/camped OS is these days.<br />
<br />
CoM is outta the question - I spent too much time there in the past with different chars.<br />
<br />
What about howling stones - I can't recall if fighting at the zone would be too difficult there or not?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the input<br />
<br />
Tooaxe<br />

p.s. Haass,  save your strength.  Don't waste the effort attempting to type more than 2 letters - you could really strain something there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">go mash seafuries in OOT ... should be relatively quiet besides the people either camping AC or someone ganking Gornit the ATM machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Until you can easily tank in PoP, then I would stick to the classic old world zones. Old world mobs have considerably less HP and they don't hit near as hard as later expansion mobs. You can do SolB well into the 50s which should set you up for PoJ/PoD where the exp bonus is a lot higher. As soon as you can tank PoJ/PoD mobs in a group, do that the exp will be a ton better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">p.s. Haass, save your strength. Don't waste the effort attempting to type more than 2 letters - you could really strain something there... <br />
<br />
Don't go there dude, you really don't wanna start that kinda stuff with me.<br />
<br />
You asked if you could 2 box in CT at 48.  The mobs START at level 51 there and will rip thru your 2300hp in less time than a CH will cast in.  You're not only gonna die, you're gonna get raped 6 ways from sunday.  The very concept of a 48 in CT is laughable.<br />
<br />
Of course, I decided to say it nicely and tell you &quot;No&quot; instead of &quot;You've got less of a chance of surviving 2 minutes there than a twinkie does in front of Anna Nicole Smith.&quot;  Apparantly the sentiment is not appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Try the new Nurga, it should be perfect for your duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't mind being told that the concept of two 48 lvls going into CT is ridiculous.   Hell you could call me moronic for suggesting the idea and I wouldn't be offended - but don't try and tell me your overly terse answer of &quot;No&quot; to my 3 or 4 questions was you being nice.  It comes across as being rudely arrogant - so no, I suppose your initial sentiment was not really appreciated.<br />
<br />
However I can relate to the twinkie trying to /con Anna Nicole Smith - I'll heed advice.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It was being nice, and I'll tell you why.<br />
<br />
Instead of asking on a message board, you could have taken your toons to CT, saw that they were red cons, tried to pull a single, and died, and you wouldn't have had to ask this question.<br />
<br />
If it's rudely arrogant, than so be it.  You could have taken 5 minutes and answered your own question yourself and avoided the whole mess if you were offended by the response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;It was being nice,&quot; <br />
Uh huh, the word No simply ooozes nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Instead of asking on a message board, you could have taken your toons to CT, saw that they were red cons, tried to pull a single, and died, and you wouldn't have had to ask this question&quot;<br />
<br />
No shit Sherlock, that's the purpose of a message board - to not have to waste perhaps hours of time doing something futile.  To share information...or have you never gleaned information from those here?<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have taken 5 minutes and answered your own question yourself and avoided the whole mess if you were offended by the response.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mess eh?  hehe ok then...<br />

Tooaxe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well nevermind.  If you can't figure it out, then I'm not gonna waste my time trying to explain it.<br />
<br />
I guess somewhere along the line EQ turned from people who were willing to check out new things themselves into people who need their hand held to do everything, and feel they are justified in doing so.  Whatever floats your boat I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I do know what you're saying *cough* in these latter posts at least.<br />
And... well,  I used to be able to do as you say &quot;check out new things themselves&quot;.  However with my limited time (becoming a new dad impacts play time immensely) I really don't have the hours that I used to to go searching for a Necro for a corpse summon, nor do I belong to a guild that would otherwise help me out of a sticky situation.<br />
If I die I need to be able to get my body back asap as it's a real possibility that I won't get to play for another week or two and thus have corpse rot.  And so here I am asking a simple time saving question.<br />
<br />
So now you know what floats my boat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What's wrong with &quot;No.&quot;?  Instead of not answering and leaving it to you to find out on your own, he correctly answered your main question.  He took his time (even if not much) to answer your main question correctly, how is that &quot;rudely arrogant&quot;?  Short and to the point isn't insulting, it's just short and to the point, leaving out a lot of fluff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hussar,  <br />
<br />
Pretend for a minute that you are repeating to a friend, who plays EQ exactly, what I asked.  Would you not think it rude for them to turn and answer with a simple &quot;No&quot;?  Why would a written question be any different?<br />
<br />
If not then I guess we'll chalk it up to a different upbringing...and leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Arrogant would be the wrong word used, whether it be apt or not one certainly can't tell from Haass' post.  my apologies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can't think of many zones that need Corpse summons anymore... Well the deep, but you probably wont go there without a guild.  All zones in EQ are accesible from max three zones away.  There's no reason to not try anything anymore.  Majority of the zones don't even see invis.  Risk vs reward has been replaced with easy CR's, easy to get too zones, mobs that don't see invis, and loot that sold in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Your question was :<br />
I've never been to the revamped CT but was wondering if I could 2-box at the zoneline.<br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
NO<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Are there 2 mobs when you zone in or 8 or none? <br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
2, but not at zone, and sometimes the pirahna's show closer to zone in, don't atk them, they will summon you below the Z axis zone in.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Do the buggers still love to run at 20% health?  <br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
No idea, sorry, always taken a snarer :/ But I believe its a NO, cause they fight till death and don't turn.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
can I expect trains to the zone like the good ol' CT? <br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
Sure, any time you fight on the way to the only zone out....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Okay dude, you're apparantly thinking of some different CT, since you're worried about &quot;5 hour CR's&quot; and &quot;finding a necro to summon your corpse,&quot;  here's the CT that I know.<br />
<br />
1. ZONE IN.<br />
<br />
2. TURN CORNER<br />
<br />
3. SEE RED CON MOBS<br />
<br />
4. PULL MOBS<br />
<br />
5. GET OWNED<br />
<br />
6. WALK BACK TO CT FROM PoK VIA OGGOK PORTAL<br />
<br />
7. ZONE IN<br />
<br />
8. LOOT CORPSE<br />
<br />
9. LEAVE AND CHALK IT UP TO EXPERIENCE LEARNED.<br />
<br />
If you're smart enough, you can zone out before step 5 happens too and skip straight to step 9.  <br />
<br />
I told you the short and sweet answer, knowing full well that 5 other people are gonna come along and tell you exactly why in this thread.  Even if I had told you the exact reasons why in my first post, this thread would still have 3-5 more people repeating the same shit I said, so why bother?  It's not being arrogant or rude, but you're kinda forcing me to be by continuing on with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Originally posted by Haass <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">HS is a good spot as well, though you probably won't want to go much deeper than the entrance room or the basement. Better bring along a gate potion as well since the only exit is in the East wing (or is it South?, it's been a while).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Derrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Karnors basement is great for a war/clr duo.  Bunch of skeletons, easy to split with pacify, very few runners.  Might be rough at your level, but it is doable.  You can level all the way to 60 there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Atilette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">a nice spot for you could also be The Hole zone in.<br />
<br />
I always enjoyed this zone, and it's almost always empty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Some excellent suggestions all.  Thanks for the tips - it's been a while since I've played as I &quot;retired&quot; when Velious had just come out so I'm definitely out of touch with many new components/features/zones to the game.<br />
I think I might try the KC basement to start with.  Undead...MMMmmmm...Undead....<br />
<br />
Even though I won't be venturing near CT anytime soon - it's nice to know to stay clear of the angry fish...<br />
<br />
<br />
Tooaxe Tooquick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Again I suggest you try out the revamped Nurga, the mobs ought to be much the same level as Howling Stones or KC basement, and fairly efficient killing.  Any of these places should be good though.  The Hole is frustrating because of the huge variation of the mobs (a level 37 mob can be right beside a level 54 mob).<br />
<br />
The cleric's Pacify spell will be invaluable in any of these places for getting mobs singly.  I suggest you use it every time there is a chance of getting multiples.  Also use it on roamers that are walking toward your fight so that they don't add.  Get used to using external camera angles to target mobs that you can't see for Pacify.  You can still pull with the warrior if you prefer, just do it after the important mobs are pacified.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Anulien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Most CT mobs suffer a horrible syndrome worse then the Luclin trash.  This syndrome is the &quot;i have more HP then an old world dragon but i hit no better then the cleric standing next to you&quot;.  Quite annoying really.<br />
<br />
A 48 cleric and war will not survive as everyone has kindly pointed out.  With a slower they have a fighting chance as long as you can pull the singles.  But then also keep in mind this horrible syndrome these mobs walk around with and know that other then farming this place is god awful because of the time wasted it takes to kill a single lizard.<br />
<br />
Consider the sewers with a group in a few levels though.  The oozes have considerably less HP then the lizards but their moms taught them how to hit somewhat.  Crowd control required and some decent dps to make it worth your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">dunno what u are smoking but CT mobs hit hard for their level and dont have that many hp</div></div><hr />

Wake of Tranquility requires line of sight. Pacify, calm, lull, etc. do not. <br />
<br />
Getting to the basement of Karnor's as a pair of 2boxed 48s would be, ummm, difficult.<br />
<br />
Howling Stones is a one way dungeon. You'd have to be insane to go there with a warrior/cleric 2box setup. Plus, golems run, and once they run, you'll die from the resulting train. Oh, and you'll immediately aggro 2 harmtouching skeletons on zone in. Hope your warrior zones faster then the cleric!<br />
<br />
Sebilis frogs run. Going to be a problem for you.<br />
<br />
My suggestion? Echo Caverns, the Taskmaster camp. Killing the Taskmaster's kind of tough, but very doable. Mobs run here, but it's easy to keep enough room cleared (clearing exp-giving dark blue mobs) to give the cleric enough time to land a root, and root lasts on these mobs. With KEI, you may have enough mana for the cleric to nuke fleeing mobs effectively. The social range on these mobs is low, so mob fleeing isn't as much of a problem here as in Howling Stones or Sebilis. Best of all, it takes only a couple minutes from time to log in, to when you can start killing. Very, very easy to get to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any common warrior two boxer (with a shaman or cleric) is going to have some kind of a snare item or weapon. If the cleric or shaman follows Inny (DE cleric or troll shaman) then there is that necklace that clicks darkness. There are also several weapons that proc snare or darkness. If you're using a snare weapon and it still hasn't proced a good ways through the fight, then have your priest sit down and start memming root.<br />
<br />
That said though, I'd think that either karnors basement, howling stones, or seb would be a bit tough for two 48s. Probably good at 55 though (give or take a few levels).</div></div><hr />
