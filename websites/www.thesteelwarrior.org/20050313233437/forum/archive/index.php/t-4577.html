<br />
Weve been running through at least 3-4 MTs because DI cant save em all the time once defensive drops. I think we have about 8 clerics in the rot on him and a  few more on the  rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wigg0</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We kill him without any casualties, maybe some shitwiz now and again for overaggroing and turning him so a few more dies</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple really - we've been there longer than you. That means our tanks have more hp (eg: I'm over 11.5k) so stop being single rounded. Then it's just a case of throwing enough healing around that the MT doesn't drop. Corner him and attack from max range and don't draw agro off the MT at any time.<br />
<br />
Sure, the first times may well be messy, but the longer you're there, and the mob you get equipped, the easier it becomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goobayouface</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">overagro is still an issue in time, just like it was in tactics heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the MT dies its usualyl right near the begining because rot isn't working  we simply resest and go again,none of our tanks are beyond 10.4k I don't think as we are jsut new in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudana</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surlok you have 21 clerics too :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">guess ur right our current main tank is about just over 10k 2000 ac. maybe need to throw a bit more healing at it i guess. was annoying as hell though had a messy one with him lastn ight, got him down to 0 pct but then dps dropped off cos most of us were dead annd he regenned back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We havent had a MT die on Tallon at all since we killed him first off unless it was in the first few seconds to the rotation having a hiccup. We also pretty much have 0-5 casualties. His damage is actually pretty weak, if youre not taking any spell damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">10k is enough to tank him just fine.  I have just over 10k and have tanked him a few times start to finish.  Sometimes my DI does get skipped over which is extremely annoying, but for the most part the hits that kill me, would just as likely have killed me with 10.5 or 11k hp.<br />
<br />
Also, we have around 60 people, and use 7 clerics in the cycle although we tend to have around 8-10 total on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surlok you have 21 clerics too<br />
<br />
<br />
No,we have 21 clerics on our roster,The most we have ever had in time at any point is 13.<br />
<br />
It's a touchy fight,if aggro stays on the Main tank then it all comes down to healing,8 clerics is what we use as a chain on him and as long as the rot is solid keeping one tank on him should work.We have a harder time keeping the RT up then the MT up for some reason...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">over aggro is not an issue on time tz..assuming you tank him properly.  First of all 3 of his aes are 30 range the 4th if 50 range, so the only one that will land at max melee ect.  When i tank im i make sure i have full buffs ect all 15 slots and trash up front.  so jboots acumen cotr aura of green petals legacy of bracken vot divine intervention protection of seasons, tribunal, pot9, symbol, ward, brells ,focus, haste.  The one ae you need to worry about as mt is tallons balance.  Its neg 300 all resists and will most likely allow his other shit to land, slow aggro debuff ect.  So what i do is group with a bard and have him mem high level dispell song.  With full buffs his aes eat your top buffs, and bard dispell is top 2 slots only.  It will occasionally skip a buff but very rarely.  So I work with a bard to dispell that shit the whole fight and fill in the blankks with clickies.  You can also work with a rune rotation or vie ect depending on how sloppy your dispelling gets.  If they are top two slots youre fine, as long as they arnt eating something importatnt.  I dont place them lower because they longest they last is 3 seconds and then you have a threat of his slow or debuff dropping lower in your buff order and you are fucked until it fades.  Anyway doing this i have no problem aggroing and we normally have him to 25%ish before disc drops, then just fill in the blanks with druids and shaman.<br />
<br />
edit: dispelling his resist debuff will also save spike dps as he has a 3k ae dd and a 3k single target dd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We dont dispell or cure anything and very rarely lose anyone.<br />
<br />
Usually an 8-9 cleric rotation, and a 5-6 minute fight. Very straightforeward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not necessary to dispel but getting rid of Tallon's Balance makes the spikes a lot easier to deal with.  Also prevents his deaggro/slows from landing which helps quite a bit with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm...<br />
<br />
&quot;Once defensive drops&quot;<br />
<br />
How about not letting defensive drop? <br />
<br />
What the hell happend to tank switches?  Are they like out of style or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throag</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But why using tank switches when not necessary?<br />
With the proper resist buff ( including Ferocity ) and a bard in the group you can almost completely negate the damage spikes from his AE and his melee dps is not that bad, keeping a non-defensive tank alive on him is not really an issue.<br />
<br />
Imo you have much more chances to fuck up trying to switch tanks than trying to keep the same tank the whole fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">man you guys are killing him real fast. our guild just had a bunch of people move servers like 20 or so (me included) so its hit their dps a bit. fights taking quite a bit longer than 3-5 mins atm<br />
<br />
thanks for the tips tho will mention it to the raid planning team</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tank switches have been out of style since Velious. I can only think of 1 or 2 fights it would be worthwhile to even attempt it on and even then you're throwing yourself a curveball you don't need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BattleaxTN</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know a friend guild did very well in MT rotation. They can down TZ(time) with like 1-2 casuals. But that need your cch used to tank-switch and hold fire when tank switching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parv</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, we still tank swap out on TZ/Quarm :p  We just don't trust the RNG and lag to make DI work all the time...and for something like TZ your fight can go in the shitter fast when he turns on the raid after tank dies.  Quarm you can still recover easily given the delay on his AE's and melee, but our early fights with him we were having to reuse tanks since we had so few and generally killed slower then, so that became the habit.  Our switches are pretty solid, healing stays consistent and for all practical purposes the rest of the raid never has to let up on their dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like tank switching.  It is a useful tactic in many areas of the game.  And it is not difficult at all if you practice it frequently.  And it sure makes some of the meaner LDoN raid bosses easier if you are proficient at switching.  I can't remember the last time we ever messed up a tank switch.  But that is mostly because we do it fairly often.<br />
<br />
If you have an unexpected tank transition it is not uncommon to lose 5 or more people, but if you are good at transitioning defenisve tanks, you greatly decrease your chance of havng an unexpected tank transition, and you will almost never lose anyone.  Even the previous tank.</div></div><hr />

No reason to take full damage from a mob when you can switch it over to another defensive warrior at the touch of a button.</div></div><hr />

No reason either to switch tanks if the current tank has little chance of dying.</div></div><hr />

Not quite.<br />
<br />
No reason to take full damage from a mob when you can switch it over to another defensive warrior at the touch of a button.<br />
<br />
And I see no reason to switch since the same cycle can keep me alive most of the time, and in the worst case scenario, we just have to do a tank switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With UD3 available why bother?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well last night we got him down. thanks for the tips.<br />
was a pretty clean fight but we burnt through most of our main line tanks. first couple held up and switched ok but then he mowed through 2 in quick order before we picked it up on the 5th one and that held through to the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
anyway we then took a pop at his brother for the first time. man that stun proc is mean. can see a lot more deaths ahead....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyway we then took a pop at his brother for the first time. man that stun proc is mean. can see a lot more deaths ahead.... <br />
<br />
Vallon heh...that fight can go from perfect to wipe in a matter of seconds...(At least for us anyway) I really like that encounter for some odd reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We approach the VZ battle as a battle of attrition.  We always lose 2-5 tanks and still never come close to dieing.  Those are usually our only deaths.<br />
<br />
And I see no reason to switch since the same cycle can keep me alive most of the time, and in the worst case scenario, we just have to do a tank switch.<br />
Well, it is good practice.  And while losing 5 or so people isnothing in a raid of 60, losing 5 people on a ldon raid because a tank went down could cost you 3 hours.  So keeping sharp on tank changes is really worth it when you can't afford to lose anyone on an unexpected tank transition.  Several of the Ruj end bosses come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">out of interest how do you guys handle the tanking on VZ? been trying to think through a strat. atm one option seems like keepnig 2 tanks on him so if one goes down to stun other can keep aggro but given his dps thats gonna take a hella lot of clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szlia</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there are several pretty diferent strats in use for VZ, but since he basicaly is the steping stone to reach Tier 5, I doubt many will share their strat :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i figured theres a few ways round this. gonna try him again  tonight and see what we can work out.</div></div><hr />
