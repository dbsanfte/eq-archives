I did a OoW instanced zone the other day and was weilding my newly augmented BoC and SoTB. Pretty much got tore up with ripostes. Never died but cleric had to work a bit harder to keep me alive. Decided to use my 2hander (Veluim Gemmed Greatsword/Unaugged) until mob was slowed. Then swap to one handers. Besides the Greatstaff of Thunder, Is there another droppable 2Hander that has a nice aggro proc on it. I am a casual player and it would take me forever to do all the LDoN's needed to get an aug. <br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

There are warrior usable weapons from oow like a 33/30 stun proc or something, nothing that is better than boc though.<br />
<br />
And I guarantee you the &quot;torn up by ripostes&quot; was just perception. Using a two hander to minimize riposte damage has been parsed again and again, and it seemed to me at least that the only times to use 2handers are if you a) are tanking a hard hitting raid mob where aggro isn't an issue, but healing is. or b) if your 2hander is the same or better aggro as dualwield, or high enough that aggro is trivial.</div></div><hr />

Can't remember if it was attuneable or not.<br />
<br />
The sword Neksnappa is talking about is probably Longblade of Khetus, 30/32 with Ykesha proc (the old school 75pt Ykesha). 80hp and OK stats, attuneable, but &lt; 1:1 dmg/del ratio =  :(<br />
<br />
EDIT - Found it, http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70564 , but it's NODROP. Drops off Tiorpat. Kinda lame that it's nodrop, it seems more in line with upper end attuneable OOW loot than nodrop OOW loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres Edge of Envelopement outta WoS off some chimera named.  its 43/33 with 135 hps, some AC and a 100 DD.  if you aug with anger 3, im sure with the 2 procs and then decent 2h ratio, aggro should be pretty good, though i cannot say from experience.  As far as i can tell, thats the best ratio 2h that you can buy thus far in the game.  Note that it IS attunable however, so before you buy it, you might want to see if anyone has any further incite on how they think it will perform, as you cant resell it.  There is ALSO a 2hs, very nice, though i forget the name, from the Tiorpat ring in RCoD.  As i recall, the ratio was similar to that of the Blade of War from potacts.  The sword is no drop, and i realize you are looking for tradable stuff, but i have also heard that the ring is 1 groupable, and as the sword is no drop, and is war pal sk only, you'd stand a very good shot of getting it.</div></div><hr />

It drops in MPG, but it is no drop, so i guess it is not something he is looking for.  Although the mob that drops it is single groupable to any group that can hunt in MPG.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Edge + A3 proc, and it does the job quite nicely. Hoping the get a non-bugged Tiorpat soon though, or get one of those 2hb  dps machines....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly when it comes to aggro 2handers, I'd rather use a GSoT over an edge of envelopment. No innate aggro proc = just about worthless from a tanking perspective. In a random pickup group you might be fine with an edge of env, but get a dps class that is ele+, let alone high end GoD, and they will have aggro 90% of the time. <br />
<br />
With WA5 and an anger proc, you'll get 3 anger procs per minute, and 3 100dd procs if using an edge of env. A GSoT would get you 3 stun procs instead of the dd, which is over 1000 more aggro per minute from procs. True, dps would be lower, but I doubt it would be enough to compensate for the proc. With 6 aggro procs per minute on a 2hander, you'll average 1 proc every 10 seconds. The odds of getting an early proc (which is where we have aggro issues) is much better than if you only had A3 (3 procs per min, 1 / 20 sec).<br />
<br />
Until you get really really nice 2handers, 40/30 + aggro proc or better, it's almost a given that your dualwield setup is better aggro. If you've got the plat, by all means get an edge of envelopment; at least mobs will die quicker while the ranger in your group tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, no fucking shit sherlock.  <br />
<br />
Weapon comparisons should be before augments.  It's simple algebra people...Anger 3 cancels itself out on both sides of the equation.</div></div><hr />

If anyone is familiar w/ BoT towers 2hb, and its insane proc rate . .  THIS is better . . rofl . . so many procs, almost every round.  very fast weapon, great dps, and im tanking as i type this!  no need to watch the other computer, aggro is solid, unaugged.  SICK weapon!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well excuse me but the question was raised as to wheter the Edge would do as a tanking tool, and IMO it does. Nm that I have anger3 on it. Anything which pumps out good solid dps can be used as a tanking tool, since the upgrades to taunt and the incite line make any *pure* aggro proc not really neccesary anymore. Nice, yes Lazy, yes Neccesary, No.<br />
<br />
Edit: I've only now noticed the title of this thread as being aggro-2handers... so I shouldn't have responded in the first place since the original question undoubtingly is for 2handers /w chaos or ykesha procs. Since nothing else will hold aggro. Obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello and ty all for the replies.. <br />
<br />
I have very low funds atm.. Like 20K at best but am saving.  Can't remember the name of the instanced we did but while using 1handers, I was getting smacked like 4-5 hits in a row at times. Although I have seen this many time before, I wasn't getting hit for 400-500 a hit. I am fairly new to OoW zones and did not do much GoD either.  I will look into the tiorpat 2hander and that Muramite Bladebreaker is.. well... OMG nice lol.. I think for now I will aug the GSoT. The problem I had with using the 2hader until the mob was slowed was no aggro generation or very little. Once I swap to the BoC/SoTB combo, the procs start flying and the mob stayed focues on me. It may have been a perception thing .. true.. I will see how the Augged GSoT does. If those other No Drop 2 handers are 1 groupable then I am also gonna try and get in there and give it a go!. <br />
<br />
Thanks again all .. Very helpful info )</div></div><hr />

My bad its 44/34 and the proc isnt a stun :(<br />
But that was the weapon i was talking about....<br />

For some reason i was sure xego fist proc was a stun....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ygnir, an unaugged edge will NOT be a good tanking tool. It's just that simple. A bazaar rogue, bst, monk, ranger, or caster will out-dps you more often than not, which forces you to incite as soon as it refreshes. If the slower gets a resist, or the snarer casts at 50% because oow mobs resist it so much, you will lose aggro.<br />
<br />
Pure DPS is a terrible method to maintain aggro. We are not a dps class, we don't even come close to decent dps until time+ weapons. Any dps class with ele or better gear, or epic 1.5, or whatever, can and will steal aggro just by doing 50% more damage than you. The solution to this is aggro procs. If you can choose between gaining 10-20% dps to use a 2hander with no innate stun/debuff/anger proc, or have a weapon with an aggro proc of its own, it's obvious which is better for a warrior.<br />
<br />
Relying on the incite line on every pull works, maybe. You shouldn't have to count on it though. If you can keep aggro without it, and only use it when you have an unlucky string of 20 seconds without any procs, then yeah use it. But using it more than once per mob will result in you losing endurance really fast. With a good chainpuller, you'll be out of endurance in less than 20 minutes. Then how do you keep aggro?<br />
<br />
And just out of curiousity, Ygnir what is this &quot;upgrades to taunt&quot; you speak of?</div></div><hr />
