<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lelara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Warriors,<br />
<br />
I'm sure you all know that bows like Stonewood Compound bow have a slot 4 augment.<br />
<br />
My question is what kind of augments do you put into your bows?<br />
<br />
If you did put a proc augment on it, how's the proc rate?<br />
Any noticible DPS increase when you range attack mobs?<br />
<br />
Honestly speaking, I find my Featherwood Compound bow not procing much at all when I use it on ranged fights like on Solusek Ro.<br />
<br />
Maybe a HP augment would be nice but I would like some advice and suggestions on what you all augment your bows with.<br />
<br />
By the way, I use my bow alot, pulling mobs with it but not shooting much unless we need to use it as a range fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look for type &quot;all&quot;. All of the augments dropped on adventures are type all and there are a few buyable type all that can go in range. Basically you can add 10 to any one stat or resist for 357 pts or there are 8str 8dex, 8dr 8pr, or 5mr 5fr 5cr  for 663 pts. I currently have one of the dropped +6 sta augments on my bow. Spending points on a proc augment for a bow I use 0-2 times per pull seems like a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I shoot 1-3 arrows during a pull and thats about it so buying a proc for my bow would be next to useless. I put a +6MR augment I won on an adventure on my Featherwood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">id put a CHA aug on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Isn't there also a +10 AC augment that can go in bows ?<br />
<br />
EDIT : My bad, the +10 AC All slot augment only fits into Face, Neck, Shoulder, Back, Waist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">6 charisma on my bow.<br />
<br />
Rangers have told me that bows proc very infrequently for them, so I don't imagine a warrior with an aug'd proc would do much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Type 4 slots on a bow are just a cruel joke to a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my bow procs the second tuesday of the fith weak of Feb.<br />
<br />
basicly waist of points for a proc if it had to be a proc i would go with mirror or guard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it's be cool to put like EB ( enduring breath ) on the bow. good useless slot filled with a beneficial thing</div></div><hr />
