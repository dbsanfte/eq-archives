i just needed to know what was best to upgrade in those slots. i have roughly 18k plat in the bank and just needed to know what would be best to get. My 2 hand slasher is a Sword of the Crypt Keeper(not in magelo) and my friend told me to go with feirce heraldic everything. but i saw on fierce heraldic helm the +5 INT. so wasnt sure if i was gonna get it. and the boots i was looking at were the kylong darkmail boots. just wondering how best to spend my cash. or any better suggestions for weapons.thanks<br />

Run EQupdate (check on magelo website) and play EQ a bit. it will update your sword in magelo database..<br />

<br />
And fierce heraldic/crimson darkscale armor is a good choice for low cost.<br />
Just get the best ac/hp combo you like (and cheap) and buy it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xaipax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i mean is there anything better than the heraldic armor? like more bang for my $$$$. lol. i meant specifically if there was anything better out there than the heraldic armor. i liked the kylong darkmail armors stats but the hp on those are kinda low. i dont think plat is that much of a problem (all of myRL friends are in 2nd top time guild on our server) so i can get like 20k more plat really easily. maybe getting more would be a problem so i dont know.....</div></div><hr />
