wtf can't i hold the agro sometimes, even when the damned stick procs up to 6 times a fight?<br />
<br />
Is there something else i can do to gain a much bigger agro lead over the folks i'm grouping with or am I doing it all wrong?<br />
<br />
I've heard of begging or some shit to increase agro but have no clue about how to set that up (feeling like a fucking noob)<br />
<br />
any help advice would rock</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try not hitting the taunt button until you lose aggro.<br />
<br />
Get ure Dex up via buffs and/or gear.<br />
<br />
Stand closer to the mob</div></div><hr />

Check your hits. If your not doing much dmg, get better haste...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wait until the mob turns on someone else and then hit the taunt button and you will be 100000x more successful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moving closer to the mob and all the other suggestions about things that YOU can do are good.  Making sure the rest of your group isnt a bunch of....no...I shouldnt say that.   Making sure the rest of the melees in your group are standing at max melee range, occasionally turning off auto attack, evading/feigning/jolting when necessary will go a long way towards making sure you hold aggro.  That and making sure the casters in your group have some sort of a clue about when to cast which spells, and when it's safe to sit down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackdaddy</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tell the people in group/raid to wait for you to call em in to assist.  Wait 10 secs then call em in, if that doesn't work wait longer.  Also get some nice fast weapons, them constant hits keep reminding the mob to hit you and not them.  All the other suggestions above are good too.  You got a Magelo profile so we can see your haste, Dex and what not ?</div></div><hr />

The people you hunt with need to learn agro control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, /agree Wandor.  Tell the group to watch their agro.  I do alot in any group I'm in.  Usually they fix their actions.  Sometimes I have to tell my slowers not to sit right as they tash/slow.  Knights spoil people on agro.  With a GSoT, about any warrior should be doing fine for agro.  Its the group bud, not you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor is right (didn't think about that). It's them, not you.<br />
<br />
/shield the pally and ask alot how much hp/ac he has compared to you. (I usually have about 1k more hp and a 200 more ac than pallies my lvl)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Repeating what others have said, only taunt when you lose agro, or right after slows, massive agro-generating debuffs, or early Cheals. Better to have taunt up when you need it than to taunt when it's already smacking you.<br />
<br />
I have the basic half-okay proc-for-agro setup, FB/WC and GSoT; but at lvl 61 I can lose agro easily to a chain-stunning lvl 53 paladin. ANYONE can steal agro over a warrior if they try to, period. It's a matter of getting lucky enough to group with people who understand why it matters to keep the mob on the MA, or at least people who care enough to listen, learn, and help the group be more efficient.<br />
<br />
Try talking with those you're grouped with if all else fails. If they call you noob or refuse to help out, then take off or gut it out, there is a limit to what we can do if our group is working against us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally the issue boils down to asking people to watch their aggro control.<br />
<br />
Sadly, PoP has made knight MTs aware that with mobs hitting for hundreds every round, the only way to turn a groupful of ignorant Dreadlands graduates into a safe place to exp is to trivialise aggro control for them by spamming the mob with aggro spells, which is an area a warrior can't compete in.  It's also, unfortunately, the most efficient way to get fast exp.<br />
<br />
The result is that many people are now genuinely ignorant and/or incapable of learning how to control their aggro.<br />
<br />
One thing which is rarely mentioned though: If there's another plate tank in the group, not casting spells much but they keep getting aggro with about the same frequency that your taunt button refreshes, you have a stealth taunter in your group.<br />
<br />
Politely asking them not to taunt (and kick, if you see them kicking), once per fight, is the solution.  They'll either stop, or get upset and leave the group which works just as well.  If they say they're not taunting, keep asking and then when they make an issue of it tell them they're getting aggro with the exact frequency that the taunt button refreshes, and then continue asking them not to taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
go to droga. it is. I am 56 and on Stromm, and I have Copper Hammer, there is no excuse for anyone at 60+ not to have one if he is unable to hold agro.<br />
<br />
My Magelo is able to tank King Dronan, I doubt anyone on this board is weaker ;)</div></div><hr />

Wielding 2 1-handers that both proc dd/stuns is bound to fix anyones aggro, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah...we walked out of droga with so many copper hammers that our one enchanter is meleeing with one like a cleric with their fancypants hammer. There is no excuse to not have one of these and the bloodsworn if you want it...TOO damn easy to get. Same deal with 80% of the Kylong stuff from Vek. Sony is BOUND to nerf the drop rate on these...</div></div><hr />
