<br />
These little mini expansions have to stop they eat up vital time the your team needs to create real quality content.  Loy and ldon are are prime examples of the make a quick buck philosophy that SOE seems to be following.  We don't need a expansion every 4 months we need a huge expansion with attention to detail every 9 to 12 months and nearly all players would pay 20$ more if it was good.  Nobody wants your cut/paste zones .....nobody.  I'm not sure if they think we don't notice or exactly what the situation is.&lt;edited out B.S&gt;<br />
<br />
I'd be very happy with one expansion a year if it were filled with content and diverse zones and thoughtfully planed character advancement.  While this doesn't meet SOE's quarterly objectives, it would go a long way in keeping EQ fun and entertaining.<br />

It only works for Blizzard because they essentially own the Diablo and RTS genre (only significant competitor is C&amp;C).<br />
<br />
There's no software so good that it's worth delaying it to make it better, not in any realistic situation.  People have this notion that somehow 'buggy' or 'bad' launches tarnishes a game but in reality unless a product is atrociously bad, a buggy product that's delivered ontime is far more useful than a normal product that's delayed (it'd also be outdated by the time it actually came out).  <br />
<br />
There are 9500 LDoN accounts on my server (make a level 1 character and see your rank) and there's no way Drinal has over 20000 accounts (below average population out of about 30ish servers, and EQ is quoted at ~500K subscribers) so even a very poor estimate says 50% of people bought LDoN.  I wouldn't be surprised if that number is actually 80%+.  Regardless of how much people whine about an expansion, an expansion that's available is more useful than one that is delayed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your missing the point all togather.  I'm saying don't shoot for a 4 month cycle time with 10 cut and pasted zones,  make it larger in scope and more detailed from the start.  <br />
<br />
Because people bought it does NOT mean they liked it NOR does it mean they will buy other products like it, that logic is very flawed.  I never said delay anything, I'd like longer cycle times with 9 to 12 month development on worth while content insted of what they currently are doing.  3x 4 month expansions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have to agree, LDoN was shittly levels, it was all preformed lego bricks that a monky could have stuck togeather</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, what I miss from EQ is that it was a challege.<br />
<br />
There were design flaws with the original release--where they seem to have confused hard to play with challeging--at least at my level of play.<br />
<br />
50th was a real accomplishment, 60 less so, 65 nearly trivial, and marshall, when I get it, pointless. EQ has made a great number of improvements in easy of use...but all eviserated any challenge from the game--unless you really go out to look for it, and have a group that is willing to go.<br />
<br />
LDoN would be much improved by a medium setting...something between normal (where most of the adv's can be won by a group of 63's) and hard (where you need 200 AA and really good gear (RA or Ornate+). THere is more than a small step between the two.<br />
<br />
Nerf PC (the XP there is so fast as to be stupid) add giants and griffons to the out door Rok trak... (One of hte reasons that the dungons in original release were so popular was usually they were faster XP and safer from wondering red mobs of death.)<br />
<br />
Heck I still remember the first time I soloed a sand giant, not because it would get me anything, but for revenge.<br />
<br />
I think SOE Is falling into the trap of listening to us, the players, too much, or just giving away too much (FT comes to mind). <br />
<br />
I don't want an easier game, I want an easy/good interface on a challenging game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to kinda disagree and agree...<br />
<br />
The cookie-cutter maps, do need reworked some. There just is not enough diversity in the maps. And its not like they are that hard to create just double the number of map tiles for each them and it would help. Also adding a few more unique aspects, the underground city in Tak is an example, or the wind bridges in Ruj. Each map should have one of these unique features, that ISNT at the end of the dungeon, where people never see it.<br />
<br />
Also, Since they designed  the dungeon mapper tool, they really should change the zones geometry on a regular basis.  It would take what? an hour to draw up a new zone map? changing these on say  2 month basis would keep th edungeons fresh and new.<br />
<br />
As far as the rest of the LDON expansion, I completely disagree with people who say it is worthless or terrible. It is by far the very best expansion for the new gamer, the casual gamer or someone who doesnt have a lot of time to play. You can log on and get an adventure with almost any character any class and level, and get a group in 10-15 minutes. People know now that you dont need the holy trinity, you dont need a cleric, or a warrior, or any certain class. many different groups can easilly succeed, using many different tactics.<br />
<br />
It is by far the best and fairest expansion for the majority of players. <br />
<br />
What I would like to see is more themes opened up, in Kunark and Velious... <br />
<br />
And complete the damn augment sets. Some augments are just plain missing that should be there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree, Brutall. Kunark was amazing. Velious was jaw dropping. Even Luclin was huge and mysterious. PoP had some great ideas, brand new stuff. <br />
<br />
LoY was a flop. People bought it because it was SUPPOSED to be cool, and all they got was some bank space and a map. I know tons of people that simply never went there, because there was no reason to.<br />
<br />
LDoN I have mixed feelings about. It brought back the dungeon crawl mentality, which would have been great if it felt less like a job to get certain augments and more like a crawl for adventure. Maybe that's just us being jaded though...<br />
<br />
  I'd love to see another Kunark. Kunark was HUGE, Kunark had epics, Kunark was actually hard. You couldn't just get to Kunark and run around, because it was dangerous everywhere. Same with Velious... even at a high level, it was still a mean place if you had the wrong faction. It had this overall goal of factioning that you could ignore only at the very high end.<br />
<br />
  If they came out with an expansion that was hard, interesting and involved, I think they'd really bring back a certain something to EQ. And yes, this would take them longer than a few months to throw out. And people would buy it, especially if it was GOOD, even at a higher price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still havent had reason to set foot in LoY, I want my 20$ back :D<br />
<br />
But yeah I agree the expansions need to be bigger and more well-polished, even if it means 1-2 months more between each one(but again, if they are bigger/better, then they will take longer to consume as well).<br />
<br />
Looking back personally I enjoyed Velious the most. Lots of good challenging raid targets(KT/AoW/NToV/Yelinak/Dain/ST/10th Ring war etc), plenty of room because the expansion was well laid out, none of the centralized porter stuff like PoP. You actually had to _travel_ (gasp!) and being good at it was part of what seperated the good and the bad guilds(ability to quickly mobilize). <br />
<br />
You really got your moneys worth with Velious IMO. Even with fierce competition it was fun and no guild could monopolize it all because of the travelling distances involved.<br />
<br />
Some of the races was fun too, even if you lost it was still a rush. But it looks like racing is dead now that EQ is disney'fied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the string of half baked expansions following PoP, in contrast to what came before, points to one simple fact that I thought might be the case from the day I first grasped what the end game of PoP would be.  That fact is that PoP was meant to be the end of EQ1.  If you look at what they did in a single expansion in terms of mudflation, its breathtaking.  I think its clear that they had no concrete plans for anything that would surpass PoP in terms of raid content and the quality of the items.<br />
<br />
I've heard through the grapevine that the basic quandary facing SoE these days is that their original plan, i.e.; transitioning thier player base from EQ1 to EQ2, isn't looking all that feasible.  They are afraid that if they actively drive the players out of EQ1 that they won't automatically wind up in EQ2.  So they continue to develop EQ2, but also continue to maintain the illusion that EQ1 will continue as a viable game for raiding guilds, while short-changing both efforts and hoping for a miracle to solve their increasingly bad customer relations.<br />
<br />
I think the real tale is going to be told in the next month.  If GoD is a turkey, from a full blown raiding point of view, thats pretty much it for EQ.  My server is pretty typical I think - 9 guilds in the elementals, 4 guilds in time (very soon to be 5).   Our top end guild, HnE, are basically reduced to ghosts who log in one day a week to raid Time.  GoD will either present them with sufficient content to keep them interested in EQ for another 6 months to a year, or they will, I suspect, be moving on to WoW or just about anything but EQ2.  As will I.</div></div><hr />

I did at least 10 levels in LoY and the zones are well laid-out, with great atmosphere and cool mobs.  <br />
<br />
It wasn't an expansion for raiders, and it wasn't advertised as one.  I was great for it's target audience.  Nobody forced you to buy it.  &quot;I've never been there because it sucks&quot; is just plain ignorant.</div></div><hr />

Their are just some things that take more time if you want more content and completely different looking zones and thoughtfully planed character advancment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish they would come up with new forms of character devlopment that did not directly increase the player vs NPC power. Instead of MORE hp and MORE damage, bigger spells, etc, just some alternate route to customizing your character. I suppose raid/ group leadership is somewhat a step in this direction, but they need something for the general public. Adding more abilities or neat things to do, more questing that players of all type (casua to the hardcore) desire to do, more just fun things in general. <br />
<br />
I cannot really offer any solid ideas at the moment, but I think everyone can see my point. Just more character devlopment and customization without major mudflation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I felt LDoN was about the most innovative thing to hit EQ since release, and has provided many hours of fun for me when not raiding.  I do wish the raids had worked out better for LDoN. . .<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is too buggy or impossible even, but would have loved to see randomly generated maps for LDoN adventures, i.e. elderscrolls:daggerfall.  Probably not possible yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I started playing right as Kunark expansion came out so cannot relate to the original game before that. I do remember when Velious came out. I was playing a cleric at the time and really wanted to get to 30 plus (the normal lvl to start heading to velious at the time). I was excited about the expansion then. Still remember my first Kael raid was amazed at all the giants in there. LOY was an ok expansion I leveled there alot soloing my druid and doing caster groups of root and dot methods. LDoN I really think is a good expansion. It gives alot of people who are not in the high end guilds a way to upgrade gear (aug items) and has created alot more places to group at without having to any campchecks. Nothing worse than getting a group of guildies together running all the way to Sebillis and seeing 45 people already in the zone. LDoN has really helped with that issue. POP expansion made almost every zone easy to get to. I have mixed feelings on this. The POP zones are extremely good  exp and the mobs were at a level most people not ready for. Mobs blue at 55 hitting for 400 points. I just hope GoD is as good as LDoN was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Longer expansions means they will take longer to consume.  This means there must be more character development, or bigger timesinks.  No one likes the latter and the former gets tricky when balancing previous contents.  While of course new expansions make old content easier it just wouldn't be right if at the end of Gates you have 20K warriors.<br />
<br />
Since players can't grow too much more powerful, expansion have to be small by nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KardisKinnu</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rather liked LDON. The XP is kind of slow but at least I don't have to sit in one spot the whole time. It did not take long to get a group and it's nice that there are named every few missions. I am not in a guild large enough to raid so it's a nice change of pace from the grind for me.<br />
<br />
As for what I would like to see. More themes would be nice but really I think there are enough. They just need to balance them out a bit. No one on my server ever goes to the south ro one and there are some awesome pieces of equip there. People just don't seem to like it there. If they did add new themes Kunark would be really cool. I just hope there is more content where I don't need a massively good guild to have fun in this newest expansion. I don't mind the timesink to level but don't have time for a large scale raid a few times a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's really a tough question.  I guess what I would like is for them to go back and look what made the various expansions good, and combine them together.  Kunark had great dungeons, I would love more time with the feeling I had when I first went to Dalnit, to Kaesora, to KC(well, maybe not KC), to Chardok, to Seb.<br />
<br />
Velious had the factions, and the whole idea of giants vs dorfs and dragons.  10 ring war is still one of the best ideas to my mind that EQ has.  I want more competing factions...in fact, I want faction to mean something again.  I also want more of the grand style, and visual apeal that Velious had.  Velious also had great mood(I always semed to get chilled in RL when I went to Velious).  Velious in case you could not tell is my favorite expansion.<br />
<br />
Luclin had tons of content, level 1 to 60 plus AA's.  Luclin added AA's, which where an awesome way to continue advancement past the level cap, and to cusomize your character.  I think what I would take from Luclin is the idea that being able to cusomize your character is good(ok, that came out lame.  Read Besrikarle's post, and stick that in here).<br />
<br />
PoP had more intense encounters, and more imaginative events.  Please keep those ideas alive.  Assigning a mob x number of adds to controll, and 2 AE's to deal with, and this much DPS to have to keep healed ends up being dull.  Make the encounters as actual scripts, with each being different, and not only is it more chalenging, it is also more fun...and you feel better after winning.<br />
<br />
LoY was about atmosphere.  I love going there on alts, some great zones.  Go to Dulak, back in the caves, and try not  to be creeped out.  Brutul is right, LoY was not for 65's, it was for 30 to 60ish people, and provides some of the best content for those levels.  From LoY, take the zone designs, the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
LDoN has instancing.  It is so  nice to be in a zone and have no worthless spam going on in /ooc, no trains, no fighting over camps.  Keep instancing zones, it is nice.  LDoN has the idea of pushing people to go fast.  I like a fast pace, and LDoN provides that.  Provide incentives to people to focus, and keep going.  I hate going to zones where pulls are just steady, single pulls, always in control, no pressure.  People telling you about what they are watching on tv as they go.  Make zones where people do have to pay attention, and be on their toes(LDoN isn't really that, the mobs themselves are too gimp).  Side note here, Kailyn is dead on right about LDoN needing a third difficulty level.  I am at the level where normal is way too easy, and hard is just slightly above me(without an exceptional group).  Make a midle setting, with mobs that hit for 700ish, and I think that would be awesome.<br />
<br />
EQ obviously has a lot of quality content.  We all would not spend all this time discussing it if it did not draw us into the game so much.  What I want to see from SOE is that they learn from what they have done before that works, and uses that as a starting point, adding in some new, mixing the elements up in different ways, and really keeps the sense of excitement.</div></div><hr />

Who the f*ck are you tell to us what to complain about? Yes I will complain about LoY because it was a ripoff for everyone that was level 60+. But unfortunately it was not an expansion you could chose _not_ to buy if you wanted to remain competitive. Hell we have it as a requirement for shamans simply because they HAVE to have the Blood of Nadox spell and the only friggin way they can get it is by having LoY even if they never intend to play there, EVER. Also the Map feature comes to mind, which is immensely useful in LDON. And correct me if I am wrong, but you do need the LoY expansion to have that feature, yes ?<br />
<br />
IMO they should have sold the lowlevel content that made up LoY separetely from the actual features that everyone including highlevels need(Map+Bankspace etc). But they chose the rip-off path instead by charging everyone full price even for content they wont ever use. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah and being called a dork by the guy who posted this makes me all warm and fuzzy : <br />

<br />
I never went there for the same reason most didn't, it should have come out in the beginning of EQ. The level of mobs is to low to be on interest to most players now, who basically PL a char to 50 and go to LDoN and then PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LoY zones/content was good, assuming you had characters in the right level ranges to play there. The extra bank space, new spells, mapping feature and other minor things were pretty good too.<br />
<br />
I just wish I didn't have to shell out $20 for it, I think $10~15 would've been acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's reasonable to complain about the game content of LoY.  The point of LoY for most players (and I think it's a legitimate one) was the extra interface features (extra bank space, map tool).  SOE is a business, and I don't have a problem with being charged $20 every now and again for some newly coded functionality (okay, not that the bank space required significant &quot;new code&quot;, but you know what I mean).  <br />
<br />
And LDoN?  Speaking as a casual player (i.e. lacking the time to be in a raiding guild) who cares one hell of a lot about building an optimal character--THANK YOU SOE!  LDoN is an absolute godsend for non-raiders who nonetheless want to be optimal at the game.<br />
<br />
GoD may turn out to be another LoY, where you pay $30 bucks for some new features (like new AAs), and never touch the zone content at all.  It may turn out to be another LDoN, with amazing new instanced zones and spiffy AP rewards.  Either way, $30 just isn't all that much money for the time and effort they put into it.  <br />
<br />
Do I hope they make another &quot;full&quot; expansion, like Luclin or PoP or Velious?  Hell yeah.  I just don't expect GoD to be it, nor do I object to them making occasional minor releases (and charging money for them) in between the major releases.  They're a business.  They're here to make money, not to make the perfect game available for free.  Admire them for their leet BvP (Business vs. Player) skillz, and be glad that the result is lovely incremental improvements to a game we all love.<br />
<br />
And remember that they didn't charge us one red cent for the Provoke line.  It's not like they're gouging us every chance they get.  :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding EQ2, and power inflation in EQ1:<br />
<br />
SOE wants to start a new world, from scratch, to fix all of the built-in balance problems, and to eliminate four years of mudflation.  The players want to retain their friendships, and their investment (often quite considerable) in their characters.<br />
<br />
But that investment is not primarily embodied in gear.  If you stripped every character in the game of all items and plat tonight, by a week from today the top Time guilds would be back killing Time mobs, hardly the worse for wear.  Hell, I could re-equip my character to nearly the same level he is now in something like two or three months, if I were serious about it, which is nothing compared to the time I've put into him in the past.<br />
<br />
The investment is embodied in time (levels + AA) and organizational skill (Planes access and LDoN raid wins being the easiest measures).<br />
<br />
So.  Create EQ2.  Forget about selling it as a separate game; sell it basically as an expansion to EQ1 ($30 or so, and covered by the same monthly fee you're already paying for EQ1).  Let players play either, or both, as the spirit moves.<br />
<br />
And when you create an EQ2 character, you get a number of bonus stat points (assuming stats mean anything in EQ2), or AA points (assuming there's an equivalent to AA points in EQ2) based on your EQ1 accomplishments.  You know; an extra starting stat point for every level above 55 on your highest-level character, plus a stat point for every 5 AA, plus 10 stat points for Elemental plane access and 20 stat points for Time access, and 5 stat points for ever having one a Time-level LDoN raid.  Some formula like that.<br />
<br />
So that guilds can painlessly move themselves, part- or full-time, to EQ2.  So that players benefit in the new game proportionately to their efforts in the old.  <br />
<br />
SOE's win?  They get to move people to a new game, one that is more balanced, easier to maintain, more fun for players, and will retain more players longer.<br />
<br />
The players' win?  They get to painlessly try out a new game, stay somewhat leet if they were already leet, and incrementally persuade their friends to move over to the new game with them if they decide they want to stay.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the bulk of players will have &quot;voted with their feet&quot; for either EQ1 or EQ2, and momentum will bring most of the rest along.  If SOE has done a good job with EQ2, most players will eventually move over there.  And if a few stay in EQ1?  Consolidate servers some, cut back on support and new expansions, and wait for EQ1 to die a slow death by attrition.  There's always EQ2 waiting for anyone who gets lonely in the &quot;old world&quot;.<br />

But they chose the rip-off path instead by charging everyone full price even for content they wont ever use.  <br />
<br />
Should they also sell raid content entirely seperate, since it is content that many will not use?  Should family guild types have been charged half price for PoP, since they will only use about half of it?  If you are to expect it one way, it would have to go the other.<br />
<br />
I never went there for the same reason most didn't, it should have come out in the beginning of EQ. The level of mobs is to low to be on interest to most players now, who basically PL a char to 50 and go to LDoN and then PoP. <br />
<br />
So no new content should ever come out except at high levels?  How sad that you feel lower level people should not get new content as well, and how selfish.  And what a sad view of people, to say that most just PL to 50 and go on to LDoN and PoP.  Just a note:  I was just soloing my shaman, grinding towards 58, and doing it in Nadox, which is an awesome zone, with many good places to hunt.  If people choose not to go there, that is their right, but to condemn SoE for making great content for players not at the endgame is just sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine by me. But I think you missed my main point: <br />
<br />
Updated UI features that everyone regardless of level need/want(like the Map feature) should either come as part of our monthly 13$ subscription. Or alternatively if they deem some Interface/UI features to be so costly to develop that they cannot include them as part of our regular subscription, then include them in MAJOR expansions that covers all levels, or sell them as an Interface Expansion Pack or whatever. <br />
<br />
So no new content should ever come out except at high levels?<br />
I would say the &quot;majority&quot; of new content should be for high levels(50-65) yes. And there is one very compelling argument for why(besides the fact that this is the majority of the active playerbase - see below): <br />
<br />
Because everyone, even the most casual people will get there eventually. And what was once high-end content(NToV and the like) is now raided by what I would call very casual guilds.<br />
<br />
As a side-note, some interesting statistics about the current level distribution(snatched from safehouse thread http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=29397.topic). This pretty clearly demonstrates for what level range new content needs to be developed IMO :<br />

How sad that you feel lower level people should not get new content as well, and how selfish. <br />
Oh please.. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
For all I care they can make a level 1-50 expansion with 300 zones costing 50$. Just dont bundle it with 1 and 2 relatively small features _I_  need and expect me to pay full price for it.<br />
<br />
And besides, there are already tons and tons of zones for all levels from 1 to 60. In fact you would be hard pressed if you were to fully explore and play in them all and not be level 60 by the time you got done.</div></div><hr />

It did what it was supposed to - expanded content (And, even better, unkeyed/flagged places for lower level guilds to raid) for folks at levels below 60. It would be as misguided as a level 45 ripping PoP as a 'waste'.<br />
<br />
 And as far as the griping about LoY spells - I remember the days when no shaman who wasn't in a top end guild could EVER have a full spellbook without having his nose inserted in some guild's collective rectum or having more plat than god. I bought LoY, XP'd in some of the zones, and will say that the two Bard songs, in usage time and 'save my ass' factor, were WELL worth the $20. To this day I laugh at Bards who bought it for the bank/dye and never got the songs, especially the ones who do LDoN.<br />
<br />
 Plus, your point about who needs content is well taken by Sony, obviously - the next expansion is all about high enders. Where you'll hear the screams REALLY start is if it's all for Time+ guilds and is basically unusable by casual 65's.</div></div><hr />

From Sony's perspective, EQ is in it's final days. The expansions from this point on are just buying time until EQ2. The only way they are going to invest significant resources breathing new life into EQ1 is if EQ2 is a colossal failure(which is entirely possible), but I doubt they would salvage EQ1 either after going to so much trouble to move their player base on to the next generation of mmorpgs.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: EQ is gonna get worse before it gets better. Enjoy what is left while it lasts.</div></div><hr />

You want content for you, and since you are 65, you expect you should not have to pay for content for lower levels.  God forbid they bundle stuff that you might use with content that you don't want.  Trouble is, that happens for people every expansion.  Fo a long time, PoP offered a large portion of the population a new city, and 4 exp zones.  BTW, the Luclin.org chart with level distributions...that is from well post LoY.  In fact, the data was largely collencted post LDoN.  With a couple changes that have happened post LoY(opening up some flagged zones to all, adding LDoN, which is obscene exp at lower levels) it has certainly skewed the numbers towards the high end.</div></div><hr />

If they do that I am all for it but I am not going to spend another year or two starting over at level 1.<br />
<br />
LDoN has a few major screw ups.  <br />
<br />
They need an intermediate skill level.  Easy adventures are too hard for average players at 65 for the reward you get.  51 points for an adventure and the best gear is 1150 to 1450 points each?  That is moronic.  I would be way more enthused if I could do 10 adventures per upgrade and 10 for each augment but I raid a lot and I see more benefit in getting AA points than I ever will from LDoN.  I am not even going to spend 120 to 150 hours doing 100 or so adventures just to upgrade to a new Tak BP--WTF were they thinking?  <br />
<br />
Hard adventures are too hard period--going from easy but too tedious to almost impossible to win is too big a jump.  The people I know that do them only farm the nameds that pop by the zone in as far as I can see.  If your well equiped enough to win hards, you don't really need the actual drops.  The time geared people only get to buy a few decent augments for their effort but pretty much thats all they get.<br />
<br />
They also need some untimed adventures.  Perhaps they could add another theme where it isn't always a stressful race against the clock.  If you are in a pick up group with Joe Moron who screws it up for the rest of the people by being dumb or leaving on you, it is not fair that you wasted an hour and get nothing for it.<br />
<br />
They need to make the items that drop higher level for the effort and risk involved.  I will probably never see a LDoN raid because my guild isn't equiped well enough to actually win one and if they were, why would they bother?  The gear that drops there is VT level but requires people to be elemental equiped.  Basically, need easier raids (if they would let 72 people raid the same ones they have now this might not be an issue though) and they need some 2 and 3 group level mini-raids at the easy level where something decent actually drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. Once you get the AA hard advents are not that &quot;hard&quot;. I hit just over 8500hps fully buffed and I have never set foot into VT or the elementals. Most of the warrior loot that drops is an upgrade for me.<br />
<br />
But doing a hard advent leaves zero margin for error, which is the way I like it.<br />
<br />
Hard advents require a decent amount of AA's (as far as a tank goes), a good puller or great CC. The people in the group have to know their classes, not be Time equipped.</div></div><hr />

Amen to that.  The prices they charge for gear &amp; spells is absolutely crazy.  I spend most of my time raiding or farming key pieces to Emp or VT ... if I ever manage to get enough points to buy a Tak BP it's going to be completely by accident.<br />

Keane, that is 100 % exactly how I feel about LDoN hard.  I wear a very nice neck slot I got from one, and have seen a couple other drops that would be a nice upgrade as well.  I like the edge of the seat sense that being in LDoN hard gives.</div></div><hr />

Take a Dalnir, or a Kaesora, or a Paw, or Guk(please Paw and Guk, those should be great zones, they deserve to get use), add new mobs, add new quests, reitemize...and just maybe they would see more use.

<br />
How many people that complain about how LoY sucked raid old world zones on a fairly regular basis because it is good content and the events are enjoyable?<br />
<br />
Very few I'll bet.<br />
<br />
<br />
The desire for loot and character progression precedes all else in Everquest now.If an expansion came out tommorow that offered nothing new in terms of loot but featured various raid encounters designed to test the skills of existing time equipped people would it be a &quot;waste&quot; of money?<br />
<br />
For most it would be,And that is why there isn't really any need to produce good well thought out expansions anymore,Give players the short little increases in power every few months in an expansion of decently tuned content that doesn't really offer anything new in terms of encounters and players will pay for it and play it.<br />
<br />
LoY is a good example of this.For the majority of lvl 65 people, the encounters featured in that expansion designed for raiding also presented new challenges and events not typical of the majority of raid encounters in EQ.<br />
<br />
They were designed for low numbers and thinking rather than jsut toss a tank at it and heal him.It was a good template for what was to come in LDoN.It was ignored however by most players because the loot was &quot;shit&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
EQ didn't used to be about the loot,it used to be about immersion and fun,It used to be more difficult and in depth both in exploration/travel of the existing world and the encounters foudn within.As it aged and became more bloated with zones and mudflated with increasingly better loot the old world of EQ became useless.<br />
<br />
Haas note above some old really great well designed XP zones,New players don't use these anymore for a number of reasons,they are out of the way,they are intricate and difficult to recover from if mistakes are made and the loot and xp found within are pathetic compared to the present day standards of the new xp zones.<br />
<br />
It isn't about fun its about the development of your Toon.<br />
<br />
Of course by this point in the games life,you cannot turn back the clock and remove PoP's ZeMs and Graveyards,you can't remove the plane of knowledge portals ,you can't take out the myriad 75 hp + droppable items from the bazaar because the amount of player base that have grown to use these &quot;features&quot; have become so dependant on them that they would be lost in the game without them and the player base would plummet.<br />
<br />
EQ is a Min/Maxing game now,its nothing but a glorified first person shooter ,the world that once was is no more and the current crop of expansions and ideas are the building blocks for future MMORPG buisness plans,if it worked for EQ it will work for anyone else that has found at least some success with their game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isnt this human nature?  Aren't we all driven by these forces out side of &quot;a game&quot;?<br />
<br />
EQ has always been about these two items, from the bronze in solb to the ykesha in lguk.  <br />
<br />
I do agree that without &quot;loot&quot; an encounter becomes boring and repetitive after the first kill.   Why do the Inny in Nadox spawn after doing him once? It surely isnt for the loot.  Why do the  Hate's Fury Capt's mindless item gather quest after doing it once?  It surely isn't for the loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back to the topic at hand in a moment, but first... <br />
<br />
I've been through this argument before and I'm not sure why I bother, but there are a lot more low-level, part time players than most of you seem to think.  <br />
<br />
To mildly paraphrase an old saying: there's lies, damn lies and bar charts. <br />
<br />
First, sure, there's more 65's than anything else;  it's as high as you can go.  Why not take the same statistics and show a bar chart with '55 and over' vs. 'under 55'?  I think you would get a significantly different impression. <br />
<br />
Secondly, and more importantly, even if you do that it's still deceiving. <br />
<br />
I presume that that chart reflects a summary of players actually playing on the server(s) at various snapshots over time.  I wouldn't think it would reflect the average level of players DEFINED on the server, since, hopefully, no one outside SoE has access to that information. <br />
<br />
Since people who play a lot tend to have high level characters, then people who have high level characters also tend to play a lot (on average at least).  So, if I have a level 40 character that I play for 6 hours a week, and you have a level 65 character that you play for 60 hours a week, then you have 10 times the weight on that bar chart that I do. <br />
<br />
So what? you say - shouldn't the game be geared toward the active player base? - those who play the most?  Ummm.. there's actually a bit of validity to that (I'll get back to it), but economically, no - it doesn't make sense. <br />
<br />
Think about it - if you are Sony, what is your ideal customer?  Your ideal customer is someone who pays their fee every month and NEVER plays! You can support an infinite number of those people on one server!   <br />
<br />
Presumably, there aren't a whole lot of those people, but there are a large number of people who play a limited number of hours every week and still pay their fee.  Sony should love those people.  They get the same money, but require considerably less resources than people who play a lot.    For argument purposes, let's imagine two groups of people - 'casual' players, who average 10 hours a week, and 'hard-core' players, who average 50 hours a week.  <br />
<br />
By any means available, be it your perception, actual active player statistics, etc., there will always appear to be 1/5 the number of casual players than there actually are.   <br />
<br />
Bah - enough rhetoric - bottom line is, I BELIEVE there are more casual players than hard core - I am CERTAIN that there a lot more than people think.   And, most importantly, they are PAYING THE BILLS.   They are, relatively speaking, a free ride for Sony - they use 1/5 the servers per monthy fee, 1/5 the CS - 1/5 of all the ongoing costs per account.  <br />
<br />
I've been playing since before Kunark was released and at the time PoP came out, my highest level character was somewhere in the high 40's, so I bought PoP, at the time, for one zone and the books.   LOTS of people were in that same boat, so to those of you who complain about buying LDoN for just a few features let me say, and I mean this in the nicest way possible, screw you. <br />
<br />
Now, having said all that, I will still agree that there needs to be proportionately more content at the higher end (surprise) - simply because it's crowded up there.  The lower levels do not face the overcrowding problem for the most part, and there tend to be lots of places they've never seen.  However, they do deserve something new to keep their interest.   And you should want that too.  <br />
<br />
If we can pay for content we will never see (and we're paying for the development of it with our monthly fees whether we actually buy the expansions or not), then you can pay for some content you'll never use, because, believe me, you WANT to keep those relatively inactive accounts around.   As much as they are a free ride for Sony, they are also a free ride for you - you do not want to lose that half (or more than half) of the monthly fees that is the real income for Sony and that is funding their continuing development. <br />
<br />
Most of the new content will continue to be geared toward the high end - but let's not wish for all of it to be that way - you might just kill the goose that is laying a golden egg every month. <br />
<br />
So - what I'd like to see - another Kunark type expansion.  It remains in my opinion the best expansion ever.  Add a new race - new starting city(s) - all levels of zones up to and including the very highest content. <br />
<br />
Second - do something with the 20 or 30 zones that are almost completely unused.  I don't care what - change them just to change them - increase the ZeM - add some decent loot - add SOMETHING worthwhile to give people some reason to go there again.  <br />
<br />
And speaking of ZEM - PC continues to baffle me.  Why not at least reduce the ZEM to something moderately reasonable, even if it remains high, and then slap the same thing on 5 or 6 other zones in the same level range.  <br />
<br />
That's about it.</div></div><hr />

I think this gets back to one of the core problems with the game...zone imbalance.  PC is so great for xp that almost all players flock to it for 10 to 25.  This leaves all of the old 10 to 25 zones nearly empty.  The same thing happens all across the level ranges, especially once you hit 50 - then pop is far and away the better xp option.  <br />
<br />
Maybe this is fine, maybe it isn't.  It's sad for me to see W. Karana completely empty cause I remember going there at lvl 10 and competing with the other 70 peeps for spawns.  On the other hand, it's probably not a good use of SoE's resources to revamp every zone.  But, I do think they have a problem with inequity of zones within an expansion (PoTorment comes to mind :rolleyes: .)<br />
<br />
As to the &quot;who should expansions be geared towards&quot; question...if SoE focuses expansions on the time geared crowd I think the game folds in a couple years because that's such a small percent of the client base.  Yes, the ubers need something, but I don't think it's a good business decision to make them the focus of your development resources.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) Group Buffs on all levels<br />
2.) Paludal Caverns<br />
3.) PoP portal Stones<br />
4.) PoP Tier 2/3<br />
<br />
Thank goodness they finally fixxed group buffs... a level 15 wizard with KEI was just an exp machine.<br />
<br />
PC is just stupid silly xp... no reason in the world you should be able to go from level 1 to level 30 in 8 hrs... <br />
<br />
The PoP subway is here to stay, they should at least add bus stops in CS and the Dreadlands though..<br />
<br />
When they opened up tier 2/3 was like PC all over again for noobish level 60's... <br />
<br />
maybe I am elitist or strange, but there really should be some other sort of requirement on leveling than just experience... the influx of people at high levels who have such extremely limited knowledge of their character class. I dont know, maybe get a flag from Naggy and Vox to level to 53, ROFL... something, I just know its too easy to level up to 65 and not ever even have to really play the character..<br />
<br />
As to the original topic...<br />
<br />
What is my wish list from SoE?<br />
<br />
1.) LDON augment 10 AC 20 HP for all slots, type 7, War/RoG/Mnk <br />
<br />
2.) Fully Instanced poTime<br />
<br />
3.) NON-Blowable SPAWNS for progression<br />
<br />
4.) Intermediate and Easy settings on LDON<br />
<br />
5.) CS &amp; DL  - PoK portal stone<br />
<br />
6.) melee Stat AA to 355<br />
<br />
7.) melee friendly tradeskills<br />
<br />
8.) melee friendly/ caster unfriendly mobs (i.e. med hps, med-low dps, 1000 resists MR/DR/PR/FR/CR, non snareable ) mobs where a group of melee can kill, yet wont be camped 24/7 by dr dr00d and mr wizard...<br />
<br />
9.)  type 7 haste augment!<br />
<br />
10.) bigger boobies on dark elf chicks...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Not true, I want new content.<br />
<br />
You see, I happen to think LDoN is total timesink shit.  I don't want to be tied to my computers for XX minutes or I lose.  That's fucking bullshit.  Furthermore, you don't even earn upgrades to your gear...you have to buy all new gear, and then upgrade that.  It's total trash.   I&quot;m glad everyone enjoys it, it gets you the fuck out of zones I frequent.<br />
<br />
I also happen to think that 99% of PoP is shit too.  I can't be challenged there.  Ya, the first time I was in BoT or HoH it took about 5 minutes to readjust my tactics.  Big fucking deal.  Same goddamned shit, outdoor mob spacing, everything just hits harder.  If I know i can walk out into a vast expanse of a zone like the Dreadlands or Storms or Valor or whatever and just wait until I see a single mob and pull it.  That's boring, that's bullshit, and that's REALLY what they mean when they say Everquest  That's not the game that hooked me 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
So what's left for a fellow like me?  Well, I've got the aforementioned BoT and HOH...that is if they're not being swarmed by the fucking idiot brigade, and then I've got Droga, and that's basically it for my XP choices.  Everything else is either green or doesn't yield the XP that Droga does.  How come when I grew up I had Solusek and Guk, and then Kaesora, and Chardok, and Sebilis and Siren's Grotto, and DN and hell, even Kael gave me a decent chunk of XP when I was camping the bank for my BP.  Now you've got your choice between overcamped ornate camps in BoT or Droga or the &quot;Lost dungeons&quot; which should have remained fucking lost.  I want a REAL goddamned dungeon, not this shit they're trying to pass off as fucking expansions.<br />

Last night did a normal mission with all 65's and won easily. However we had no cleric (druid main healer) it was a guild group and 5 of the 6 of us are under 100 AA's. No way we could take on a hard with this group. Another thing might be intersting for LDoN is adjusting the adventure to the number of people in the group (maybe this does happen, never seen it). They allow you to accept a mission with 3  now but still have the same number of items to collect to kill etc. I know this could lead to serious point farming but would also allow those 4 in the morning players a chance to maybe get some LDoN time they normally do not get.<br />
<br />
Haass read your message above. This is just a suggestion that we have done in BoT when it is really full. We took a grp and exped in the towers. These are normally open because most don't like to try this. Mobs are a little tougher than the normal mobs downstairs but exp is great.<br />

No single character XPing from 1-65 even able to experience it all anymore.<br />
<br />
All of old Antonica, Faydwer, Odus zones and I mean all<br />
that something like 40 XP zones right there<br />
then there is LoY once again 99% of content for newbs<br />
Add to that now most of trivialized  Kunark/Velious/Luclin and LdoN that can be used by newbs too and you will realize that there is no fucking way any new character is going to see all or even a good chunk of it before maxing out at 65 unless they cut off xp themselves for AAs or some such.<br />
<br />
So lets see now what is it there for a guy who is 60-65 and who is grinding AAs BoT/LDoN/Tactics/Innovations/Nightmare/CoD/PoV/PoD/PoS/Sol Ro and then a few more for those who have elemental flags and a few old world revamped zones.<br />
<br />
So thats the whole 20 or so zones VS 70+ zones for newbs. Newbs have the luxury of having non-crowded zones to enjoy and high levels have the pleasure of being herded into a few small places where they have to be at each others throats if they want to improve their character.<br />
<br />
What EQ needs now is ONLY high level content which a year a two from when it comes out will be trivialized for mid level content anyway.</div></div><hr />

Since Luclin a large amount of people have basically told SOE though actions that while they may bitch, cry, whine and complain about the situation, they will basically do almost anything in the name of advancement and loot. And until that changes, not a lot will change imo.<br />

What do I personally want? Heh I don't really know anymore. Something unpredictable I guess. The game and its expansions have become way too predictable</div></div><hr />

Actually, I have a pretty good idea how much content there is since I've been in just about all those zones at one time or another in my 3 and a half years of playing. <br />
<br />
Those who think that level 65 is the only thing going on in this game, or even that it is most of what is going on in this game are myopic and self-absorbed at best.  Those that find it necessary to gratuitously (and repetitively) refer to everyone who is not playing the level 65 game as 'newbs' deserve their own circle in Dante's world, imo. <br />
<br />
Let me point out that everyone who is below level 65 is not levels 1 to 64 all at once (think about it).  They are almost always at some given level at any one time and thus do not have '40+' zones available to them at that level.  They have only a few levels available to them, just like the level 65s.   And some of those zones get old after a while.  <br />
<br />
Now, as I (very generously, I thought) pointed out in my earlier post, lower levels don't face the overcrowding in their zones that 65s do, so I conceded (very generously, I thought) that a lot of the development effort should continue to be concentrated on higher level content.  But don't tell me ALL of it should be.   <br />
<br />
If I want to ask for something new in low to mid levels after 3 and a half years of paying my money, then I will fucking well ask for something new.  There are, I still contend, more of me than there are of you, paying our money for considerably less playing time.   I know you don't give a rat's ass about us, but you will if we all get bored and quit.   In easy to understand terms: <br />
<br />
If half the players quit and stop paying their monthly fees, then Sony will only have half as much income (money).  <br />
<br />
Then they will only be able to pay half as much money for development (new stuff), unless they want to lose money, which they probably don't. <br />
<br />
Then there won't be as much new stuff for anyone (including you!). <br />
<br />
I hope that's clear. <br />
<br />

Name any level range under 60 and I will give you 10 fucking zones you can bring 1 group to and get GOOD xp if you're not an idiot.<br />
<br />
Now please do the same for a 65 in a non elemental guild.  Even tier 2 zones taper off for XP at 65.</div></div><hr />

Ok, level 45.  Not that I don't think you can do it.  I just want to make you go through the work.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and it would help if it's some zone where I can find a pick-up group without wasting more than half of my 2 hours at a stretch playing time.   And some zone that YOU wouldn't mind sitting in for a few more levels. If I remember correctly, it was you who said you damn well did want some new content because a lot of the existing zones were boring.   Me too.   I've spent most of the last 3 levels in PoV - now there's an exciting place; almost as interesting as, umm... the Dreadlands. <br />
<br />
You don't really have to do this - I can name the zones myself.  My only question is, so this means that ALL new development should go to high level content?  Because that's what my last post was in response to.  <br />
<br />
I have already said (twice before - this makes 3 times) that a lot of the development should go to making new high level content;  maybe even most of it - I don't have a problem with that.  <br />
<br />
But somebody saying that ALL of it should go to that pisses me off.  That is dismissive of a big chunk of the player base.</div></div><hr />

You know what else is dismissive to a big chunk of the playerbase?  Upping the system requirements for every fucking expansion whether you own it or not.  They've decided that it's a loss they have to take to keep the game looking new.  Time for them to decide that the fucking noobs have enough shit to do and there is a massive goddamned bottleneck at the top.<br />

This would be a very good argument, except that it is not entirely true.  Go to, for example, HoH...usually never more than 10 or 12 in zone, tons of places to exp, and with the added advantage that most camps are out of the way of any training.  Droga, which is less exp per kill, but faster kills, rarely if ever has more than 1 group, and is often deserted.  Tactics usually has a couple chanters and maybe 1 exp group in it, tons of places to camp.  LDoN you get a dungeon to yourself.<br />
<br />
I agree that the game does need more high end content, and expecially more raid content.  This does not mean that lower level content should be ignored.</div></div><hr />

If there was a segue into that thought, I missed it. <br />
There is PLENTY for your twinks to do. I'm telling you, there is more shit to do than someone who dies 15 times a day and only gains a few blues a day could possibly do. <br />
What?<br />
<br />
I do play twinks - I'm playing an Iksar Monk twink right now;  I do it whenever playing my main gets boring or seems pointless, which is more and more of the time.  He's 62 right now (my main, I mean) - he could have been 65 a long time ago if I really wanted, but.. <br />
<br />
There's nothing for me at 65.  At 4K unbuffed and 2 hour stretches of playing time there's nothing for be but being a less than adequate tank in tier 2 zones.  With a lot of work I suppose I could be 5K unbuffed and be slightly less inadequate but I'm still not playing for more than 2 hours at a time.  I'll get there eventually, but there's still nothing (particularly) for me at 65. <br />
<br />
So I guess I'm putting it off intentionally, because I want to continue to have something to look forward to with my 'main.'   <br />
<br />
I guess, actually, maybe, you've got a point.  What the fuck - when I think about it, a bunch of new content is probably not going to make me play this game any longer one way or the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing I always somewhat liked about the old EQ was that you could reasonably fit a very large amount of people into a very small space, IE: the entire 40+ crowd of every server into two zones, lower guk and solusek B.<br />
<br />
There werent any other options, and although at times it seemed like it, it wasnt that bad really.<br />
<br />
The zones were designed with multiple seperate camps per unit of space, the mobs were fairly easily seperated into different camps, the camps were of a somewhat progressive nature as far as the requirements to actually be there, IE: lvl 40s would be exping around the entrance, but you bring a 45 group in there and they go maybe fight down to the second level and exp there, bring some 50s in and they will work on getting some SMRs or something, bring in the real big dogs and they will go for the real live and undead bosses.<br />
<br />
Seb was the same thing, 50s at the entrance maybe the bridges, 55s over at bonecaster or gang, 60s would be down at shrooms or juggs where the real rewards are in the zone, and bring enough 60s and maybe you could try trak.<br />
<br />
Zones these days are relatively vanilla, and there are very few camps per unit of space, think plane of valor, everything on the vast space of land between the 2 water boundaries and before the castle remains unkilled ever, however the topside castle walls have frequent groups and so does OC or IC, the problem here is that these camps are all completely equal, there is really no group that can fight at one camp that cannot fight at another camp.  No real progression in camps either, you gain nothing by camping IC over OC, maybe a chance at the sleepwalker but thats about it.  This applies to all of POP exp zones that are tier 1 or 1.5 (valor/storms) for the most part.<br />
<br />
BOT is somewhat in the line of the old seb/lguk in that weak groups will fight at the entrance, better groups might go in some and include some kriegers in their fighting, and better still groups would try their hands at the wing bosses, and bring enough people and maybe you could try a tower boss or two.<br />
<br />
The problem in BOT is its relative to total lack of seperate camps, there is really nearly no reason to camp any side other than earth side unless there is a group already killing all of the earth side.  Also no other side matches the easily pullable 4 kriegers to one camp, other wings barely have so many kriegers together as there is just in the earth side.  If there were more kriegers in the other wings, then more people would be able to reasonably fit into BOT without feeling total suck.<br />
<br />
The comparison between lguk and BOT then being that lower guk has probably 10 decent camps to support 10 decent groups and give them reasons to actually be there for anything other than exp, whereas BOT has only one such camp the mentioned earth kriegers.<br />
<br />
Another POP zone that sucks is torment, there is not one single camp in this zone that offers anything other than exp for a single group, none, and if there is one somewhere that I dont know about then its either 1) insanely difficult to get to, not like high lvls clearing a few trash mobs meant for lower groups to get to the real camp, or 2) some very close guarded secret, and I mean very closely guarded, such that nobody ever heard of it outside of DEVs.<br />
<br />
If the POP zones were designed like the old school dungeons with natural progression in mind then it wouldnt feel so much like you were just plain stuck in trash zones if you had no claim to one of the very few camps in a real zone.<br />
<br />
If all pop tier 1 zones were made this way, I mean with a progression path that must be cleared to get there so that you just cant walk to the better camp, and increasing rewards as you progress through from one camp to the next, then these tier one zones would be wildly more popular than any other zones in all of POP as far as exping goes.<br />
<br />
I dont want outdoor zones, kiting is bad, maybe one expansion zone designed for solo dru/wiz that is akin to POV to keep them from trying to kite in a real expansion progression zone.  I want to pull the lvl 50 mobs at entrance, move in some, then pull the 52s, then the 54s, then the 56s, once I get to this point I want a large amount of branches to go out, each to seperate camps, one camp per branch, the branches will then have trash mobs be 58 at the front, and 60 for a mini camp in each branch that gives either spell or item rewards that are useable for anyone fighting here, then I want one big room with one big lvl 65 boss with two lvl 62 guards, and two guardian bosses which are lvl 63 with lvl 60 guards,  all 3 named should be linked with their guards in such a way that no guard or named can ever be split from the pack of 3, if one is fought they must all be fought together, mezzing is fine for the boss guards but not the boss.  All three bosses have a decent sized loot table, with approximately 6 items droppable, two for each class type, tank, priest, or caster.  Such that at each big boss room there is 6 possible and USEFUL items for a group that goes there, and if a group were to go through the whole zone and clear every mob maybe 3 or 4 times then they should have a really good basic set of equipment made up to start the next bigger set of dungeons.<br />
<br />
Killing the lvl 65 bosses in each branch would then flag you for the next higher tier of the same type of dungeon layout (but wildly different mob types and scenery).<br />
<br />
There would follow a sort of dungeon to dungeon progression, with say 3 tier 1 dungeons, and 3 tier 2's, and 3 tier 3's, etc.<br />
<br />
Thats what I want to have in EQ again.<br />
