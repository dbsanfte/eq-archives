Anyone have any idea what they were fixing or changing?<br />
<br />
I heard people were getting a ton of runes by kind of &quot;exploiting&quot; OoW instanced zones.  They would start an expedition with 3 level 46ish toons, camp them and bring back their 65+ toons and tear through the place because the mobs are all so low level..... and in the process they would get a ton of runes by doing it over and over.  Is this true, anyone else heard of someone else doing this?  I am seeing people in the bazaar with 6-7 of each kind of sellable rune except for the greaters, I'm thinking that they may have done this with 3 bots but I'm just speculating.  Anyone else heard anything about it?</div></div><hr />

Whether I start a level 67 or below isntance, or a 68+ one, I can still 3box both the named before they repop, and I get better rune results from the higher level instance.<br />

What i'm hoping they fixed is the bugged shrewd Dragorn, having 30 or so of him stacked on top of each other can really lag the area.</div></div><hr />

But can you do it as fast as they can by raping a bunch of level 45-50ish mobs?  I see people in the bazaar on Drinal with 5+ of each droppable rune (excluding greater) and they're not selling them for astonomical prices, which leads me to believe they're not resellers.  I haven't done this personally but if I can get a bunch of 50k+ rune drops for slaughtering a bunch of green/LB mobs in less than an hour, I'll be all over that.</div></div><hr />

Yes they can, and further, by doing level approprite instinces, they can get exp too.  2 named, with PH's, 14 minute spawn.  No matter what you do, you can at most get 2 named every 14 minutes, and then only if you are lucky.  Ideally, one of the things they fixed is the Shrewd Dragorn that GraniteMG mentioned, tho if you are fast, you can farm some nice exp off him.</div></div><hr />
