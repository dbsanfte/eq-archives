<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is more of a grumble than a hearty rant.  Sorry.  I just don't have enough venom and bile right now.  <br />
<br />
Lately with more grinding going on, my biggest problem seems to be finding a good cleric.  I don't get it.  It's NOT that hard to play one.  I sometimes two box a cleric, but when someone wants to bring a friend, the group has a cleric and i'm just joining it with my warrior, or I get this silly idea that for hard content I should invite a single boxed cleric so I can focus on one character, I expect to get a good cleric who outperforms me 2 boxing.  Honestly I'm not that wonderful at playing MT and main healer at the same time.  I'm really not.  So why the hell can't I find good clerics far too often?  Oh, some have been good, but a surprising number have not been.  <br />
<br />
Common examples of late:  <br />
<br />
1.  The &quot;40% CH cleric&quot; cleric.  This cleric starts their CH when you're at 40% health, no matter what mob you're fighting or where.  Are they playing EQ from 3 years ago?  Has their only grind zone been BoT with tanks overgeared for the zone?  If the content is what I'd consider remotely challenging now, the damage spikes are bad enough that you sure as hell better not wait for me to hit 40% health to start the CH.  Has it occurred to you that you can't heal the same way for every single grind mob in EQ?<br />
<br />
2. The &quot;Never has mana&quot; cleric.  This cleric frequently burns through all their mana either through a total lack of math knowledge (how many hit points per mana are you healing?) or because they wait too long to start the heal, much like the 40% CH cleric, but the latter are bright enough to realize that they waited too long and must now use a faster heal.  Of course those fast heals cost more mana, heal less, and when overused you frequently hear &quot;lom&quot; from the cleric.  They may also burn huge amounts of mana on unnecessary group heals.  Back in the day I called them the &quot;divine light&quot; clerics after that damn spell.  It cost only a little less than CH, only healed something like 900 hit points, and yet I had some clerics who soon went &quot;LOM&quot; using it to heal me even after combat in easy grinds.  Learn a little math prz.  <br />
<br />
3. The &quot;Chuck an early direct heal&quot; cleric.  Many clerics don't seem to comprehend aggro after 65+ levels and a bunch of AAs.  Yes, since I have a cleric myself, I realize sometimes you have no choice but to chuck a direct heal on someone right as the mobs hit camp and it sucks.  But sometimes I group with clerics who frequently throws that early heal on me when it's not needed.  Delaying the heal a bit or doing elixir followed later by a direct heal would have been plenty, or actually getting Divine Arbitration and using it.  Instead they keep chucking that direct heal as a mob hits camp, get aggro, and die or at least waste more mana healing themselves and make me chase the mob around.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line.  Any comparably leveled single boxed cleric should be a better and more efficient healer than my 2 boxed cleric run almost entirely from hot keys on my old 600 mhz pentium III computer.   Sadly it seems many are not and that's not to brag about my &quot;l337 ski11z&quot; (sp? :P) at all.  It's just not that hard to be better than that.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah for sure when clerics use fast heals instead of just ch'ing early and get low on mana its a pain in the ass.  Also I hate when they use fast heals for no apparent reason, like they didn't heal late, I'm not dying quick but they blow mana on supernal light or whatever.</div></div><hr />

Thankfully in my groups I never had to worry about finding a good cleric...I was the cleric.  Just had to worry about the tank.  Although I think I was just decent, the group I would play with thought I was awesome for some reason...like it's really hard to pay attention as a cleric...<br />
<br />
I really don't get some clerics when I read those stories.  Elixers are getting pretty dang powerful (OoW Elixer is 1170/tick), yet they still insist on throwing large direct heals right off?  I often wonder if PLing clerics is a common tactics nowadays.</div></div><hr />

I'll never understand how an enchanter can hit his 60's and still insist on avoiding AEmez. I've had chanters gripe and moan about multipulls and <br />
specifically tell us they dont use AEmez cause it sucks and blows mana.<br />

Well, yes, I think a lot of casual guilds basically have alt-heavy cleric ranks. If I knew someone who was interested in starting to play EQ and they asked me for advice on a fun class to play, I'm not sure I'd say cleric. Most of the clerics in my guilds are alts who play if they have to. Most are not pl'd, but even so, the level of play on an alt is usually lower than the level of play on a main, regardless of the skill of the player.<br />

I do know that when I'm 2 boxing I sometimes notice myself taking too long on a heal or otherwise making a mistake that I wouldn't have made if I was single boxing that cleric, so I expect single boxed ones to be a better choice for difficult content and have sought them out.  Silly me.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real problem with the cleric class is that anything in terms of skill past the most basic cheal timing is that the only time anything like player skill comes into the equation is when it hits the fan. With grind spots like today's for the leveling character, a cleric may never, ever need to learn how to handle things going bad. With the various HoTs and reasonable tanks in places like BoT, as well as twinkertanks growing up, he may never have to learn how to use cheal as a mainstay heal. And then you hit a place like wall of slaughter, where most tanks are gonna have a much rougher time of it. It's a totally new situation for these people. The basics of tanking are universal. Healing strats should change depending on the beating the tank is taking. Since these clerics have never seen a tank take a real walloping, they just can't deal with it... yet. They only hae one or two healing strategies. In the coming weeks, a lot of clerics are going to have to learn to adapt. And most of them will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been annoying as hell lately knowing the spots in wos I want to hit to get the most named spawn, but not having the groups capable of doing it.  It's partly unskilled clerics.  It's partly lack of the right classes.  For one all the good puller classes seem to have quit EQ.  :P  Finding a group that has slow, good pulling, and CC all covered at the same time... that's tricky.  Yeah yeah, if the pulling is perfect you don't need CC, but I deal with the realities of a pickup group.  If we have CC, it usually goes a lot better.<br />

wos trash mobs are easy.  ldon hard mobs do considerably more dps on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact, a lot of players suck.  It's just that when a cleric sucks, it's more obvious.<br />
<br />
The difference between playing a cleric (or an enchanter or tank) and playing any other class, is that if you suck, the group wipes.  If you're playing (say) a rogue and you suck, you'll probably die a couple more times, but the group won't wipe and other people will tend to compensate for your suckiness.<br />
<br />
The most forgiving classes for this are probably nuking classes.<br />
<br />
It takes a few pulls to get used to a tank you don't know.  In places like MPG, you can replace a 14k, 500aa tank with a 9k, 30aa tank.  It takes the poor cleric a couple of fights to figure out the new &quot;heal point&quot; - in that case, maybe 85% instead of 40% - and during the adjustment period you can end up with a lot of spam heals.<br />
<br />
I have to say that, having a cleric main, I can't level up an alt past the mid-fifties, because I just can't stand grouping with clerics who aren't me.  They all do it wrong.  :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of trivial observations.<br />
I was in a pick-up LDoN recently. I was pulling. Had cleric &amp; chanter in group. I'd been pulling a bit on the slow side, splitting mobs whenever I could and getting the cleric to pac when mobs were tight. Then on one pull pac failed. We had 4-5 mobs in camp. Not only did the chanter get them all iced, but the cleric timed his heal so that it landed on me at &lt;5%--just as the last add was mezzed. So, no one died, no one but me had aggro. Nothing spectacular, just very solid play and everyone was awake. It made me realize that the people I was grouped with were much better than I'd assumed, and that my default mental setting for pick up groups is to assume that the chanter can't pick up adds and that clerics can't time their heals.<br />
<br />
Second, one of the top-ranked LDoN players on my server is a druid friend of mine. She does a lot of pick up LDoNs, usually as main healer. So I get a lot of tells from her giving me blow-by-blow accounts of some pretty stupid melees. From a healer's point of view, a loose cannon warrior is a group wipe waiting to happen, lol.<br />
<br />
Skilled players in almost any class really can make a difference in a group, but the skill of the healers (and pullers) are just a bit more on display.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find that real quality players can usually pick up any class, and after a short while playing they tend to be better then the vast majority of people who have been playing that class for years. This is because being a good player is not really about knowledge of your class.. the actual mechanics of playing the game are easy... its general game knowledge that is important. Seeing your role as a part of the whole and knowing how best to fit in is not only about knowing exactly when to hit your 3 key, anyone can alt+tab to their eqwbot and do that.<br />
<br />
With clerics its glaringly obvious sometimes. Ive had clerics try to convince me that divine arb is useless, had clerics refuse to use elixirs because they are &quot;too slow&quot; and just recently had clerics bag epic 1.5s because they &quot;didnt use the rclick&quot;. The same can be said of any class of course, but cleric happens to be one of the easiest to bot with eqw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that hit the nail on the head.<br />
We only notice the bad ones.<br />
<br />
Besides, almost all guilds scream for more clerics all the time, so that's bound to lure a lot of bad players into trying a Cleric and play the game on &quot;easy&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its frustrating to die and since many clerics feel guilty when someone dies they tend to err on the conservative side to the point of absurdity. im frustrated when i tank for hours and in the entire time i never go below 20 percent health even once, all the more so when there is another tank-worthy class in the group like a beastlord who can pick up the tanking in event that a damage spike takes me out. i get a rush out of near death experiences anyway so if a damage spike does take me out once in a while (im talking exp groups here obviously) and someone else can pick up the mob i really dont mind too much.<br />
<br />
i say this to encourage clerics to grit your teeth and let those tanks get down to 20 percent or even less consistently on the easier mobs. if you have a hot tempered tank then by all means heal him early. but believe it or not some of us tanks like a cleric who cuts it a little closer and allows us to die once in a while.<br />
<br />
do not underestimate HOT spells. even as a non raid warrior with only 8300hp and 1700 buffed AC i will generally NOT lose hp on a hard ldon mob if i have a HOT on me. for that reason i am a huge believer in HOTs as an alternative to patch heals by the cleric for most situations. i also wish clerics would HOT themselves instead of using instant heals. and that does not change just because they are channeling through a heal while they are getting beat on. an instant self-heal while being beat upon only makes it that much harder to pull agro back off. all too often an instant self-heal turns into a chaincast healfest on the cleric.<br />
<br />
ok .. scenario time. 4 mobs come to camp. in the time needed to get them mezzed or rooted or snare-kited or whatever the group does to keep the tank from having to handle them all the cleric gets agro. the tank (me) finds himself taunting off the cleric. then the cleric finally gets a chance to try to channel through a heal on himself. i pray he is casting heal over time. but no .. he casts instant heal so i cant taunt off him. now he has to cast a second heal. another instant heal. root breaks on one mob or mez breaks and it goes after the cleric. (weep). ohh ... if only the cleric had done heal over time on himself. all these instant heals and pretty soon even a kited snared mob starts looking the cleric's way.<br />
<br />
im a big believer in heal over time.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately not every cleric has those powerful elixiers.<br />
At least on Kael its like 4 to 5 guilds in Kod'Taz and only one in Qvic and farther.<br />
So you can imagine that not even every cleric there has Holy Elixier or the new OOW one (I think 2 clerics in my guild have it and I am not one of those).<br />
It depends a lot where you hunt too.<br />
I was recently in MPG with my warrior and it was a close call sometimes with those 1100 hitters and some nasty dd procs.<br />
Cleric was a blue con to me (68 warrior) from a guild going after Luclin/Early PoP targets.<br />
It was a zone in group so nothing nasty and me and the healer were the only ones to die (except the beastlord once) 2 or 3 times in a 4 hour session(Cleric went ld once).<br />
Cleric was a good one although i didnt see her use Divine Arbitration once (dont think she got it) but supernal light and complete heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It the bad ones that give us good clerics a bad rep sometimes.  Cause until we are in groups and can *prove* ourseleves, hardly anyone trusts us and our playing ability. I have noticed alot of Group Changes since OoW, as some said here, breaking out the old bot's to heal instead of getting one that is LFG. I also wonder, if people don't see certain guild tags they automatically assume the player not good enough? But, I also know that everyone is seeing this some as the WoS become train city and 100+ players in a zone, that we all end up with the Good, Bad and Uglies of any class.<br />
<br />
Yes I learned drastically when OoW came out, and screwed up the first time or two. But that is part of the game and when you start adjusting your play style to the zone / mob, then that shows how good a player you are. There are people that do not belong in some of the new zones, but do anyways. Some one who is maybe a good DPS with 5k HP should NOT, (MHO) become the MT in some of these zones, but they think they are the dream come true and since they can do BoT, they can handle WoS.<br />
<br />
One thing I always do when I enter a group, or have a tank change is find out HP status of that tank. Some do this automatically, some ya sorta have to pry the info out of them. I can't do my job as a healer if I do not know what I have to face. The ones that say that Cleric's are easy, or think we have a easy ride, then they don't look beyond certain things and just see the ones that sit, stand, heal, sit. I am sure that most here agree a Good Cleric, knows a little about each class. We must know when the right time to heal that tank, cause maybe in a certain fight they want to zerg and burn a disc, now I have to only HoT on a low end of the HP so he cranks out big DPS while low on health. But same time watch him just incase a bad situation and be ready for a quickey. There are classes I do not heal at all, unless a major problem, I.E. Necromancers. Given, that I ran with a necromancer for 2 years and learned alot about the class and suh, but the clerics that sit ther and heal them at 80% health cause they an INT caster, don't know the class and that they really have powerful spells to take care of themselves. I could go on, but I prolly have hijacked the thread from the original meaning.<br />
<br />
There are cleric's out there that have prolly never seen much action as some of these OoW zones can provide. I am not in a big guild (Not in elem planes or KT), but think I can manage on my own and provide the healing required. I do have 5kish unbuffed Mana Pool and FT11 + MC3. If not, I am not afraid to open my mouth and voice my feelings. Ones that can do this prolly earn alot of respect from the others.</div></div><hr />

I got one rune on a raid - go go level 68 stun - and bought 3 runes in bazaar.<br />
The Holy Elixier rune was very common for us once we started doing Ikkiniz Raids, the other 2 are another story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 They are insanely booring, Cheal, DA, HOT.... If you try and get off your arse and melee so you are not so boored everyone complains.<br />
3 They really dont need to do much untill the sheet hits the rotating round thing, then they get very very busy.<br />
4 You can never leave groups, people wine, complain, and lay on the guilt trips, so you end up staying on till 3am while boored.<br />
5 Everyone thinks they know how to heal better than you.<br />
6 When people die, its always your fault.<br />
7 INFUCKINGVISABILITY! makes traveling on a cleric a risky proposition unless you have a stock of invis potions.<br />
<br />
People complained bitterly when i retired my cleric, but it was the best thing ive ever done to improve my fun factor in the game.<br />
<br />
Its a pain that you need a cleric to go anywhere challenging, and its a pain that no one likes playing them, but threads like this are why. Its a prick of a job. Its all responsibility.<br />
<br />
When a clearly acknowledged undergeared tank is unnable to perform the task they were recruited for, then they feel they can blame the cleric.<br />
<br />
On the cleric boards you never see &quot;Tanks suck! man tanks do nothing but soak up my mana&quot; threads.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the love of a good tank!&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Its one of the toughest roles in the game, tooo tough fo me. I much prefer being a tank where you just hit attack, worry bout positioning, disc chaining and the occasional tank change.<br />
<br />
Brrrrr, clerics, for those that really want to make a difference, and have the temprament to endure the complaints, guilt trips and &quot;all clerics are greedy bastards&quot; threads.<br />
<br />
Good luck all.</div></div><hr />

Late response, sorry, but as the original poster I would point out again that I two box a cleric.  If I can clearly heal more effectively slapping hot keys on my 2 boxed gimp geared cleric than whatever single boxed cleric we've recruited, then I don't have any problem with blaming the cleric.  <br />
<br />
As for the class being boring, I can certainly understand.  I've never switched my main to my cleric because I'd be bored with it.  But at the same time, if you're that bored with it, then play something else.  Don't go advertise as a cleric lfg.<br />
<br />
I'll respond to a few more things because i'm bored... :p<br />
<br />
4 You can never leave groups, people wine, complain, and lay on the guilt trips, so you end up staying on till 3am while boored.<br />
<br />
I don't.  I just bring my 2 boxed cleric over to fill in.  :p<br />
<br />
5 Everyone thinks they know how to heal better than you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I do.  :D  I shouldn't, but that's what I'm saying, there are some clueless people out there (in any class, really).  It's just that the cleric's job is important enough, if they're clueless it really shows.<br />
<br />
6 When people die, its always your fault.<br />
<br />
Nah, often it's the puller's fault.  :)<br />
<br />
7 INFUCKINGVISABILITY! makes traveling on a cleric a risky proposition unless you have a stock of invis potions.<br />
<br />
/nod... it sucks not having invis.  As I said, I box a warrior and a cleric, neither of whom has invis.  I go through an assload of potions.  It's an expense, but damn, at L65+ you can't tell me it's THAT big of an expense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Through my mid 50's and early 60's I loved being a cleric because people would let me in higher level groups due to the difficulty in finding a trustworthy cleric.  A side bonus to this was that I was usually out of range of the curse when they would come to gank us.<br />
<br />
One thing I always do when I enter a group, or have a tank change is find out HP status of that tank. <br />
<br />
Sometimes this is like pulling teeth on a pvp server.  Maybe they would be afraid that I would finnish him off with my uber easily resisted 600 dmg nuke and jack their ring of vallor or whatever.<br />

<br />
This is pretty darn annoying when your group has a named on track and decide to go get it.  They invis up and run of.  I have to stand there going /g ... ummm... guys...  clerics can't invis.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I like to consider myself a good cleric, but sometimes even I get close calls.  I have memories of seeing complete heals hitting low enough that it wouldn't completely heal a tank in pov.  I have had complete heals go off while the targets health bar was purple (they lied about how much hp they had).  And I have even made a ranger feign death  :D   after he was healed he was still laying on the ground and he had to /stand.<br />
<br />
Okay... now that I think of it maybe I am a bad cleric  :(   atleast most of those close calls were when the crap hit the fan (i.e. charm and mez breaking at the same time)<br />

I don't know about you, but I think the tank has an advantage over a *real* cleric in timing heals.  You know how fast your hps are dropping, you know what the mob is doing...I'm not sure how to explain it, but I cut heals closer on myself than any of the real clerics I group with, and on the rare occaision that I play my cleric without the warrior, I find it much more difficult to heal another tank than it is to heal myself.<br />

You're saying this like it's a bad thing hehe.  Seeing how close I can cut CH's is my favorite game.  These days it takes crits to get good ones though.  My best so far:<br />

I have found this to be true myself.  I have a Druid and a Cleric that I box.  When I'm playing the Cleric, I can time CHs down to the wire.  I think one reason is that you are actually paying attention to what you are getting hit for and how often.  I know I don't watch melee spam when I'm healing someone else, but I sure watch it when I'm tanking.</div></div><hr />

Competant boxing isnt better or worse than real players behind each toon.<br />
Its just different.<br />
<br />
A lot of it comes down to information and timing.   Any competant boxer has more information comign into thier screen and often can take advantage of it.   My normal combo is Dru/Shm so I can see when a Slow bounces and I need to duck and spot instead of ICH.  Or Spot from the shaman because I know when the ICH is late.   Or realize that the bounced slow = agro for shm and start healing shm before any real player would realize and cast.<br />
<br />
I often also bot a variety of tanks/healer combos (ranging from War/Bst tanks to Clr/Dru/Shm healers)   You instinctively can tell gee the CH is going to be a bit late.   Duck/Spot  OR KITE.  even a summoner has a summon timer so you get hit once, run summon, rerun, heal lands than finish mob<br />
<br />
Beat MPG Fear last night.   War Pal Necro Ran Dru (me) Shm (me) there was a lot of cross healing.  looking at various mana bars and knowing who had more mana to heal.   Knowing when to throw AA group hots, etc.   Could a different dru or shm won?  Possibly, but also quite possibly would have lost due to wasting mana<br />
as both spot at same time, or thinkign the other would heal.</div></div><hr />
