<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question to the rest of you about the drop rate of the Darkblade of the Warlord. My guild has been in Time since August. After the initial learning period, we've been farming Time nonstop ever since. Quite literally every class has gotten their class weapon/item from Time, except us warriors. Last night marked our 10th Rallos kill and still, nada.<br />
<br />
Has this weapon been this rare for the rest of you? If so, why is our weapon so much harder to get than the rest. Nearly half our enchanter crew is outfitted in Serpents, most of our shamans are carrying around Time's Antithesis, the majority of rangers have their Timespinner, all our sk's have Cudgels, pallys have Hopebringers and Greatblades of Chaos, and the warriors have nothing.. <br />
<br />
Im curious how the droprate has faired serverwide.</div></div><hr />

2/4 for BP molds. 1 more on Quarm<br />
<br />
Arch Overseers has about 5 or 6 from their kills. Not sure, mabey Tanamar or Liz can answer if the poke thier nose in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 darkblades from 15 rz kills<br />
All paladins have hopebringer<br />
All shadowknights have cudgel<br />
4 serpents in 19 kills<br />
~0~ rog daggers from Inny in 12 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 darkblades in 16ish RZ kills.<br />
<br />
And darkblade have for us been the most rare of the class-specific weapons. We have 4-5+ of most of the other ones. Timespinners have rotted already and songblade/shinais/hopebringers will join the rot club soon as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have gotten I think 3 DBotW so far in god knows how many kills (15+). Just about every other class weapon is rotting or going to people with way negative points. We haven't gotten a single rogue dagger yet, not one. I think the other Time guild got 1 so at least our server is not being shut out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have actually gotten 3 rogue daggers from our 10 or so Inny kills, so I guess we are lucking out in that aspect. <br />
<br />
Im still hoping to see a Darkblade sometime this year atleast...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've been in time since June 1.  Also note that our first Shinai didnt drop till late october, our first darkblade till august, and first jagged timeforged blade till august.<br />
<br />
They seem pretty rare, but pretty consistent.  Only 6 at the most and 3 at the least in 30 ish ~ roughly clears.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how many ppl are actually using it though. i would rather get a vanzir(sp?) myself and put an anger3 on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to have use a vanazir with ykesha aug, I rarely use it after I got darkblade+anger3. <br />
<br />
In everyday LDON groups I use darkblade+EoE, the only time I un-bag my vanazir is when we do time and I am not MT'ing(to avoid getting agro).<br />
<br />
There is a huge agro difference between those 2 setups(of course the different augment types play in as well, but I dont think its only that). And the DPS is similar. So the only drawback is the increased amount of ripostes, but if you are worried about such issues you can always just swap in a shield once disc run out, you will have enough agro by then to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the agro difference can't be huge.  With agro procs in both weapons a warrior using DB cant keep agro off of me without a Time BP.  While I can't get agro off of a warrior with anger3 and vanazir who does have the time bp.<br />
<br />
My guess is that Vana is more agro while tanking, due to higher agro ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well maybe I should clarify:<br />
<br />
My previous setup Vanazir+Ykesha aug was what I would call solid steady agro. If I kept attacking and kept in range of mob I could keep agro fine. There were however things I could not do; most notably drag mobs around with me.<br />
<br />
With Anger3 augged Darkblade, once I get that first anger proc I know the mob is mine. I can drag it whereever I want it. <br />
<br />
This is a huge benefit. For instance in undead trial the difference is very noticable. Common scenario: 4 skeletons spawn and rush some guy. I run over to the skeletens and taunt+attack one. With vanazir+ykesha I could stand there and hit for 5 seconds and then try to back off to drag it out of the crowd only to have it turn around and beat on the nearest person instead.<br />
<br />
With darkblade in the same scenario, I run up there, taunt+attack. Then I just wait for the first anger/anger3 proc, once I get that I can now bring the skeleton with me whereever I want.<br />
<br />
This knowing you have agro after a proc is really nice when you are concerned about placement and like to keep mobs separate. <br />
<br />
Its possibly I could have achieved similar effect with Anger3(instead of ykesha) in vanazir, but I am not about to go back and re-aug it to find out :p<br />
<br />
Tbh I am a bit puzzled by your comment Brodda, wtf are you wielding/doing that pulls agro of a db? :)<br />
<br />
Maybe what you are experiencing is you getting agro until the first proc hits? That is to be expected and does happen a fair amount in normal gameplay, since procs after all are random. The main source of agro from DB is in the procs, whereas from vanazir it is more balanced and a good portion comes from its nice ratio.<br />
<br />
It could also be argued that a raex BP most likely will benefit a vanazir setup more, because majority of DB agro relies on direct +hate procs which according to the SKs are not amplified by Raex(ie, Terror of Thule is +510 hate, no matter if you have practiced spell casting subtelty or not).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would actually make a LOT of sense. I had plate BP and a BoWar combo for almost 2 months before a Darkbladed warrior got a BP. I had consistantly the highest agro on bosses except for the rare times the Darkblade chain proced right off the bat. I couldn't understand why, given the parsed proc rates indicating the DB should be top. Now other warriors have DB/EoE + BP, they have slightly higher long term agro, though we still have around the same average 'safety' level of agro</div></div><hr />

We have been in Time since around June-ish and we didn't get a DBotW until mid-November, it was the last class specific item to drop.  <br />
<br />
I also have a VDD and a DBotW.  Currently ykesha on the VDD and nothing on the DbotW (almost got anger3).  The DBotW I have really likely and I cannot wait until I get anger3.  I'll likely mess with shields then a lot more, and have been using my AoE already with some fairly good results.  I also can't wait for a Raex BP... the aggro will be great!  I have been using the DbotW/Shield lately a lot instead of the VDD and generally don't have any major problems, but i did have 1-2 wizards die last time I did that vs TT.</div></div><hr />

Bp hands down.  It makes a huge difference.  DB is just there for if you just HAVE to have dual wield.  It doesn't do much by itself.</div></div><hr />

The Ironic part is it was during the night when the server was so crashy and it was pretty much a live or if you die you go LD and wont make it back, thank god I survived!<br />

Our guild has gotten 4 out of maybe 20 or so clearings on Darkblade, and at least three times that bp's.</div></div><hr />
