<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that I am lvl 49, I was wondering about spell stacking. I found out last nite that Kazads stacks with Bot9 and that virtue stacks with Fo7. Is there a thread that gives a list of what spell stacks with what? I would like to view something along this line as I want to be getting more hp for my money..<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, in general, you can have the following buffs all at once:<br />
<br />
Hit point type one (Bot9 or Faith or Heroism or Resolution)<br />
Symbol (Kazad or Marzin or Naltron)<br />
AC buff (Shield of Words or Bulwark of Faith or Ward of Gallantry)<br />
---NOTE: the above 3 lines are covered by Temperance or Aegolism or Virtue<br />
Focus line (Focus of 7th or Focus of Spirit or Talisman of Kragg or Shield of Arcane or caster self-buffs)<br />
Hybrid buff (Divine Vigor or Divine Strength or Brell's Aegis or Brell's Mountainous Barrier or Brell's Stalwart Strength or or Spiritual Brawn or Spiritual Strength or Spiritual Vigor or Warder's Protection or Strength of Nature or Strength of Tunare)<br />
One attack buff (Primal Essence or Primal Avatar or Ferine Avatar)<br />
One haste buff (these will stack if they have additional effects, but only the best haste icon provides haste)<br />
Plus stat and resist buffs (generally no stacking issues with those)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want to get the most for your buffs~<br />
<br />
Virtue (could do po9/symbol for more hps, but symbol wears off faster than virt and po9)<br />
Fo7 (always want this)<br />
Brells (hp) / (can be repped by strength of tunare, but less hps)<br />
spirit of the predator (atk)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Equirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Enchanter's illusion attack line which gives you dex and a lftp proc will also not stack with Avatar line of spells. Mainly cause it gives a bit of atk as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phulavit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey all~<br />
<br />
    I started a thread about this at Allakhazam a ways back and really got some great  responses on how to maximize your hps....<br />
 <br />
  Here's a summary of how to get the best hps for your buck:  <br />
<br />
Primary HP/AC buffs:<br />
<br />
Group &quot;A&quot;<br />
<br />
1) Symbol of Kazad (Cleric) 910HP (costs a dot)<br />
2) Ward of Gallantry (Cleric) 54AC<br />
3) Protection of the Nine (Druid) 618HP/32AC<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Group &quot;B&quot;<br />
<br />
1) Virtue (Cleric) 1405HP/72AC (costs a dot)<br />
<br />
To which you add Shaman buffs:<br />
<br />
2/4) Focus (or Focus of the Seventh) (Shaman)<br />
3/5) Talisman of the Boar (Shaman)<br />
<br />
And then one of the following:<br />
<br />
4/6) Brells Stalwart Sheild (Paladin)<br />
5/7) Spiritual Vigor (Beastlord)<br />
6/8) Spirit of Tunare (Ranger) <br />
<br />
These buffs are all listed in &quot;stackable order&quot;, ie.  You can't mix Kazad with Virtue...<br />
<br />
Also you need to consider that any spell from the Cleric line of &quot;Symbols&quot; will only last an hour or so, while extended Virtue will more than double that.<br />
<br />
I hope that clarifies things a bit..<br />
<br />
Cheers, <br />
<br />
  Phul    :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LUMMP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One other possibility to mention here is to drop the Focus7 which gives 544hp 75str 70dex in favor of the war bp clicky Shield of the Arcane which yields 300hp 36ac and 30svm. This is a sacrifice of 244hp to gain 26ac which is something less than 7hp per ac and with GoD so much more focused on AC is a direction I prefer. It also has the benefit of adding 30svm which can be usefull in certain situations.<br />
<br />
You do sacrifice the str and dex from the Fo7 buff but untill new ceilings are in place on stats this hasn't been an issue for me as both are maxed at 305 without buffs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Felnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On a raid/to get the best hps/ac currently available to non-ubers go with Symbol of Kazad/Kazad's Mark, Protection/Blessing of the 9, Focus of Soul/of the 7th, Endurance/Talisman of Boar, Brell's Stalwart Shield, Ward of Gallantry, and Call of the Rathe.  Throw on yer max hps/ac tribute for even more, and then there's always the possibilty of some hps through someone's group leadership abilities as well.<br />
<br />
For grouping purposes I usually go with Virtue, Focus(or Infusion of Spirit/Talisman of Kragg if BL instead of shammy), stamina and best hybrid hp buff available.(pally &gt; BL &gt; ranger....for hps at least...reverse order for +attack)  Also just had to add to always grab Call of the Rathe if it's available-it's ~34ac that should stack with everything-at least to the best of my knowledge it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the info. Now that i'm starting to get higher i may have to try out this tribute thing.</div></div><hr />
