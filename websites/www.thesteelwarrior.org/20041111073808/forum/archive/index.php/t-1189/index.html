<br />
I _love_ them RP wise so it's what I played.  But since many consider Iksar king (cause of regen and spells using HP) for necro's, is there a king for us?<br />
<br />
I realize I don't have stun and I can get stunned but...I love us all the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Supposedly it is ogres for frontal stun immunity but they are, well, ogres~<br />
<br />
There is a 360 stun reducer AA and quite frankly the only time I am really hurting from getting stunned is when a mob is at my back and I am trying to move. ( As a human omg! )<br />
<br />
Also, kickstun pwns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Theres innate sta, which is pretty trivial at the level you have to really start pushing for every possible hp.  Besides that theres stun resistance, which helps, but is by no means nessicary to be successful.  Really warriors are probably the class that race matters the least for.  Numbers get boring, its really about what you wanna be, gnome warrior for me.~<br />
<br />
Don't all warriors get kickstun?<br />

I heard ogres had more hp? Dunno. I do know that they have much better starting sta/str than Vah Shir, but in the end game it all seems to come down to gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dwarves are a pretty good warrior race IMO.  They are a small race (huge advantage), have pretty good starting str and stamina, have the jumping roll thing and have females with beards.  What is not to love about dorfs.  If I wasn't a halfling warrior I would probably be a dorf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sneak is much more useful than Hide to me, if only for getting indifferent at merchants. But I did love Hide when I was soloing back at 46 and could Bind Wound in peace :)<br />
<br />
As for Dwarves I dont play one but I had a friend who was dwarf warrior and he was ranting about the fact that small races always get pushed off mobs during raids, and that sucked and blablabla  because he couldnt get near mob enuff and that mattered to be able to hit blablabla<br />
<br />
Also he was whining about the fact that when u get stunned you can loose aggro and OMG everyone dies :p   But as mentioned above you can get a AA for it.<br />

Ogre: frontal stun immunity<br />
But I still prefer dwarf over all.  Jump roll gets the women, though not like we need help since we do have our natural sexiness.<br />
<br />
Really, for warriors I think there is no best race.  We are the class most reliant on gear, and it is through gear that we gain the majority of our skills, we have few things that are innate to us that make us better which is why I think that no racial benefits change much since we all get the same gear in the end. (Though cultural changes that some, but only minorly, not enough to really matter)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Slam is by far the most underrated of all racial abilities.  Higher skill cap than kick, stuns mobs (with kick you have to wait till 55 for that), and you dont have to swap a shield in and out to do it.  That may be changing as insanely high damage mobs force MT's to use a shield, but for now racial slam is a huge bonus.  I like barbarians because they have many of the advantages of being a large race, and many of the advantages of being a medium race.  In other words, higher base str and sta than smaller races, racial slam, can wear large race only equipment, and can still fit pretty well in  most dungeons and wear medium sized gear.  Besides,  it's fun to roleplay a great hulking savage....Barbarians love fighting, red meat, drinking, and wenching.  Which is why we get along so well with dwarves. :)<br />

Also ugly, and they smell of feet. To this day I entertain thoughts of starting over as a gnome.<br />
<br />
 From a strictly empirical standpoint ogres are the &quot;best. They have the only innate advantage that really means a lot. Iksar would be next due to AC advantage I suppose. Both are ass-ugly though.<br />

 A team of scientists and doctors did a 4 year study with a grant from the government and has proven without a doubt that this list is accurate. Any attemps to disparage or disagree with it are evidence of psychosis and possible beastiality fanatacism.<br />
<br />
Edit: The scientists and doctors have moved Frogloks from 11th place to last because of Tungg's gigantic fucking sig. They feel it is sufficient evidence that all frogloks are inconsiderate and kill babies for sport.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well, I'm partial to my barbarian self. Ogres seem to be the &quot;trend&quot; and I can see the benefits. I don't see where people say that being a small race is an advantage though...<br />
<br />
In Alphabetical Order to not offend the runts<br />
<br />
Barbarians - Large/medium race (which is nice for being able to see over the hordes that don't know how to listen so you can target properly),  and have Slam (higher skill kick and Stun ability from level 1). Decent innate Sta level.<br />
Dark Elves - Small Race. Ultravision, I assume hide, don't know what else.<br />
Dwarfs - Small Race. Infravision and the silliest looking Luclin models (old dorf models were the real deal, now they look like long bearded, hairy gnomes). Decent Sta.<br />
Gnomes - Small race. infravision and tinkering!!!<br />
Halflings- Small race. infravision, hide, sneak and exp bonus<br />
Halfelves - Medium race. the Banana/Dildo Hats and infravision<br />
Humans - Medium race. the middle of all.<br />
Iksar - Medium race. higher innate AC, racial regen, infravision.<br />
Ogres - Large race. frontal stun immunity to melee, slam, infravision, highest innate stamina<br />
Trolls - Large race. slam, infravision, racial regen, high base stamina<br />
Vah shir - Large race. cool looks and infravision (not sure what else).<br />
*Frogs* - who cares<br />
<br />
Personally as base advantages Ughres, Trools and Iksar have some nice perks. Tinkering is an awesome ability if you have the patience and coin to work it up.  Barbs were a good choice in the days faction mattered (pre-Luclin).<br />
<br />
In the end Conan &gt; Gimli (he lets a freaking ranja throw him!!! Come on!!!) ... nuff said!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">There are 3 good races to play warrior on the long run :<br />
<br />
1) Wood/Half elf/Human : Good Agi/Charisma (Best of the best)<br />
2) Iksar : Extra AC , Balanced Stats<br />
3) Ogre : Great Anti stun, PATHETIC charisma (most important char on the long run)<br />
<br />
People will tell you all races are the same on the long run.<br />
While it is true to some extent.<br />
Some races are better than others (marginally).<br />
<br />
Elf/Human come out on top because of agi/charisma<br />
<br />
Ask any Elemental + warrior where would they put 25 points now.<br />
They will either say charisma or agility.<br />
<br />
Getting 305agi without buffs. <br />
<br />
And maxing charisma (SPECIALLY CHARISMA) is priceless.<br />

Is much much much more valuable than you can think.</div></div><hr />

1.  Intelligence.  Gimli knew he couldn't make the leap himself, he had the pasny ranger toss him so he could make it, and continue to kick much ass.  What would Conan have done?  tried himself and slipped and fallen his big ass off!<br />
<br />
2.  The ladies.  Galadriel had the hots for Gimli, and Gimli was charming enough to get three strands of here hair!  Love to see Conan try that w/o getting filled with arrows!<br />
<br />
3.  Style.  The bikini briefs of the late 70's just don't mess well with the trends, though who knows, they might make a comeback.<br />
<br />
4.  Weapons.  Whoever stole which idea, any dwarf can own a  Gimli's Ax/Windblade.  How many of Conan's swords are running around?<br />

Actually the reason I picked an ogre was the fact it is soo very easy to max stam and str on an ogre. Yeah it can be rough to raise agi and dex, but by the time you need to seriously worrying about high dex for procs and uber high ac you are usually getting gear which will naturally round everything out. Oh yeah and not being stunned from the front is very nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ogres have a physical advantage (phys stats and frontal stun) plus like other large races get bash.<br />
<br />
True enough stats do not matter after about low 50s if you have solid gear but ogres substitute for hp/ac/resist gear 20-50 stat pts sooner than other races.  <br />
<br />
If you play a war to the end game you are most likely sooner or later gonna do quest involving tradeskillz and that is where it sucks being an ogre. Smithing skill ups go by str but all the rest you need int/wis and the best my war has got so far is 130ish and that is with burrowing some int gear from high level chanter I could wear.<br />
<br />
With the way more and more tradeskills appears in quest this may be more and more of an disadvantage.<br />
<br />
Here is how I would list the races by my standards, which are pretty nutty like you will see.<br />
<br />
Ogre - best pure warrior class hands down imo, relies on other classes for non-tank stuff more than any other race, does not matter to me tho I have 10 toons<br />
Dwarf - 2nd best, if I did not have other toons in tradeskills I may have picked 1st to do tradeskills as well<br />
Halfling/human - cause they are easiest to level<br />
Troll/Barb - I like the bash and the troll regen, plus these guys have good starting stats<br />
Dark elf/High Elf - they look good in armor<br />
All else - I do not care past here</div></div><hr />

well, as stated before, it kinda doesn't matter, esp. at lvl 60+. <br />
I like barbarian for the RP, generally disliked but not KOS, SLAM, nice stats, tall but can shrink smaller than troll/ogres,... <br />
point is i dont regret making the cliched barb war. i DO regret that i knew so little when i started that i didnt put my starting points 20-sta (max it will allow) and 5 dex. putting bonus pionts into STR is a waste for any and all races, as Str is on almost every peice of warrior gear. Put all you can into sta, then if any are left whicheve is lower between agi and dex.</div></div><hr />

Nice option pre 55 with a higher cap. It works up the Bash skill which means if shields come into vogue the skill is already maxed without having to ghetto bash for skill points.</div></div><hr />

I made my gnome when all thought I was nuts (mar of '00).  This is my third toon created and here I am.  I made a female gnome to prove that race doesn't matter and to have the smallest can-o-whoopass (even smaller than asslings) anyone had seen on my server.  Nice to see I'm not alone as I once was.</div></div><hr />

Who needs more than that?<br />
<br />
Although some disadvantages early on in game with huiman warrior as far as ac/str/sta, I am now on par or better stat wise as other warriors.  <br />
<br />
Besides you all know you would drool all over me if you met me :P</div></div><hr />

Start a large race.  You're cutting into my uniqueness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>zarrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The way i look at things it really dont matter what race or char you choose to play they all have there ups and downs.Its a matter of you being happy with the person you created.  And bottom line is the gear that rounds out any char and you use your aa to fill in the weak spots or to captialize on your tanks skills.:)</div></div><hr />

Though ut really doesn't matter in the end. Play what you like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
/repeat everything that has been said so far.  Race doesn't matter etc etc.  I've seen ogre warriors suck beyond all belief and also know wood elves that are really top class.  I'd take a &quot;weak&quot; race warrior that knows what he's doing over an ogre twink.<br />
<br />
As for me, I'm quite proud of being one of the few (that I know of anyhow) Vah Shir warriors on my server.  Plate + fur + tail &gt; all</div></div><hr />

<br />
Small races&gt;all (And by small races I mean dwarves, gnomes and halflings) because of their ability to 'pin' mobs in corners.<br />
<br />
While not all big encounters will be able to utilize a pin most that CAN should.  Large races will need 1 or 2 shrinks in order to pin a mob into a corner and tank it so that it's back is facing out to the rest of the melee.<br />
<br />
Even as a human I cannot 'pin' a mob in this fashion without a shrink or some HQ gnome illusion.  And if you don't see why pinning a mob in this way is important, think about all the riposte damage negated, or the death's avoided from enrage when those monks/rogues/pansy hybrids/whatever turned on autoattack and went afk to watch Friends.</div></div><hr />
