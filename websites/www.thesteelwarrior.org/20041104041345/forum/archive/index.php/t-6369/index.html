GSoT is worse aggro than the Droga weapons, and ripostes aren't a big deal until you probably have better weapons (high PoP mobs).  But GSoT sells for 100p, and the Droga weapons can run you 30k for a set.<br />

Editor: Anger II &lt; Yak (100dd/stun) &lt; Anger III.  Cheap Yak augment functionally as good for hate as expensive Yak augment.  Yak augments lore, unlike Anger augments, so you can only get same-cost-better-aggro-than-Anger-II once, then you have to start buying Anger augs.<br />

BabaHanz says he prefers CHSD/SotB over CHoS/GBoS on raids, because of the decreased knockback.  Editor: if you're MTing, everyone's behind the mob, on the opposite side from you, and your push seems like it wouldn't matter.  If you're not MTing, you should be using a GSot4W instead of any dual-wield combo.  Why would you worry about aggro weapon push on a raid?<br />

dethvegi1 says to mainhand the BF even if you have an aug'ed GBoS, because it has nearly the same proc rate even without an aug.  Editorial opinion: with increased proc rate, BF does 2170 hate per minute.  GBoS aug'ed with Anger III does 1200+958 or 2158 (assuming stun is 300 hate).  Roughly the same hate.  However, the GBoS does it in four procs (average) per minute, while the BF does it in three.  And the GBoS has a slightly better ratio than the BF.  Thus the GBoS will have slightly more reliable early aggro, and probably roughly equal long-term aggro, making an aug'ed GBoS probably slightly better to mainhand than a BF.<br />

I have a question about the modal and max damage formulae:<br />
Should the multiplication be done before or after the addition.  It looks as if it's supposed to be multiplication-&gt;addition-&gt;division if I remember my order of operations correctly, just wanted to make sure of it.</div></div><hr />

That alone is why I enjoy the summaries. You get such succinct, and wonderfully entertaining quips such as that. So Haas. So true. So fun to read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the modal and max damage summaries, first multiply, then add, then divide.  That is, &quot;damage * 2 + bonus / delay&quot; really means &quot;((damage * 2) + bonus)/delay)&quot;, not &quot;(damage * 2) + (bonus/delay)&quot;.<br />
<br />
Glad you like the summaries.  :-)</div></div><hr />
