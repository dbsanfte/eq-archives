<br />
Zones seem to vary, quite alot.  The deeper you move into some zones, they hit harder, which is natural.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I have been able to manage d/w with some difficulty.  My 2hs agro just sucks, no SEWS or BOW yet.<br />
<br />
I am not interested in how i can get a decent 2hs easy, I will <br />
get one soon enough.  What I want to know, anyone out there use duel wield in GoD, and their experiences please.<br />
<br />
Any takers?</div></div><hr />

I'm just trying to get a feel for others that choose d/w over 2hs in god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have bloodfrenzy with anger3, boc with anger3, and stormrider carapace.  On mobs that seem to riposte a lot, I've been using carapace a lot in the offhand, and I haven't had any trouble holding aggro.  ALso, the extra hp and AC and resists are nice.  Offhand proc rate is 1 per minute at 305 dex, 2 per minute with anger3, and the bash from carapace seems to make up for this quite nicely.</div></div><hr />

I really don't have any trouble dual wielding on the usual 'fearsome' mobs to 2h on.. Fennin, Xegony, time gods.... <br />
<br />
No problems in GoD either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least in some of the intitial GoD zones (specifically Qinimi, Burindu and Ferubi) dual wield has been my preference.  The mobs die pretty fast, so i haven't seen or felt the effects of rispostes much. The better agro from dual wielding seems to outweigh any benefit i might get if i were to use my 2hander.<br />
<br />
This may be a different story in some of the more difficult parts of GoD, but i'll find that out once i get there, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leelron</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your grped with the same peeps all the time ask your healer if mana is ok when duel wielding and healing ya :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As you progress through GoD I think you will find dual wield offers great benefits.  With Weapons Affinity 5 and hategiver, BoC both augd with anger3 its a rare case that I dont proc in the first 8 seconds of a fight.  <br />
<br />
With the mobs in the sewers, vxed, tipt all hitting for 1100+ and fast I need at least a cleric chain casting CH.  Theres no time to &quot;wait till warrior gets aggro&quot;, its game on the second the mob shows up.  Dual wield offers less lag time between procs, and higher statistical chances of an even distribution of procs.  <br />
<br />
In my case with CH landing 8-10 seconds into each mob arriving in camp the rare case where I didnt proc EB is offset by the frequency I can AE Taunt (every 10 min) and save the cleric.<br />
<br />
The downside, obviously, is eating a ton of riposte damage.  You need to be quick and if you eat a 5 x 1250 round and CH is gonna be late just run big circles around the cleric.  With dual wield and weapons affinity you have enough aggro to be able to run around and not have it pong.<br />
<br />
Dual wield is also better when mobs come screaming into camp at mach 10.  Missing that opening flurry with a 2 hander if mob isnt in range can be the difference of a dead cleric / blown trial and a win.<br />
<br />
Thats my $.02.  I love my DW setup, and my clerics love it too.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, if something can kill you by riposte, you really shouldn't be fighting it in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dunno phantron, named in tipt eat through most ppl, they got huge proximity agro, healers just need to watch their distance.  some of those mobs who just chain cast dark claws are ruthless, personally i try to have DI up at all times. if you dont have a secondary healer, might well get all the advantage you can and use a good 2h. i just dont see how you can causually shrug off 1200 riposte dmg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont agree, there are a few 2K5+ hitters in EQ that can with a bad round &amp; a riposte kill a tank.<br />
<br />
As long as the mob doesnt hit for more than 20% of your HP i do not think ripost matter that much.<br />
<br />
That beeing said, i prefer 2H because of the better DPS. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now there are some 4-7k hitters in GoD, but thats stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warcry</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has killed the smith, and Iv completed Tp'd, and Vxed<br />
trials in 1 day.<br />
<br />
I'm finding out that instant agro is very attractive in god.<br />
<br />
I also have WA5 and quad eb setup so to speak.<br />
Clerics need Bulwark of Vie, and have it on you at all times.<br />
That spell is a lifesaver.  Also When the heal is looking close I'll <br />
just back up untill the heal goes off, by that point no one can take agro away from me anyways.<br />
<br />
Casters chain nuke in god, harder than I have ever seen anywhere else, and they have to.<br />
<br />
These mobs hit hard, but have lower hps than most elemental trash mobs.  Most are faster than SOE, it's a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
We always have 2 clerics in group, you need 2 rezers minimum<br />
in case it hits the fan IMHO.  Hell many times our clerics pull for us.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another little simple trick, i take attack off when the heals looking close, again in the first 5-10 sec's of the battle I have enough hate to not attack the mob at all and keep agro though the rest of the battle if needed.<br />
<br />
Crank up the ac and enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point about Bulwark of Vie Warcry.  Its no longer optional, its well worth the med time necessary to cast it every fight.<br />
<br />
Chaos claws are lame, but IIRC a mob cannot proc on a riposte, so mob procs arent an issue in this discussion.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider with casters chain nuking is that in Tipt and Kod'Taz the nasty mobs can easily 1-round or at least frenzy range any class without plate mail.  Warrior's DPS matters not a bit if the mob pongs and wastes the wizard / druid / mage in 1 round.  Aggro is still top priority IMO.</div></div><hr />
