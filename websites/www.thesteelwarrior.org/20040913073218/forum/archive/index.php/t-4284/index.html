<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would love some thoughts on this..<br />
<br />
I 65 warr up to 236 AA more than any warrior in my guild. play time are 6 to 8 hrs weekdays. 40 plus hrs of playing friday to sunday. I show up to almost every single raid, And most recently i lost my lil bro of 20 years old. My addiction to this game and my willingness to help my guild hendered me from seeing him alot but i made it to where i can see him and raid with my guild to show my willingness to progress and help others. Imo this was not noticed by our officers...=( <br />
<br />
1st problem i am 3rd in line on tanking most of the time due to my gear its not bad gear but the other 2 warriors are more geared up than me. When my guild 1st broke in to Fire us other warriors were told bye an officer that our 1st would be geared up so we can do encounters i thought sure np, But once this happened he quit logging in and being hard core. Then our 2nd Mt got geared up to a T and now he does the thing. Most of the time they will show up do a couple of hits and just logged off leaving me and the other warriors to do the tanking which i dont mind. But the next day we raid a phat element loot drops and if they need it the loot goes to them, I feel this is very unfair and have talked to our officers about this but nothing has really been done to stop this, In alot of ways i feel that i am being taken advantage of and i want it to stop its causing me lots of anger and i dont like to be that way. We are on a god loot system and have been told in the past that raid attendence does count but so far it has not. I dont want to leave my guild but i am soo tired of going threw this.. i have talked with other guilds on my server and most would open there arms.  But my love for my guild and peps keep telling hang in there it will get better its been about a month now and nothing has been done =( .....I would really like someone else veiw on what i should do  and think about..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is one person you keep forgetting to put ahead of all the stuff bro...<br />
<br />
YOU<br />
<br />
You deserve your due. If they don't want to include you in the progression of the guild than you need to part ways with them fucktards.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: this is only going by your side of the story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I swear i am tell the truth, about this the way we do loots is we send a tell to an officer of Low Medium and High they Vote and the most Votes gets the loot. I am chatted with our guild leader about things example not pulling my weight bye not being MA enough due me wanting to learn and such. I went the easy way of hinting to him HEY please notice what i am doing i just took a different appoarch so i would not seem like a dramma queen..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sounds like its the award system, where officers decide who gets whats (great guild for suck ups ill tell ya that much, guess you gota give the officers a rimjob before they will give ya loot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koralak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally...I find merit loot system to be one of the worst loot systems period. For large guilds, it doesn't work fairly, there will always be some sort of favoritism, some sort of human error, you name it, it is one of the most flawed (random probablly being the worst). Having been in a 100+ member Elemental guild, that was strictly on merit system, you could see it pretty clearly. In fact, the guild fell apart due to burn out and constant complaining from guild members, most of the arguments had to do with loot decisions...large discrepencies of people getting choice loots, certain classes even getting very little loot compared to others, the list goes on. I am 99% sure if we were a DKP guild, we would have progressed to Time...instead they fell apart. I realize this doesn't help you, but all that you have said, I would think to leave the guild as it seems they treat members unfairly under their current loot system. Find a DKP guild, things will go smoother imo, sure you still get loot whores, but at least they gathered the points to get said item, you can't really argue with that, just with their ethics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Based on the contents of your post, I'd hazard a guess that they you're not popular with the merit officers and they're hoping you'll get the hint and leave.<br />
<br />
That may be a bit cynical.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I'd say go find a guild with a points system.  You'll probably be a lot happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fuck em and join a DKP guild. If you have 200+ aa and log in 40 hours a week not counting weekends, any guild will take ya (of course, if you play this much, you might have bigger problems than EQ loot, lol). Either way, the only reason these people are screwing ya over is because you're letting them. Not the guild, these people, loot officers to be specific - in fact, I'll bet my last dollar THEY get loot, even if they're something like a druid or necro, not exactly essential for guild success.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't make a big drama out of it, just let an officer or the GL know that if you made every single raid and logged in as consistently as you do in any DKP guild, you'd be geared up to your gills by now. Let them know that you, like others, play EQ for 3 things: friends, killing big mobs, and loot, and that you can only get friends and big mobs with them, but you can get all 3 with another guild and a friends list - what would they do in your place?<br />
<br />
And if they don't do anything, leave. You can kill the same mobs for DROPS with another guild and keep in touch with your friends from the old one with a friends list. Best of both worlds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Like everyone has already chimed in SCREW THEM . . . .<br />
<br />
If they don;t want to give you any loot then they obviously don;t need you to tank.  There are many many many gulds out there, a lot better than that.  Also go to a DKP guild you'll be 100% happier!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Leave the guild and move on to a GUILD that knows what it is doing rather than dealing with the asshats who play favoritism and screwing over the people who actually work hard.  Let me guess all the Loot officers are female woodelf druid who get hot cyberz for l33t.  Only one thing worse than druids are Druids with power</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm a take a softer tact, but give the same advice.<br />
<br />
I won't say screw your current guild, or anything like that. They're your guild, your friends, people you've played with for a long period of time.<br />
<br />
But if things are frustrating you, and making the game less fun for you, then a change of scenery is in order.<br />
<br />
Play time seems to be one of your strengths. You have lots of it.<br />
<br />
So moving to a guild that rewards attendance (i.e. a points system) will help you in the long run.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the turnover rate and burnout rate in EQ is pretty high right now, so moving to a different guild should be relatively hassle free. Just don't cop an attitude with your current guild if you don't want to. If you do want to, then hey, go medieval on em and have a blast doing that too.<br />
<br />
Either way, do what's best for you. The game's supposed to be fun, after all.</div></div><hr />
