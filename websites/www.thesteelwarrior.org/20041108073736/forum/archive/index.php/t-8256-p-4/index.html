If you honestly believe PoP didnt see a huge mudflation of new droppable, formerly raid quality (often times better) gear, then you need your head checked.  I'll admit that GoD doesnt see too many more droppable stuffs flooding the market, but i cant complain as it is a veritable treasure trove of single groupable nodrop loot.<br />
<br />
There is a limit of just how much you can buy ... but a person got all the little goodies possible out of the bazaar, they'd be sitting fairly well off.  I estimate that to get &quot;everything&quot; out of the bazaar would require somewhere along the order of 3-5 million plat.<br />
<br />
PoP did do decent with droppable stuff, but PoP is old news. <br />
<br />
As for the bazaar. I did get the &quot;everything&quot; you speak of. I spent millions of hard earned plat trying to get the best item possible in every slot. I can't do that anymore because there is a better personally obtainable no-drop item. This is obviously a grey area based on how people feel about obtaining gear through plat, but it is indeed an aspect of the game that has been getting phased out more and more with each expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">note the key words Millions of plat....<br />
<br />
frankly I've seen a grand total of about 700k through my fingers through out my game playing years...  of course I didn't touch shit in the bazaar normally cept for helmet of RZ<br />
<br />
millions of plat though is NOT what's considered possible for people, unless they have alot of time, alot of luck, or in a guild or some RL cash....<br />
<br />
using the argument of millions of plat for ANYTHING in EQ currently and then talking about nonraiders in the same breath is idiocy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm glad it's getting phased out.The pp game imo should be for trade skillers and you should kill mobs to get gear.Plat farmers and pa people contribute to the worst kind of attitudes in game.<br />
<br />
We have a couple warriors raiding with us who would still love a BOC hehe.You can take your friends and hit luclin and pop mobs eventually for better.Some more god aggro weapons would be great,but, if they are better than current weapons they should be harder to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spend large amounts of time in earth, water, fire and occasionally air farming pieces for bows, jewelry, and armor.  My friend is a master smith and fletcher, so though the influx of armor is slow and costly, bazaar upgrades still exist.<br />
Apo they may exist but I will backup Glat in that they are incredible rare. Interesting how you point out you are flagged and have a friend. Thats the whole point, we are talking people who are not flagged. I am flagged and have 3 guys full GMed out (technical GMs in most cases not actual and no tinkers) so I am in a position to have some knowledge about this.<br />
<br />
Having just spent 200K on parts for 2 pieces (5-6) of Grimel for my chanter (cause I am too lazy to hunt there while I am finishing my LDoN stone) I can verify that on my server the parts are exceedingly rare and incredibly expensive. For those of us who dont have anything to spend money on other than food (or stupid lazy things like the above) that is no big deal. For many its a far bigger deal, especially when you cant farm many of the best droppable loot places because you are not equipped.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
Obsidianwood sap - 1 available in over 3 months of checking, price 35K<br />
Featherwood bow staff - 2 available in last 3 months (both available from same person in last week only), price 75K<br />
<br />
Thats alot of work for an average solo player to get some of those mythical EP parts, unless he/she is EP flagged which means they still need a grp. But that is the whole point, the have nots cant really do anything about this without benefitting the haves.<br />
<br />
I wont speculate beyond the 3 servers I have had characters on in the last 6 months but it would not surpise me if this is true on all servers.<br />

The complaint was made that droppable loot doesnt exist for non-raiders as it did in luclin/velious, which just plain isnt true.  It doesnt matter how rare it is ... the upgrades do exist  :rolleyes: , and i daresay they are 100% easier to get 99% of the time these days then they ever were in luclin or velious.

which one is the smith going to make? which has the better ROI?<br />

the formula is out of wack and its true for all the other EP armor<br />

In my experience (once again limited to my servers) you are far more likely to see a warrior running around with a BoC then any EP crafted armor. BoCs are often hand me downs. BoCs are ALWAYS available in the bazaar (200K). Any guild worth a damn can take down AoW with enough people (often the limiting factor but if you cant do AoW most of the rest of the content is likely off limits as well) and good tactics. And a HoRZ goes for less than most of the EP pieces on my 3 servers by the way, its a rarity thing more than a cost thing. That leaves bracers which I never see available, EVER. Its too good an item on a relative basis to do anything other than sell to a friend. Its far easier to get, however, than EP armor if only because of the flagging (whole point of this thread). But most guilds who can do it would be working VT most likely which means its up more often than not (wonder why no one farms it now that I mention it).<br />
<br />
Whereas the BP (example given) is only one once every 3-6 months, for 250-300K and clears within days of coming up. And in the end the EP crafted is not really that much better than anything else available (ornate BP for 175-200K or Tak for 1492 AP). Personally I didnt buy or make EP armor for my pally cause its easier to do Tak and unlike others I could make it if I wanted to.<br />
<br />
EP bows (other than Featherwood because of its part in Grimel I suspect) are plentiful that is for sure and a good example of how the crafting piece can be viable for non-PoP flagged guys, but the stuff that drops most of the parts is doable by a small number of people and easy to get to.<br />

so same arguement differnt item.<br />

ohh and raid quality +100 hp gear is velious raid lvl loot it should be in the bazaar by now.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe anyone uses the BoC or Horn of Hsagra to support their argument that non-raiders need more DPS today, while they discount farwater armor as being a viable armor upgrade due to its rarity/cost.  <br />

Stay consistent, please.  Either ultrarare/ultraexpensive items are part of the balance equation, or they're not. :)<br />

A non-raiding group in Velious COULD have purchased 6 Zlandicar talismans to get ST keys, and then farmed trash mobs in ST for the rare priceless weapon.  Shall we use priceless weapons as the yardstick for non-raiders in Velious era?</div></div><hr />

I tend to think of them as not being a major part of the balance equation simply because the percentage of people who actually have access to them is exceedingly low.</div></div><hr />

Just for clarity. I was the one who was using rare loot (HoH, BoC) as obtainable, and I never said anything about EP craftablearmor might as well not exist. I haven't scrolled up to see who said it shouldn't exist, but it sure wasn't me!<br />
<br />
Edit - In fact, I agreed that PoP was decent for droppable loot.</div></div><hr />

I agree with your post but the zland talisman was not made droppable until well after luclin ... i think it was PoP but dont quote me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Alandi talis was always tradable I think.<br />
What happened during luclin  ( I guess it was about the time of the ST revamp ) it's they added the &quot;key&quot; on KT / statue as a 100% drop and vindi as a rare drop ( supposely velk drop it too but I have never seen it yet ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Torrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bazaar loot differs from server to server.  There are a number of loots I have a habit of checking for, even though my desire to buy them has been long gone.  Just a boredom thing I do at the end of the night before logging out in Bazaar.<br />
<br />
For example, I see one or two Rallos helms every other time I've looked.  I used to see the Mithril daggers constantly as well, but haven't seen a single one since the revamp of the ring event.  See Zlandicar Tali's constantly, anywhere from one to four of them everytime.  See countless Stonewood/Featherwood compound bows, there are always a number of these up..  A piar of Boots of the Storm off and on.  One or two Blades of Carnage maybe once a week.<br />
<br />
Never, not once, have I ever seen a single piece of Farwater for sale.  Not once... ever.<br />

Different servers vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's rare, but I've seen farwater pieces in the bazaar on my server, for a hefty fee.  I tend to think of farwater as the type of situation where you'd submit an &quot;order&quot; to an EP-enabled smith, rather than buy already-finished pieces.<br />
<br />
I farmed/bought enough pieces for one attempt at farwater arms soon after reaching EPs.  It took me about 3 weeks and about 20k (I bought half of the parts).  The 250+trophy smith failed the final combine.  I figured the failed attempt was well worth the 20k I paid.  I paid 40k for ornate arms, after all.<br />
<br />
I would guess that by watching the bazaar regularly, a non-EP-flagged person could buy up enough parts for one farwater attempt in about 2 weeks, at a cost of 70-80k; success rate would be about 50% for a maxed smith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">aye some would also claim that in 2 weeks or longer depending on adv time you could spend your adv points on sand arms, and get around the same basic piece of armor. and then add 40 hp and a effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt, the success rate is hella streaky in tradeskills.<br />
Go me on 1 EP tailoring made combine out of 12 attemps with max skill, while for bow s it's the contrary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Streakiness is an evil thing.

My experience is 30-40% so that would fit, but the parts are not buyable on my current low-pop server plus as stated by others as well as myself, not enough of an upgrade to Tak to justify IMHO.<br />
