<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I looked for it in the Ubermob tanking thread in the library, but it didnt include many of the higher end bosses in PoP.  I also tried a general search, and it didnt want to search for DI or DB.  <br />
<br />
We(my guild) are working on getting this event done, and are having various issues with RZ and RZtW.  <br />
<br />
So does anyone know the DB and DI of each Rallos?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have exact numbers, but it's about the same as Bertox's DB/DI.  The difficulty of the encounter is not really his DPS at all, it's the other aspects.  In fact, my guild has always had more trouble keeping tanks alive on fake VZ than on RZ/RZTW.  Somehow fake VZ's DPS just always catches us by surprise.  I think he has a faster delay than most mobs, or something, or maybe we just suck. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">RZ Event's difficulty generally comes from the other issues of the event, mainly adds during fight.  RZ doesn't have jaw dropping damage output, and by this time your guild should have the experience in a one tank cycle to survive RZ, just need to get the adds controlled which hurts the raid when they get loose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">RZtWL's melee is truely pathetic.  To win the fight, you'll need a good team of kiters with a good video card...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had to scour through my logs to find these mobs.  Since I'm an officer, I have to log everything.  Anything and everything I've tanked has been logged, so it's available for parsings.  Oddly enough though, I've tanked Rallos Zek countless times.  I've tanked Rallos Zek the Warlord maybe twice.  This was the only one I found of him, but I think there are more.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek - 666.54dps // 82,654td // 19dly // 277min // 1032max<br />

I believe that Rztw fight was when you couldn't corner anything.  We beat him anyways.  :)</div></div><hr />

Bertoxx has insane DPS output for what tanks are tanking him.  I remember tanking him as a 9.8/1600 and he'd eat me in like 2 1/2 rounds worth of dps</div></div><hr />

Lol the last time clear i parsed terris thule and saryrn at just over 600 dps.  His melee isnt all that weak now is it..at least compared to the 2 gimp time gods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, remember, that's a rampage parse.  I'm pretty sure Bertox's dps on the MT can be anywhere from ~950ish (VT) to ~1100ish (Ornate), or somewhere around that level.  It's a shitstorm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eriatha, I assume those come from before the minus-1-DI patch, and that they are defensive on RZ/RZTW, and non-defensive on Bertox? That gives me:<br />
 <br />
RZTW: DB=193 DI~84<br />
Bertox: DB=413 DI~74<br />
 <br />
I bet Mith Marr and Sol Ro look almost the same.</div></div><hr />

Wow<br />
<br />
286 DPS RT'ing Sol Ro?<br />
<br />
That seems way higher than I remember, he is fully slowable.<br />
<br />
Hmm, sure of this parse Eriatha?</div></div><hr />

I only consider evasive a useful disc on mobs that proc DDs, like Mith Marr, otherwise better mitigation is better</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you aware of how many clerics were in your rotation?  MM's dps is no joke to an up and coming warrior pimped out with bazaar gear, let alone even with some VT gear on him.  In fact, that parse of him was with me having a good mix of Raex/VT gear on me (killed him for backflags).  <br />
<br />
The proc is fully resistable with 500mr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah hehe.On most mobs your healing has everything to do with feeling like the encounter is a joke.I've berserked and fired di on him at well over 10k np.I've turned around and tanked Blazz on a good day and never gone below 50 pct and tanked Reparm with no di checks or tense moments well past defensive.Luck and your healing have more to do with that then you buffed hp.<br />
<br />
I would use defensive on RZTW keep it smooth and predictable as possible.<br />
Ps.Yeh his debuff sucks use a full time rgc guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I indeed had a bard in group for Max resists, which is prety much a must if tanking a Procing mob. Had 6 clerics in rotation which is also prety common for a PoP god encounter. Raid force was in high 40s if you want to know that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It seems like POP doesn't use round number DI/DB like previous expansion, that or else there's something else going on.  I get the following from Eriatha's logs:<br />
<br />
RZTW: DB=193 DI~84<br />
Bertox: DB=413 DI~74<br />
LMM: DB=307 DI~85<br />
SolRo: DB~535 DI~66<br />
<br />
Just based on melee, RZTW is the easiest of the four, and SolRo's the hardest.  You can never resist all of LMM's procs (you can only reach +350 on the resist check), making him the most unpredictable.  Just from eyeballing the fights, I'd have to say that Bertox probably has the highest ATK rating of the four.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting that they bash for significantly less than DB+DI as I thought they did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kitas, read this thread if you dont understand how evasive can be a better tanking disc based on DI/DB: Ubermob Tanking (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=13)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So? Evasive v Defensive on RZtW? Hehe.<br />
<br />
Stonewall, you want all the DPS you can get.  His DPS isn't hard, 5 clerics grouped with a bard can run a 2 sec rotation on you all day, disc up or no.  The issue is killing him before the adds get you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">defensive on rztw while dual wielding (more dps) has netted me a crappy 760dps to me... all my parses are at home, though :(<br />
<br />
concerning LMM - a 10min parse (we pulled a bunch of adds and took them all first then LMM) I used evasive then when dsic refreshed defensive, I found defensive to be a wiser choice due to the streakiness of his melee as well as procs, since a flurry is going to hurt you more then those sissy easily resistable procs. (he is, after all, a wimpy paladin :p flash of light so leet)<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of evasive simply because it seems to be a better adaptive disc ...<br />
<br />
Oh, and on bertox, he did 1200dps to me, 1750ac, would've been 10khp. Defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So? Evasive v Defensive on RZtW? Hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats basically what i was lookin for, but i wanted to analyze the numbers myself :)  Looking at these numbers, for RZtWL i will prob use stonewall, since he doesnt have that -400AC proc.  I am still unsure as to whether I should use evasive or stonewall on RZ, due to that aforementioned proc.  I will be having my druid GRC me to get rid of it, but the cast time is a bit long.  <br />
<br />
As for our progress, It took us a couple of attempts to get TZ taken care of, and our pallies are great at tanking him, and keeping his aggro.  Before he would go after our casters, but that has been averted.    We are a good split tanking guild(what is this mez thing? kiddin!), so VZ is cake.  The adds during RZ is our current hang up.  We have tried a couple ways of pulling the guards, but havent had too many attempts on him yet, and only one attempt at RZtWL just to scout out where exactly the adds where coming from during the pit encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">RZtW had the -400 ac debuff last time I fought him. MT went down and I was lucky enough to be 2nd on the agro list and got owned pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">RZtW had the -400 ac debuff last time I fought him. MT went down and I was lucky enough to be 2nd on the agro list and got owned pretty quick.<br />
<br />
ahh, i only survived againt rztwl for about 30 secs, dont remember the ac debuff hitting.   I didnt expect to last long though, we didnt have the numbers due to alot of deaths on RZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well you lasted longer than me, I only lasted as long as furious because I hit it after I got low health agro and every add swarmed me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The key to RZ is to have a tight chain on the MT ... he only hits for 1k, so any 8k+ warrior will do fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with RZ is (as the previous poster noted) that low health aggro can be a bitch and drag all the adds in the arena on top of your raid force.  If you keep the chain up and running hard, though, then your kiters are free to keep shit on the other side of the arena where it needs to be.<br />
<br />
If the fight takes more than 3-4 minutes your toast anyways.  Unless your kiter team is top notch you're gonna get swarmed and owned.<br />
<br />
Chanter/druid pets from the pig pen = win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">bertoxx always scared me the worst out of him MM RZ and sol ro. hes the hardest (tank wise) for his position in the planar progression i think. first time we killed him i think i was around 9k and was tanking him, i remember it was parsed and one round he laid 8.3k worth of damage on me which isnt too shabby for a pre EP mob.</div></div><hr />
