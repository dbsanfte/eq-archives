<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently using an GSot4w with anger 3 aug and really enjoy it; however, one of my guildies would like to see me pick up the Obsidian greatsword.  I was just wondering if anyone is using this or has used this and how does it compare? The GSot4w has a 30% increase in proc while the Obsidian procs standard.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Obsidian greatsword <br />
<br />
Doesnt exist on lucy :) So guess you are talking about &quot;Obsidian Greatblade&quot;<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25997<br />
<br />
45/35 AC30 85HP Taunting Blow (450 Hate)<br />
41/31 125HP  Lightning Surge (DD75 , Increased proc rate)<br />
<br />
Well the Greatblade will totally own the GSo4W tanking wise (More AC, Much better proc).<br />
DD75 (even with a 30% bonus proc rate) is still very very low agro.<br />
<br />
However Grinding 11-23 LDoN is a pain...<br />
<br />
Since you already have an augmented GSo4W i wouldnt bother (it is an upgrade tanking wise).<br />
But probably not worth the effort (getting one + getting A3)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Obsidian Greatblade is actually 40/35, not 45/35.  It is not a very impressive weapon IMO.<br />
 <br />
My experience in grouping with a warrior who had the Obsidian Greatblade was that mobs would ping pong between the GSO4W (with lifetap aug) and the OGB (no aug).  Take that for what it is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I gotta agree.  Not too greatly impressed with the obsidian greatblade myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not impressed at all either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yerba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am impressed with it, I have both.<br />
<br />
Its ratio isnt bad, the stats are horrid, but the proc i think outways that. I xp in earth so using two handers can significantly cut down on rip damage taken, which is better for your healer than more raw hp from the weapon because its more consistent.<br />
<br />
I have the OG Ang3 aug'd and WA5, so the amount of procs is consistently better aggro than my damage output. I only lose aggro when someone else is careless or really really wants it, i dont punch taunt either, i only use incite for initial burst aggro, i believe that anger procs are the safest aggro, so using a weapon with one and aug'ing with ang3 is the best all-around way to go.<br />
<br />
Again, yes the stats suck, but until you get a BoW this is a great all-around tanking tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let's be realistic: ANY 2-handed weapon with Anger3/WA5 will probably be &quot;fine&quot; aggro for the kind of group that you describe.  I doubt that the intrinsic properties of the OGB are the reason why you can make do with using it in Earth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yerba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That is true, and you are probably right that most weapons with any kind of proc would hold aggro with ang3 and WA5.<br />
<br />
However, earlier posts in this thread didnt seem to take into acount the relative difficulty involved in procurring something better, i posted to try and reflect the benefits of the weapon.<br />
<br />
A weapon without an anger aug is unreliable, a weapon with an anger proc and an aug is almost a must in planar progression. Like BoT minis, Sol ro minis can be killed with a few good groups and the OG can drop off of any of them randomly. BoC, Bloodfrenzy, Hategiver, BoW, DBotW all require well equipped, well-motivated guilds to aquire, so for the casual warrior id say this is a viable upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Obsidian Greatblade drops off of the Balrog's on the way to Dresolik. I've one grouped them without too much trouble far in the past..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well cursed and xtc really aren't too hard to kill these days if you can say get 3-5 groups together after a raid or really less than that is needed you're just looking at like half hour fights or so.  Not a 2hander but just another idea heh.  As for the greatblade, seems pretty rare to me.  We've been done with solro for a while now but throughout all our dreso clears we only saw one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The greatblade will be better aggro than GSoFW if they both have anger3.  unless it is free (dkp wise), though, i wouldnt touch it with a 10 foot pole.  its basically a greatstaff of thunder with slightly better dps and more ac.  if it's free, though, go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yerba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it would be a greatstaff of thunder + stats, except stun procs are not a set amount of aggro, more circumstantial, if youve played a cleric or pally youd know that they dont always aggro right away, sometimes they seem to work too well and sometimes not at all. all-in-all id rather have a hate proc.<br />
<br />
also, ive seen the OG drop 3 times, and usually in more adventurous guild groups, never during a clear. i wouldnt expect to ever spend dkp on it since you shouldnt need more than 2 groups to get one, and only more than one group if youre specifically going for named loot, not xp.</div></div><hr />
