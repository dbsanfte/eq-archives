<br />
What a letdown. Know what the Ducks had as their biggest monkey clawing on their back? 12 days off. Totally killed their momentum and it showed. The only Duck on his game last night was J-S Giguere. He was a little rusty but still for facing as many shots as he did last night I think he still did a commendable job for his first time in the Stanley Cup finals. <br />
The Ducks had NO OFFENSE. The Neutral Trap totally shut them down and the biggest reflection of this was Kariya's one shot on goal. Oates pretty much put on his jersey and skates and was about it, and all the other Ducks were flying liek they were lost in a snowstorm. How many breakaways and odd man rushes did the Devils have again last night? 8 ? That is where the Devils flourished. They weren't worried about Defense with the Neidermeier and Stevens lines protecting their Turf, and Madden, Langenbrunner, Friesen, Pandolfo, and a bevy of other Devils aggressively attacking the puck no matter where it was.<br />
<br />
My read on Game 2? Expect the ducks to oil up the ducks machine that sent Detroit and Minnesota down in 4 and you'll see Kariya looking for the openings. The ducks never faced as much of a defensive team as the Devils in their playoff rounds; and once they see the holes in the neutral trap they'll be pelting Brodeur  with the puck. J-S Giguere will still be stellar ( I see him as goalie of the year ); but the Devils will still take the Cup back to E. Rutherford winning in...Game 6. I doubt it will go to 7 games but the Ducks will get back in their groove and provide a tougher obstacle on NJ's road to the Stanley Cup. NJ though got the tolls paid for and got plenty of gas left in the tank.</div></div><hr />

Anaheim seemed awful rusty and they need to shake it off and use their team speed to break the trap if they want to compete against the Devils. The Devils on the other hand have to feel good about scoring 3 goals on JSG, something that hasn't been done much in these playoffs. <br />
<br />
Wonder how much gas NJ DOES have left? They have played an awful lot of hockey, against some pretty nasty teams. Anaheim just had a 10 day break while NJ and Ott battered each other to death. The longer it goes, the more the balance swings to the Ducks, IMO.<br />
<br />
I agree with the NJ in 6 pick, but I don't think its a given.</div></div><hr />

Patrick Roy - We will not forget you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pfft, the only thing the ducks really have going for them is giguere.  If he wasn't so damn good I doubt the ducks would've made it past the stars (yeah, I'm bitter)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah really; that's one hell of a hole Av's gotta fill with Roy not minding the posts :(<br />
<br />
Wulfran : I think Jersey's got the legs to go all the way. There really isn't a bang-crash west coast team for the Ducks to season against that's near the caliber of NJ/Ott/Toronto...the classic argement over West Coast Hockey ( european flavored, open ice and speed ) and East Coast Hockey ( je me souviens, canadian style muck and grind ) .. and unfortunately I feel the longer the games go the more advantage the Devils have. Pretty much all the Devils now have at least one final round under them if not more..plus their leaders especially are basically all-star material and know what it takes to go into the long run series. Ducks; even as much as they've decimated their opponents just don't have enough experience I feel to bring Lord Stanley's Cup back to the pond.<br />
<br />
Stranger things have happened though. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
/shakes fist at his North Stars jersey..Damn You .. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh Slyse I actually wanted the Stars to win that series too just to see the electricity of the Stars / Wild Series. I am from MN and while I know it is not the players faults I still hate them all with a passion. I will start the Norm Green Sucks chants at every Stars/Wild games I attend. I know I am way too bitter and need to move on but taking pro hockey from The State of Hockey and moving it to Dallas was so painful. Not to mention that was right around the same time the Cowboys were stuffing Hershel Walker in a duffel bag and sniping I think 14 or 15 Million draft picks from us. Gawd I have a vendetta against Dallas pro sports.</div></div><hr />
