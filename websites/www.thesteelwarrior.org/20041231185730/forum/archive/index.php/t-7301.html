<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are a number of things I like about CoH and that I disliked about EQ.<br />
<br />
No corpse runs.  As a Warrior I always hated corpse runs in EQ.  After having fought tooth and nail to some deep dark corner of a dungeon, to finally lose for one reason or another, and then to have to try and get my corpse back was always very frustrating.  I can remember more than once staying up way past the point I should have been in bed because my corpse was down at the bottom of some dungeon along with the rest of my group and if we didn't get it then, we might not get it at all.  Hated it.  It sucked.  I know some people wax poetic about CRs, but I'm not one of them.<br />
<br />
Everyone can solo.  I love this about CoH, the fact that if you don't care to have a group or can't find one then you can just go solo on your own.  As a Warrior I always hated being so utterly and completely dependent.  Gone are the days of my sitting at a zone in someplace, like sebilis where you can't even get back out easily, hoping like hell someone will pick me up for a group.<br />
<br />
Death of the uber elite.  Hate to say it, but I despise the path EQ has taken there.  I have friends in the game that I would have enjoyed playing with, but couldn't because they were always at a raid.  And even when I could play with them, often times we couldn't play where they'd prefer to play because I didn't have the flags required or the gear level necessary.  So we'd end up playing alts.  But it still kind of sucked.  And I also hate how in EQ if you don't raid, you basically reach a point where you can't progress any further except through AAs or by doing a couple of hundred LDoN missions.  Sorry, but LDoN just isn't that exciting a place to play in.  CoH doesn't have that problem.  Even if you out level your friends you can at least sidekick one of them.  And everything seems to be relatively equally available to anyone willing to play the game and not just to those willing to &quot;raid&quot;.<br />
<br />
Death of the &quot;virtual penis&quot;.  Everyone gets enhancements, but no one in CoH talks smack about how their enhancements are better than your enhancements or how they have all these uber inspirations while you don't.  While I didn't suffer from it too often, there always seems to be someone around more interested in running their mouths about their &quot;gear&quot; than in playing the game in EQ.  But in CoH that absolutely is not true, as far as I've seen.</div></div><hr />

I was going to head it with the question &quot;Has EQ forever jaded the MMOG market on what their players call &quot;fun&quot; ?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I agree with you on all the points you mentioned as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people who want differing loot and uniqueness in possessions will not like coh.<br />
<br />
If you like non-combat aspects or MMoRPG's you will likely NOT like CoH.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy raids in EQ you will not like CoH. <br />
<br />
CR's are stupid.  It detracts from fun IMO.<br />
<br />
Everyone can solo - very true.<br />
<br />
Excellent post Glat<br />
<br />
The major unique innovation is the side kick system.  Though not perfect it allows everyone who wants to play together a mechanism to do so.  It is a wonderful thing for me to sidekick my 10 hr a week buddies to me so we can hang out together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is what is offered you to sidetrack from the monotony (sp?) of said treadmilling ( my favorite word to replace it with is 'catassing' ) is where the $$ is.</div></div><hr />

Sure, but all MMoRPG are.  I guess it depends on how you want to spend your time, trying to keep up with the Jones, like EQ, or just playing the way you want and having fun, like CoH.  Personally, I feel there is already far to much competition in RL.  I really don't want to join a MMoRPG to be made to feel inferior.  If I want that all I have to do is watch something like American Idol or watch commercials on television.  I already have a massive marketing machine working night and day telling me that if I can't buy a BMW or a Lexus, I'm not worthy.  Or if I don't buy X or Y aftershave, the beautiful models won't want me.  I really don't need to join a MMoRPG where a 15 year old willing to spend every day after school raiding with the local uber guild can then kick sand in my face because I can't or won't.<br />
<br />
Remember how in another post I talked about how CoH made you feel powerful while that was significantly missing from EQ these days?  Who really wants to join a MMoRPG to be made to feel weak?  Where's the fun in that?</div></div><hr />

Exactally why let my EQ account laps. And I am more sad than anything about it. If it were a relationship, you could say we grew apart. <br />
<br />
One of the things I love best about CoH is the side kick system. Tired of your main but your friends are all high level, not a problem. Get sidekicked upto you their range and play on.</div></div><hr />

 Oh, they're trying - look at the SG Equinox, for example. But it's not getting very far, and that's a credit to the devs for looking at the history of other MMOG's and not following down the same road - yet.</div></div><hr />

Waaa, Waaa there is nothing else to farm for us.....now what - you mean we were supposed to enjoy the journey?.....what is that like?<br />

The Uber elite will not stay in coh....this is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Amen brother. Amen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then again I get the impression that most of the people who run fan sites are not the uber elite. And EQ has put in a nice foundation for that for any other game.</div></div><hr />

One of the reasons I'm playing a number of different characters is because I can see that once you get to level 40, that's pretty much it, at least for now.  The game needs a chance to grow and expand before there will be anything like the depth to it of EQ.  And if you insist one focusing on one character to the exclusion of everything else and level level level just as fast as you can, you're bound to hit the ceiling fast and then stand around bitching about having nothing to do.<br />
<br />
People need to chill and relax a bit more, enjoy the game maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That si the key.even with EQ having an intense level of catassing needed to be 'halfway adequate' as the uber kiddies proclaim..i still felt the need/urge to immerse myself into the world and rP/storylines of encounters/scenarios.<br />
<br />
Taken from a snippet of another thred; it was discussed that how much care/concern was put into older world zones; and with GoD/up the time spent actually evolving a storyline was dismissed in light of them focusing on making content more time intensive to complete rather than adding a story behind it.<br />
<br />
CoH mabe yet has come through with this as well; there's really no major players/storyline involved beynd the street gangs, neo-nazis, and kiler robots..but in time I hope more story will evolve. It kmake fighting for good, well, actually &quot;good&quot; that you're cleansing the city of crimes for the benefit of good rather than just whacking_the_moles</div></div><hr />

Very cool I think. Now if only they had unique pics instead of a ? next to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;CoH mabe yet has come through with this as well; there's really no major players/storyline involved beynd the street gangs, neo-nazis, and kiler robots..&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, depending on how the upcoming content between now and CoV shakes out ... I can say the backstory is certainly there to make it far more than that.<br />
<br />
The neo-nazis for instance ... they're led by Nemesis. With his right hand man, Requiem. And some mad crazy doctor. They're the same 5th Column that plagued Paragon City in the 40s ... the same 5th Column villains that Statesman himself fought. There's quite a bit of room for development there.<br />
<br />
Killer robots ... well, the Clockwork King ... heh, there's a lot of good backstory there.  And you learn a lot of it in-game. <br />
<br />
Though they disappear at level 20-ish. And MK robots are brutal I hear later on. 5th column insanity.<br />
<br />
The street gangs, pretty much the focus for Superchum and Ebon Avenger it seems ... well, there's a lot of story there too. How they all evolve and are connected. What the Tsoo are doing. The Family. The Warriors. And then the Freakshow.<br />
<br />
I dunno. I mean the backstory is certainly in place.<br />
<br />
And, for the umpteenth time (though I've never posted it here) ... The RIKTI AND THE LOST HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP! This ISN'T a spoiler! You can find out about it on the regular site! Just click on Villains at the main page, and then find The Lost and you'll learn about it!<br />
<br />
(Sorry, had to rant ... people on the CoH boards have been getting very snippy with others about &quot;ruining&quot; or &quot;spoiling&quot; the Lost story, when, it's been spoiled for about 2 years on the main site).</div></div><hr />
