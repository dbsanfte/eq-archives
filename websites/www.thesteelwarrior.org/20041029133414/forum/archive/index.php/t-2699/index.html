<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Everyone just had a couple questions on her.  Guild tried her last night first time ever we wiped first try at 23% :(  Came back right after with 48 people and still barely won :p Main thing I wanted to know is I heard so many different stories about the Gargs.  I read it's best to kite all 4 of them until that witch is dead. We had 2 kited and 2 offtanked I was an offtanked of course I died :mad: So for future reference how do you all deal with the Gargs the Butterflies kinda owned a couple people to :) I dunno if it's just me or not but she is by far the hardest PoP Boss I've had to fight for my flag so far besides RD that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we kited them all around and burninated TT chaincasting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The way we do the Terris Thule.  I usually pull her to just a tad right of where she is.  We have our clerics / priest classes setup to the left where butterflies spawn.  Usually the butterflies will head straight towards the clerics anyway.  We have 2 enc's setup , along with any AE'er we have at the time.  Enc's stun them. Wizzies / Druids burn them down.  During this time we offtank Terris, and put all melee on butterflies until they are dead.  Once they are dead, MT calls engage again.  Dealing with the dispell is pretty easy.  Now with the garg's.  We select 4 designated kiters before hand and make them stand at their assigned post until the gargs become targetable.  Once they are targettable, they kite the gargs outside around her throne.  They wll not aggro from low hp of anyone out there.  From this point just kill TT herself.  Then have an sk or ranger tag a garg off a kiter. Kill it, Rinse and repeat until the other 3 gargs are down and distribute loots.  <br />
<br />
The first few times we did her, there wasnt' a sound strat that we had yet.  We've killed a few times using this strat and works pretty damn well.  We had less then 40 our last kill of her. I was the only to die.  Its not a fight you want to rush through. Take a bit of time with her.  HP is pretty low and her melee isn't all that bad.  Once you learn the encounter it will be a cake walk for you to knock her off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sssive</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can tell you that we have just Add tanked Gargs and Butterflies.  Stone 3, TT 0!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We always just tanked the guards.  They're slowable.<br />
<br />
TT is one of the first more 'interesting' fights :)  They use this theme a few more times; this fight is about controlling the encounter and not so much about the main mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">takes less healing power to just kite them around, obviously you can offtank them, but takes more ppl. <br />
<br />
there are actually a few waves of butterflies that spawn. if you dont lower her hp too fast, you want have quite so many to deal with at one time. last few times we did her, mezzed the small butterflies while tanks get on the big ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We always just kited the Gargs.  Much less complicated than trying to heal 4 offtanks while you finish off TT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Off tanked em here - the casters opened up so hard on TT when the Gargs popped that TT was down in less than 4 secs.<br />
<br />
Get used to off tanking adds, it happens more and more as you go up the levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We have always just kited the gargs while burning down TT after they spawn.  Never have tried off tanking them so I can't comment on that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">TT dropped 4 etherals for us btw.. is her loot still that retarded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stommper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Havenlight has a movie of their TT kill at this address...maybe it will lend some insight<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">TT dropped 4 etherals for us btw.. is her loot still that retarded? <br />
<br />
actually her loot is pretty decent compared to say ad &amp; grummus (who also drop 4 eths).  tt caster ring &amp; priest face are nice items that last a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whatever works :)  I think that offtanking them is more controlled and organized than kiting them, personally.  Also, we kill the gargs first, then finish TT, since TT will already be slowed and 2 clerics can keep the MT alive.  The rest of the healing power is just split among the 4 off tanks.  Kill the gargs, switch back to TT (who will be nearly dead now due to damage shields/pets).<br />
<br />
Whatever works for your force :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We offtanked the 4 &quot;A Grotesque Statue&quot; - they are stunable so build 4 teams of your_most_hated_class + Shammy and assign them to the 4 corners (NE/SE/SW/NW). You can see the moment the statues respawn to become targetable, they will stand up and sit down again. Now you have 2 seconds to aggro them before they aggro the raid. Tell you Pallys to stun them so they can lock down the statues for around 8-10 seconds - thats enough to slow them and after they're slowed a shammy is enough to heal the Offtank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We used to kite them around outside back when we were killing her. <br />
<br />
IMO the safest way(and least resource intensitive).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Kite the gargs. Everyone says get used to offtanking and not kiting but why? If you can kite and win and its easier for you then do it. When an encounter comes along that you HAVE to offtank then you will learn it anyway but offtanking TTs Gargs isn't gonna train you for that lol.<br />
<br />
She is a cheesy easy once you learn the encounter don't make it harder than it has to be. The Gargs hit harder than TT herself and combined all 4 Gargs have more HP than TT herself so why would you want to offtank that anyway unless you have a buttload of healers its not effecient to do so.</div></div><hr />
