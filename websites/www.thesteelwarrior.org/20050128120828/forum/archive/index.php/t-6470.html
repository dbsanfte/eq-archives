I don't see em for under 500k to much anymore on Veeshan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently using a BoC/CHoS combo....both unauged and the aggro is clearly superior to the CHoS/SoBS i was using before.<br />
<br />
I plan to Anger 3 the BoC which should make that weapon last a LONG LONG time.  Not sure yet about the offhand,  dont see myself getting anything anytime soon but i doubt ill waste LDON points auging it until im sure im gonna keep it for awhile.<br />
<br />
<br />
On my server BoCs are anywhere between 500-700k depending on the level of greed.  I was fortunate enough to get mine as a gift from a old friend but at 300k i would say BUY BUY BUY.  It really is a superior aggro weapon IMHO.  Anger 3 auged it would be very hard to replace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I ask is 300k is expensive for me.  I can come up with it but it will be gone by then.  I do see them sell at much higher prices.  But I would be willing to hold out until I got it for 300k once I have it.<br />
<br />
But the reason I was asking is Anger 3 is 600 hate, Engraging Blow is 700 hate.  Wasnt sure if 100 more hate would be worth the 300k.<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the difference is with GBoS and anger3 you have a proc that gives 500 hate ( probably less) and a proc that gives 600 hate, with BoC it's 700 hate and 600 hate. I prefer the BoC and I have both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen a BoC for sale for almost a month....  the ones that used to be up for sale were 300-350k.  If I'd had the pp I would have bought one....<br />
<br />
Now I'm approaching the 250k saved mark and there are almost always SoD's for sale for that price or less.  I am really considering purchasing a SoD.<br />
<br />
Should I hold out and keep saving for a BoC?  Is the aggro that much better than a SoD?  Would a SoD/CHoS combo be any better aggro than a CHoS/SotB?  How does the DPS of a BoC compare to the SoD?  The reason I ask about DPS is I usually group with the same 3 people and we oftentimes don't have a lot of DPS so my DPS does make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sold my Blade of Carnage in favor of SoD/Copper Hammer combo.  However, I wasn't in a raiding guild, and the biggest thing I ever tanked was Dozekar, who was still a joke with the aggro those 2 weapons generate.<br />
<br />
It is my personal opinion that EB is overrated for anyone not in a serious raiding guild.  You might as well take the DPS that comes from the Greatblade of Storms/Sceptre of Destruction/Copper Hammer.<br />
<br />
Is it nice?  Sure.  Is it worth 300 to 500kpp?  Absolutely not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It works great.<br />
<br />
People can pull agro off me with Anger III BoW/Sews/Time weapons. (when taunting)<br />
<br />
Other than that, I am good. One rogue pulls agro off me with his hate-reducing Time Dagger (grrrr)<br />
<br />
I can hold agro pretty well in LDON with big nukers just going nuts, hold agro 99% of the time in LDON with non-EP+ nukers going nuts,  and if you put me in an MA situation with a little time to call assist, I never lose agro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I think I will pickup a SoD.  I'm not actively raiding yet, so I am sure my aggro will be fine with a SoD.  Also, I really like the stun procs, helps against gaters and to interrupt spells like CH's.  Sucks when you get a mob down to under 10% and a CH goes off...  Bash only goes so far.  If I start raiding I'll pickup a BoC later if I can and then can still offhand the SoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoD only stuns up to 55 so it won't stop anything high level from gating/CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only 55 atm, so the stun will be good on most mobs for awhile, but yeah eventually I know the stun won't be effective.  The DD portion still will hit on higher level mobs though, right?  I always an grouped with an enchanter to tash, so my procs from my current CHoS and SotB usually stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DD sticks, the aggro sticks, but there is an additional immune message you'll get on everything over 55 or giants/dragons and whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...  but the BoC has a better ratio than the SoD.  I am sure the proc damage on the SoD more than makes up for the lesser ratio, but how close are those two weapons in terms of total DPS?  Has anyone parsed the DPS of the two weapons on normal LDoN mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I were you, I wouldn't spend 250k on a SoD either.  You could do ALOT with your gear for that money, and there's not going to be a huge aggro difference or DPS difference going from Copper Hammer to SoD.<br />
<br />
Get some Ornate bracers, Ornate Greaves, Elemental Bow, etc.  SoD is a good weapon, but not for the price tag it carries these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GBoS is an amazing weapon.  Period.  I don't plan to upgrade it until I get a BoW, in which case I'm shelving all DW options for at least a while.<br />
<br />
Till then, I'm aiming on replacing my Cord-Hilted Spike Driver with a Double-Edged Greatblade of Storms (or something like that, off Agnarr), or a Jagged Shard of Frozen Flame... and then sticking A 100dd/stun yak aug on it.<br />
<br />
I would take a BoC, but not to replace my GBoS.  It's my baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never used a BOC and GBOS at the same time to do direct comparisons.  What I have done is play the LDON-beta warrior template, which was almost identical to my real warrior at the time, but instead of my GBOS it had a BOC.  I was expecting a noticeable difference and was disappointed not to find one.  Yes, the BOC's aggro is a little more noticeable when it procs early, but my sense was that 18 delay gives the GBOS a little more sustained aggro (and DPS) between each proc.  In general the performance between the two was very close, definitely far too close for my 300k.  But I suppose that if you really want a &quot;GBOS-class weapon&quot; in both hands, then buying a BOC is one route to obtaining this.</div></div><hr />

Slap an anger3 aug on your GBoS and you will have one of the best agro setups pre-elemental. Don't even need anger aug on the scimitar. With all that plat, buy a Crystallized Acid Bracer or 2, depending on prices on your server. Will be a big hp upgrade much more worth it.<br />

I will most likely DPS aug them before I put any anger augs in them. The only times I have trouble holding aggro are when someone is trying to pull aggro off me and even then it takes serious effort on their part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll take that advice, ornate prices have been dropping nicely on my server.  For 250k I should be able to pickup bracers, vambraces, and greaves.  That will leave me really set on armor for a long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a BoC/Gbos combo both with anger 3 augs. BoC was better than gbos when mainhanded, but was not a huge difference. I gave the BoC back to guild when i got my BF. I would have prefered to keep the BoC, but i got dkp back for it so it was gone lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">back when i first got the BoC i didnt think that it had much better aggro in ldons than the BoC. on mobs that you have time to build up aggro on, like raid mobs, the BoC is alot better than the GBoS but for your situation, as nice as a BoC is i dont think its worth that 300k</div></div><hr />
