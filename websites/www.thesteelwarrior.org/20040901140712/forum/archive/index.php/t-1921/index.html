<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not entirely sure where the best place to put this thread is, I'm just tossing it here for now. Mods can move it wherever.<br />
<br />
I was thinking the other night.<br />
<br />
I think that a good part of the reason why so many people are passionate about problems with their class, is because they have invested a lot INTO their class. If they have a class such as a warrior which arguably has turned innto a class that is weaker in relative pwoer than the other tanks, they're going to make a fus about getting the problem fixed, they're not going to go to the other, more powerful classes, and start a character of the class that's perceived to be more powerful, because they have invested too much time INTO their original character. Really, &quot;powerful&quot; can be interchanged here with the word &quot;in demand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pure melee also in PoP have, until the very highest levels of PoP (IE SolRo/RZ/Elementals and above) pretty much gotten the shaft in terms of itemization and improvements to their class and their abilities, especially compared to the upgrades in spells that all casters have gotten.<br />
<br />
I think what this is very likely to turn into in terms of class choice in EQ2, is that classes that are seen to be weak in EQ, will pretty much translate directly into classes that are NOT picked in EQ2. For example, I believe many warriors will pick Paladins or Shadowknights. Druids will pick Mages if they want a pet, Cleric to be a good healer, wizard to be a good nuker. Rogues and monks will be rarer, clerics and enchanters will be all over the place. <br />
<br />
IN EQ2, I believe that since people won't have the time invested into their characters as they have in EQ1, people will reflect, with their class choices, the community's general perception of what classes are good and what suck in EQ1, and to a lesser extent, what classes they feel will get upgrades and new toys consistently, and what classes will not get anything.<br />
<br />
I'm curious, what does everyone else think of this little speculation of mine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't care how perty the graphics are, I will NOT be playing Eq2, nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup. <br />
<br />
EQ2 is not on my wishlist, nor are any further Sony Online Entertainment products. <br />
<br />
I'll continue playing EQ1 due to my attachment to the character (and my online friends) for so long as it interests me or until a product to rival it by some other developer comes along.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To reply to the post actually, I do think you have a very valid point.  I personally do not see many people jumping from EQ to EQ2, I tend to think that most people who play it will be new to online gaming or jumping from another game.  Those that do I believe will look at it as an opportunity for a new beginning, a chance to switch classes and try something different.  This certainly will hold true for any warriors who are switching.  I do believe that many of us continue to complain and hold on to our class because of our time investment to our character, I personally am fed up with my warrior, but will continue to play him because I shudder to think about repeating the same time investment on another character.  Do we know what classes will be available for the next expansion already?  I haven't read it anywhere, perhaps we do.  <br />
<br />
That being said, I personally have no desire to switch to EQ2.  Even being fed up with the game as it is there is still so much to see and do for me.  I have never actually been on a successful Naggy raid, I have never taken part in slaying one of the gods.  I believe this to be true for most people who play the game, and I also believe that many of us become emotionally attached to those goals.  Sheesh, there is still so much content left to explore in this game, so many zones I have still never explored completely, so many mobs left to kill.  I imagine that most that will switch are those that have seen all there is to see, the Time capable guilds that will be leaving and reforming in the new EQ to conquer yet again, and I hope leaving boatloads of higher end content for a new batch of players to discover and explore, without having to leave their current guilds and join one of the current higher end raiding guilds because it is the only way to get to the end game.  Or the people who are just plain fed up with SOE's current game, and are willing to give the new one a shot, which is probably few.  I'm kind of excited to see what happens when EQ2 comes out, maybe there will be a bit more room at the top, it might shake things up a bit =)<br />
<br />
Heh, or maybe nothing will change, and no one will leave, I know I'm not.  Guess we'll have to see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Class choices in EQ are a little different.  You don't pick a class to start out, everybody starts out the same.  Then at level 5 or so you pick an archtype, like fighter or caster, and continually get more specialized as you gain levels.  I think this will be nice for newbies to the RPG world.  I'm not sure what I'd do if I was to play EQ2, but I don't think going by the relative power of classes in EQ1 at the time of release will necessarily work out for you.  At least in EQ1 classes go from overpowered, to useless, to back to overpowered every year or so.  I know people who played rangers when they were uber back in the old world, then remade as warriors when rangers were gimpy, and have now gone back to their rangers hehe.<br />
<br />
If I play EQ2 I will probably mess around with a few classes and see how they compare to EQ1 and how fun they are to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I think players are going to gravitate towards the choices that lead to the ones that are considered &quot;in demand&quot; in EQ1. This may or may not work out, because the vision of say the enchanter may be a significantly different role in eq2, but I think EQ1 will heavily influence choices in EQ2, whether deserved or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure i'll play it but in practically every other FRPG over the last 20 years I've played a warrior/fighter.  Odds are I would again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tend to doubt that I'll play EQ2 based on the total lack of understanding SoE has about how their own game works both from a class balance standpoint and from a zone design perspective (risk vs reward).  That said, if I did feel like playing EQ2 I'd read up on how the game mechanics work and base my class selection on which classes can do the things I like to do and are not castrated by the game mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think what this is very likely to turn into in terms of class choice in EQ2, is that classes that are seen to be weak in EQ, will pretty much translate directly into classes that are NOT picked in EQ2. <br />
<br />
EQ 2 doesn't work like that.<br />
<br />
Check out Star Wars Galaxies. EQ 2 will work much more like that. So if you want to be a druid who heals better, you'll simply focus on that more in your skill tree set than, say, nuking or DoTing.<br />
<br />
Warriors will have defensive or offensive options.<br />
<br />
The thing that has me most interested in EQ 2 is if the skill trees are flexible enough that I can be the class I always wanted to play from the get-go ... a monk/warrior. Basically a pugilist or a brawler. Defensive enough to take a few shots to the head, but a straight up bad ass hand to hand combatant.<br />
<br />
EQ 2, from everything I've heard seems like it will have room for that type of specialization to develop.<br />
<br />
That of course remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I keep playing both a warrior and a monk. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes.<br />
<br />
Pure melee, I believe, will be avoided when making the class choices, especially pure tanks, in favor of hybrid tanks. <br />
<br />
Pure, highly specialized healers will be chosen more, as another example.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if it's one pure class or a series of choices to get to the same general area, I believe those choices will be made regardless if it's 1 decision to get there or 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unless they make a compelling case towards being a pure melee I can't forsee many people wanting to invest time into being one. Always needing a group to even leave the starting gate isn't a good thing.<br />
<br />
Nothing more I hate to get is an upgraded item that has the same stats for a hybrid and has a chunk of mana on it. <br />
<br />
Perhaps they will use percentages on items so that a pure melee gets more AC (for example) and a hybrid gets a balance of AC/mana much like it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I intend to play everquest, I'll probably end up as a hybrid of a Warrior(Offensive, Defensive can eat me)/Bard, or perhaps a Wizard/Cleric to become something like a Red Mage. (If you know your FF terminoligy[sic?])<br />
<br />
I think the Offensive Warrior/Bard would be a GREAT combination. Bards have LOTS of power behind them once you think about it for awhile.</div></div><hr />

I haven't given up on EQ even though they occasionally will get the smart ass feedback from me (when I can't find a group or am in the nightmarish one where the pally just left and the enchanter can't seem to make the adjustment):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/feedback I wonder if Night Elf Warriors are better for grouping<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh, I know it probably does more harm than good but...<br />
<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, SoE and EQ have until WoW comes out to make some dynamic changes to the class.  If not, once i buy WoW, well  &quot;You have defiled your own lands!  EQ will no longer defile mine! &quot;<br />

In every RPG I've ever played, warriors are the heart of a group, in EQ, they're the most hamstrung, castrated class around.  (I hope that will change).   And like what is beginning to seem like the vast majority of players, there's a ton of content in EQ1 I havent seen yet, and I lack the time to play more than one game, so I doubt I'll be shelling out the cash for EQ2. (had to pass on SWG as well)<br />
<br />

<br />
Serioulsy though, I don't know if I'll play it.  If I had to pick again, I would pick some type of melee hybrid that can actually solo.  Grouping is fun etc., but there are times when I don't have a lot of time to play, or just don't feel like being around people, and I'd like to be able to effectively solo to get at least some xp.  Gimped as we may be these days, I really don't have that much trouble finding a group though.  I sometimes even get offers out of the blue without even being LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">from the looks of it, EQ-1 and EQ-2 are targetted at entirely different audiences, at least they should be if Sony were smart. EQ has content, without argument multiple times mroe content than any other popular MMORPG's out there. Game mechanics suck, many problems in the game, graphics aren't too impressive, classes are imbalanced. BUT, people who actually want to explore cling to EQ for the constant array of new content (which is why I'm still utterly shocked that Sony actually doesn't have any more high-end raiding expansions announced, even though PoP, and EQ for that matter has been at the moment beaten). <br />
<br />
EQ-2 looks to be focused on the elements EQ doesn't offer. Better graphics certainly, a more lively and intrigiung environment, better and more interesting class structure, better game mechanics, etc. However, I sincerely question the amount of content it will have, since it's basically reverted back to the original 3 EQ continents. Seriously, it seems to be more like DAoC II without RvR than a sequel to EQ, and since I am a fan of content above all, I won't be buying it.<br />
<br />
P.S., devs, fix warriors and add more raiding content already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">devs, fix warriors and add more raiding content already. <br />
<br />
I agree with the first part, but the raiding stuff, no. The last 3 expansions have been dedicated to raiding crap. (Not counting LoY of course)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think thats the point.  Why make a new expansion available so people stick around?  They want to give the high high lvl people something to spend their 30-40 hour play time a week on.  Why they are releasing any kind of mid lvl expansion at all baffles me.<br />
<br />
Well Im still trying to get higher in EQ1 and it seems like theres a bit more time to do so.  It all depends on what the other games are out there and if they look good.  SWG was on my list but after trying Beta out, I wasnt too impressed.  Give it bout 2-3 months and they player economy (no real merchants from what I hear) will be up and running.<br />
<br />
EQ2 looks good, but wont be as deep as EQ1 for a long while.  It's like playing EQ1 but u can cross breed classes and gotta start in the bronze (armor) age again.<br />
<br />
But, Blizzard has never let me down on ANY of their games so I'll prob give that a shot on release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;I agree with the first part, but the raiding stuff, no. The last 3 expansions have been dedicated to raiding crap. (Not counting LoY of course)&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiding stuff, yes. Everquest is beaten. Sony needs to release high-end content for several reasons:<br />
<br />
1) What was once called high-end content trickles further and further down the EQ ranks. NToV (3 expansions ago, so within your quota) used to be the high-end of Everquest. Now, most of the mobs are probably one-groupable by the top people, who wouldn't touch them anyways. If at one point, 1% of the server visited NToV, then now, with level 65 and everything, I can safely say that at least 20% of the server has done it.<br />
<br />
2) There is always new content for non-raiders. If you're level 46, is NToV, or ssra, or PoP; this is all new content for you no? I mean, sure, some people have been there before, but have you? There is always something to do in EQ that would technically still be new to you. The same can't be said for the high-end stage of EQ. Some guilds have already finished everything. Others are close to doing so. Without constantly adding new high-end content, what encourages them to keep playing?<br />
<br />
3) I've alluded to this in the previous paragraph, but let me re-state. Without high-end content, raiding guilds already finished with PoTime will quit. Hell, even guilds in the elementals might consider quitting, considering the end is already close in sight, and the desire to keep playing wanes. Eventually, more guilds will reach the elementals, or time, and will also quit. I know, some of you may think &quot;ooh, yay, finally, the ubers are leaving, they're all jerks and low-lifes anyways.&quot; But, consider this, EQ has survived this long because of content. With Everquest beaten, why would anyone ever consider picking up EQ, when there are other MMORPG's with better graphics, more lush environments, and better game mechanics. Many people would stop playing, and this would eventually affect you as well.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, it has already started, but not as heavily yet. If Sony doesn't release a high-end expasions, they will be sealing their own fate, as this would signal the beginning of the migration from Everquest to WoW. And let's face it, with a company like Blizzard, who is renown for spectacular games, do you think EQ 1, or EQ 2 for that matter will be able to compete, especially considering the kind of relationships Sony has with it's customers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't think ubers are horrible; I just think that you really can't get much more raiding than killing the gods themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;I don't think ubers are horrible; I just think that you really can't get much more raiding than killing the gods themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to normal logic, yes. But, this is Everquest, a game where it is normal for a hybrid to outank a class whose sole purpose revolves around tanking. It is a game where the most powerful dieties attempt to prevent Zeb from unleashing his wisdom, and the four elemental dieties, supposedly the most powerful, summon a demon to prevent this from occuring. But, you beat the demon, and some lesser diety, far weaker than anything you've killed up until this point shows up, says &quot;so, um, Zeb, don't reveal the secret&quot; and he says &quot;ok,&quot; thereby ending the game. What I'm hinting at, is that logic does not apply to Everquest. <br />
<br />
True, some will say that, once you've killed all the gods, where else is there to go? Well, personally, I think there are still several angles that can be explored here.<br />
<br />
1) Keep in mind, not all the gods have been killed yet. In fact, arguably the two most powerful ones have yet to even be discovered. Veeshan is obviously one. Brell, her greatest nemesis is of course the other, and I still have no fucking idea how they can justify not finally implementing Plane of Underfoot, with Brell into LDoN.<br />
<br />
2) (This is the idea SOny will probably opt for). Create an SoL-like expansion with a non-sequential and non-related set of lore and storyline, and load it up with various bosses more powerful than the gods because they are supposedly not subject to their power and laws for some apparent reason.<br />
<br />
3) THis is just an out-of-the-blue idea I came up with after some friday-night drinking. Considering the fact that players have already defeated most of Norrath's dieties, and the final stage in PoP progression is Plane of Time, I had a thought. Up until this point, Everquest has existed in a consistent time-frame, as in, gamers never travel through time, to past or future. The concept of time really isn't even an issue (not talking about time limits on encounters or anything, i'm talking about in-game time).<br />
<br />
So, with the completion of plane of time, and the deafeat of major Norrath diety, why not launch an expansion enabling gamers to travel through time? I mean, the expansion starts off with an immensely wize sage who forsees the destruction of Norrath. He can't explain how exactly, and he claims the fate of Norrath has already been sealed by actions of the past, and the destruction is inevitable. However, the detrcution of Quarm, and completion of PoTime has shattered the fabric of time, allowing adventurers the ability to travel through time and prevent the events that will eventually lead to Norrath's annihalation from occuring. <br />
<br />
Rather than gods, gamers can combat the mystical characters that helped created lore of Norrath, and participate in the events taht helped shape the planet's history. Trakanon's prophecy, the original war of the dieties, the chaining of the sleeper are just a few of the possible encounters...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea, I know, my idea probably sounds stupid and non-sensical. But, it's just designed to illustrate that tehre are still paths that Everquest can go through at the high-end game without allowing the game to just &quot;be beaten&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Liakim1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just a quick question to satisfy my own curiosity - I am not an uber, never will be, but am curious to hear your mindset on this matter.  Two questions actually.<br />
<br />
A)  Do you think PoP was beaten too fast?<br />

B)  Much like after Aten Ha Ra was beaten in Vex Thal, many guilds continued to farm VT for the awesome loot.  Do you have similar intentions with PoTime?  You talk about content being done and people leaving now, but to my knowledge very few people serverwide have elemental BP's, wouldn't you continue to farm for them to 'complete' their characters?

<br />
There's a difference. SoL was beaten too quickly yes. But by the time people defeated AHR, Planes of Power was already announced. It was already announced to be a high-end expansion with many raiding zones. Therefore, people already knew that SoL would not be the conclusion of the game. The same does not hold true now, there is no forecast high-end expansion in sight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mephistophilis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am a casual gamer and haven't been playing EQ that long.  My main is a level 50 Warrior on Mithaniel Marr.  That being said, I can still remember the excitement and immersion of EQ when I first started.  I loved discovering new zones and monsters.  Hell, I still do.  As has been mentioned before I probably haven't even seen 20% of the game.<br />
<br />
I will play EQ2 (I love checking out game design and graphics...sort of a hobby) and work towards being a warrior.  It's just my favorite class in any RPG.  I look forward to a fresh new world to explore, where at least for a few days, there won't be uber guilds who have done everything already.<br />
<br />
I think at first, people will play their 'favorite' class.  Simply because nobody will really be sure what the various class viabilities are.  There may be some prejudices and predispositions based on EQ, but I think most people will want to take on this new challenge with the character they love the most.<br />
<br />
What can be better than exploring a new world of dangers and treasure with YOUR character, your friends in arms by your side.  Remember that feeling of excitement?  It's why I play, and why I will be the warrior protecting my people with raw power and an iron will, no matter how much the world tries to knock me down.<br />
