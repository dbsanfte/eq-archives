Debuff not land, all resist  :( However heard alot of nuke him down :confused: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your casters need to be in melee range for anything but malos and tash to land.  Just have em run in, cast, then run out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heres how you kill PoHate Inno 2.0:<br />
<br />
Run to the second floor of Hate. Kill a couple mobs that guard him. Pull him. He hits for 401, 201 defensive. He will eat all your buffs, period, no matter what, and will Gflux you in whatever direction he is facing. So have him facing a wall... After about 30 minutes, he'll die if you have any dps.<br />
<br />
Then he'll drop 3 crappy items based on various races, and maybe an epic piece of two<br />
<br />
Now, do you mean Innoruuk 3.0?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>psmoses</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hummmm&#65292;the Inno...now...standing in the Hall at PoH is 3.0?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like I said, the current Inny resists all spells (except the unresistable ones) if you're not in melee range.  The trick is to avoid or minimize exposure to his rampage while you're casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats correct. The current incarnation is 3.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2.0 was when they added the second floor to the old plane, wasn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">keys to inny<br />
<br />
1) He has AoE rampage so melee from max range so your melees don't get hit by it<br />
<br />
2) His grav flux dispells the top buff slot so have an insta click buff up in that slot<br />
<br />
3) As others have said you need to be in melee range to cast spells on him<br />
<br />
4) Try to pull real inny with as few of his guards as possible, but dont take too long on the pull, he wil despawn after a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2.0 was when they itemized / populated the second floor, moved 1.0's loot table to the minibosses, and created a highly gay loot table for Inny, gave him 10x the hp and removed his Death Touch. <br />
<br />
3.0 was when they moved it all to hateplaneb and revamped just about everything about the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have to say I think Inny 2.0 had the absolute worst drop table in the game for a boss, let alone a god.  He had to be the worst RvR mob there ever was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Inno 2.0 could be killed with by any number of people, having a level 60 Knight tank with a level 46 cleric as the only healer - my cleric's mana pool never dropped below 70% with c3 and no FT. The RvR was right where it should have been. When you kill orc pawns, you get cloth caps and orc pawn picks. The dark elves were a bigger threat than Innoruuk 2.0, they had better rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If the only risk on Inny was wasting 2 hours, his loot still wasn't worth it.  If you had to clear plane of hate first and then his loot spawned on the ground to be picked up, people still wouldn't bother with it.  If a  mob is up all the time then his RvR is bad, no matter how easy he is hehe.  My guild killed him twice shortly after his upgrade and the loot either rotted or went to alts on the very first kills, and he was actually a somewhat challenging mob then.  Was kind of a fun fight thanks to the knockbacks at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, but how long did it take you to break in and clear to Inny?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agree with all the comments on Inny 2.0, Kendrick's version of Hate was definitely a failure, but the biggest failure was Inny 2.0's loot table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">not alot was up last weekend so we went to hate to try and kill inny but the lag with 50 people was incredibly bad and we had to call it off, been like that last few times we been in hate for inny or maestro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Inny 3.0 (Hate) is probably one of the best RvR mobs in the game.<br />
<br />
-Level 46 requirement (Not that you could kill him at level 46 though, hehe)<br />
-No Keys<br />
-No Flags<br />
-3 Day respawn<br />
-4 VT quality loots (3 + 1 marsinger book for the 3rd gem)<br />
-1 hour raid tops with 10 mobs to clear<br />
-Relatively easy encounter once you figure it out<br />
<br />
Only problem is, it's blowable!  Not blowable in a sense like Coirnav, but if the real Inny despawns before you kill him, the fake Inny (trigger) will respawn one day later.<br />
<br />
Another problem is, however, is that PoHate is fuckin' lagged right now.  Ever since the DX9 patch, it's hell with a raid up there.  They need to fix something, that's for sure.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Btw, I opened up PoHate (B) in EQ-ZoneViewer and also noticed an incredible amount of lag.  I mean, it was god awful.  I have a P4-3.0ghz machine with 1gb of RAM and a Radeon 9700Pro and have never seen that much system lag.  I also opened up PoWater, Drunder, and a couple of other zones and none of them had system lag like this.  <br />
<br />
My *guess*, and I mean just a *guess* is this:<br />
<br />
PoHate has a ton of architecture (polygons!) right all clumped up and next to each other.  If you open up the zone with EQ-ZoneViewer, you'll notice it's one hell of a tightly packed medieval style town.  It takes one beast of a system to view it all.  My wager is that with the release of the DX9, they changed the way EQ did polygon occlusion (IE: Rendering only what you see and not everything in the frikkin' zone).  If I had my guess, it's not a problem they can simply fix serverside, they're either going to have to re-design the zone or change the way the rendering engine handles geometry.  Again though, this is pure speculation, but when the problem seems to exist OUTSIDE of the game, something is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Did i miss the memo? Plane of Hate B?? Or is this what you are all calling plane of hate now that its been &quot;revamped&quot; I would love to take my guild to do this mob if we have an off night and nothing we &quot;need&quot; is up. So if you could explain what your talking about i would be greatfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if you want to do the new hate here is a good resource<br />
http://www.guildseofon.com/raidinghate.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Add's another VT esque BP to the mix, only the 2nd enraging blow 2hs in the game, and it takes 20 min top.<br />
<br />
If you're having difficulty, think mini RZ, and you're golden</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's my understanding that the new innoruuk isn't actually tethered so you can pull him far away from where the adds spawn... is this how ppl are doing him with 2 groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The biggest pb with Inny atm is the enormous lag that as the zone since the DX9 patch.<br />
We used to kill him regularly before, never killed again since this patch, just too much lag in th zone.</div></div><hr />
