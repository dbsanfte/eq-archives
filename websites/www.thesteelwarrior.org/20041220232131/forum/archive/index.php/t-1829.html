Furious Bash from lucy's (http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=2455&amp;source=Test)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like the furious bash effect is going to leave a spell icon on the mob for 3.3 minutes?  If that happend to be a buff that added x hate per tick well....that would be pretty damn nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only change was the addition of : Added Slot 2: Limit: Effect(Unknown(999) allowed).<br />
<br />
Best guess is they are not allowing it to work with stuns etc as the pals / sks have shown, or they're allowing it to work on procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would the 3.3 minute duration mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenelan</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That second slot, a Limit:<br />
<br />
Normally that for what types of spells it can effect. Any chance it's going to effect hate type spell/proc effects? :)<br />
<br />
I think even worn effects that have no spell that can be cast, have a listed duration (check vengeance effects)...so not sure that's going to do anything to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that they are changing furious bash to a proc instead of an &quot;effect.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The proc will cause an effect on the mob (that lasts for 3.3 minutes) which will increase all hate generated by the person who proc'd it.  We already know that they can assign a player name to an effect on a mob (dot stacking code), so this seems like it is within the limits of the existing code.  It would be an effective workaround to the problem of the furious bash &quot;focus effect&quot; not working on procs.<br />
<br />
The slot two exclusion will probably be used to negate certain types of spells (and their associated aggro) such as stuns and heals... as these already generate mucho grande hate on their own, and could make aggro control even more trivial for those who can cast such spells.  Or it might be used to exclude things like taunt/AE taunt.<br />
<br />
If this is true, than everything we do to the mob while this effect is active (DPS, hate procs, etc...) will generate more aggro (percentage tied to the level of furious bash).<br />
<br />
Anyway... that's my guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The duration is how long it lasts on yourself.  Every worn effect looks like that.  Of course, since all worn effects are always on, whether it lasts 1 tick or 8 hours makes no difference.  It's just how they code things.  I'm guessing it's for things that can both be worn or a buff (Aura of Battle, Aura of Eternity, etc).  <br />
<br />
The only change they made was adding a new limit(unknown) field.  My guess would be Furious Bash will only work with procs.  Since Shield of Strife is Knight usable, 70% aggro increase to a class that gets most of its aggro via spells is just downright ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinuvan</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ll take a guess and that limit is for EB type spells. I.E any pure hate spell will get modified by shield  which mainly help warriors. Will see thursday anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would be pretty funny if they turned it into a click-buff...self-only agro spell, pretty nice, huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think phantron was right about it being a &quot;worn effect&quot; buff.<br />
<br />
If the new field allows it to work with procs (and not with spells that are cast), then it certainly makes furious bash shields a much better option for warrior aggro generation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but if it makes no difference, why would they change it from 3 minutes to 3.3?  I suppose duration does something on worn effects, but we probably don't know what it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hail, a_year_old_change!<br />
<br />
Wasn't that about the time they were preping spells for the PoP expansion and 5 more levels?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking its just the result of mass code changing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm betting worn effect.  If I remember correctly all worn items now have durations assigned to them even if they are perpetual (see EB item...even though it has a duration listed it still acts as infinite). <br />
<br />
If it was &quot;put an icon on mob and increase all agro for a period&quot; then it would encourage people to just &quot;ruatha shield swap&quot;....which is precisely what you have to do now to have it worth a darn.<br />
<br />
Man I sure hope its worn effect only.  Would make leaving the shield in full time a nice option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That change was old and it's:<br />
<br />
Changed Durationtext from 1 ticks @L1 to 3.0 mins @L60 to 1 ticks @L1 to 3.3 mins @L65<br />
<br />
They're just updating it so it'll be consistent with level 65 characters.  Of course, since I have never heard of worn effect 'worn off' with any characters that change must be just for consistency.  <br />
<br />
If Furious Bash had an icon it'd completely defeat the point of using a shield.  You'd just use it and then switch back to a BoW or a Time DW combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it's cool that they are supposedly making it easier for us to get and hold aggro through sheilds.  However, if I wanted to hold a shield I would have made a cleric or druid lol.  That's just my take but if this goes through I'm gonna be pissed for 1 reason, there was a fb 3 shield I could have bought for like 6k and I didn't cuz it was when fb was supposedly broken, but now that things gonna be worth like 30k lol.</div></div><hr />

I was ghetto bashing with mine before, I'm not sure what I want out of this patch. The message mentions nothing about it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, tested in an xp group for an hour, the shield hasn't changed at all for me.<br />
<br />
Configs tested:<br />
<br />
* ghetto bashing with Great Blade of Storms, Cord Hitled Spike Driver -- good agro, noticeably better than without<br />
<br />
* equipped with GBoS primary -- pretty bad agro, GBoS + SoD out-agro'd me reliably<br />
<br />
* equipped with CHSD primary -- really bad, never could get agro over GBoS + SoD<br />
<br />
It never procced at 305 dex, definitely still a worn effect.<br />
<br />
The theory in my guild is that they limited the stacking ability with the Raex BP, since it seems like an FB 7 shield + Raex BP would be insanely huge agro.</div></div><hr />

The glow message is still there, but I haven't seen a particle effect. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated, fb still goes off on bashes, which is pretty meaningless for us.  Even IF it went off on procs, I doubt it would be that great either.<br />
<br />
Assuming lucy is actually accurate that FB increases 'bash hate', the damage bash does and thus the 'hate' it generates, is so small as to not even matter, even if you increase it by 50%.<br />
<br />
I logged most of a fight against Xegony, and for a lot of it I used aegis of earth and a hategiver, because aggro wasn't likely to be an issue.  In 38 minutes logged with that combination, bash only pulled in at 5 damage per second, and the hategiver of course only managed 55 dps.  50% more hate for 5 dps = Doesn't make any difference at all.<br />
<br />
There is no real solution here..  Even if FB worked on procs, and theres no reason to believe that is even what sony wants or cares to have, you'd still be way behind damage (thus hate) wise.  <br />
<br />
You can't give warriors good 1h weapons that can be paired with a shield because we can dual wield.  The pot rallos weapon is only 34/31, which means if you paired it with a shield, you'd still be way behind a 2h weapon dps wise.  Further, as I'll get to that would be a bad move..<br />
<br />
Probably the best solution, would be to use innate hate effects on FB shields.  Scaling from say 1% up to 8% on the highest.  These worn effects wouldn't just affect bash hate and thus would make shields somewhat viable in many situations.<br />
<br />
I think that sony may have once had a vision of shields and either it didn't work out, or they just never finished.  Furious Bash is a retarded effect that does next to nothing for us in particular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The FB shields have very significant AC on them.  If aggro is tolerable with a FB shield then you should expect to give up a lot of DPS because you're getting the AC on the shield.<br />
<br />
There are basically three generic types of weapons you can expect to use based on what we've seen so far:<br />
<br />
Dual wield - good HPs, best aggro (in theory), high riposte, low AC (typically)<br />
Weapon + shield -  best HPs, lowest aggro, medium ripostes, highest AC.<br />
2H - lowest HPs, medium aggro, lowest ripostes, medium AC.<br />
<br />
Since weapon + shield has highest AC &amp; HPs just by the way shields are designed, and riposte rate with 1 weapon is tolerable, this means wepaon + shield always has the best tanking stats.  If weapon + shield aggro is even the same as 2H or dual wield there would never be any reason to use that type of weapons for tanking purposes.  <br />
<br />
So therefore weapon + shield by definition can't do a lot of aggro, otherwise that's the only kind of weapon you'd use.<br />
<br />
A worn 1-8% aggro increase on a FB shield would do even less than whatever it's supposed to do now.  You're basically saying that you can hold aggro with a 1 hand weapon if you've a Voice of Thule (12% aggro increase).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthious</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of this problem is that EVERY warrior that has said something about not using shields has always said &quot;we lose dps&quot;<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
We still are not about DPS people. Just because you can do over 110DPS now doesn't mean you want to while tanking. If you can hold agro with 125+ hp and insane AC shields there is no reason a tank shouldn't use them imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I dont understand is why people think that the only hate drawn from bash is damage hate.  Bash has a stun component...even if the mob is unstunnable, we are still TRYING to stun him.  Therefore, if you're only pulling 5dps, but trying to stun (for maybe 200 hate), you're looking at a more sizable increase in bashing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, I've heard that you're better off ghetto-bashing with a FB item, which holds aggro better than dual wielding (obviously)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am going to do a test.<br />
<br />
will let someone pull a mob, no taunt no damage, see how effective  bash is to pull off aggro, i honestly think that there is no stun aggro with bashing, DEFINATELY not the kind of aggro a pal gets from stun/ resisted stun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">High DPS = consistant hate generation, which is why BOW is so good, not because it procs so much because it doesn't.<br />
<br />
The reality of it is, FB shields don't make up for the loss of 50+ dps you lose.  And you can just come up with things like bashes generating extra hate because of stuns, but it's not even the same thing as a stun cast, or proc'd, and it wouldn't really matter.<br />
<br />
Shields SHOULD be about trading offensive for defensive, but that isn't the case because the shields don't pick up their end as far as aggro goes, and then the trade off isn't even remotely balanced in that, you lose tremendous dps, but you gain relatively marginal defensive boosts.  Like I lose half of my dps easy when using a shield, but gain what, at most 5% better defensive abilities?<br />
<br />
Again the best solution for shields would be to convert furious bash to innate hate increasing effects, and/or add shielding, so that there are tangible and significant benefits for using them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Losing 50% of your DPS for 5% defensive is perfectly acceptable.  You realize that although you lost 50% of your DPS it amounts to maybe 1% loss of DPS to the entire raid, but on the other hand your raid just gained 5% more defense (since you determine the raid's defense).  <br />
<br />
However marginal the gains are from using a shield, it is still increasing the entire raid's defensive ability which easily outweighs whatever offensive ability is lost.  That's why shields necessarily can't be very good at holding aggro because any raid will gladly give up 5% of its offense for 5% more defense (assuming it's on a mob where defense is meaningful), and in actuality the raid is giving far less offense (you) then the defense it's gaining.  If there's no aggro tradeoff then you will always use a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To put what Coray's saying more simply -- all the defensive boost in the world is irrelevant if you can't get the mob to hit you.<br />
<br />
That said, I get a noticeable boost bashing with my FB4 shield, so I do use it. It's not the end-all be-all, anyone with BF/{BoC,HG} would never need to do that, I think. It was worth the 4 DKP it cost me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Losing 50% of your DPS for 5% defensive is perfectly acceptable.

<br />
Agree on that. But do you realise by gaining 5% defensive.<br />
You just lowered raid DPS by 30-40% ? Because of the Agro issues.<br />
<br />
FB should be a worn effect like Raex BP.<br />
<br />
A shield will give you approx 1-2% more hp (for a 10k warrior).<br />
A shield will give you approx 4% more ac (BoW vs BF/Aegis).<br />
<br />
Lets say these combine , to 4-8% higher survivability.<br />
<br />
Is that worth the 50% lesser agro ?<br />
<br />
PoP Fights are not about staying alive (contrary to the old world)<br />
They are about killing the mob before it kills the MT (Hail 1 round Failed DI)<br />
Because the MT will DIE, even with 100 clerics healing.<br />
<br />
While shields will help the MT stay alive, they will make the fight insanely longer.<br />
Thus are not even worth thinking exept on  special lame ass long fights.<br />
Where killing the mob ASAP is not an isssue : Rathe/Xegony. (i'm not in time).<br />
<br />
As a MT, and often a raid coordinator i prefer having<br />
to tank 4 minutes and hoping for a lucky DI (which is often the case).<br />
Than having to tank 5:30 minutes, because my wiz/necro/magi cant go full burn.<br />
<br />
Killing FAST &gt;&gt;&gt; Staying alive<br />
<br />
Killing FAST = More chances to stay alive<br />
Killing SLOW = More chances for a dead MT<br />
<br />
For the sole reason, that tank survival nowdays is more based<br />
upon luck (which we have ZERO influence) and time<br />
(the more you tank, the higher the % you get 1rounded).<br />
<br />
Shields help you stay alive, but u will kill sooo much slower they<br />
arent even remotely worth the trade.<br />
<br />
You do not loose 5% RAID DPS for 5% tanking.<br />
You loose 30-50% RAID DPS for 4-8% tanking.<br />
THAT IS WRONG.<br />
<br />
I dont give a fuck about my DPS. But i do care about our Nukers.<br />
And if something forces them to lower by 30-40% their DPS.<br />
Then that something is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to stray too far from topic here, but I was always a fan of giving warriors a type of 2h bash -- wielding a 2handed weapon you can wield a shield with it.  BoW + Aegis would probably be overpowered and scaled down a bit, but it sorta makes sense to me to be able to eventually learn to wield a 2handed weapon in one hand.  We can do it in D&amp;D...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless FB gives like 10-70% more aggro for being worn (FB 1-7) you might as well make it effect only procs because you're still giving up the offhand.  <br />
<br />
Although the raid can potentially lose DPS via aggro, when you stack enough defense it becomes almost certain that you will never die.  I know people complained about the marathon Luclin fights but a long fight with virtually no chance of losing is certainly a lot easier than a short fight with a decent chance of losing.  Shields alone aren't enough to put you to a point where failure is impossible but it's getting close.  Although I don't have any FB shield parses handy, it seems like weapon + shield is at least gives workable aggro so it's not like your wizards have to nuke half as much to avoid aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i know some of our wizards complain when its not me (BoW) or the GL (BF/BoC) that does the tanking.<br />
They can not nuke as much.<br />
<br />
BoC/Aegis, hell even BF/Aegis can not compare to BoW agro wise.<br />
<br />
Exept Raperm, i'm having trouble thinking of any non PoT mobs (not in PoT yet).<br />
That are able to 1 round me, hell 2 round me while under disc.<br />
While it remains possible it is very very extremely unlikely.<br />
<br />
When the disc drops, well your time will be up. sooner or later.<br />
<br />
To my mind PoP has become :<br />
You have 180 low risk secs to kill the mob.<br />
After those 180 secs shit will hit the fan, its just a matter of time.<br />
So you'd better get it as low as you can in those 180 sec.<br />
<br />
Ps : Totally Agree low risk long duration SoL fights are LAME<br />
But i doubt there will be enough defence in this expansion<br />
to make death impossible (talking about discless here).<br />
<br />
Atm a warrior under disc is unkillable exept by a huge FLUKE or by Raperm.<br />
(Not counting lag spikes/fizzles etc etc, they are out of the equation)<br />
<br />
Exept of course after 5 months of PoTB farming mudflation.<br />
<br />
Most &quot;fun&quot; PoP minis can 1 or 2 round a Tank with 10Khp easy.<br />
Same for Xegony or Fenin.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't generate enough agro. Nor does it make me so much more survivable that it's worth everyone notching their DPS down by around 40% so that I *can* generate enough agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not saying shield aggro is good.  I&quot;m just saying that if shield aggro is as good as a typical weapon combination, then you'd always use the shield over that combination since the shield combination by definition always has the best tanking stats.  That's why they can't be anywhere as good as the best aggro weapons.  But since aggro is the most important attribute by far,  this leaves them pretty useless.<br />

Although you can always get one rounded in PoP discless, with enough defense I have a pretty high confidence that I will not get one rounded that easily.  Sure it's not going to be like Luclin where you need to somehow go through two rounds without any heals to die, but just because you can die in one round doesn't mean you will.</div></div><hr />

I have a paladin friend with the FB3 shield off Rydda'Dar.  The damn thing glows when he bashes, glows when he casts, glows when his weapon procs, glows when his weapon buff procs.  For warriors it glows only when we bash.  If FB works every time a knight casts, procs, or bashes, why is it so damn hard for the developers to make it work every time a warrior bashes or procs?<br />
<br />
You bash, the effect works, you proc, the effect works, you cast, the effect works, just doesn't seem like a difficult concept to me.<br />
<br />
Perhaps making FB into a 5% per point aggro increaser might work better.  Make it stackable with the visage/voice spell lines.  Sure, +35% aggro when using the FB7 shield might seem huge, but everything else about Elemental/Time gear is so grossly overpowered compared to pre-Elemental gear, why the hell should it matter?</div></div><hr />

This is news to me, and I have a few paladin friends with FB shields. If it IS doing this, then it needs to be the same for us, its the only way that Furious Bash would be beneficial to us.</div></div><hr />

Eb Procs would be affected 700+ 10-70% would be a significant agro jump....<br />

Lets hope it gets fixed.</div></div><hr />

I am not often MT for our raids, but occasionally I get called to do the job and it seems to work just fine aggro-wise.<br />
<br />
Especially with Reparm and other crazy hitting minis, with BF/Aegis I have even been able to step up after a tank switch and keep the mob on me with no problem when I kind of winced and wondered how I was generating aggro.</div></div><hr />
