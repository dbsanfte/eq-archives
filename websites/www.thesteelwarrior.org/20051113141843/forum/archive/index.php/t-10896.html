Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthax</div><div class="date">03-11-2005, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think any PvE instance tank should at least have the following:<br />
<br />
Arms: Deflection<br />
Protection: Shield Spec, Toughness, and one point in Imp. Shield Block.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But there is another further up the protection tree that I highly recomend:<br />
<br />
Improved Shield Bash: This might be my favorite talent.  Casters suck cause they ignore our armor.  A 100% chance for silence (assuming you hit the target) allows us to pull casters from tough spots and stop the big damage or debuffs.  Follow up the bash with a concussion blow and you might get through the fight without the mob getting off a single spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-11-2005, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, imp shield block plus conc blow rule a lot for casters. personally I do not want to give up SS/MS again so soon, but these two talents definitely have their uses on raids.</div></div><hr />

Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
It's a pretty solid plan.<br />
<br />
I see upper protection stuff coming into play more in single group than in raids, where your silence and stuns play more of a role without other people there to cover for you. (I hate trying to stun, just because I use revenge to death, and they're usually immune for me).<br />
<br />
Enemy casters in raids typically get cheapshotted, gouged, silenced etc then beat down so fast they die 5 times before they hit the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am almost full protection specced, so far 5 in fury for cruelty and 9 in arms for parry/tm.  At level 54 I can solo level 52-53 elites, and can solo level 57 mobs, or multiple mobs of my level.  That is using a sword/shield and using shield disc and imp shield block.  The 1H spec helps a lot, and improved revenge is also useful.  Conc blow is useful when soloing casters as is shield bash silence.  If I swap out to dual-wield for dps I can kill mobs faster, and it is much much more effective for green mobs, but it is much less effective for mobs near or above my level and against elites.  I also shine in instances.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I just don't see the upper end protection talents as useless.  How is a 5 sec stun on next attack useless?  How is a 30% hp boost useless, I can not only pop a heal potion, but if I am going down after that I can pop last stand.  How is a 10% dmg bonus to 1H damage useless?  How is a more aggro generation and a reduction in taunt cooldown useless?  How is a discipline that increases the damage blocked by 50%, and increase the damage done and hate generated by shield bash useless?  How is improving sunder armor, one of the best warrior talents, useless?  Sorry, I just don't get it.<br />
<br />
If you go arms/fury you can do more damage.  If you go protection you are better as a sword/board warrior and therefore a better tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agreed with everything until this.  Shield discipline is not worth the rage in its current form.  I have the 30 points necessary in the protection tree that are required to get this top tier talent and I still wanted to spend the one talent point somewhere else.<br />
<br />
The extra damage blocked is barely noticeable and the rage cost of shield disc/shield bash is a very inefficient way to gain aggro.  I would rather bash and sunder.  No problem keeping aggro and get real results from sunder.<br />
<br />
I am happy with the protection tree up until this top talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shield Disc is not an inefficient way to generate threat.  You can get off 2 Shield Bashes within the duration of Disc.  Since Disc increases threat generated by Shield Bash by 100%, that is effectively like getting 4 bashes for the price of 3.5 (10 + 10 + 15) AND you get the added bonus of all that hate being done in half the time.  Since Shield Bash is considered by many to be one of the best threat generating skills we have, I would say that is a significant benefit.<br />
<br />
The rest of the benefits provided by Shield Disc are questionable (a bit more damage dished out, a bit less taken), but it is misleading to say that it is inefficient at gaining threat.</div></div><hr />

Concussion blow is usually under diminishing returns when you use it, either from revenge chain stun, or from rogues, or hell, even a charge.  If it's not under diminishing returns, the mob is immune.<br />
<br />
Last stand is lower protection.  It's pretty much trash on raids (Spike damage is what kills you),  but good for every other single situation.<br />
<br />
Taunt is useful on mobs that are designed to evade aggro.  The boosted damage from 1h is nice, although sadly the other trees make up for the lack of boosted aggro through increased damage.  <br />
<br />
Improved sunder adds 3-5% more damage overall from what i've seen in most cases.  If it's a mob that has low enough armor to where it'll get more of an increase than that.. it also has low hp and is dead by the time you're even partially sundered.<br />
<br />
Shield spec is pretty good as a taunt, I think it's probably the best talent in the upper tree for hate keeping.<br />
<br />
It's not that upper protection is useless, it's that fury or arms are more useful.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that Imp. Sunder is changing on the next patch.  Still might be useful, but just something to think about.</div></div><hr />

I see your point and I had shield discipline for a long time working off of the above logic, but in practice it just doesn't seem practical.<br />
<br />
Our primary ability for holding aggro is revenge.  I want to be able to fire off that 5 rage skill every time it lights up.  In order two use shield discipline and quickly get off a bash, I need 25 rage.  We need to work fast on that first bash to get off a second in the 20 second time frame.<br />
<br />
Maybe the numbers disagree with me, but I hated holding off on my rage to guarantee an immediate bash follow up to the discipline.  I would rather spam revenge at every opportunity.<br />
<br />
I would really like to see this talent get bumped up to a 30 second duration to give me a little more freedom in my rage usage while still taking advantage of the improved shield bash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Practicality is another matter entirely.  It is NOT very practical to use, and I usually don't use it unless I'm doing a boss.  I would be happy, like many others, if this became a less effective, permanent talent.  As it stands, it is really only useful for a small percentage of what I do.</div></div><hr />
