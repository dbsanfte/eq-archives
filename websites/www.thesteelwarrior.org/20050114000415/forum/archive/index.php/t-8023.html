Level up, keep saving pp, farm some ornate in BoT, once ya hit level 65 re-evaluate gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">felicitation, it has been a long time since a saw a full myrmidon suit. it's rare nowaday to put so much time into it. <br />
as above I would suggest to jsut go on your way, your not that bad right now. just augment your weapons and head to BoT and LoDN. after getting to 65 you should have sone ornate and/or lodn geras (damn I can't never remember their names).<br />
note that your intricate wooden figurine with the adv augment will greatly improove your toon when you will have it (or did you jsut forgot to put it in your magelo? or maybe you don't have all the expensions?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Druunk Decerto</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick responces. To answer a few things; No I don't have all the expansions. I do not have GoD and just bought LDON for this account. I have only done 3 adventures so I have a long way to go. I also am guildless as my main was in an Elemental Guild, but I just don't have the time to raid for 5 hours a day 5 days a week.<br />
<br />
I think my main thing now is to try to get more LDON's to get my weapons aug'd since I have problems keeping aggro in PoV when slow or CH hits. <br />
<br />
thanks again<br />
