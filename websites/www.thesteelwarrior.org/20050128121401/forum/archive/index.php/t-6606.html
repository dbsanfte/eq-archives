Background:  I'm the SA for a mid-level raiding guild.  We're doing things like mid-level Ssra, Tier 1/2 PoP bosses, AoW and the like at present.  Right now I'm using an auged GBoS and a (soon to be auged) BoC.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about either buying a BBoE or an Orb of Sky.  I'm on FV, and they run about 400k and 300k respectively.  My guild is not very focused on VT at the moment, and it is also fairly contested, so I doubt we'll be heading there anytime soon.  Seems like the Orb would add about 2ppm, while the BBoE would add about 1.3ppm (correct?).  I'd effectively be spending the same amount of money, since I could sell the GBoS for a decent amount since it is augged.  Obviously getting both would be nice, but I only have the scratch to afford one or the other for now.<br />
<br />
Any resounding reasons to pick one over the other?<br />
<br />
My one reservation about the Orb is the cast time/duration of the effect.  Is the aggro it generates worth the hassle/cost?<br />

<br />
I play on Firiona Vie, where very little is NO DROP.  The GBoS is not NO DROP, so it could be sold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one as well and I concur with Zynth.  If I am pulling(I tend to pull for all my Vxed/Tipt groups which is where I xp nowadays), or I have a good chain puller, or we have to move alot, ect. then I don't get to use the orb very much.  Lately I've just been clicking it at the begginning of a group, and from that point on I will only make time to click it for named just for that extra agro umph.  That said, I click it any chance I get that doesn't slow the group down.  Its a nice item, but the cast time is very prohibitive to regular use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.  In my exp groups, I'm typically not pulling, but it's almost always chain pulls.  It seems like even though the BBoE would make less visible impact. it may be the best choice.  Since I will never realistically see a Bloodfrenzy, a BBoE + BoC should keep me going for a while.<br />

Thanks for the responses.<br />

Why not? Is cursed that contested on your server? Aren't you currently raiding at that level according to your original post?<br />
<br />
And hey, what about Hategiver? That's got to be something within your grasp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cursed is EXTREMELY contested as far as I know.  There are 3 guilds which hotly compete for the cycle, and it's been months since my guild has even been able to catch all the needed mobs up to start it.  Additionally, Ssra/Luclin is not really a priority for the guild right now, and we've been doing PoP for the most part, so our Ssra raiding comes second.<br />
<br />
We could do Cursed if we caught it up, but it seems unlikely that we will, considering those factors.<br />
<br />
Hategiver is a possibility, as XtC is not (I think) as contested.  The priority of PoP over Ssra would still come into play here, however.<br />
<br />
It may be that the BoC (+A3) and GBoS (+A3) will be close enough aggro-wise to not worry about buying something else.<br />

<br />
In theory, yes.  In practice, I have never actually seen a Bloodfrenzy for sale in the bazaar, and only seen one purchased through the boards.  Even if one was for sale, I suspect I'd not have the 800-1000k required to purchase it.<br />
<br />
I believe I will hang onto the cash and wait for opportunity to come my way, as it were.<br />

Problem is though is that they're just too damn rare.  =(</div></div><hr />
