<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to compile information for The Library. I want to figure out or END regen and current pool. I will start:<br />
<br />
EDIT** All testing done by me, with poor math skills and oddball theories. Times taken using /time command in game and a UI with % instead of a yellow bar.<br />
<br />
Dex/Sta/Str/Agi all effect END Pool.<br />
 Theory1: 1 stat point in any of the above = 2.5 END.<br />
Theory2: END Regen Standing = 28~ per tick<br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
All studies below consist of me, naked.<br />
<br />
Naked END Regen from 0% - 100% 5m42s = 57 ticks<br />
Incite = 250end 		Berate = 200end<br />
Naked Incite = 15 %	Naked Berate = 12%<br />
250/15= 16.67		200/12= 16.67<br />
Naked 1%= 16.67 END<br />
Naked 100%=1667 END<br />
<br />
Naked regen time = <br />
1667 / 57= 29.25 end/tick naked regen<br />
<br />
Studies done fully dressed<br />
<br />
Dressed regen = 8m46s = 88 ticks<br />
Incite = 10%		Berate = 8%<br />
250/10=25		200/8= 25<br />
Dressed 1%= 25 END<br />
Dressed 100%= 2500 END<br />
<br />
Dressed Regen Time = 8m46s = 526sec = 88 ticks<br />
2500/88= 28.4 regen/tick<br />
<br />
=====<br />
Checking Magelo my base modifiers from gear for melee stats are:<br />
str 76<br />
sta 94<br />
agi 68<br />
dex 95<br />
<br />
Now, using those as the difference from me being naked and buffed, the total value is 333 stat points.<br />
Dressed END = 2500, Naked END 1667. A difference of 833 END.<br />
833END / 333stat points = 2.5 END per Stat Point.<br />
<br />
Theory: Disc defensive uses 1800 end over time, but combated by 28 regen a tick for 30 ticks should = 960 cost.<br />
<br />
Test Result:<br />
/disc defensive Used 35~% dressed END. Which at my current 25end per 1% = 980. Give or take a tick that is</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that ALL melee stats (STR,DEX,STA,AGI) affect the size of your endurance pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taliefer</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, just played around some<br />
<br />
incite uses 250E, accordingf the list of your abilites(hit the little s on the combat abilities box, it lists all costs initially and pertick(upkeep) )<br />
<br />
when i used incite, it used 8% of my endurance pool. my stats are all maxed unbuffed at 305, so if my math is correct, the MAX endurance pool atm for a 65 warrior, or at least MY pool, is 3125E.<br />
<br />
<br />
when i used incite with ALL my armor off, buffless, it used 12%. so my Epool was 2083. naked stats are str 100, sta 92, dex 95, agi 85.<br />
<br />
i regened about 1% every 2 ticks, sometiems itd go up every tick, sometimes took 2, so.<br />
<br />
i have no idea if its one stat or all of them taht effect endurance however</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My max endurance with my gear on was 3125 also.  I used incite to test it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 305sta 305str 144 agi and 225 dex and incite uses about 9% End so that comes up to 2778 rounded up. so agi dont have much affect on it i think and dex is close maybe it is all dex.<br />
<br />
But it may scale wierd since 225/305 = 73% and 2778/3125 = <br />
89%<br />
<br />
edit= the calculation is all whacked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I noticed while I was trioing in velks that whenever Infusion of Spirit wore was re-cast on me, my Endurance bar got bigger.<br />
<br />
So, something on IoS is increasing the size of the endurance pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well my calculation came up with 2177 and with no gear on as i added gear your hps and endurace would drop b same % almost so i though hey ill look at modifers on magelo well closest thing i found was my hps modifiers pure hps which was 2167 but then i looked on magelo of some posters above and umm didnt fit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK take any item off with dex on it and put it back on changes pool. Now take off say umm Boots of the storm or seru bp (no Dex items) and put them on youll see no effect to your pool. So definately the stat is based on dex but to say how much without hard numbers is hard to tell so much room for error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaoraEci</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the upkeep is per SECOND. I watched the bar and watched it drop every second. It would almost make sense since a stone wall is almost half of your bar.<br />
<br />
Would make Defensive cost 1800 and Stonewall 1980, as well as Healing Will 1980. If we use the upkeep per tick, it comes out near the cost of an Incite and by using incite, you can tell that 250 on your bar is not a lot.</div></div><hr />

Same disc took 5 ticks to regen to full while standing.<br />

So roughly 50/tick regen sitting and 40/tick standing.</div></div><hr />

If you chain 4 disc with Incite, you are low on END but of course you have no discipline to use for 30 minutes :p.<br />
<br />
I wonder however if this pool will be enough when they'll add the opening system...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And with a 211ish stm (Magelo is off due to Intricate Wooden Figureen) using the 250 incite was 10% of my end. (Since I was only grouped with an enchanter and druid, my stats were not that different from what they appear in the my magelo.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With str, sta, dex in the upper 200s and agi in the upper 100s, Incite used 8% for me.  Took me 9 ticks to regen that 250 while standing, 7 ticks to regen while sitting which is much lower than the 50/per and 40/per of one of the previous posters.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we regen a percentage per tick rather than a set number???  I dunno, I haven't tested it much.<br />
<br />
Yeah, upkeep is definitely a per second cost as I found out while watching Healing Will blow through my Endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The endurance pool is solely based of Dex from what I can gather. Take for example eru bp off or Tormax boots and put them back on it does not affect endureance pool. Now take an item with just dex on it (Gloves of warding here with dex aug) and replace it it will affect your endurance pool. Last find a shammy and get just str/sta/agi/dex buffs in that order and none should affect your pool cept the dex buff</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regen is the same sitting/standing, but is 2/3 when auto attack is on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
im thinking the total pool is calculated from a mish mash of all melee stats, but most of my gear has multiple stat effects...so i guess the only way to test it would be go naked and have a shaman cast single stat buffs one at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: just read kahvlok or whatever his name is, the EQ dev, on a thread in the arena, confirms taht E pool is based on all 4 melee stats</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont agree with the first part of this statement at all....this system is GREAT, regardless of wether they fix knightemization or not. <br />
<br />
i agree doing something to balance itemization would be nice, but i think this new melee system is working out great regardless of wether they do or not</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the matter of itemization, stats simply cant be the only part of the equation. Its stupid. There is a reason why time items for casters have more mana on them then items from lower guk and thats because the people using them deserve to be more powerful. As it stands its almost impossible for a warrior in bazaar gear to NOT max all melee stats with buffs on. There is virtually no differentiation between melee of various tiers of the game in this system and it needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With maxc raid buffs, yes.<br />
<br />
Without, no.<br />
<br />
And there is a difference there.<br />
<br />
&quot;IF&quot; that warrior maxced his stat AA, and &quot;IF&quot; that warrior went for all the stat augs, then perhaps. But getting maxc STR / STA / DEX in bazaar gear is a little harder than you seem to think.<br />
<br />
But itemization is still whacky, but no need to make some far fetched statements to support that claim.<br />
<br />
Hell, I dont max out any stat unbuffed, and I am in better than bazaar gear.<br />

Hmmm,<br />
Didn't the Devs specificly, several times at least now, that the END pool is based on all your core stats, str, dex,agil, sta.<br />

if i would see them as common as Pal Shd Weapons who start to Decay because everyone of the 20 pallys n sks in my guild has them already this game would come to a point where i could say its balanced. Vs the 6 warriors and noone has a Bloodfrenzy BoW and so on .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I didn't have stat buffs on was when I needed to have other buffs in thier place.<br />
<br />
When you cannot max out your stats unbuffed, it is very hard to have Guard of Druzil, PoS, Charisma buff, DI, BoV, and all the other sometimes essential buffs on.<br />
<br />
If I could avoid getting the stamina and agility buffs I could use them two slots much more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Now, pre-patch dropping an agility buff for something else, like say, a resist buff, charisma, or in some cases a levitate or whatnot was not a big deal. Now that agility has an added bonus to it, the decision sure is harder to make.<br />
<br />
I am not saying it is perfect right now, I personally think there should be no hard cap. However, there is certainly an advantage to being maxed unbuffed at the moment, just not as much of one as maybe there should be.<br />
<br />
By the way, with better than bazaar gear, my agility with wrulan is 211, and my dex with focus is 229. Only way I have seen my dex maxed, it involved NDT.<br />

I use Virtue 95% of the time.<br />

Still run out of buff slots.<br />

If I think I may need DI, and on top of that the MOB procs/casts debuffs on me I am severely limited in my buffing choices.<br />

<br />
The difference between time/elemental warriors and their non-raiding counterparts is already incredibly huge.  I don't think every new thing that comes out must increase this difference.  Disciplines have always been gear independent...I'm not sure why this needs to change significantly.  (and, yes, it has changed some now...not all of us max all 4 melee stats - even with buffs...and I'm still losing buff slots that could go for other things like hp and resists)</div></div><hr />

Whats bad if you grow stronger trought itemization ...<br />
<br />
Take Hybrids give them Baz gear then give them vt <br />
raise in power can be great ...especially with 600dd spells who need mana and with ft15 ...you can cast them unlimited ...to meeleing ...and add in every other type of damage / stun / heals / slows / utility .<br />

wtf eq is all about upgrades as a war monk rogue you can currently just put on haste and vengeance items wich is by far not like a Hybrids ability to equip vengeance and ft / mana to grow even stronger ...</div></div><hr />

Regen looks to be about 5.6/5.7 a sec depending on rounding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabon Ssteel</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If regen is 5.6 per second thats around 34 endurance regen per TICK ...and if they give us 1 regen more endurace per TICK with GoD ...like they give 1 Mana more per TICK with aa...(whats the standing mana regen without ft or mana regen spells ? ) i guess not 34 ...<br />
<br />
wich aa has more uses ? ...<br />
a mana regen aa who boots 17 mana regen per tick standing to 20 ...<br />
<br />
or a endurance aa who boosts a 34 endurance regen per tick to 37...<br />
<br />
<br />
is mana regen and endurance regen worth the same per point ?</div></div><hr />

Test it by watching hp regen, it ups per tic. Now notice that your endurance % changes at the same time the HP tic goes through.<br />
<br />
As far as the regen aa, I don't think it is very significant, but since when has that stopped a warrior from buying/looting/doing anything? I will take whatever advantage offered, even if I grumble while using it. Any amount of regen is better than none. I do however wish they would open up some LDoN Endurance Regen items. It is something needed and it would further people's addiction to LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Upkeep is the Endurance over time that you spend on a disc.  So, while defensive, your endurance bar keeps going down as, each second, defensive &quot;costs&quot; what its upkeep value is (which I don't remember).<br />
<br />
60 seconds of defensive costs 1/3 of what 180 seconds of defensive costs.  Some of our discs have a burst cost, some have upkeep costs, and (I think) some have  a mix of both endurance pool drains.  To put it another way, something with an upkeep cost of 100 will cost 100 Endurance after 1 second, 200 End. after 2 seconds, 300 after 3 seconds, and so on.<br />
<br />
EDIT :: As per Wompem Ondahed's correction, I've replaced &quot;ticks&quot; with &quot;seconds&quot;.</div></div><hr />
