Cheer for the cleric that was nice enough to notice the once uber tank now a relic of the past....</div></div><hr />

If I wouldn't have the time and oppurtunity to be in a raiding guild I would have quit this game long ago. Always feel like crap when I zone into PoV and go LFG when there's some unguilded warrior 3 lvl lower who's been sitting there LFG for 2 hours...</div></div><hr />

<br />
it really is a nice story there; makes ya wonder sometimes about how much more the game actually can be when it doesn't revolve around number crunching and overall l33tness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya know I fall into that category although not quite to the degree that the warrior in his story does. I have had my account three years and my Warrior has always been my main. Currently I am only level 53 which tells you how much I play. The only upside to this story is that I am in a guild with a bunch of good people. I get guild groups and have been consistently upgrading my equipment. I will probably never be an Uber Tank but hell I play the game for fun and to enjoy the company of the people I play with. It is good to know that some people out there feel the same way even if you are not Uber.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in Karnors the other day on my rogue and a warrior had been LFG for a long time. My group had room in it, it was a pickup group and there was a 60 druid sitting on the side to PL us. Exp was rolling in. So I say to invite the warrior, we got 2 spots open, to which they said &quot;hell no, did you see his equipment?&quot;. So I hit the hide/sneak button and sure enough the guy had a yakesha and a PGT with various pieces of crafted and bronze armour. The guy had been around before kunark came out and was pretty uber back then, had restarted his account a couple times but didn't play too much and was just looking to have some fun, and no one would group with him. So I asked my group again to let him join and they said no, so I dropped group and logged on the cleric, gave him a few of my twinks items and PLed him for a couple hours.  <br />
<br />
i think i want to go to that server and hug that cleric 100 times.</div></div><hr />

Then again I been getting groups pretty fast when I want them. Maybe because I dont hold out for the &quot;uber group&quot; that some warriors want. Then again it might be that rather large RNG in the sky might be rolling in my favor latley.</div></div><hr />

<br />
guys like this are the reason i still play.  It proves there are still some nice people out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vamcoy hits on another good point.  What's with people giving the third degree now when you try and get them to fill a spot in your group?  &quot;What Classes you got?&quot;  &quot;Who's healer?  What Level?&quot;  &quot;What level is slower?&quot;<br />
<br />
WTF?!  I ask &quot;You want in a CCY group?&quot; or &quot;You want in a PoN yard group&quot;  should be enough in most cases.<br />
<br />
sorry for hijack, just my pet peeve and people were difficult last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lhostee Chulain</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amen to that! Luckily enough, I have never had all that much trouble with gear, having high level friends and such to help me out. I do remember, though, when I transfered my cleric from Cazic Thule to Sol Ro (To play with my bro) and was wearing some bronze and blackened alloy and the like. I had around 150wis, at level 44, and I could not ever get a group.<br />
<br />
Even with a lot of groups that had all they needed, a slot open, they wouldn't let me join.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">could i ask a favor of my fellow warriors? send SoE's QA team that link over and over again, or write them a nasty letter of complaint.<br />
<br />
 i saw bards, wizards and rangers going thru all the everquest forms and calling for this, and then the next day there was a patch to change them back to the way they were. also i would like to ask the peps around here to push the idea that all classes should have this new skill in a expantion <br />
<br />
i call it resting, it gives casters and melees 6 extra ticks of hit point and mana regen, but the down side is the effect of drowy when you get up is cast on you or when your sleep is interupted as well as the players AC is /2 while sleeping. if we state that it is not for soloing and just for group down time, as well as it will never replace a fast CH i think we could get this put in EQ i know its sorta off topic but id like to see us sticking togeather to get change for the better, this is one of the last good warrior boards left<br />

My 64 Warrior just got repped by a 61 Pally in PoV cause I couldnt hold aggro with FB and FG.  <br />
<br />
The group was dumb yes, but we shouldnt be penalized for that when Pallies arent.</div></div><hr />
