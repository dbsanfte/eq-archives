<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torfinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 51 Warrior returning to the fight, with about 12k cash to spend. Essentially what I'm trying to decide is whether to go with aggro-grabbing weapons (Bloodsworn, Frosty, Snowchipper), pick up some better armor, or a combination of the two?  Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If i were in your shoes, I'd get a Copper Hammer of Striking, and keep your snare whip in offhand.  That will set you up pretty well for keeping agro.  Then, I'd spend whatever pp I had left on starting to upgrade gear.  Use Allakhazam's, or this website http://www.cardplace.com/eq/config/config.cgi?class=Warrior to see what's available for you in the way of upgrades.  See what you can find in the bazaar for upgrades, and always upgrade to the highest level you can, even if it means only doing 1 piece at a time.  I would concentrate on upgrading accessories such as earrings, rings, face, etc. in the bazaar.  Armour slots such as BP, bracers, legs, etc., you can upgrade by hitting Kael with a group or 2, or HoT if you are in a guild that can put 2-3 decent groups together.  As well, grind out LDoN adventures for the points towards some really nice gear, as well as the extra stats on your adventure stone.  If you can get a couple of groups together, go and hit veksar, lots of nice upgrades there.  Also, if you can get those 2 groups together, then you can also go and camp the CHoS as well as the SotBs for yourself.<br />

Hope this helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">stay away from straight dd procs like snowchipper ... the aggro on them sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd think about farming veksar for some upgrades to your visible gear.  And I'd definitely think about getting some better gauntlets and put your haste on your waist or your back.  Soulscream belt is not a terribly tough camp with a full group(if you can find it uncamped)  :)<br />
<br />
Failing that, get a good aggro weapon like a CHoS and level your ass off.</div></div><hr />
