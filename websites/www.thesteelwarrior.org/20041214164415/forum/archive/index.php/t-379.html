I'm curious of the effect it has with aa's.  I have CA3, PE, and LR3.  I think I can notice a difference when my Agility is at 280, than at 190, but every one I've spoken to says its my imagination, that Agi has no bearing on AA's or a noticable difference in damage avoided.  So, what I'm asking is 1) Is having a higher Agi effective in taking less melee damage through avoidance, or does your Agi score make no difference?  2) does your Agi score effect your combat damage avoidance AA's?  <br />
<br />
To me, it only makes sense that the score would affect both, but it's definately not the first time my noggin has taken me in the wrong direction.<br />

<br />
Yes, shamans did alot of research on it like 2 years ago. Agility affects mitigation only and only in the amount that it raises your AC (7agil =1 ac iirc).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocalypse</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, the only actual research was done 2 years ago by shaman? And no one has tested it since?<br />
But everyone agrees that it's still true concerning normal avoidance.  <br />
<br />
But what about avoidance AA skills?  Has anyone looked at this? Does having an Agi of 305 have any effect over having an agi of 75 (besides the normal 1 ac to 7 Agi AC) concerning AA's like CA3, PE, and LR3? <br />
<br />
And if everyone says its unimportant, why the hell do monks value agi so much?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are missinformed.  If agi did what the eq manual says, then it would definately be something that fit in with monks.<br />
<br />
From my eq manual:<br />
....affects your probability of being hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit.... <br />
<br />
But the tests did prove otherwise.<br />
I was told that the devs had mentioned that they would have to retune all mobs to make it work right, so they won't, but I've seen no proof of the devs saying so, so take it with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess avoidance and mitigation AAs are based on your own avoidance and mitigation scores( so on your avoidance AC from agi, and mitigation AC for buffs / items ). <br />
so yes getting agi allow more return from avoidance AA, as getting AC items help for your mitigation AAs</div></div><hr />

Re: On determining AC<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok I finished the agility table. <br />
Here's the full formula for AC: <br />
<br />
Avoidance = (T from table) + trunc(Defense * 16/9), but never less than 0 <br />
Caster Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/3) + trunc(Defense/2) + (Equipment + 1) <br />
Anyone else's Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/4) + trunc(Defense/3) + trunc(Equipment * 4/3) <br />
Displayed AC = trunc( (Avoidance + Mitigation) * 1000 / 847 ) <br />
<br />
Caster means Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Wizard. <br />
Defense is the character's Defense skill. <br />
Equipment is just the sum total of the raw AC from everything worn. Don't forget the range slot. <br />
Buffs is the sum of the bonuses from all buffs. You'd have to check your spdat file to see those numbers, but for reference Skin Like Wood adds 15 and Skin Like Nature adds 55. <br />
T comes from the agility table below, use the column corresponding to the character's level. <br />
trunc means truncate, to remove the fraction; keep only the integer part of the value. <br />
<br />
Some qualifications: Iksars get a bonus, I'm not sure how much but I suspect it might be adding (Level - 1) to Mitigation. The formula hasn't actually been tested on Beastlords or Vah Shir yet. The formula doesn't work for monks because of the weight limit thing, but it should work if they keep their weight under the limit. There is a 'never less than 0' issue with Mitigation too, but it only matters if you get hit with an AC debuff while wearing little or no equipment... it won't affect most people. The formula doesn't work right if your character has been drinking but it works in every other situation, including illusions, hunger, thirst, drowning, encumbered, low health, low stamina, stacked buffs and debuffs, and resurrection sickness. I have no proof that these are the actual Avoidance and Mitigation values, there isn't even any proof that Avoidance and Mitigation are ever used seperately in actual combat calculations... I just know that the first few factors are rounded up to 0 and are the same for all classes, so it seemed like a sensible division. <br />
<br />

(Korak)My own personal observations:<br />
Agility does not add to the &quot;mitigation&quot; portion of AC. So, in theory, it should allow you to avoid more hits. The mitigation portion being factored into an equation to determin n=1to20 in the DB+(1-20)DI, and the avoidance being factored into an equation to determine if you are hit. I believe the special skill checks (block/parry/dodge/riposte) are done sepatately and distinct from either of the other two computations. I can't link anything, but iirc testing has shown that riposte rates were constant regardless of mob. I really wish the two numbers were still displayed separately as that would allow for easier analysis. With carefully controlled and recorded tests (and a bit of math) it could be determined what effect agility has on hit rate. I suspect it is rather small, on the order of 1% in significance, since you are only talking about a 25pt increase in avoidance AC for going from 75agi to 240+ (unknown to me how it scales after 255). Therefore, situations might dictate that there are better uses for your buff slots. I still have too many other goals in the game to pursue such testing. Perhaps someone else will take up the banner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undafut</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Edit: Revamped the table.  Table now shows the AC you get by having your Agility at a certain point, without all the messy AGI factor stuff.  <br />
<br />
AC from Agility. (http://www.users.qwest.net/~taleisin/pages/AC%20from%20AGI.htm).<br />
<br />
As a f'rinstance, my usual agility is currently 103, so 53 points of my AC comes from having a decent agility.   <br />
<br />
My local supershaman is kind enough to buff my agility by 60 points.  <br />
<br />
At 163 Agi, I get 66 points of AC from my agility, for a net 13 point increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my own tests:<br />
<br />
I took a ranger, warrior, and monk for these tests. They were all lvl 65 and had LR 5 and CA 3. There was also a lvl 65 monk and warrior - neither had any LR or CA. All were tested at 200 210 215 220 225 230 235 240 245 250 255 260 265 270 275 280 285. The test mob was the mist panther in WL.<br />
<br />
Looking at the data, there was no significant difference in the avoidance % between the warrior and the monk without the CA or the LR. That was expected because they guy on the shaman forum wrote that agility didnt do anything and he put lots or numbers and such on the board - so you know it true.<br />
<br />
The strange thing was that as agility raised the avoidance actually declined - over the above range it decreased by 12.4% and in a linear fashion. The other odd thing was that as although the avoidance decreased, the overall DPS from the mob decreased 7% from 200 agi to 255 agi. There was no further decrease in DPS from that point. Upon reviewing the logs - it was the mitigation that increased and not the avoidance.<br />
<br />
So we came up with this forumla:<br />
<br />
Mitigation = Avoidance % (agi with full armor + agi with 1000 copper coins)/(time spent in PoT)^3 - AC/(DPS from the mob) + 14.4<br />
<br />
That gave us the exact percentage of time a successful hit would mitigate - not the number it would mitigate - that was solved with this formula:<br />
<br />
percentage of mitigation = (level of combined alternate character/100) - (agi with stamina below 100 and with the stamina bar empty) (hours played per week/raw charisma) + (int/wis)<br />
<br />
So there you have it. I hope this answers all your questions.</div></div><hr />
