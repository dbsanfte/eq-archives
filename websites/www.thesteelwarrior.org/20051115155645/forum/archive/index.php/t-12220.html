<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmane</div><div class="date">07-14-2005, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For tanking which wins out the +13 Def, 5 stamina and 12 Str or the +252 AC and 35 FR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">07-14-2005, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends what you're tanking.   The armor on the dark iron puts it ahead of +13 def probably in terms of overall reduction... however it dosen't do jack against spike damage, the real killer.<br />
<br />
So I would say..<br />
<br />
Anything that spits fire.. or if you have enough defense.. Dark iron<br />
<br />
Anything else.. Enchanted Thorium</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmane</div><div class="date">07-14-2005, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Enchanted Thorium Helm and Bracer of Valor. Someone told me I should make DI Helm rather then make DI Bracer as its a bigger upgrade. But If I replace the Valor Bracer I would gain 150ish Armor and 18 FR (Over half of what the helm would give me), and I would still have the +13 Def.  My Stamina would stay about even which ever way I went... lose 7 switching the bracer or lose 5 switching the helm, but I would have more strength. So I think for me the Dark Iron Bracer is the better replacement. Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">07-14-2005, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. it's sorta like this.   Fire gear -sucks- for most other uses other than resisting fire damage, and tanking fire/melee mobs.  That and looking cool is the only reason to have it.  There is better pieces availible that are easier to get, and have more useful stats in general.<br />
<br />
Given the choice between the 2, the DI helm is a much better upgrade requiring signifcantly less materials.  In your case, the bracer may be a &quot;wiser&quot; overall upgrade option, but it still hurts in terms of cores/dark iron, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">07-14-2005, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to follow that line of thought. DI helm is a tad better than my helm when it comes to mitigation for example, but I won't use it full time because my DI helm gets the fire resistance libram where my normal helm gets the hp libram. DI helm doesn't compare to helm of wrath or helm of might, which you should have access too with time once you can start getting the mats for DI helm. Pop an FR libram on the DI helm and make it resist gear, aim for other gears as your normal gear.</div></div><hr />
