<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladd</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got out of a BB ldon run normal difficulty . Group consisted of myself , ench . clr , necro , ranger , and zerker.<br />
I had my hands full trying to keep agro especially from the necro he was nuking a fair amount though im not sure how heavy he was going on the dots or sitting after sending pet or anything like that . But it was not easy trying to keep things pasted to me using provoke , taunt , disarm.<br />
Early today in POJ i was keeping mobs on me without any issue really so i was curious if this is a ldon &quot;feature&quot; , bad string on the random number generator , or do i simply just suck ?<br />
Ive never really had much hassle keeping agro until tonight and have done quite a few Ldons before but mostly at lower levels. I think the last ldon I did was at lvl 45 or so.<br />

Err the obligatory gear link so you know what im working with<br />

Did he FD at all?  I often group with a necro with my shaman for LDoN's and he never pulls aggro from the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anheg</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. I grouped with a necro that would dot right away or slow right away and sit to get mana. Duhhhh  then would complain I couldn't Keep aggroe.  I have found if I am given 5 to 10 seconds at the beggining of the fight I'll hold aggroe no matter who is in the group.  But if I loose that initial aggroe period I will fight to get half the aggroe the rest 0of the fight when sks, necros ,etc are in the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they dot heavily early and sit they will get aggro no matter what I do.<br />
<br />
If they do it enough times I just let the mob go after them.</div></div><hr />

Trouble is it's reckless and dangerous to do so, A smart Necro will always FD after High aggro Dot's and/or snares land, in order to lose aggro it takes 1 second to cast &quot;Death Peace&quot; with spell haste, plus it ensures that the Melee are not running around trying to grab aggro back again.<br />
No lvl 64 plus Necro should need to sit down in normal LDoN adventures, A Necro's Stood up Mana regen from &quot;Seduction of Saryn&quot; is usually more than enough to take care of things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladd</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies folks , makes me feel a bit better. Have a shaman main myself so i full well understand the agro power dots have especially poison line and to answer the question about FDing , no never once did i see him FD or the so and so dies msg.<br />
Ive never played a necro myself ,well at least not past lvl 4 so i wasnt sure if the fault laid with me or if he was a little too happy to show the power of his new lvl 49 spells =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not so much a feature of LDoN as it is the nature of an indoor dungeon.  People have been doing the sitting on the horse in the outdoor zones thing so much they've forgotten that if they sit to med, especially shortly after casting a high aggro spell, they're going to get kicked in the teeth by the mob.  I'm dualwielding anger aug'd chos and sotb, and it still happens to me if someone gets careless.  (although at this point it tends to be more because the group has gotten comfortable enough with my aggro that they start pushing the envelope a bit too much)  <br />
<br />
Also, sounds like that necro needs to learn to manage his/her aggro a bit better.  It used to really bother me if someone pulled aggro off me, but with me using every trick in the book, and swinging 2 weapons with 2 aggro procs each, now if someone gets eaten I usually can chalk it up to either too many resisted tash/malo/slow kind of spells which nobody can help, or to someone having a head up the ass moment, which can still happen no matter how good your aggro setup is.  As Mokor's custom title says: Idiots &gt; Aggro.</div></div><hr />
