<br />
Conventional wisdom used to be that when working up a badly lagged weapon skill, that skill-ups were harder to come by the farther away you were from your current max.  My own experience bore that out. <br />
<br />
The last time I had to work up a bad skill was maybe a year and a half to two years ago - I was in my low 40's and working up 2HS from a skill of 20.  It was agony at first, and took many hours of beating on other peoples mobs to get it to 140 or so, after which it went considerably more quickly (I should note that I was often beating on yellow or red mobs at that time).   Once I got to within 20 points of max, it went very quickly. <br />
<br />
My dex back then was probably not as good as it is now, but I knew enough to get dex buffs and it was at least decent - maybe in the 130 to 140 range.<br />
<br />
Well, I just dinged 55 and while I had been looking forward to finally using a GSoT, I was dreading working up my neglected 2HB, which was at 47.   In the last two days I've managed to squeeze in about an hour and 45 minutes of working it up, all on dark blue mobs, and I've gotten 70 points!  My buffed dex has ranged between 170 and 200 during that time. <br />
<br />
I'm sure not complaining about that, but what does surprise me is that last night I did an LDoN group - I spent 45 minutes of it using the GSoT and got 25 skill ups in 2HB.  I spent 45 minutes of it dual-wielding 2 fast  1HS and got 2 skill-ups in 1HS (first time I used them since levelling). <br />
<br />
So, has this all changed?  Does it not make a difference any more how many points you are below your current max?  Or did the extra 50 or so points of Dex just make that much of a difference? (seems unlikely that that could account for it all).   I feel like I've been worrying over nothing - at a similar rate, I should be able to take a couple of 1HB's and have my skill over 200 in about an hour (currently it's.... 5). <br />
<br />
And the other thing is - do skill-ups get harder to come by the more you get them above 200?  I really hadn't been paying that close attention to how my skills have been going up in the last few levels - I knew they got maxed by the time I dinged but didn't notice how long it took.  I was surprised last night by the relative few skill-ups in 1HS.</div></div><hr />

Your offense and double attack/dual wield skill rates are through the roof compared to when you were a newbie.  Throw in the fact that your probably running at the haste cap in a good group and your dex is buffed big time and skill ups become trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been working up my long neglected Bash skill.  I found a new Hotbuttons UI that has primary/secondary slots and all 8 bag slots.  I keep my shield in an empty bag slot and ghetto swap it in when bash refreshes.  I've gone from a skill of 30ish to 125 fairly fast.  Helps a ton in LDoN when you get a cleric/druid mob.    Nothing worse than pulling a healer mob with 2 mins to go and you need 3 more kills to win a slaughter 60 and the mob gets off 3 CH's before you get a lucky streak of bashes.</div></div><hr />
