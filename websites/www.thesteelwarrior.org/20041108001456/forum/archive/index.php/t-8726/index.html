<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With oow a few weeks away, I imagine that this post is a bit late, but I'm finding it particulary frustrating that there exists no upgrade path for aggro weapons in gates for non raiders (non guilded as well).<br />
<br />
Myself and my group of friends have been steadily progressing through gates as much as we can via the single group content, and have been getting some good upgrades.  We are currently doing Ikkinz1 over and over to try to gear up our group with the PA + random named loot.  The overall progress hasnt been fast by any means, it has been very difficult for us, but it is progress.  Not to mention it has been a blast, there are only two items that I own that I were not 'earned' (aow hat, stonewood bow, bazaar bought).<br />
<br />
I am using a GBoS as my primary weapon, and I'm still holding onto a LDON sword I pieced together.  I was really hoping to discover some sort of aggro weapon upgrade in gates w/o raiding, but it simply doesnt exist.  I have upgraded nearly every single piece of my gear with gates gear (or had the opportunity to, but declined due to having comparable ldon gear), excluding aggro weapons.  Where are the weapons?<br />
<br />
With that said, I have a suggestion.  Probably an unreasonable one, but I think you'll get the idea.  Ikkinz1 is very difficult for my group, so I'll use it as a place to start.  My group sees the Pixxt Slaughterer and Pixxt Decimator up on occasion, and so far have gotten zero loot from either, so I'll give the Decimator a fictional piece of loot that I think would help fill in the gap for non raiders to suppliment their weapons along with the rest of their gear.  I used some traditional warrior aggro weapons as mini templates to at least get some discussion going:<br />

A pipe dream, yes.  The stats seem to fit with the rest of the stuff that I've looted <br />

<br />
I'm trying to be optomistic that there will be weapon upgrades in oow, or perhaps the epic 1.5 will be remotely doable for non raiders, but it isnt very easy considering past expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cuttin' to the point here, even though I am still against it a year later, LDoN has augments for aggro. You no longer need to plan a path for aggro weapon upgrades. Get an augment. When you get a new weapon, take the augment off the old one and put it on the new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You no longer need to plan a path for aggro weapon upgrades. Get an augment. When you get a new weapon, take the augment off the old one and put it on the new one.<br />
<br />
Fair enough, but even if you remove the proc altogether from this imaginary weapon, it's still an upgrade, and it still makes my point that there arent any 1h weapon upgrade available (aggro or not) that are worthwhile to set as goals.  You said 'when you get a new weapon', and my reply is 'there arent any'.  There are two weapons that I am aware of that I have actively tried to camp for without success (Gilded Ixt Spear, Cold Steel Brand), and neither are 'upgrades', so I'm not sure why I even bothered. <br />
<br />
Gates lacked weapons that werent raid obtained, it's not out of the question that they could easily add a few here and there for those of us who would bother to loot them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The majority of all high agro weapons are on raid class mobs. Sure, you can do the AOW and the Cursed with 1 group NOW, but for the most part, they are raid targets for lower geared people.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want another crappy weapon to be added to the loot table which would most likely end up rotting for the people who are killing that type of mob. You are already getting some Plane of Time comparable loot from Ikkinz, that in itself should be enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gates of Discord is a HIGH LEVEL expansion, in fact, it's tuned for level 70.  I see no need for an &quot;upgrade to aggro path&quot;.  Perhaps what you're looking for is in Omens of War.<br />
<br />
The previous expansions have excellent choices for weapons, maybe you should check them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't want another crappy weapon to be added to the loot table which would most likely end up rotting for the people who are killing that type of mob.

<br />
Two things.<br />
<br />
First, we are being told that nonraiders ought to be in Kod'Taz and the Ikkinz trials.  As such, it is a fallacy to state that aggro weapons of the type dreamed of in this thread wouldnt' be an upgrade to people who are killing that type of mob.<br />
<br />
Second, please don't had me this BS about the present loot tables being enough.  You know and I know that a warrior is as good as his gear (in terms of taking damage) and his weapons (in terms of keeping damage from his party).  There are a lot of good items in GoD that meet that first requirement; NO ITEMS that meet the second.  It is only &quot;enough&quot; for you because you may not need the weapon upgrade.  <br />
<br />
As for the entire &quot;anger aug&quot; argument, it's tired.  Clearly anger augs add aggro.  Duh.  But our ability to hold and maintain aggro is increased greatly with pre-existing aggro weapons.  Right now, I think nonraiders can obtain a BoC (at great cost), Xanamech hammer, Einride sword, CHoS and whateverthehell that other droga/nurga weapon is.  That's it and most of those items are from expansions several years old and way out of line with present mob standards.  I'm happy enough with my aggro weapons in terms of keeping aggro, but they are a sad fucking comparison when put against gear dropping in nonraid portions of GoD and obviously an absurd comparison with weapons obtainable by raiding in PoP.  <br />
<br />
I think it would be a good idea for SoE to wake up and figure out that warriors need weapons the same way that casters need spells.  GoD has extremely limited options (read: none) and that is not the way future expansions ought to be designed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, we all benefit from and love our anger augs.  But i don't think that anger augs should be a justification to having such lame single group weap itemization from an entire expansion (but honestly, single group weap options have always been pretty slim). I cant really see warriors going out of their way over any of them to replace even Droga weaps. Is this a game/class breakingly huge problem? Not at all. Is it un-fun and kinda lame? Yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The previous expansions have excellent choices for weapons, maybe you should check them out.<br />
<br />
Aye, there are some sweet obtainable items in previous expansions that I would be overjoyed to have a chance at getting with my group, but my server is run by guild rotations on every conceivable loot dropping mob.  If I want to keep a good rep, I had best avoid these mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I should have never mentioned 'aggro' weapon.  Stick 'tentacle sting' or 'icicle claw' on a weapon, i'd be happy.  I'm enjoying the new content, I'd be delighted if I didnt have to go back to old content to upgrade a weapon, aggro weapon or not.  <br />
<br />
Oow will most likely address this issue, time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes! Great idea.  Let's put a ton of no-drop warrior only weapons on mobs.  That will become JUST as popular as the knight only weapons.  And we all know that is simply retarded.<br />
<br />
As I said before, the &quot;filler&quot; you are looking for should be in Omens of War, not the HIGH END RAIDING EXPANSION that is Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
There is no lame itemization in GoD(except the Darkglint Blade )*= )  What the fuck are you talking about?  Most of the items are all/all or multi class useable.  That means cool, decent loots for everyone.  Just because you can't upgrade your Bastion of Thunder level weapons, doesn't mean something needs to be implimented so you can.  In this instance, at this level, the drop tables are fine, nothing needs to be done.<br />
<br />
XTC is an EASY mob, and drops a 15/19 25ac 85hp weapon that procs Enraging Blow.  The cursed cycle drops TWO decent aggro weapons, most noteably the Bloodfrenzy that is 16/20.<br />
<br />
I think you need to stop trying to jump expansions and go back and do some natural progression.  If you're in KT and complaining about aggro weapons, something is seriously fucked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm tired of people saying GoD is tuned for level 70s.  It may have been when it came out, but it definitely isn't today.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mithlani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">can probably one group the Cursed Cycle and all of you will enjoy the loot from that.  <br />
<br />
You may get a BBoE or a BF so you should maybe thing about that. <br />
<br />
There is also XTC which drops Hategiver you could look at possibly doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think you need to stop trying to jump expansions and go back and do some natural progression.<br />
<br />
This IS my natural progression.  I chose to play the game differently than you is all.  I enjoy 1 group content with my RL friends.  I dont find much enjoyment from raids with lots of people.  Personal preference.  I hold no bitterness nor resentment towards raiders,  I'm very much indifferent to how others play the game.  I have found however that the opposite is not true very often.<br />
<br />
All I did was comment that there is a weapon itemization problem for my style of play in gates, it really shouldnt impact you at all.  As my original post states, adding a weapon to a mob that as far as I can tell drops NO loot, wouldnt affect you in the least.  <br />
<br />
And natural progression?  Most of PoP is locked up tight, and even if it werent, like I mentioned before, my server is all about mob rotations for guilds.  I wouldnt have a shot at any of that stuff even if I wanted to.  Wanna paypal me some funds so I can transfer my group (with gear!) to another server?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Brutall, It was tuned for level 70's.  And when I say that, I mean you already come there with addequate tools for the job.  The fact it's easy for level 65's doesn't mean that the content has changed for it being tuned to lvl 70's.<br />
<br />
Moruk, you can't possibly expect the game to cater to your specific needs, since that's &quot;your natural progression.&quot;  In an ideal world, my natural progression would be to already be time flagged, skip the lame flagging that was for EP access, and pick up a DBoTWL at the orc lift in Gfay.  Unfortunately, reality stopped that from happening.<br />
<br />
The mobs that you are you are talking about by the way, do in fact have a loot table, however, it is extremely rare that you will get a drop from them.<br />
<br />
Xanamech in the Plane of Innovation drops a 13/19 weapon with Taunting Blow as a proc, and is easily one groupable.  Since it's spawnable, there is no contention for it.  And if you arent looking for warrior specifc items, there is a slew of others available that have a proc on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Moruk,<br />
<br />
Looks like we have similar play styles, and I have to agree that weapon selection is horrible in GoD.  As for the Decimator and Slaughterer, they can drop the Earring of Destructive Essense rarely.  It would definately be cool if they could drop some decent weapons.<br />
<br />
Off topic: Have you tried DD? My group found her easier than the Annihilator (this was pre-nerf, I have no clue how she is now with no defensive), and if I can steer you away from one thing it is spending too much time on PA. We killed her like 12 times before even attempting DD, by the time we got to trial 2, we only needed 1 ring and we just watched ring after ring rot trying to get the other drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, I am vaguely familiar with that item / event.  I might go check it out, but I think first I'll wait to see what oow has to offer.  13/19 isnt terribly exciting, I would personally prefer something with more oomph, even if it doesnt have an aggro proc.<br />

No we havent tried DD yet, we've been waiting for a chance to give it a 100% effort attempt, but life keeps interferring.  Wifes getting cranky, babies getting crankier, etc :)   We will try as soon as we can, and in all honesty, we are a bit intimidated.  We'll definitely give it our best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it has.  Just about the whole expansion, from Barindu to Tacvi, has been retuned (made easier) since the expansion came out.  It is not tuned for level 70s, although the vast majority of people will go through it at level 70.</div></div><hr />

I am talking about the fact that it was made for players with level 70 gear, and that is why the drop tables are what they are.  Hence there is no need for upgrade paths from KT straight from BoT.</div></div><hr />

It's that there isn't anything in LDoN, Ferubi, Barindu, Sewers, Tipt, Vxed, and then still nothing in KT/Ikkinz.

I guess this post was supposed to clarify what you were saying, but now I have no idea what you are talking about at all.  What is level 70 gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Im not sure what there is to get worked up about. I just find it odd that you can earn gear the quality of Heartstriker bracer in single group GoD content, but cant get a suitable upgrade to CHoS in GoD. Just strikes me as lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Brutall, are you just not paying attention or what?  Level 70 gear would be &quot;coming with gear that's adequate for the job&quot;  It could be high level PoP to/ mid+ OoW gear.

Asking for items that are not in the game for the soul purpose of skipping content is absurd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoL so I guess if I understand you correctly, we are supposed to gear up in OoW, an expansion that will come out several months after GoD, in order to do GoD single group content?<br />
<br />
I suddenly lost interest in this conversation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can't quite follow the logic here either.<br />
<br />
Let me try it a different way Holy.  How can someone wearing Heartstriker Bracer and your rings see anything wrong with being able to loot a weapon that would upgrade a CHoS or GBoS from the same content? Your GoD single groupable loot is matched by only High-end raid gear in previous expansions.  Clearly its ok for items that are upgrades that YOU happen to want to drop from single group stuff, but for people that want weaps its out of the question. I just can't follow your reasoning.<br />
<br />
And no, im not saying &quot; &quot;Let's put a ton of no-drop warrior only weapons on mobs. That will become JUST as popular as the knight only weapons. And we all know that is simply retarded.&quot; &quot; But I dont think a 1hs or 1hb usable by multiple classes with some DD and a stun that would upgrade a CHoS or GBoS would have been out of line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">They could solve the problems by putting a stun aug or a Taunting Blow aug that is Type 7 (Primary/Secondary only) as either a quest reward or a random drop in one of the instanced zones in GoD.<br />
<br />
That way, a warrior could get a Velium Gemmed weapon and stick both that and the Anger III aug on it and have a really good weapon without having to make new loot tables for warrior weapons.  I'd say that's an upgrade to CHoS, even GBoS perhaps.  Although, this solution doesn't give you the pleasure of looting the weapon itself, unless you make your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Nice creative thinking Kaesorn. Think it would be best to make it a DD and stun so other classes could make use of it too. <br />
<br />
Still not sure if it would be better to have it be an aug or a weap with an inate agro proc drop from single group GoD stuff, but I really like the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Jesus the new age of warriors act like spoiled brats.<br />
<br />
Let’s see, we (Warriors) get an instant click of hate, 2 decent weapons with stuns basically handed to us AND enraging blow line of augments. People still seem to bitch about agro weapons. Seriously, what the hell?<br />
<br />
I don't want to start this into an &quot;I walked to school up hill in the snow both ways&quot; but damn, these threads are retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not that there isn't enough ways for any old warrior to hold aggro. It's that the thrust of Everquest is to get new equipment. As a melee, your weapons are among your most important slots. The problem lies in that there is a decent sized demographic of warriors that are missing properly tuned weapons. If you were using the same weapons you are now when PoP first came out and there didn't even exist any upgrades that you could possibly obtain wouldn't you feel there was something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It doesn't look to me as whining, it's only the desire to have an upgrade option available.  Others have shown that upgrades exist for every other slot you can equip, with the exception of the weapons without losing procs.<br />
<br />
I don't believe what's being asked for is an improvement to agro abilities, but merely something to look forward to after CHoS/GBoS in a group setting.  IMO, the agro abilities could remain the same, but have the weapon itself get better.  Best option I've seen is the Velium Gemmed.  Better ratio than the BoC, but lack of any second proc that could be put on it other than a 50hp lifetap. (They really should exploit the Type 7 slot on that more)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I can  never understand why high end raiders (which I would consider myself one of) complain when people who aren't raiders get equipment that is &quot;near&quot; raid standard. I know on my server, I don't go anywhere near BoT or PoV or HoH, unless I'm playing with a friend who isn't flagged for EP's - and then I usually go to potac cause there's no one in there. <br />
<br />
It doesn't affect me in the slightest if these people get gear that's a bit closer to our level, as quite frankly the gap between what I wear and the &quot;non-raiding&quot; warrior wears is pretty big as it is. (do you really consider something 100hp less than what we're wearing as too big a reward?). Quite frankly, I'd be happy to see something like this added, even though I'd never use it. It's not game breaking, and certainly balanced vs risk of the trial.</div></div><hr />

The original post is about a warrior that isn't a raider wanting higher end one groupable mobs that drop higher end warrior aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
These ALREADY EXIST.  The Bloodfrenzy and Hategiver from Luclin, which are BOTH ONE GROUPABLE, can easliy do the job.<br />
<br />
Brutall, clearly you can't connect the dots from A to B to C. Do you need to invest money on a reading comprehension program? As it looks like you just took things out of context, jumbled them, and then read that as what I posted.  The fact you thought I ment that players were supposed to have OoW is just retarded, honestly.<br />
<br />
Gates of Discord IS a level 70 expansion, HELLO.  The items made for the expansion REFLECT that.  Look at the Glyphed Prayer Ring, there couldn't possibly be a better example for elite 1 group loot.  Traditionally, people able to obtain these items already have better.  The only ones that don't that I've seen, are holding out for a Quarm ring and get this to tide them over.  <br />
<br />
Since the tuning has happened, since the level 70 idea was scrapped on GoD's release, there are alot of players in KT/Ikkinz/Yxxta that normally wouldn't be there, and probably would have wait until level 70 to get here.  THIS MEANS:  That the gear quality of players now zoning into KT is LOWER than what was expected.  <br />
<br />
Originally, these zones were designed for time guilds.  Now, we see guilds that aren't even in EP's filtering in.  Now clearly, people in pre-elemental gear, or a guild that's only been in elementals for a short times gear is going to signifigantly affect their abilities in these zones.  From manapools, to hitpoints, and possibly AA. Players who are in this situation complain that there aren't enough options for them, not only weapons, which btw, GoD is FULL of weapons.  This could be remedied by a number of things, most notabley natural progression.  Fully VT/Elemental/Omens geared(which I believe will be elemental gear with VT focus) guilds are going to have an easier time doing these things, they will have items focus, hate weapons, and larger manapools and hitpoints.<br />

Does GoD need more weapons for non raiders? Seeing how it is a RAIDING EXPANSION, I THINK NOT.<br />
<br />
Groupable content already exists for some pretty elite weapons.  When Time was first done, do you think everyone magically had DBoTWL's and BoW's?  No, they didn't.  A few lucky tanks had a BoW, but every other warrior used dual hate procing weapons, and some of those even used them into GoD until they were able to upgrade with weapons such as the JoS.<br />
<br />
This is almost as good as people whining that there wasn't enough non raider content in the planes of POWER.  You're expansion was LoY, much like your new expansion will be OoW.</div></div><hr />

And as I have REPEATEDLY stated and you have REPEATETLY IGNORED, I would be just as happy if weapon upgrades existed that were NON AGGRO PROC or NO PROC AT ALL.

If you answered yes, you really need to take a hard look at yourself, you have issues.  If you answered no, then answer me what is so holy about weapons that upgrades dont exist in gates for non raiders?  Another thing you conveniently keep bypassing is when I state because of politics on my server, namely people like YOU, damn near all loot dropping mobs from non instanced areas on my server are forever OFF LIMITS to me.  Get that?  Hategiver = OFF LIMITS.  Bloodfrenzy = OFF LIMITS.<br />
<br />
I'm done with you.  I tried to be logical with you, I even conceded in my obviously greedy and outlandish 'weapon upgrade fantasy', but you'll have none of that.  Maybe I should get your phone number so when I get a new upgrade I can ask for permission before I loot it.</div></div><hr />

GoD is a raiding expension, the whole design was for the &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders / hard content, now the shift of the expension has changed.<br />
It was the same for PoP beside it wasn't much for &quot;hardcore/hard content&quot; but more &quot;raiding expension&quot; ( not sure if it makes sense but for me there is a slight difference ).<br />
<br />
Weapon choice from GoD expension on single group content is definitly rather sad, but the whole expension is fucked up itemisation wise.<br />
There is definitly a need in these single group content for an agro/ dps  weapons ( ala great blade of storms ), so something in the kind of a 18/20 ( or 17/20 /Shrug )  130hp and about 10ac with a DD / stun proc and war / ranger / rogue etc usuable maybe.</div></div><hr />

For little more effort than it takes to obtain these, better weapons can be obtained.  Weapons that would fall into the &quot;aggro&quot; category.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Well, Holywrath, I could have but I didn't.<br />
In fact, on one level I think you are correct: not all expansions have to contain loot tables that drop upgrades in all gear slots. A lot of improvements for casual warrior aggro have happened in very short order (the last year-ish): incite line, anger augs, even better no-drop aggro weapons for raiders, since that tends to lower demand for inferior dropable stuff that casual warriors use.<br />
The LDoN augment thing keeps casual warrior aggro in the game for the moment, but the droga-level weapons are likely to get tired eventually, just as the Langseax of the Wolves and the centi weapons got tired before them. With level 70 around the corner, I'd suspect that that time will come sooner rather than later.<br />
But beyond that, all players like to loot their own gear, and all players like to look to chances for upgrades. We're seeing a growing percentage of casual players who are running out of options for looting their own weapons, and in fact I'd guess that a very high percentage of casual warriors did not loot their mainhand weapons, but rather bought those weapons from someone for whom killing the mob was trivial. For casual players doing the latest content, there are no aggro upgrades. Crippling if that happens in one expansion? No, certainly not. But you begin to notice it.<br />
In this narrow sense, even a few weapons that had exactly the same stats/procs as droga weapons but were avaiable in a wider range single-group content would be more fun. As far as I can tell, any casual warrior who can drum up 200 pp can get a GSoT; 7K gets you a droga on my server. Basically, no matter how broke you are you can get a GSoT; and almost everyone can afford the droga set. So having a mob drop such weapons in single-group content in GoD might have for its total effect on the game a deflation in the cost of droga weapons by maybe 1.5K pp, and no real effect on GSoT because they can't get any lower. I don't see those effects as game breakers.<br />
Even a drop that was a slight upgrade to drogas wouldn't mess the game up too much as far as I can tell, partly because you could simply insert the weapon deeply enough into GoD that casual players would have to work pretty hard to get there. And even now there aren't that many casual players very far into even the single-group stuff in GoD. It's not like the market for droga weps would crash from casual players looting too much stuff in GoD any time soon.</div></div><hr />

All the guy asked for is better itemization for weapons. In general, he even retracted the word &quot;aggro&quot; and simply said a weapon that is an upgrade from what's available to casual players from older expansions. What's the big freaking deal? Notice his posts, all he wants is better stats on the weapon. Heaven forbid one should want to see better weapons in content surpassing older content...<br />
<br />
<br />
And so yea, you claim you weren't necessarily responding just to him.  Alright fine, four score and seven years ago Warriors had it much harder than they have it now. No incite, no aggro weapons, relying solely on taunt, etc etc etc... so why don't you feel a little compassion for a newer Warrior (maybe not even that new?) instead of demanding he go through the same crap =/<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note; I seriously have a problem with that stupid droga weaponset anyway. How many ogre Warriors do you see running around with the same cookie-cutter configuration weaponsetup. These days there's nearly ONE prescribed path to being a Warrior; race with slam and frontal stun immunity, cultural armor and a droga weaponset, and while it works damn well it takes all the creativity out of the game. Now we have a player talking about some reasonable weaponry off of mobs that are hard enough to get to and kill anyway, why is the auto-respose &quot;no, you didn't do ssra, go get a bloodfrenzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those weapons you linked are kind of trash, exception the 2hb which is rare as fuck of a mob deeeeeep in sewers trial 1. Not that this means it's unreasonable, it's a good weapon and it shouldn't be easy to get, but for a 2 hander that's so difficult to get, it should have more HP and some better stats on it. The essential question is should Warriors be limited to weapons that you can buy better in the bazaar for under 10k?</div></div><hr />

Because if attention is paid to the casual players than the ubers dont get their good and just amount of attention. That and if you dont have to raid to get decent stuff than raiders are afraid that no one will raid.<br />
<br />
Casual warrior itemization in GoD is not that much better than VT (almost have to go more than one foot to count the number of expansions on my piggies) and GoD is a hell of a lot harder than VT (except the fact that you need 25-60 people capable of staying awake).<br />
<br />
And the GoD drop rates can be streaky anyways. I know if I spend 15 hrs with my chanter in VT that there is a decent probability that I will get a drop (30-40 people normally so 2 runs+ should net me something useful) whereas I am going on 20+ hrs farming trash in GoD looking for a drop. Funny thing is my first 10 mins in GoD I dropped a named and got that ok bow (forget name) of the guy in Riwwi (sp?). Go figure. Guess I need to permacamp a ranger in these zones and dropped only the named :) That and the xp per hr expended sucks relative to Tier3 PoP. Hopefully they up the XEM when OoW hits (cause GoD will be a wasteland otherwise).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Haass, go back and re-read what the original poster had said later on in the thread, that they didnt just have to be aggro weapons; but any weapons.  I've already made my point about sufficient aggro weapons being obtainable from earlier expansions.  One group encounters in fact, and I don't want to hear this time enabled shit, get another fucking group and viola, problem solved.  If at level 65, people can't take out these easy encounters, then they should just stop playing Everquest because they are too fucking stupid.<br />
<br />
I'm simply stating that the itemization for GoD is perfectly fine, it's probably the ONLY thing that was done correctly in the whole damn expansion the first time around.  Does it need to be changed for non-raiding people? No, and there isn't any factual or feasible evidence that there needs to be a change.<br />
<br />
The only thing that would result from easy weapons, is more cookie cutter warriors.  Just like now, with the droga set up, you'd see level 60's and soon to be 70's with the same weapon set up.  I really don't think we need to see that happening again.  However it would be to a lesser extent, because the proposed weapons would be no drop.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a problem with the droga set up at the moment for warriors who have them.  They should be sufficient aggro for the level of gameplay they are used for, because if you go above that, it will be raiding.. and raiding mobs(hopefully) that drop upgrades.<br />
<br />
As it is, with my epics, it's not uncommon for me to steal aggro from a DBoTWL, both 1handed and 2handed versions.  I'd say about 3 times a night, just on procs alone I steal aggro with them.  I could only imagine the droga set up with anger 3 augs.  I'm not sure where this magical aggro is that everyone is searching for, but you probably already have it, or NEAR it.  I don't even want to hear any shit about ppm, or procmods, or the damage output themselves of the weapons.  That only matters on tanking a raid level mob, not clearing the trash where procs score you aggro, and in turn exp groups are much the same.<br />
<br />
Things are pretty fine at the moment with weapon selections, they may not be as broad as I'd like them to be, just for the diversity alone.  I kinda miss talking to other warriors about their weapons, to compare and contrast.  But since every warrior has the same damn shit, there's real no point. And,  Incite and Anger augments have aleviated all of warriors aggro problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">None of those weapons you listed are upgrades to anything that people would be using.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of people can scrounge 2 groups and field a greatblade of storms.  There is not a single weapon that a warrior would be using in that list over a greatblade of storms.  Other classes?  Sure, but we're not talking about other classes here, we're talking about warriors.<br />
<br />
Second of all, we shouldn't have to be using weapons that are 2 or 3 expansions old.  That's called &quot;Fucking bullshit.&quot;  You don't see casters getting focus items from previous expansions, because they're all upgraded.  Same with armor, same with weapons..with the exception of aggro weapons.  And since we're the only fucking class IN THE GAME that is absolutely, 100% tied to aggro weapons, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a fucking upgrade to those weapons in any given expansion.  <br />
<br />
It is absolute fucking bullshit that the best small guild weapons in the game right now come from Velious (BoC, buyable), and from PoP (GBoS) when there is a new expansion out.  Telling people to &quot;Just go back and get something different&quot; is not only counterproductive in terms of bottom feeding, but it's also illogical.</div></div><hr />

Yea but now you're getting really picky...obviously there will always be spill over when not every person can have individual weapons, but how many Warriors do you see walking around with BoCs? DBotWLs? Having a no-drop weapon coming off a very hard encounter - lets face it, those nameds in Ikkiniz are no pushover - is exactly what is needed here - a good weapon off hard content that's not raid content.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I've already made my point about sufficient aggro weapons being obtainable from earlier expansions.  One group encounters in fact, and I don't want to hear this time enabled shit, get another fucking group and viola, problem solved.<br />
<br />
By your own logic, then a dbow and a eoe is enough, so no point to put a raid warrior agro weapon in GoD, guess what? dbow / eoe is definitly more than enough agro wise.<br />
<br />
<br />
If at level 65, people can't take out these easy encounters, then they should just stop playing Everquest because they are too fucking stupid.<br />
<br />
You aren't in tacvi?  you aren't time flag? considering how it's trivial to have a time flag ( and in a lesser extend tacvi too but it's more arguable ) you should stop playing EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm simply stating that the itemization for GoD is perfectly fine, it's probably the ONLY thing that was done correctly in the whole damn expansion the first time around.<br />
Happy that itemisation please you, you must be the only one who is happy with it. Most people who are doing GoD and also are in tacvi, find it's totally retarded.<br />
EP / Time itemisation was fairly good but the gear from time was a bit too good considering the content tho.<br />
VT itemisation after the revamp was &quot;perfect&quot; good RvR but the named were a bit too easy.<br />
GoD ? Totally retarded itemisation with definitly no thought in them, only mobs with a good itemisation is CBQ imho but the mob is gimp. <br />
<br />
<br />
Does it need to be changed for non-raiding people? No, and there isn't any factual or feasible evidence that there needs to be a change.<br />
<br />
There is a need for casual / one group content path, should it be better than raid loot one &quot;true&quot; expension ago ? I don't think, but it definitly should be one.<br />
<br />
The only thing that would result from easy weapons, is more cookie cutter warriors.  Just like now, with the droga set up, you'd see level 60's and soon to be 70's with the same weapon set up.  I really don't think we need to see that happening again.  However it would be to a lesser extent, because the proposed weapons would be no drop.<br />
<br />
It doesn't change, look at your main MT from guild in qvic+<br />
They have all a dbotw main hand with either a raex bp or vadd bp + gloves.<br />
That's cookie cutter, in fact, the more you are going in the &quot;high end&quot; the more cookie cutter it will be.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a problem with the droga set up at the moment for warriors who have them.  They should be sufficient aggro for the level of gameplay they are used for, because if you go above that, it will be raiding.. and raiding mobs(hopefully) that drop upgrades.<br />
<br />
As the shift of the god expension has changed since the begining, droga weapons are not sufficient for the level of gameplay.<br />
People doesn't ask for a free weapon, but a weapon that they have to work for it.<br />
A casual group who is winning the ikkinz 1group trial definitly deserver this kind of weapons ( something in the line of a 18/20 with some stun + DD //  usuable by dual wielding classes for ex ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Yea but now you're getting really picky...obviously there will always be spill over when not every person can have individual weapons, but how many Warriors do you see walking around with BoCs? DBotWLs? Having a no-drop weapon coming off a very hard encounter - lets face it, those nameds in Ikkiniz are no pushover - is exactly what is needed here - a good weapon off hard content that's not raid content. It would be the middle ground between BoWs DBoTWLs BoCs and Droga Weaponsets.<br />
<br />
Celeritum beat me to it. <br />
<br />
Do you honestly think putting a decent no drop weapon on a mob that rarely spawns, is out of the way, and is very difficult for someone who would want it would make it just another CHoS? That is rediculous. Heck, even look at GBoS. A lot of these cookie cutters you talk about don't even use that. Why? Because for a good amount of people even Eindride is difficult. Getting to and killing those Ikkinz horses make Eindride look like a walk in the park. <br />
<br />
To put this whole thing in perspective, rewind time a couple years and PoP is new and your high end raiding guild just took down Rallos in tactics and you looted the coveted BoW. Fast forward to next week and your guild just took down Tunat`Muram Cuu Vauax in Tacvi and there was not a single weapon that dropped that whole time to upgrade your BoW. And it wasn't just because your guild got unlucky with drops, it's that a BoW was still the best weapon in the game. Wouldn't you think something was wrong?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're doing a bit more than connecting dots here, you're taking some pretty big assumptions and running with them.  Calling GoD &quot;a level 70 expansion&quot; is complete nonsense.  Whether or not OoW was &quot;supposed&quot; to be released with GoD is irrelevant, because it wasn't and therefore GoD needs to be balanced as the stand-alone expansion that it is.  I'm sure OoW will be balanced for the time it comes out (many months after GoD).<br />
<br />
And yea, Brutall plays on Bertox and is a completely different person with much more uber gear than me.</div></div><hr />

This is common sense really.  To move on to bigger and badder things, one needs to become bigger and badder.  Of course upgrades are 'necessary'.  Just because someone doesn't wish to play the raid style doesn't mean they don't wish to progress and see new things constantly, as they move up the progression tier.

<br />
Common sense would also allow you to understand raid type loot vs. single group encounter loot. The loot you can get in Kod'Taz is Time quality (raid type). Let’s see, you can get damn fine shoulders, nice ranged, wrist, earring, ring HP/AC augments. This should be enough for the casual player that runs with a group of real life friends but no, they want more.<br />
<br />
If the Warrior in the group is struggling for agro, then they should focus on getting agro weapons that just so happen to drop in old world content. This isn't that hard to understand.<br />

EQ is not about the minority players, hard fact to face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not really completely understanding the exchange between you and Lelith, but what I do understand is this:<br />
<br />
a) You originally claim that GoD (not in this thread) was originally geared for level 70.<br />
b) Also in another thread, you claim for the original target audience, the gear itemization was fine the way it was - designated for Time plus guilds, but more importantly, the level 70 crowd.<br />
<br />
Yet in the same breaths you claim that Warriors should be able to tank this content with weapons that wouldn't even last through Plane of Time, which was released what, in an expansion two years ago?<br />
<br />
That doesn't make sense. Although you repeatedly reference that Warriors should have to pharm old content for weapons, it doesn't abide by the logic. If GoD was originally geared for level 70 players that had completed Plane of Time, then weapons should drop that are at least close to that level.<br />
<br />
You speak of Vxed and Tipt saying they can be done by anybody with an Enchanter friend. I agree with you. What you do NOT mention is that every Ikkiniz trial contains NO CHARMABLE ENEMIES at all. So again, by your own logic, people that relied on Enchanters to get past Vxed and Tipt would CERTAINLY fail these trials, because they'd have no cruch to rely on.<br />
<br />
The red con nameds in Trial 7 are a fucking assbeat. Don't pretend like they aren't.  How the fuck are you saying this is &quot;an early stage of the game&quot; ??? ITS THE NEWEST CUTTING EDGE CONTENT!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From your last sentences, it doesn't seem at all that you are upset about people wanting appropriate level weapons to drop off cutting edge content. It seems that you really liked when Kod`Taz was exclusive and now that people are learning to break in using different methods than you used, you're mad that you have to share the sandbox. Sorry to piss in your wheaties, but that's what occurs in this game. It just so happens that in this expansion, there's no warlord with a gigantic flaming axe blocking people from getting into the good experience zones. Where loot drops that is appropriate for the kind of challenge presented, if not somewhat lacking in weaponry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I don't think it's unreasonable to say that a non uber person should be able to upgrade a weapon they got in a level 58 exp group 2 years ago without raiding.

Not a silly question, but let me ask this:  Raid content from whose perspective?<br />
<br />
Someone in Qvic+ has a different idea on what is considered raid content than someone who has only reached Kod'Taz and Ikkinz with a group, who has a different perspective than someone who is still down at the level of Ssra or lower.<br />
<br />
I don't believe very many people have an idea of what can be considered &quot;raid-only&quot; content or equipment from the perspective of a person who only grouped up to KT or Ikk.<br />
<br />
And Holywrath:<br />
I'm not responding on this thread anymore because people are acting totally fucking stupid. You can't make a post without some moron adding his two cents and disregarding what you actually said in favor of their jaded views.<br />
<br />
I hate to say it: Pot, meet Kettle.  But I digress...<br />
<br />
Fine, lets give warriors ALL elite weapons at at early stage of the game that takes no real thought to get to, just a decent enchanter friend. And then lets call it skill, even though they can't master trivial content from the past. If you can't complete older easier content, how should you be able to complete new and harder content for better rewards? Fucking idiots. I'm already having to deal with newbs entering KT, and this is just factual evidence of that.<br />
<br />
I think you should chill out, relax a bit.  You're obviously not reading properly, and seeing what they're asking for.  DBotW is not being asked for, BoWs aren't even being asked for.<br />
<br />
What IS being asked for is an upgrade to a 13/20 weapon and a 14/18 weapon that DOESN'T lower the agro abilities of the Warrior.  I've already suggested a very very VERY easy solution, to just make a stun proc (maybe even Force Shock or a 50DD like the lifetap with 0 stun) Type 7 augment, that people can fit onto a Velium Gemmed weapon, drop from an instanced zone...perhaps Vxed/Tipt...hell, even KT or Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
That would satisfy the upgrade idea easily, yet still not give people the &quot;elite&quot; weapons you guard so jealously, and it wouldn't increase the agro abilities of the non-raider significantly (which many consider really adequate, although I'm sure damage classes can challenge warriors at times).<br />
<br />
It would be an upgrade though, one that a non-raider can work towards.<br />
<br />
Get out of the self-destructive &quot;raider's only&quot; mentality for a second and see what is actually being asked for.<br />
<br />
One last thing:Common sense would also allow you to understand raid type loot vs. single group encounter loot. The loot you can get in Kod'Taz is Time quality (raid type). Yet, a good amount of it is gotten from single-group stuff, and KT/Ikk can be gotten to without a raid.  This is single group encounter stuff, which means it's single group encounter loot.  You're running on the misguided belief that &quot;single group encounter&quot; means &quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;worthless gear&quot;.<br />
<br />
Honestly I believe many raiders are just upset that KT and Ikkinz aren't a &quot;raider's only club&quot;, that they have to share now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Hrm, well I'm not sure if you're referring to GoD as a whole as having good itemization or just single group content, have you done ikkinz raids?

All of which start to rot after a few runs.  Of course with most other expansions, too many damn knight weapons.  <br />
<br />
Well anyway, yes all those weapons listed lack aggro.  There should be a one groupable weapon out of GoD with innate aggro not &quot;well you could aug it...&quot;  Solution could be tossing something in ikkinz/tipt/vxed similar to GBoS so it's not a complete rot weapon, way too many class only shit in ikkinz, so something with a stun proc usuable by war/rng/brd/rog, don't see what there's to object about that.</div></div><hr />

I believe I posted stating there were incredible loot drops in Kod'Taz and Ikkinz I’m not misguided at all. I can't talk for other raiders but there is no way anyone could get upset for &quot;sharing&quot; mainly because Ikkinz is an instance zone. What would there be to share?</div></div><hr />

Snowz, I don't think the non-uber raiders are the minority...<br />
<br />
I'm a casual raider (was non-casual raider until recently), and I've basically reached the point that my weapon upgrade options are extremely limited.  As someone else said, would you be happy if you were still using a BoW in 6 years?<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone (well...anyone reasonable) is asking for non-uber single group BoW drops, but it would be nice to have something other than the Droga weapons or CHSD/GBoS.<br />

lets say mobx did exist that dropped said item, what do you think would happen to it? the more uber than you would perma farm it for anyone they didnt want to go back and do shit like RZ for again to get them better aggro weaps. you people act as if the raiders have gear magically falling out of trees and hitting us in the head. we work our asses off for that gear. i will flat out state that if KT had visible slot upgrades i might not even be in a guild, there would be NO POINT. the non visible slot drops from just KT named and ikkinz trials is better than most elemental raid drops, do you REALLY need weapons and armor to COMPLETELY bypass the raiding progression? For gods sake, if they did put shit like that on 1 group mobs, who in the fuck would even bother to raid, i sure wouldnt spend every night farming elemental rings and trying to get to time, i would just be parked in KT permanently. Lets talk about the skill it actually takes to get to KT, its pretty much zero. It takes a skilled enchanter friend and a ranger buddy to WS the named on engage. past that, your skill as a warrior and gear didnt have all that much to do with you getting to KT. accept the fact SOE gave you such fucking nice gear on a silver platter and shut the fuck up about the stuff you didnt get.<br />

for the really slow here is the math<br />

spend every night at raids for 3-4 weekd to build enuff dkp to have a chance at an ele mold or spend 1 week in KT and get 2 earrings, 2 rings, a range item, 2 20 ac augs, some 35 hp augs, a belt and i think a nice neck drops there too<br />

lets say mobx did exist that dropped said item, what do you think would happen to it? the more uber than you would perma farm it for anyone they didnt want to go back and do shit like RZ for again to get them better aggro weaps. you people act as if the raiders have gear magically falling out of trees and hitting us in the head. we work our asses off for that gear. i will flat out state that if KT had visible slot upgrades i might not even be in a guild, there would be NO POINT. the non visible slot drops from just KT named and ikkinz trials is better than most elemental raid drops, do you REALLY need weapons and armor to COMPLETELY bypass the raiding progression? <br />
<br />
Considering that you can grab time quality loot from single content in god, putting this kind of weapon from this content would be a smart and logical thing to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
For gods sake, if they did put shit like that on 1 group mobs, who in the fuck would even bother to raid, i sure wouldnt spend every night farming elemental rings and trying to get to time, i would just be parked in KT permanently. Lets talk about the skill it actually takes to get to KT, its pretty much zero. It takes a skilled enchanter friend and a ranger buddy to WS the named on engage. past that, your skill as a warrior and gear didnt have all that much to do with you getting to KT. accept the fact SOE gave you such fucking nice gear on a silver platter and shut the fuck up about the stuff you didnt get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering you are &quot;broking&quot; in the EP, that you are in a raiding guild you should just shut up considering that EP content now is nothing more than having loot on a silver plater.<br />
We are speaking about top end content on single group, not trivial zone like EP or time.<br />
<br />
<br />
gee cant imagaine why the raiders think you guys are some whiney ass bitches<br />
<br />
I am no longer a raider, I think that most casual are just lazy ass, but here  it's not the case and yes rewarding people doing progression content is a fucking good thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lelith, you sir are a fucking moron. No, that's not my my own logic, that's by your twisted logic, don't get the two confused dumbass. The itemization from Time wasn't good. DO YOU NOT REMEBER THE PALADIN WHO TANKED QUARM? The whole, warriors can easibly be replaced now?<br />
<br />
<br />
At least I am not a clueless retard.<br />
The paladin who tanked quarm / and any other time god had better gear than you do, not only that but he had more hp, more ac and I would bet more shielding and avoidance than you do.<br />
Guess why it was the case? Because the content was too easy in comparaison of the items, in fact after a few clearing, time was totally trivial ( considering that you never put the feet in this zone you couldn't know ). <br />
Itemisation was good, content was too easy ( arguably quarm looted was kinda &quot;sad&quot; in comparaison to the previous phase, but it was because these items were already _too good_ ).<br />
<br />
And I would add, when I have first &quot;seen&quot; a monk tanking fenni then pal tanking quarm + RZ, I thought more : geez how they are lucky to not have a cch which totally blows / total clueless clerics ( and yeah the guild where I was got time on &quot;farm&quot; status at this time  tehee ).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">The reason people like Snowz and Holywrath see no problem with these type of slot upgrades dropping from single group content is because it is stuff THEY can use. THEY have no use for weap upgrades from Ikiniz because raiders have had better available weapons than what is suggested in this thread for like 4 expansions. <br />
<br />
Their position is not difficult to understand, its just difficult to rationalize in a logical way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I think you guys are being unreasonable.  Why is it ok to get VT level gear in Ferubi exp groups but even a weapon that is inferior to Ssra weapons dropping in Kod'Taz is overpowering or asking too much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">is it so difficult to understand that top aggro weaps have ALWAYS dropped from some of the hardest mobs from thier expansions? why in gods name would that change now? oh wait, it did. the chos and sotbs drop off duoable mobs and are more than enuff aggro til you can get a BoC (dropped or bought, your choice, if it matters that fucking much to you the price isnt an object or you can scrape together 2 groups to go take down AOW, cursed, xtc, xana, einride etc.) my server apparently has one of the crappier non raid populations and they still manage to take down everything short of RZTW with open raids, including killing most of ssra with 20 or less quite often. if you cant find time to make a couple of these raids to try and get the aggro proc weapons, why should i listen to you cry about sitting in KT getting 7-10 aa per day while i raid for upgrades. you honestly want the solo/single group path to have as good or better rewards os the 60 man raid path, thats just fucked up and you cannot defend it. its like if we both had the same job and i didnt go a god damned thing but surf porn all day and you worked yer dick in the ground, at the end of the week we get the SAME check. i bet you would feel shorted huh, well thats how the raiders feel when you guys DEMAND drops as good or better than what it takes us 60 folks to get<br />
<br />
brutul there are some decent weapons drops in GoD off single group stuff, is it the best? 18/20 is NOT inferior to ssra stuff, its better.  someone made the argument about casters focus, oddly enuff many many casters i see still use their VT focus items until they replace them in time. tanks i know also keep their velious/ssra weaps until they replace them in time (sure some guys lucked out on a BoW, but not every guild gets lucky on drops or has the time/patience to farm RZTW repeatedly (on our server there are select asshats who think its fun to train RZTW on a guild as they float into the pit or to ninja loot his corpse so once you get him enuff to flag the guild you dont go back) and sews drops for us has been a grand total of 1 sews sigh. considering how far back i am on the list for bow and the fact the sews is hotly contested drop if it ever drops again, i will most likely be using my BoC/SEM til time. so if anything i have a vested interest in weapons upgrades from god, but i just dont think a single group taget should drop an upgrade to either of my weaps. yes it would be nice, but it wouldnt be decent risk for the reward. i mean really, lets see, how hard is it to get named in kt. hmm kill trash, check track, kill trash check track. and ikikinz is start instance, zone rogue in to check named, no named, drop instance and try next trial, repeat every hour til you get loot. omg thats soooo hard. bottom line is yer a bunch of pussies who want it all handed to them without WORKING your ass off for it</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">The fact that you are a raider using bazaar trash and a 2nd rate dps weapon for aggro is a perfect example of why there needs to be more aggro weapon drops in the game.

brut, those are the weapons i had from leveling the warrior, he is the 3rd main i have played and he was last played during the velious/luclin era as an alt of my cleric. after cleric i played necro from nothing to elementals and 1 kill from time. The guild i was in got stuck on RC and its warpiness and eventually imploded so i took a break and came back and goofed on some melee alts til i decided to pick the warrior back up again. the gear i had was the best buyable thats actually for sale on xev, sure there are better buyable slots for a few spots, but those items simply were not in bazaar or were 400k like a BoC was. for the money it just wasnt worth it to me at the time since i just did ldons, single group pop stuff, fun with friends etc. since joining my guild i have worked very hard both in raids and outside raids to get better gear. from raiding nightly (i actually start raids from here at work, then drive home between main mobs or after we are done for the night) to finishing keys and flags, to burning thru ldons for augs and charm upgrades to farming aa and gear in KT i have done my share of the work and i am proud that i am the guy they call on to tank the trash at raids :)</div></div><hr />

Hey bro, everyone loves mom and dad, I would just try and tone down the &quot;I work so much harder than a non-raider&quot; rhetoric. Just couldn't resist throwing the old post at ya, hehe.<br />
<br />
Your reactions to people wanting viable agro weap upgrades from current single-group content is just kinda over the top.  Especially people that are geared for and are excelling in that content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">the problem frost is that its not that hard to get to KT, just knowing a good enchanter/ranger should not give you rights to get upgrades to weaps like BF and boc. i can see an argument that can be made for some upgrade weaps to drop in the ikkinz trials off the bosses tho. at least then you pretty much earned it and didnt just gimp your way to it. ie its a 6 man encounter, no charm, cant defensive, cant have 5 clerics keeping up one gimp ass tank so he can loot gear he shouldnt be able to get etc. Even then, the nature of the trials and the ability to swap folks in and out of them let a good geared group be able to farm twink/friend loot and gear up people who havent earned it. Hell im guilty of that myself, we had a hybrid cloak rotting the other day in trial 5 or 6 and we invited friend in to come loot it but his 59 ranger couldnt get into the trial hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I agree with you Ibithor that if a weap were put in it should be in an Ikiniz trial, not Sewers/Vxed/Tipt. And i do see your point about friends being able to swap in others and the possibility of exploiting that to some degree. However, the same dynamic exists in raids with being able to raid in non-flagged members who can then loot, being CoH'ed and dieing and being drug along by rogues, alts tagging along for the inevitable rotting loot, etc..  I can't really see this being a deal breaker to adding an agro weap upgrade to Ikiniz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This happens whether you be a raider or not, really.  It's not specifically non-raiders who do that.  Also, not everyone will get into KT and Ikk simply by going on the coattails of an enchanter/ranger team.  That's almost offensive to those warriors who do in fact make it in without relying on charm.<br />
<br />
But yes, putting a stun weapon/aug onto a mob where you cannot gimp the fight with charm/defensive or whatever would mean you've earned it.  I don't believe many of these guys are asking to get a weapon that's spawned on the ground the moment they enter KT.  I've been seeing too many people jump to conclusions saying they're asking for top end weapons...when all they want is an upgrade worth striving for that doesn't sacrifice agro.  There is a significant difference...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">The proposed weapon didn't seem too far outa line.There does seem to be a  lack of weapon choice in single group GOD content.<br />
<br />
I didn't read the whole thing,but, I noticed some of the old raider vs non raider stuff building up again.I'm glad that single group GOD content that drops ep+ quality loots occaissionaly doesn't fill all your slots similiarily.I think it's stupid that I was able to get a glyphed prayer ring off of a single mob in Ikkinz trials that owns rings it took 50+ of us to beat in EP's.My dkp officer flipped when he saw the link hehe.I don't know how OOW will be,but, at least this kinda imbalance is still somewhat limited.<br />
<br />
The old game is great and shouldn't be written off IMO.Keep as many reasons for people to go back with groups of friends as possible.That said the GOD groupable weapon stuff does kinda suck.A couple weapons similiar to 18/24 with tentacle sting would probably be a good addition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">it does exist with raids frost, but its rare that you can get 60 folks together and agree to farm something for someone not there or not ready for the encounter. there is going to be a good chance someone attending needs the item or that the 60 folks will decide their efforts are better spent elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
the original posts dont mention wherre they think such an item should drop, so i dont assume they mean parts like ikkinz trials. they just state that no upgrade from ssra to god for non raiders is their issue, i am thinking they want this upgrade to be before ikkinz but i could be wrong. i still dont see where there is a need for an upgrade before ikkinz for non raiders. are they REALLY having that much of an aggro problem or do they just want more dps, which technically isnt our job, its the job of other clases and they all just got 16/20 double augable weapons buyable in bazzar just in case they feel they are being shorted by not raiding.<br />
<br />
offensive or not, chanter/ranger is the easiest way to get thru trials and i would wager the way most people get thru them if they arent already time+ geared<br />
<br />
<br />
gun i wouldnt mind 18/24 but some are asking for 18/20 and thats not right for single group drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I agree that 18/20 doesn't belong on a 1 groupable weapon at this point.Especially with an aggro proc.Stuff like that laughs in the face of past content loot/mob balance and shouldn't happen imo.<br />
<br />
The 18/24 example doesn't seem bad tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Only one person that I know of asked for 18/20.  The rest of us have been saying something like 15/20 (BoC ratio) or 16/20 (Velium Gemmed ratio) or 18/24 (which is actually lower ratio than GBoS).<br />
<br />
That's quite a few less than &quot;some&quot;.<br />
<br />
In addition, yes I'm aware that warrior's jobs don't include DPS while tanking.  However, once you hit the &quot;adequate&quot; area of agro procs so you don't lose agro very much to group members who are there for damage, the only thing you really can improve weapon-wise is your DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">I don't think it is too rare at all to have people carried through content/flags/gear upgrades via raiding. I imagine this varies a lot by guild so I can't really speak knowledgeably about it as a whole. I do know i've seen a ton of low level toons wearing Vindi Bp's, using AoW Bow, using Ssra weaps, PoP weaps (jeezus, Im thinking all the rotting Knight weaps off the top of my head, hehe) etc.. I've also seen a lot of people raided into content they are not ready for and can't contribute to defeating, just for the purpose of flagging and progression, knowing that gear will come later.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">the problem frost is that its not that hard to get to KT, just knowing a good enchanter/ranger should not give you rights to get upgrades to weaps like BF and boc. i can see an argument that can be made for some upgrade weaps to drop in the ikkinz trials off the bosses tho. at least then you pretty much earned it and didnt just gimp your way to it. ie its a 6 man encounter, no charm, cant defensive, cant have 5 clerics keeping up one gimp ass tank so he can loot gear he shouldnt be able to get etc. Even then, the nature of the trials and the ability to swap folks in and out of them let a good geared group be able to farm twink/friend loot and gear up people who havent earned it. Hell im guilty of that myself, we had a hybrid cloak rotting the other day in trial 5 or 6 and we invited friend in to come loot it but his 59 ranger couldnt get into the trial hehe.<br />
<br />
Too bad you can't swap on the boss loot. It's totally irrelevant to the point of this topic, but you keep coming up with the worst defenses I've ever seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Frost none of that is the point for me.The game should try to make sense and not make a joke out of peoples efforts in previous expansions.I know this happens already,but, it shouldn't be encouraged.I could care less what you,or, your friends are wearing.However,if it took 50 of us a month ago to drop mobs that had x quality loot then 6 of us shouldn't be able to go out today and get better than x quality loot.It doesn't make any sense gameplay wise.<br />
<br />
Everyone should just bazaar up a warrior and jump into LDON &amp; GOD and receive the same rewards with 5 friends that people work with their guilds for a year for?How will that balance gaming in EQ.Why raid prior to Ikkniz and bother going to ep's and time.Mudflation will take care of this to a degree.At level 70 with new aa I'm sure that lots of folks will be able to get better geared with less people.The mobs and loot recovered from them should still attempt to be balanced tho.<br />

Then he proceeds to describe the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I hope you fuckers are still using Darkblade of the Warlords and Blades of War in 6 fucking years.  It'd be downright hilarious if you were.  You, after all, don't need an upgrade, right?<br />
<br />
Raid content from whose perspective?<br />
<br />
Hopefully kill two birds with one stone; way late and a dollar short on my part ( had last birthing class tonight :D ) but to answer those...<br />
<br />
Well, lemme drop Exhibit A: Blade of Carnage.<br />
How old is that weapon? Is it still a valid choice after all these years? Sure is. <br />
On a similar note; I figure if my Blade of War is still good after 6 years ( and a valid choice for non-raiding content which this thread exists in ) .. than sure, 6 years is ONE HELL OF A SWEET INVESTMENT because I can focus those years on other things besides my non-depreciated aggro weapon. Example of usability is my lame magelo which to me is perfectly acceptable to what I can do and rewards of past hunts (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=458241). I don't play the toon much anymore tho :D. Can't forsee spending much time in the near future playing EQ at that level of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall; it's right back to the topic of the thread..<br />
<br />
NON-RAIDING CONTENT<br />
<br />
YOu know wwhere i'm coming from with this Haass. You've played EQ as many years as I have. Remember raids with 50 people? Remember raids with 72 people? Remember raids with 24 people? It seems to me that IMHO peopel are always lookignt o downt he participant count on encounters that 'should' to a non-raider take a set amount of people. Sure; by increasing the caliber of players attending will obviously it 'should' take less...but overall which is the more important factor? Lowering bodycounts to increase chances of upgrades or keeping attendees present to lessen the chance of failure?<br />
<br />
Sure; I don't like to fail but at the expense of pushing the envelope to it's extremes and justifying that content that a player isn't prepared to deal with; where do you draw the line?<br />
<br />
In retrospect; sure I burnt a LOT of time farming Kael, ToV, ToVN, Ssra, VT, Planes, and the likes...but the overall factor is that a larger amount of people benefitted and lessened the strain of trying to do something that, maybe, wasn't the original intent. I know, I know. Define &quot;intent&quot; :D The Vision is wierd like that.<br />
<br />
But ..years ago when people were just entering North Wing ToV did anyone ever see in the forseeable future someone tri-boxing Dozer? Or in Kael a 6 boxor r0x0r taking down Vindi?<br />
<br />
I dunno; but the focus on trying to cut corners by saying &quot;we should have 'x' when we didn't do 'y' yet&quot; is kinda silly.<br />
<br />
and in closing, Non-Raiding content againt o me is defined as:<br />
<br />
Group Content. 6 member group hunt. <br />
<br />
aagin, it's my definition of &quot;intent&quot;. I hopefully aren't comin' at ya the wrong way but I just think that defining &quot;Non-Raiding&quot; and comparing it to Raid++ is apples and oranges and justifying the latter without the previous is a moot point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally disagree, it should be 18/24 Testicle Sting :)<br />
<br />
Anyway Gunnar, I hear you about not making raiding irrelevant. And I dont think what Murok was talking about would do that. Whether its 15/20 or 18/20 or whatever I dont see adding a good ratio 1 hander with DD and Stun to Ikiniz causing people to bypass raiding content. You still have to raid to see Visible slot armor like Raex, Vadds. etc.. Still need to raid to see High AC items like you find from VT forward, Still need to raid to get the groovy clickies and combat effects, and the weaps a raider has access to will still just own this proposed weap.<br />
<br />
I think the alternatives that people are suggesting such as going back and fighting to farm Cursed, XTC, Eindride, AoW as 10khp (buffed) tanks and their equally uber friends is more damaging to the spirit of the game then adding a new loot to cutting edge single group content in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Agnar 1hs is 17/20+1cold bane with a DD proc.<br />
Jiva 1hs is 17/20 with a DD proc. Both these encounter are totally lame.<br />
I remind our first agnar we were less than 40, and killed him without any lose on first try and it was less than one month that PoP was out ( so no l33t strat ).<br />

<br />
And 18/24 would be a downgrade dps wise from a 14/18 or even 16/20 and some are arguing it's too imbalance ( even with a dd proc ) ? I am amazed really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">My last thought on this for a while.  There has been a lot of talk about how a single group weapon in Ikiniz is like letting people skip content and is therefore out of the question. Shikarii kinda summed up this attitude in this statement &quot;trying to cut corners by saying &quot;we should have 'x' when we didn't do 'y' yet&quot; is kinda silly&quot;. <br />
<br />
I understand this sentiment, but the problem with this logic is that raiders are as guilty of this as anyone, maybe more so. Do guilds stay in VT until all people have exhausted the loot possibiities there? Not today, in fact many guilds skip VT all together. Do guilds make sure every member is wearing full ornate before they go into EP's? Maybe in the infancy of PoP, but not today. Will a guild kill RZtWL until every single tank in the guild has a BoW, reagardless of how long it takes? In many many cases they will not. And as far as weaps go you read in the Overlords forum about how this guild or that guild has gotten stiffed on DBoTW/BoW/BF/HG/etc..But they continue to progress and have fun in the game with very little ill effect.<br />
<br />
And you know why this doesn't hinder their progress or damped their fun?  Because for every slot they have many options that are as good or better just over the horizon. Missed out on BoW? No problem, we get ya an SeWS/EoE/DBoTW/JoS/Demerix/whatever in the near future.  Missed out on Raex legs? No prob, Furious Might/Vadds/Jointed Scale incoming soon.<br />
<br />
And you know what? I think they deserve it and it keeps the game fun for them. I think its great design that there is a path they can take that clearly leads from one upgrade-- to the next-- to the next--to the next, with no major problems if you happen to miss a piece of gear here and there from an expansion.  <br />
<br />
I just wish there was as much time and thought put into a similar path for people who happen to play in single groups. The current single group weapon path being CHoS/SoTB/GBoS(debateable about single groupability)/BoC for those with tons of plat/and Augged Dps weaps for the desparate. The best of those, BoC, being from 6 expansions ago and has to be bought in the bazaar??  To look at that &quot;path&quot; and then say a new weap out of Ikiniz that requires 4 sewer flags, Vxed flag, Tipt Flag, then killing some beat ass boss in Ikinz to earn is out of line or unbalancing is just assinine. And to justify it based on a &quot;skipping of content&quot; logic is just nutts.<br />
<br />
Anyway, yay for insomnia, hehe. Good hunting all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you here.The above listed example at 18/24 with a minor aggro proc seems fine for group content off some kt mobs.The Ikkinz trial boss could carry something a little better probably.<br />
<br />
However,the rest of what you say has nothing to do with reasonably balancing the difficulty of the mob with his drops.<br />
<br />
As far as a BOC go's I think it should be no drop.That every bazaar warrior who can scrape up the plat through whatever method ca grab one just reinforces ebay plat,twinks and the merchant side of the game which leads to problems for everyone.Imo a warrior should get a weapon of this caliber by tanking the mob ,or, at the very least helping drop AOW.I see real warriors all the time who fight from the bottom up to gear themselves  who dream about owning a BOC hehe.That it is droppable/buyable is a boon to non raiders everywhere.<br />
<br />
Raid guilds exist as teams.They stand or fall based upon their performance togeather.So expecting every member to have every desired piece of loot from a specific level of content is immaterial and irrelvent.My guild is dkp.We stay in content until the majority (there will always be folks with very differant playtimes)are reasonably upgraded by it and people are getting bored than we move on.Again the team gets upgraded togeather and trust me it sucks when folks leave.<br />
<br />
The sol ro mobs are markedly easy targets for what they drop.That doesn't mean the game should be taken further down that road to make encounters ridiculously imbalanced with one group mobs dropping what it would take 8 groups of their friends to get in the last expansion at the same gear/aa/level strength.If you want his weapon and it's so easy for you go kill Jiva(insert watever mob) until it drops.<br />
<br />
Lelith, can you one group Agnar,Cursed,XTC etc?If you can then go back and do it until you get your drop.I would like to see newer mobs of similiar strength with similiar drops for folks in the new expansions.If you can't one group your way to these drops then the game shouldn't be made easier for you just because you prefer grouping.They shouldn't toss in gimp mobs with as good or better drops as the old ones that are easier just to placate some folks who don't want to raid.As you gear up and reach level 70 with some aa I'm sure some of these mobs and newer examples will become more likely targets for you and mudflation will win out.<br />
<br />
The weapons and loot should reflect genarally the strength of the target.Kinda obvious I know.Like I said the 18/24 example seems fine to me off of some KT named.Trial bosses(not named who anyone can zone in and poach easily) could drop slighty better stuff.It should just be kept in line with the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
Personally,imo I think new expansions should not erase the desire or need to do older content.A lot of that stuff was fun and challenging.Some of those mobs like cursed ring lil bells in the heads of warriors all thru EQ.Yeah soon folks will go back and mudflate it to gear themselves.Thats ok tho it's standard in EQ and the way that non raiders and more casual players will eventually see everything and get all the &quot;raid lewtz&quot;.EQ should keep what integrity it has tho.Everything doesn't have to be constantly made easier for newer players just to make them feel like stars before EQ2 comes out.You should get x gear when you can kill x type mobs.Just because a new expansion comes out x mobs shouldn't be remade in a weaker type carrying the same loot.People wil level and gear/aa to advantage themselves no one has to disadvantage the mobs the make gear ridiculously easier to aqquire than before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check what I said and it's exactly this. Even I would say it should be better than a 18/24 ratio as there are already 16/20 weapon flooding the market, why should people being flagged for this place having a downgrade dps ( 0.75 ratio vs 0.8 ) wise as no drop loot?<br />
<br />
<br />
Lelith, can you one group Agnar,Cursed,XTC etc?If you can then go back and do it until you get your drop.I would like to see newer mobs of similiar strength with similiar drops for folks in the new expansions.If you can't one group your way to these drops then the game shouldn't be made easier for you just because you prefer grouping.They shouldn't toss in gimp mobs with as good or better drops as the old ones that are easier just to placate some folks who don't want to raid.As you gear up and reach level 70 with some aa I'm sure some of these mobs and newer examples will become more likely targets for you and mudflation will win out.<br />
<br />
Agnar not ( due to the nature of the encounter but killing it in a not intended way could work maybe /shrug ), xtc already done several time, cursed, MT group on a 2groups killed got exoded so the other group fight him alone for about 10%, else cursed cycle is definitly one groupable ( we don't do it as having cursed loot rotting would suck ).<br />
Would one group for the content targetted doing this? I don't think ( well maybe xtc with mudflation but not cursed cycle ).<br />
And again you definitly haven't read what I said since you agreed with me on your first paragraph, I never said putting good drop on gimp ass mobs nor anyone in this thread, I said putting good drop on a challenging event for one group in the current expension, and unless YOU and I are mistaken, ikkinz trial boss / named are challenging content ( specially if this kind of weapon would be an upgrade for the warrior / other melee doing it ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Kewl if we agree thats great.I would imagine some posters on your side of the fence would push the issue beyond reason.My glyphed prayer ring is an example of imbalance imo.It is not too bad because it does not represent typical upgrades for all slots in KT nor should it.A weapon of equal stature should not drop off 1 groupable (for people not way overgeared for the encounter who actually need the upgrades)mobs.<br />
<br />
I don't believe you if you are trying to tell me that Ikkinz trials are equal to or harder than cursed,agnar,or even xtc for six people.Mind you it's been awhile for me  in SSRA.If it is so easy than you have your mobs there to get these weapons from.If as i believe cursed ring is much more difficult for 6 people to complete than an Ikkniz trial trial boss than the loot should be much better.As aggro weapons are prized loot  that have a big impact on performance than they especially should not be placed lightly on gimped mobs.<br />
<br />
18/20 weapons with procs are ep raid quality items that take 50 odd folks with ep gear to get.I couldn't take one group  to mud rings and get the rune hammer thingy.Why should it be suddenly so easy to get a weapon with similiar ratio,but, superior aggro proc off a mob i can easily one group?<br />
<br />
Imo the Ikkniz trials are a lot easier for me than trying to do a cursed ring would be and the loot should reflect that.If cursed drops a 16/20 eb mod proccer and AOW drops a 15/20 eb than god mobs should balance with the difficulty of getting those weapons.18/20 with stun is outa wack for what i can do with 1 group.Something similiar to a GBOS should be hard to get to and hard to find up.If they made a weapon of similiar strength available in GOD ,but, just as difficult to get to and beat thats fine.Ikkniz trial bosses could drop something closer to a 16/20 with stun maybe.Thats balancing for the Dev's and i'm just tossing that out lightly.It would have to be a rare drop imo at that rate.<br />
<br />
I read your post and I see whats implied.The mobs in god should not drop better loot for their difficulty than mobs in prievious expansions.For the sake of continuity,game play integrity and not totally devaluing old content.As you become strong enough to beat the older mobs for their goodies you should also be able to find newer similiar mobs with similiar drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">What difficulty would you guys compare Ikkinz trial bosses to?  i.e. what mobs would you say are about as difficult as those guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Imo, it's too hard to directly compare mobs like Ikkinz bosses to older raid mobs. The Ikkinz mobs have much less life, but take better gear to be doable. Mobs like XtC don't take super stats to be able to do, they just take forever to kill. Ikkinz bosses drop pretty fast, but need a much higher level of gear to even attempt. The very nature of the game is set up so some mobs take a lot of people with moderate gear, and others take few people with great gear. Something like the Bertox event is set up to require a decent sized force. Something like the BoT towers is not.<br />
<br />
At this point I would say the hardest part about Ssra mobs is getting there and finding them up. With the new paradigm of instancing we see that SoE does not want the limiting factor on progress to be finding the mob. This being said, I would put Ikkinz mobs on at least the calibur of those old raid mobs. They are tuned toward 6 instead of 40 so the nature of the fight is different, but the min gear level required is much higher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are not equal targets and don't deserve equal loot.The difficulty in gettin to mobs and finding them up is also part of the equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">That's the point though. You CAN'T have a slew of clerics healing you on these bosses. I'd bet if you talked to SoE they would say the reason that these trials have better loot IS because of the cap. You can't compare something where you can have unlimited numbers to something where you can ONLY have 6.<br />
<br />
If I take 6 people to cursed and I can't win, I can add another, and another, and another until I can win. If I take 6 people into a trial and I can't win, then I am SoL until I am better geared. Why do you think so many raiders complained and had such a hard time with these trials? Because they're used to packing on extra people when they can't get something done. The hard cap of 6 HAS to be figured into it because it makes an actual difference in the difficulty of an encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">You also have to remember that the Cursed, AOW, XTC are &quot;raid&quot; mobs. There really are no single group mobs that drop that kind of weapon for the expansion time period. If we were still back in the Luclin age, no way would anyone ever think about doing the XTC or Cursed without a raid force let alone a small group. Just because you can do them now with a small force does not mean the type of agro weapons they drop should be added to GoD. Yes, I do believe adding an enraging blow to a current expansion single group encounter is overpowering. It will also take away from the other expansions.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz instances at one time were pretty brutal, you needed a pretty strong group to kill and move on. The loot there reflected the difficulty. Now with entrance to Kod'Taz being nerfed and GoD as a whole being redone, it's pretty easy to kill the Ikkinz named with a semi decent group. The loot now is greater than the encounter.<br />
<br />
You guys talk about progressing as a group. That's fine, but where are you going even if there was some kind of magical agro weapon in Ikkinz? You still need to raid to move on. If you really were concerned about progressing in the game, you would have done the natural progression like most others have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">You can compare it.You are still playing in the EQ gameworld.Just because you choose to group doesn't mean drops should be rebalanced to suit you.Regardless of how you choose to play the same strength mobs should drop roughly the same quality of loot.Just because you want to group doesn't mean you should get mobs gimped to suit your playstyle.<br />
<br />
PS. You're looking for a differant game Fyn.EQ should put mobs out that drop loot according to the overall difficulty of beating them.If you choose not to raid thats ok but you wont get the same loot until you can mudflate it.When you can get to cursed and 1 group him you can have a bloodfrenzy...or get 70 and take some friends.<br />

PPS.I'm guild leader now for a time guild on stromm.I can easily form a group and drop those trial bosses.I've losin my mind tryin to get us thru p4 with low attendance for mobs to drop a cpl pieces of lot for the raid.It doesn't begin to compare for me.Never mind the fact that EQ sets challenges and leaves them there for you to beat on your own time in your own way.The fact remains you shouldn't get equal loot off a mob that takes 6 of you than one that takes 50 of the same folks.It doesn't make any sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">To put my last post in other words. Take that 8k tank and the raid force behind him that took down cursed and take any 6 of the people you want out of that raid force and stick them against the Ikkinz bosses. Could they win? I'm gonna say a definitive no. <br />
<br />
So by that, it takes a lesser geared group to kill cursed than it does to kill Ikkinz bosses. And from that, Ikkinz bosses should be able to drop better loot.</div></div><hr />

EQ loot shouldn't be structured to suit whatever numbers you prefer it should be made to suit the mob and the environment it's in.Perhaps,we should have solo trials that drop loot equal to what 6 people or a raid can do and all play by ourselves.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, that lone warrior CAN take a raid force to kill that blue mob in HoH. For that reason, they can't balance the blue con HoH mob against a single character. However, he CAN'T take a raid force to kill something in an instanced zone. Obviously if they hadn't put caps on the amount of people you can take into instanced zones, they would have to tune the encounters like they did in the early days of the game and expect people to bring as many people as they could field. The thing is, they did put in caps, and you can't just cushion things with more people.  Do you remember the old days of people talking trash about zerg guilds left and right. Have you ever heard people laugh at some guild for zerging their way through Uqua? The game has changed, new technology has entered the world. Encounters can now actually be balanced against how many people are actually allowed to fight the monster at once. It is just simply not fair to compare a zone where no more than 6 people can ever enter at once to a zone where 100+ people can try to take down one mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">You made some good points, Gunnar, without the egotistical attitude I find prevalent in many raiders.  I'd like to respond to them in turn.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you decide or have to one group a mob is immaterial.The overall mob's difficulty regardless of the number of players involved should be the determining factor.EQ is not a test of individual skill for trophys.<br />
I believe you're wrong in that.  The RAIDING game is not a test of individual skill or trophy.  The difficulty involved there is being able to use everyone's abilities together to pull off something  When you increase the amount of players doing something, you decrease the amount of work each player must do.  The individual skill required is lessened because raiding doesn't test those skills, it tests being able to work together.  Different challenges arise, such as AE (spells and rampage), as well as numerous adds and quirks.<br />
<br />
However, many raiders completely fail to realize, or outright don't want to realize, that when you decrease the amount of players you can draw resources from, you increase the individual requirements on skill and equipment.  This does in fact increase the challenge and difficulty involved, as well as the risk.  While it may be hard for a raid of 40 to take on a mob like Cursed, it is that much more harder for only 6 people in the same level of equipment to take on a mob of that difficulty.  The individual skill comes out more, the individual skill required is higher, as is the equipment necessary.  The difficulty of the encounter rises dramatically, especially in instanced zones where you CANNOT add more people in to lower the difficulty.<br />
<br />
The amount of people you bring in can indeed change the difficulty of the encounter.  If you were able to bring in 90 people to a mob in GoD that is balanced for 54, it could be much much easier.  I don't believe many can argue that.  With more people comes more healing, damage, crowd control, etc.<br />
<br />
Restricting the number of people can increase the challenge.  While it may be simple for a raid of 40 to handle a mob, with only 6 people those guys are under a lot more stress and have to work their asses off to accomplish it.  Therefor, the loot must take into account the amount of people required to take it down.<br />
<br />
  If a zone/encounter has a 6 person limit, and the difficulty is incredibly high, you better believe there has to be some equivalently good shit dropping in there for that difficulty.  Just like you'd say on raiding, no one would bother if the gear you got was subpar for the difficulty, except those who cannot get the gear any other way.<br />
<br />
Just because it's tougher for a lone warrior to solo a blue mob in HOH than it is for him to tank MM with a raid force doesn't mean that lone mob should drop equal loot.  No, that's not what is being said.  I'm sure you and many other raiders would be quite okay with very good equipment dropping if the challange involved in getting it was large, and the risks as well.  If that lone warrior could not in any way bring others to help, then the difficulty is pretty damn high.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with grouping(it's often more fun) and there should be a path to follow.However,it must remain balanced with the rest of the game including mobs presently targeted by raids only.  I agree.  A weapon that is around as difficult as a certain level of raiding should have an equivalent amount of difficulty required in order to get it.  There could be raid only mobs, which require multiples of groups that drops certain loot, and there could be forced 1-group mobs which drop a different level of gear.  A raider probably wouldn't do the 1-group stuff unless he wants to supplement the gear he's getting from raiders.<br />
<br />
Single group mobs can indeed be as difficult, if the developers would take the time to develop different mechanics to make it that difficult.  Just as several AEs can make a 60+ member raid difficult, a developer can create tasks that can challenge a group of 6 people.  I could be a stubborn ass and say that the developers have not created this because they've been focusing on the whining from raiders, but that would be incorrect since I do not know how much development on raiding content has detracted from development on equivalent difficulty grouping content.<br />
<br />
He's an idea.  Take 6 people and do a raid that you would normally bring 3-4 groups.  Is it that much more difficult for you?  Near impossible?  If that mob was slightly altered (like getting rid of stuff that would hurt a raid more than a single group and received abilities that focused on 6 people), and you could not bring in any more than those 6 people, would you expect some pretty good stuff to drop from that mob, given how much harder it would be to take down?<br />
<br />
That is the scenario that non-raiders see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Yes, I do believe adding an enraging blow to a current expansion single group encounter is overpowering.<br />
As do I.  Many have said that with 2 stun procs and 2 A3 procs and WA, the agro is sufficient for a non-raider.  I've been seeing raiders suggest going to get EB weapons from Ssra and such as the solution, although I know one person put EB in a list of theoretical weapons next to the stun proc version of the same weapon)<br />
<br />
A raiding warrior needs Enraging Blow+ procs, alongside heightened proc rate weapons (Bloodfrenzy and DBotW, for example...people tend to forget that's another benefit to raid weapons) to beat 30-50+ other classes who are throwing around high agro spells, with high % foci and Ancient spells.  The melee are using very high damage weapons (most, if not all, of whose ratios beat 1.0...there's a 29/23 ranger 1hs in GoD ffs).  <br />
<br />
That's a lot of agro that a raiding warrior must beat, but through raiding he can get the weapons he needs.<br />
<br />
However, with a few small exceptions, what's been suggested is a weapon with a stun proc (or my suggestion, Taunting Blow, since it's around the same amount of agro).  The agro would remain about the same, but the damage a warrior is capable of would increase.  He can contribute more to the group, without losing the ability to do his job well.<br />
<br />
You guys talk about progressing as a group. That's fine, but where are you going even if there was some kind of magical agro weapon in Ikkinz? You still need to raid to move on.  They'll go as high as the game allows them to go.  Artifically requiring raiding stops groups from progressing.  In PoP, the progression forced raiding down your throat.  If you didn't want to raid, you could enter the first four zones, Valor, Storms, and Tactics, with possibly getting BoT if your group was beefy or found rotting medallions.  Then they opened up the zones for levels, which made things easier.  Tactics and BoT was where the loot was though, with a couple things in CoD.<br />
<br />
Raiding isn't shoved down your throat in GoD, in fact there's numerous 1-group trials to go through.  So you'll see non-raiders progressing all the way up to the first forced raid progression, unless there's a way to get further otherwise.<br />
<br />
If you really were concerned about progressing in the game, you would have done the natural progression like most others have.  I apologize for not being a lemming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">I can argue with you all day about the challenges of raiding and single grouping.Ikkinz trials challenge my tanks a lot less than performing their raid roles well in time does.Thats another arguement.If you get lucky and have more people that help you gear in the game,buy pp online,faster &amp; smarter teammates that jive well and the right combination of classes for what you want to do with previous experience in the bunch challenge is differant.Challenge is greater than you think in keeping a guild going through tough content over time.EQ's not about individual challenge = quality of loot though.<br />
<br />
It's about rendering an adventure world that has some integrity to it and presents opportunity to grow as a charater.If you make an individual trial with a mob that a warrior could barely beat it should not yield the same rewards as that of an equally geared group's target because the groups target is stronger and posses greater reward.You band together with friends to beat these group mobs for fun and to get better xp and loot.By the same token a raid target for the same folks should be much stronger &amp; have much better rewards to encourage the larger number of folks to band together.That xp is almost nonexistent in a raid format is aside from the point.Bigger mobs drop bigger loot and encourage more people to band together to fight these special battles.The emphasis on raiding since POP is questionable imo,but, the basic structure of loot =overall mob strength should not be thrown out.<br />
<br />
It's a lot easier to get 6 people together than 60.A lot easier to keep them at full potential as well.Raids are often setup to test the whole raid forces out put which is part of the greater challenge inherant in raiding.Raids can be instanced too.Often raid forces fail because folks fail to competetantly tie in all their exertions into a cohesive whole.This stuff doesn't matter in the ratio of loot/mob difficulty tho.The mobs should simply give rewards based upon their overall difficulty.You can't just throw raid loot at a group mob because its instanced.No one would raid and the basic structure of EQ would fall apart.Stronger mobs that are more difficult to get at should have better loot simple.<br />
<br />
I could care less how difficult or raid worthy you think ssra mobs are.We raided them coming up through content and it challenged us /shrug.If they don't require a raid for you then go kill them and take their drops like anyone else has to.Most folks looking for those weapons now would need more than a single group imo.<br />
I only hope that future mobs with comparative drops are just as hard in every way.When you can one group cursed you can get a bf.It should be just as hard to get a similiar weapon off a newer mob.The number of the folks involved is irrelavent.Thats why there are extra hard mobs that require more people to band together...for the extra special loot.<br />
<br />
I am all for group content.I think it's time for soe to more thourghly explore the grouping progression path.However,groups should not get the same rewards as a raid of there fellows would until they can kill the same mob.EQ is not one big instanced LDON where all mob/loot tables are equalized against the number of players.It's a game world with big and little mobs that have big and little loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Some folks want to disregard the idea of that kind of continuity in a gameworld for the sake of more competitve upgrade paths for groups that artificially advantage them.That is what I have a beef with.Kill the same mob or an equal one and get similiar loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess this is what I don't understand.  If I go through a certain amount of challenge/difficulty as someone else, why should I be able to get a equivalent or close to equivalent reward?  Yes, I completely agree that the reward for a 6 person group that works together for 2 hours should not be the same as for a 54 person raid that works for 2 hours...but what if that group worked together for weeks?  Shouldn't they be able to get really good rewards also?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">Gunnar, <br />
<br />
I agree with you on everything except for one thing and I think that's why we have such opposed views:<br />
<br />
I think you are saying a Bloodfrenzy is &quot;extra special loot&quot;?<br />
<br />
What I am saying is I can buff up to about 10.7k and 2k AC which I'll say is about equivalent to a late elemental early time warrior. For me doing late elemental/early time 6 man stuff, I get a Ssra level 60 person weapon (going along with this BF thing). For them doing 60 man time level stuff, they get time level 60 man weapons. On top of this, the raider has the added bonus of having the end of the road be miles and miles further than the non-raider. <br />
<br />
So I agree with you that the struggles of keeping a guild together, keeping 60 people focused, dealing with politics, more complex events, etc etc should have a huge bearing on equipment, and it does. Just look at any top raiders profile compared to any top non-raider. It's not even close to the same league. <br />
<br />
However, in todays environment with the level cap being 65, insane amounts of aa, massive mudflation, if you're saying that it is tough to keep the guild morale up, get people coordinated enough, and get the right people online to do the cursed cycle as a raiding guild then I have to laugh because that is just pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">Er no thats not what i said ,but, it may be true for some folks/shrug.If you can get cursed than you can get a bloodfrenzy which is still the best aggro 1 hander pre dbotw.So it is a very good warrior weapon which you could probably get with a couple groups so go do it.I'd like them to add more mobs similiar in overall difficulty to the cursed event in GOD that would drop similiar quality loot.So that if you can kill cursed you could kill it as well.<br />
<br />
Btw Fynepisa,I've been close to your stats for awhile and the grouping stuff I've done in GOD including Ikkniz trials are way easier on me than simply tanking through time trials and p4 have been.It's not relavent to the question at hand ,but, it's true.When you can focus on one mob with one small group of people it's just a lot less complicated.That again is another argument...just saying i do the same group stuff you do.<br />
<br />
Keep playing word games if it makes you happy.Imo same power of mob same loot quality.Some particualr hard ass quests could fill in a few blanks as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">Yes, we can argue forever on which is more difficult. It wouldn't matter, because no matter what, you're going to believe raiding is more difficult (although how much of that difficulty is from the game itself and how much is simply brought on by you having more people is another matter), and I'm going to believe a single group can convey a similar level of difficulty if the developers would just work on it.<br />
<br />
BTW, as long as half the expansion is &quot;raid only&quot; as this one is, you won't see people unwilling to raid, no matter the gear possible in non-raiding.  The gear you can get in the raid only section beyond the grouping section kicks the shit out of anything a non-raider can get during that expansion.  If I had my way, expansions would be designed just like this.  First parts, plenty of gear upgrades and stuff for single groups to do, with the second parts being the raiding sections that are so desired by some people with plenty of even higher gear upgrades and stuff for raids to do.  You have your cookie/carrot right there.  Contrary to what you may think, plenty of people consider raiding to be much more fun than grouping.  Should the non-raiders be completely penalized in the game though, if they consider raiding to be the most boring thing ever?<br />
<br />
It's the next expansion, yet people complain that a previous expansion's raiding gear at the high end (two expansions ago, actually) isn't clearly better than the scraps given to non-raiders?<br />
<br />
Get over it.  You'll be progressing far further, and getting much better equipment, than a non-raider can ever get in this expansion.  Yes, there's awesome gear in groups.  However, there's even more awesome gear in raiding.  What is the problem with non-raiders receiving an equivalent weapon, or even a slight upgrade, to a weapon gotten from BoT Towers? (not only two expansions ago, but two expansions ago in a freely open zone)  How does that even remotely affect you?<br />
<br />
Answer:  It doesn't, except you'll let it rot.  In fact, it may help you since new recruits won't be so far behind in gear when they get to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, a lot of my argument comes from Ikkinz in its original incarnation when it was ass beat. Maybe now it really isn't worthy of nice upgrades. Either way, a decent weapon that was better than BoC and worse and BF wouldn't be overpowered in the current form.<br />
<br />
However, I feel you are saying the following:<br />
<br />
A raid setting is much more difficult logistically (from a guild and sheer number perspective) as well as the difficulty of mobs are much greater so the reward should be much greater than similar tiered mobs that a single group could kill.<br />
<br />
Then from that you conclude that putting a Ssra level weapon on a time level single group mob is totally out of line. <br />
<br />
I am just having trouble understanding how it makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Two things that come to mind reading all this;<br />
<br />
Raiders don't want to acknowledge that single group content can be just as challenging as raid content. That's fine, they don't have to believe it. That doesn't mean it's not true either. Having seen both worlds, having spent a very long period of time in both, I know first hand that challenging one group content is every bit as difficult, if not more so, on an *individual basis.* That's not to say it's as difficult as raid content in its entirety, but as you reduce the mass of people involved in killing something, more individual attention is required, skill per player makes a bigger difference, and gear also plays far greater of a role. Thus, the main thrust of the raider's argument then, must logically imply that single group content in its entirety isn't as difficult as raid content in its entirety.<br />
<br />
That's all well and good. It's understandable that raiders that have been playing the high-end game for a long time would have that mentality. But you shouldn't preclude non-raiding players from getting higher-quality loot that still doesn't match raid-content loot, particularly weapons designed for Warriors to hold aggro. The Warrior class is the single most loot dependant in the game. <br />

Remember this: a group of time geared + players can get together for a group and invite an Enchanter with 3khp with minimal gear and that Enchanter could still get the job done as well as 95% of other Enchanters on his server that don't have a Serpent of Vindication (and if the group has a shaman that's not even an issue) or even better. Hell, the more poorly geared Enchanter might even do BETTER than some of the Plane of Time geared Enchanters. The Enchanter doesn't need any special armor, weapon, or otherwise, to do his job at an acceptable level to all styles of gameplay.<br />
<br />
However, a group of time geared + players invite a lesser geared Warrior, and that totally skews the equation. The Warrior cannot perform on the same level as well as the Enchanter can.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's the way the class is setup. It's not necessarily bad, and you'll even notice my earlier posts on this thread actually suggested first a weapon with some kind of stun. But for the people that suggest EB procs, I don't really disagree with them either. There's nothing wrong with putting a weapon that would help our class do our job better on a mob that is a)rarely spawned b)hard to gain access to the zone c)not easily pharmed d)doesn't have charm in the encounter to gimp it and e)isn't nodrop. It's not like you're killing a moss snake for goodness sakes.<br />

<br />
And to all you raiders that are calling using charmed pets in vxed/tipt cheesy, I seriously hope you didn't charm like 8 ogres and sick them on Rallos Zek to get your first kill on him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The overall strength of the mob and difficulty involved in defeating it should roughly = the quality of rewards.A mob that can be taken down by 6 people(instanced or not) should not drop gear equal to a mob that would eat those same 6 for lunch and many of their friends.<br />
<br />
If these old mobs with good loot are easy for you to single group fine.You can go do that like everyone else did or kill a new mob of equal overall difficulty and get it's drop.<br />
<br />
Balance mobs and drops against old content so the game makes sense and doesn't devalue older stuff.There should be a sense of continuity to what you get for what you kill.So what if its hard for 6 of you to kill a mob.It's hard for a level 40 warrior to solo his mob as well.Just because the challenge is relatively greater for a particular person or group vs a larger force or higher level ,better geared people doesnt mean the rewards scale up for them.Kill the same kinda mob get the same kinda loot.<br />
<br />
60 folks that band together can kill a much stronger mob than 6 of their fellows.The reward for that big mob and the investment of all those people should be greater.The orc running down the road shouldn't drop the same stuff has the big bad town eating dragon....regardless of how much more challenging it is for 6 people to fight the dragon than 60</div></div><hr />

This is the same thread as the raider vs non-raider.  Some people don't think their &quot;penis-magelo&quot; should be close to a &quot;non-raiders&quot;.<br />

All that we have EVER asked for is a path for upgrades so we aren't using droga/bot/&quot;BoC bazaar bought&quot; weapons for 2+ years in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">I agree there should be a path of upgrades.I dont have a holier than thou attitude thats your platform.I want the mobs to determine the loot not the bloody players doh.Just cause something is harder for one person than another or one group than 3 groups doesn't mean their reward should be relatively greater.The mobs should drop loot based upon their overall difficulty regardless of how many people attack them.That or modify loot tables for everyone one so any seriously challenged level 1 can loot a BOC.Gawd its simple.Let the gameworld make sense.Let harder to beat mobs that people need lots of help on drop better loot so they band together to do it.Let folks determine their own paths in overcoming mobs and upgrading themselves.But don't scale rewards up for smaller groups ,weaker players .lower levels watever.The  mobs should be balanced with the rest of eq as best is possible in what they drop.Find your own way thru that.The whole idea is to get stronger and get more help to do bigger things.<br />
<br />
The payoff for leveling up is getting stronger.The payoff for finding a good group is better xp and loot then soloing.The payoff for raiding is taking down mobs you'd never have a chance at in a group and gettin better loot.This stuff is a general truth of EQ.Perfect balance no.But its the basis of group stucture for rewards in this game .Just because you decide to fight mobs that 6 of you can do doesn't mean that it should drop simliar loot to a mob that would take 60 of you to kill.<br />
<br />
I'm all for upgrade paths for people in groups.I like grouping too.It should just remain in balance with the rest of the gameworlds mob/loot ratio.The folks who keep suggesting that 6 ppl killing a group mob should get the same rewards as 60 of the same folks killing a challenging mob for them are the ones with a holier than tho complex.They want to advantage their style of play artificially over the game world and play the &quot;have not&quot; card.The integrity of the game is more important than pandering to such folks just before eq2 comes out to make them more excited with the franchise.<br />
<br />
I want to see more group content.I want to see more group rewards including weapons.However,if a group cannot kill aow themselves than they should not be able to kill a new expansion mob for a BOC/weapon equal to or better than a BOC.Eventually they will be able to kill AOW and equal mobs and then could expect equal drops.The loot reards should be balanced with the mobs,it is totally up to the players what/who they bring to the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">EQ stopped being monks bring the named to camp single, then warriors tanks it (clerics heal) and everyone else dps till its dead.<br />
<br />
Raid since RZtW in tactics need everyone to be at least competent... and guess what as the number of ppl in your raid goes the chance that someone will goof up goes up too. This is one reason why raiding is harder than any single grouping can ever be.<br />
<br />
The other is the effort (and, yes, skill) needed to keep a raiding guild going which is far far beyond getting a few of your EQ friends together to do one group stuff.<br />
<br />
The problem here is plane of time. Ppl want the one group equivalent of that. <br />
<br />
i.e. time drops items for all slots and in such quantities that you can gear up just on this zone. Therefore there should be one group content that works just the same. LDoN just reinforces this attitude... ppl equate raiding with LDoN griding and DKP with LDoN points. But it is not the same... yes time ends up being farm but this is not the same as being able to pick up your 5 friends and do one group content no matter how 'challenging'.<br />
<br />
Take any guild thats progressed through PoP and then GoD and you may find a few less that briliant members but you will see more that are better 'skilled' (not just better geard) than the best one group non-raiding players.<br />
<br />
GoD is a raiding expansion mostly, with a few periferal non-raid zones. You may be able to obtain previously raid qallity loots in the one group trials or in a zone like KT but these are not their to gear up non-raiders... basically they are freebies for raiders doing progression. This content was never meant to be a method for gearing up every slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">FFS, all that's being suggested is a weapon that's a slight upgrade to a GBoS off of an instanced zone that does not in any way impact your precious raiding zones or loot.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting on the reason how it could possibly hurt you.  A fucking Bloodfrenzy off a moss snake is NOT being asked for, a reasonable upgrade for the difficulty of the mob IS being asked for.  Can you comprehend that or have you been delusional for too long?<br />
<br />
This content was never meant to be a method for gearing up every slot. Yet, it has gear for every slot that is an upgrade to stuff non-raiders had before, with the exception of an upgraded agro weapon which *GASP* is the only thing being asked for.  Wow, sure looks like it wasn't meant to be used to gear up every slot.  Get off this high horse you're on and get a clue.<br />
<br />
Time level equipment is not being asked for.  Hell, the level of equipment is barely Elemental.  It's an upgrade to a drop from a BoT Tower Lord, from some mob in Ikkinz.  Can you comprehend that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">What needs to happen is more raiding content for smaller raids and less geared raiders... this kind of thing should be the progression path. Hopefully OoW will provide these smaller raids and together with lvl 70 hopefully knocking the big PoP raids down in numbers (stuff like RZ, MM, bertox still need around 50 ppl if they arent time+ geared). <br />
<br />
Hopefully this should nail the coffin shut on PoP/GoD style tiered expansions (which make noone happy apart from the few sociopaths that enjoy having access to zones that the rest cant enter)... if it doesn't then EQ is probably done anyway.<br />
<br />
But to, reitterate, I don't think there should be a one-group progression in EQ. Smaller raids (even as few as 2-3 groups) yes, and a far less rigid raid progression YES. But one group all the way... no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
? Read my previous posts I didn't disagree with this.I do disagree that the trial named should drop a 18/20 stun weapon.Because other mobs that drop similiar weapons to this are not one groupable by me and the trial named are.The closest weapon I could think of offhand was an 18/20 rune proc hammer in earth that takes a raid force to get and is crud for aggro unlike one with a stun proc would be.If a weapon drops of GBOS quality he should be just as hard to get to, find up and kill as the bot mob.<br />
<br />
I agreed with the 18/24 example if you remember and even suggested a  better weapon should drop off the trial named.The weapon and the difficulty in getting it should just reflect balance from past expansions.<br />
<br />
My recent arguing of keeping things in balance was with regard to the stance other posters were taking in the thread that such balance was immaterial.What matters to them is how tough it is for them and their 5 friends and that should be the basis of loot reward quality.Thats not the way it gos.All through the game people find differant things more difficult than people ahead of them in levels/aa/gear &amp; numbers.We don't give them extra rewards for doing the same stuff.Fook clearing p4 with 50 people is pretty hard for my guild atm.I tend to die on VZ.So since it is more challenging to us than high end GOD guilds i think p4 loot tables should be revised for us to reflect that challenge...<br />
<br />
We'll get the same kinda loot when we kill the same kinda mobs and so should you,that's my point.</div></div><hr />

Do you remember when they toned down GoD because it was tuned for level 70 and the cap stayed level 65?<br />
<br />
It's because it was unfair to balance mobs against a set of criteria the could NOT be obtained.<br />
<br />
Do you remember when Ikkinz raids were hard with 42, but then much more balanced with 54?<br />
<br />
It's because hard person caps do make a difference.<br />
<br />
Do you remember LDoN raid mobs being &quot;overall&quot; easier than time gods, but extremely difficult and dropped comparable time loot because the hard cap was 36?<br />
<br />
It's because hard person caps do make a difference.<br />
<br />
Do you remember /serverfilter making the game a whole lot easier and thus raids starting to get tuned for much larger number?<br />
<br />
It's because hard person caps do make a difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How many more time does it need to be said? <br />
How many other places in the game does it need to already exist?<br />
<br />
You're argument makes no sense, and the current game has plenty of places to prove it.<br />
Hard person caps already affect what drop in all sorts of placing in the game whether you want to admit to it or not. Every single one of your examples is total crap and is not a valid comparison because none of them involve HARD caps. <br />
<br />
If you can't do p4 with 50, you get 22 more. <br />
If an orc is hard at level 1, you can get 64 more levels + aa.<br />
If a HoH mob is hard to solo, you can bring as many friends as you want.<br />
<br />
How does this not make any sense?<br />
<br />
Before the Ikkinz nerfs do you not remember the threads talking about upping the amount of people in the zone or group limits to 8? It's because being able to bring 8 people IS DIFFERENT than being able to bring 6.<br />
<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with me wanting loot that you think is unfair, by the way. This has to do with the fact that it is totally unbelieveable to me that you can sit there and time after time post the same stupid defense that makes absolutely no sense. How about this, lets change the topic of this altogether, and give me a good reason why the following statement is untrue. If you can do that, then I will agree that everything asked for so far in this thread is totally rediculous:<br />

HARD CAPS ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EVENT IS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE OVERALL DIFFICULTY OF THE EVENT.</div></div><hr />

The rest just stems from the answer most raiders have when someone who doesn't is concerned with where they'll get upgrades to old equipment.<br />

Where did I claim that a single group should obtain raid level items?<br />
<br />
I agreed multiple times that it is more difficult to keep a raid force going for many reasons both tied to the difficulty of the mobs as well as the difficulty of the logistics and social aspects of leading a raid force sized group. That is totally irrelevant though because no one is asking for raid level rewards.<br />
<br />
The premise of this thread was that there is a lack of weapons in GoD and that it doesn't seem out of line to add a weapon that would be an upgrade to a BoC or GBoS inside of the Ikkinz trials.

Edit: WIth regards to that necro thread, maybe we'll have that conversation when there is a zone in the game where only 1 character is allowed in at a time.

Yep, I do understand what it's like not to be able to get something that is almost essential to your class. It's hard to get a good hate proc weapon as a non-raiding warrior (very limited choice)... it's the same way for a SK wanting to get a nuke foci.

On this one I'm not.   Weapons, simply put, have not kept up for some classes.   A rogue can get a 16/20 85hp piercer in the Bazaar, which is better than ANY Ssra dropped weapon for them.   Similar with a ranger and Stonewood bows. The thing to remember is that while a warrior can wield the same piercer and the same bow, when combined with the rogue's role or the Ranger's role, completely outclasses that which is available to the warrior.   <br />
<br />
There are, simply put, not enough weapons which work to a warrior's strength available at the various levels.   <br />
<br />
It is wrong for level 65 warriors to be using Droga weapons as the most viable alternative.   We may not be a DPS class per se, but we MUST remain at a competitive level of DPS to those who should be &quot;lower&quot; or 'slightly higher&quot; than us.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, with the advent of the shield AA in Omens, there are simply ZERO viable weapons that lower end warriors can use with a shield to take advantage of this, thus giving knights a tremendous advantage.<br />
<br />
Warriors need a 24/30ish primary only weapon with a hate producing proc in the &quot;casual&quot; end to fill all of these needs.<br />
<br />
One area that I agree with is that it should exist in Omens and not in Gates, it's simply too late for Gates, and people won't be hunting there casually for a while.</div></div><hr />

Nope not a hypocrite.I have to play in the same world as you.If better drops come out to fill all the slots in group content than in time raid content than it will impact raiding negatively of course.If you read the thread you would know I feel the glyphed prayer ring is an example of something totally out of balance with the ease of getting.I'm still going to get what I can in the time I play to tank better for my friends tho ...don't be an idiot.I just would rather see balance better preserved.As I've said before it's not too bad atm because the ring does not exemplify typical upgrades from group drops in GOD for all slots.The imbalance is somehwat limited.My bp,helm and neck were gotten early on stromm by raiding btw.<br />
<br />
Yeah Fynepisa,I believe that harder mobs that take more people and gear/aa/levels to kill should drop better gear than those that take less.I am for new GOD weapons for grouping warriors btw has i stated earlier.Just that they shoul balance against similiar drops from similiar mobs in past content.<br />
<br />
Just because it's a new expansion it shouldn't mean that you get better loot off a 6 man groupable mob than you and 50 of your friends could get raiding challenging mobs.Doesn't make sense.To get an upgrade from a GBOS in GOD is fine.Just make the mob and his environment that much more challenging than the bot guy and it would be balanced imo.A weaker mob in an easier environment shouldn't drop a better weapon though.</div></div><hr />

I just want to be clear about what we are trying to balance.  The raider-vs-nonraider fight has taken precedence over what is largely a problem between different classes.  <br />
<br />
The other melee classes are getting tremendous utility out of their GoD and LDoN weaps (16/20 Velium Gemmed, and 16/19 repectively) while the same weaps are not really suitable for the work we do as warriors.  These 2 weapon sets, which at first glance are intended to bridge the gap between raiders and non-raiders weap options succeed brilliantly for every class except warriors. 16/19 and 16/20 is Emp quality loot for the other melees.  Whereas warriors would not be advised to exchange a CHoS for either of the 2 mentioned above.  This is a large contributor to non-raiding warriors frustrations, and helps build the foundation of their complaint.  <br />
<br />
The paranoia that single groupers are looking for a DBoTW or something seems to have come out of nowhere.  The idea that raiding should be trivialized has not been pushed in any way. People are just looking for the next logical step for them and not finding it in recent expansions, while other classes have found it in abundance.<br />
<br />
On a related note, I can't support the idea of encouraging high AA people in KT/Ikiniz gear to go and gank Cursed, AoW, XTC, Eindride as a way of maintaining the games balance/integrity/whatever.  These are all great raid targets and tons of fun for people doing that content.  But to hear raiding purists like yourself talk about keeping content meaningful and respecting the history of the game, and then turn around and say those targets should be farmed by a group or two of KT/Ikiniz geared people for one loot doesn't quite jive.  There has gotta be a better way :)</div></div><hr />

Hi, nobody ever said it should. Read Frodlin's post carefully, it exemplifies everything we've been saying. Neither a stun NOR an eb proccing weapon for a 6 man group would be better than a DBoW or BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">has anyone considered that the sole reason the velium gemmed stuff exists is for teh raiders to use when fighting mobs that mitigate most damage from some weapon types? ie mobs only take decent damage from piercers or slashers or blunt etc. the velium gemmed weaps give guilds a decent dps weapon their melee can easily obtain to fight mobs that mitigate most of their normal weapon damage. compared to the normal weaps these people would be using, the weapons are kinda crappy. i find it amusing that so many of these have filtered into bazaar to be used as supertwink weapons for pure dps classes. are they worth a shit for a warrior? sure if you plan on not tanking, but lets rememebr they werent intended as tanking weaps, the tank was still expected to use the raid tanking weapons he always used. looks like sony tried to get away from the concept of bane weaps (which flopped totally in pop from what i can see, i dont know a soul that actually made zek bane) and instead opened up a new can of worms with droppable decent ratio pure dps weaps</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all I am not a raiding purist.My guild is a casual progressive raiding guild with a family feel to it and I enjoy grouping a  lot.I don't expect to keep up with the guys who raid 6 days a week 8+ hours a day.I do expect that if we need to take 50 folks of the same calibre as the grouping people in this thread to kill a mob it will drop substancially better loot than a mob 6 of the same people can kill.I'm not anti grouper ,pro raider,or,any other garbage type profile you want to lay on me.This just makes sense to me in EQ.<br />
<br />
Second of all I never suggested raiders should go bottom feed.If you've read any of my posts on this board on that subject you would know I'm against such practice.Imo almost everything meanigful that's not trade skilled should be no drop and pa/ebay crap should be eliminated from the game.We had problems with pa and other loot mongers coming up and I try to stay out of the way of younger guilds.The people I thought could get upgrades off these mobs soon are non raiders  at level 70 who lack bloodfrenzys and the like.I would also prefer such weapons and gear to drop off of newer mobs of similiar strength  in new expansions.My point is if you can kill cursed with your group you should be able to find a similiar mob in newer content that drops similiar loot.<br />
<br />
Why you're trying to pigeon hole me as a bottom feeder or raiding purist I don't know.Anything that smacks of not wanting to make stuff easier for the little guy just fires some people up.I'm guild leader now(was just mt for a long time)of a time guild on stromm.We have never used the guild to bottom feed.I have never gone back to hit any of these mobs now that I am overgeared for them.All of my gear was got raiding or grouping in god.Some of my raid loot is old/shrug.We're dkp and I use most of my time up for the guild.My wife and I have about 20k together which is left over from our last guild split up of bank overages.<br />
<br />
You've taken a leap in the wrong direction.My interest is that soe doesn't continue to make everything easier and devalue the game as a whole.Things like group xp mods that made everyone 65 in a hurry have me feeling that soe wants everyone to feel a certain &quot;success&quot; in EQ just prior to EQ2 coming out.<br />
<br />
I don't know that we would strongly disagree on what is an appropiate quality weapon to drop from a selected mob in GOD.DPS weapons have normally been easier to aqquire with better ratios than aggro proc weapons,because, they have less value in a sense.If a BOT boss(haven't seen this guy in awhile because I never went back after we finished raiding BOT towers) drops a 14/18 stun proccer; then a GOD mob better be just as tough in just as hard of an environment to drop an equal quality weapon.The 18/20 stun weapon was too strong imo to drop from an Ikkinz trial boss because i can easily compare it as being better then similiar weapons that take 50 of us to drop.My only point was that mobs should retain similar drop quality for their overall strength.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">With referance to what Moorgard posted about raiding...<br />
<br />
If an encounter is truly tuned to challenge 72 players at a level of progression to their utmost then it will be a much more challenging encounter for those raiders than one similiarily built for 6.It is far harder to coordinate a larger force so efforts do not overlap ,communication is perfect,everyone performs at peak capacity and timing.Often you can have strength for an objective and fail many times due to poor coordination.<br />
<br />
In a group of 6 this kind of coordination is greatly simplified.Roles are easily defined and accounted for.Variables and fast communication requirememnts are diminshed.In a decent group most often if we can kill something we will and it's mostly subject to gear.<br />
<br />
Of course it is hard to tailormake an encounter for everyone.All sorts of groups and raids will find themselves challenged differantly.Mind you as an example....I know strong GOD/Time geared guilds who have wiped on coirnav when way past having the rquired firepower/gear due to poor coordination.More people are harder to utilize at max potential against game challenges.<br />
<br />
Personally,I prefer smaller raid forces and groups.Not for increased challenge or level of skill,but, for social reasons.A smaller raid force makes people FEEL more important.Their efforts stand out among a smaller contingent and often only a couple folks could replicate their contribution.It's easier to bond with a smaller force and make it personal.Plus... well getting 50+ folks together and headed in the same direction makes my ears smoke.I hope they can do this in eq2 and make it work.Although ,I hate artificial limitations in the game world.There are drawbacks to instanced and &quot;protected&quot; content.However, without artificial limitations players will often bend the advantage to themselves and raid creep will occur again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the last thing im trying to do. First, I call you a raiding purist because you are championing the raiders point of view and defending it with things like keeping old content relevant, preserving integrity of the game, etc.. Maybe was a bad choice of words, was not meant to be derogatory.<br />
<br />
Second, I was not saying you are a bottom feeder, but am saying that recommending that players like Moruk and Fynepisa (both very well geared KT/Ikiniz single group players, and i only use them as examples) go back and gank Cursed or XTC for their single useful drop is nutts.<br />
<br />
Third, I can't see how we are not all behind a warrior single group upgrade path via LDoN and GoD.  This is not a raider-vs-nonraider thing, its a class thing. All other melees have a very clear single group upgrade path through LDoN and GoD, but warriors do not. /boggle that we can't all agree on this being a problem.<br />
<br />
What do i think would be appropriate? A 14/18 or 15/19 weap with same proc as GBoS, 15-25ac, 100-125 hp's, misc stats and saves as all weaps have.  Could also very easily have an improved proc rate and a + riposte mod as well, but that might give people a heart attack to consider.  I think adding some AC and HP's is more important than adding ratio.  This is well in line with the difficulty of attaining Eindride's weap, and Eindride is gimp for a group of KT/Ikiniz geared people.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: and keep in mind this is purely academic to Moruks first post. None of this is likely to happen, but its fun to argue about while we supposed to be working, hehe.  Hopefully OoW adds a few stepping stones to the single group warriors weap upgrade path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">No more fanatic than you.I just want the game to be fair and remember the last expansions appropiately.The 18/20 stun weapon should drop from a mob as hard as similiar weapons have dropped from before.Not just get handed out because soe is afraid people will go to WOW.<br />
<br />
Frost you're not hearing me.I want those mobs used as a measuring stick.I don't think a new expansion should change old balances of mob strength vs loot ratio.I want more mobs in new exansions for grouping people to kill of similiar strength with similiar drops.The fact is if you can go back and 1 group those mobs you can 1 group said rewards.I have said over and over 'd like to see more mobs of simliar strength with similiar rewards in newer expansions that grouping folks can hit when they are ready.I am all for more grouping content.Said that a lot in this and other threads btw.I want an upgrade path for everyone in the group game with more of the said content.I just want the difficulty of getting rewards remain the same and continuous with the last expansions as much as possible.<br />
<br />
I cannot measure Eindrides difficulty against Ikkinz trial bosses, because, like I said i haven't been back to one group him.The last time I went through the BOT towers was with a raid force earlier on Stromm.If getting to Eindride and killing him really is easier than doing the Ikkinz trials than I support the weapons you suggest/shrug.I've said that all along.An 18/20 stun aggro proccer is something else all together and I can more easily measure the difficulty of getting similiar weapon from past expansions.Such a weapon drops off mobs I still need a raid to kill.So new expansions shouldn't suddenly make getting similiar loot significantly easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">I think the people against an upgrade weapon are simply overestimating these old mobs. I took my group up to Auliffe Chaoswind a couple weeks ago. Wanted to hit Eindride as well, but he gets 6 boxed whenever he spawns it seems. For the sake of argument, we'll say Auliffe and Eindride are about the same ( I think Auliffe is a bit harder actually).<br />
<br />
Before this, I hadn't fought Auliffe since before the made them drop more than a fungus clump all the time. When we used to do him we'd have a charmed pet do most of the tanking, and we'd use 2 clerics to heal me as I backed in and out of battle to make sure I was on top of the aggro list when charm broke. Needless to say, it was rough, and I could barely tank if needed back then with a couple clerics backing me up.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. We had a druid and cleric for heals so I figured we'd have to chain CH and maybe drop patches when needed. So we engage and my life hardly moves. Turns out I could stay up with Holy Elixer and an occasional heal. It was a total joke.<br />
<br />
Compare this to the Ikkinz named where I need 2-3 healers healing all they can just to keep me up. Ikkinz is much more challenging than the BoT tower bosses.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point of all this rambling is that I think people are remembering this old content when it was new and challenging and making it sound a lot harder than it really is, and that is why there is so much resistance to upgrades.</div></div><hr />

But you are  talking about BoC's and BF's.  These weapons drop from content 5 and 4 expansions old respectively.  When casters werent nukin as hard, mobs didn't hit for nearly DPS they are now.  Velious and Luclin, tho still being raided by newer players / casual raiders, is trivial.  Especially for those people who can manage to equip themselves and are skilled enough to get into KT.  Is it so impossible to warrant a 1HS weapon with at least some kind of agro inducing proc.  Agro is so important even in single groups that now one mob can nearly one round every caster not in full time gear.  I can barely  survive a round against them with my measly 800 rune up.  4 expansions since BF was introduced into the game.  Now when we are at a point that stats on gear is just insane, with mobs doin the DPS they do now, and agro at an all high importance, a 1 grp attainable weapon upgrade that will produce even decent agro should exist.  It doesnt have to be the best ratio, but a decent proc modifier couldnt hurt.  <br />

My friggin weapons are 38/35 and 20/20.   <br />
<br />
I'm NOT offended if someone upgrades their pile of shit 13/20 Droga weapons from KUNARK to something more current.  I'm of the opinion that Ikkinz trials (or Omens) should have something closer to 25/28 with a badass aggro proc (no gay Enraging Blow for the love of god, the most worthless and overrated proc in EQ).<br />
<br />
The fact that people aren't motivated to bag their bloodfrenzy is a big problem, Luclin is FIVE expansions old come tommorrow.   It's about damn time to grieve it and move on, and weapon selection from single groups should ABSOLUTELY reflect it.<br />
<br />
And those of you crazy enough to think that single group mobs shouldn't be dropping weapons better than old raid targets are gonna have a hard time explaining to me why rogues didn't wield Vox piercers in Kunark and bagged em for Trak Tooth or the Sebilite Croaking Dirk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">Well if gear drops for folks in single groups that is better than they can get raiding say elemental planes then what does that say for folks gearing up and raiding thru older content?Or does that not matter to you because you're past that point in the game.If their should be no continuity of balance with older expansions then why not do the same with new ones?If folks with a particular gear level can get upgrades with 6 friends that are better than what they can get with 50 simliar friends in an older expansion then it should ring true for the whole game.Forget raiding altogether ,because ,I can get better gear grouping.In OOW I should be able to get qvic quality drops in 6 man groups at level 70 with god/time gear.<br />
<br />
Not everyone started playing the same time you did.Not everyone plays the same amount of hours you do.The game should be consistent and retain it's integrity for folks to play through from the beginning.Just because you're past a certain point the past raid game shouldn't be rendered useless until it is naturally mudflated by levels/aa etc.Then folks can get that gear and similiar stuff in newer expansions.If they want to balance eq so 50 people working together get no higher quality loot at their level of gear than 6 that's fine.It should be so for the whole game then though,including the one you play.<br />
<br />
I just want to see reasonable consistency.If you're strong enough to drop mobs in older expansions with a given quality of loot then your group/raid should be able to find similiar mobs with similiar loot to kill in newer expansions.An example of poor balance imo is the glyphed ring I'm wearing.Easily one grouped by ep equipped folks it is far better than what a raid of 72 ep equipped people could drop in EP's.Thats what I disagree with.Doesn't make sense Imo.</div></div><hr />

Er what upgrades do you get for visable slots with a group that is better than Luclin raid loot?Most people have to raid ep's to get better than vt armor.Some GOD loot is outa wack already(bracers, rings,etc.But It's not too bad because its limited)and I'd rather not see the trend continue.Soe seems to want to make stuff easier for everyone just prior to eq2 tho.<br />
<br />
Look, I have no beef with folks who are strong enough to one group old raid targets taking their loot or equivalent loot off similar new mobs.I don't like bottom feeding special targets that newer raiders would find signiicance in and think newer mobs of similiar strength with similiar drops should be available to people in new expansions to 1-3 group(whatever).This is going in a circle though.Fgs I'm not opposed to upgrades being available in GOD or OOW.I just want the quality of mobs to roughly determine the quality of drops consistent with older expansions.The Dev's generally do this anyways /shrug.Some of the newer GOD drops are outa line(read too good for the ease of getting) with the rest of the game.I don't want to see more of the same.<br />
<br />
The example that I didn't like earlier was an 18/20 1hander with a stun proc.That is a weapon of equal or better quality than ep raiders can get with full raids in EP's so it shouldn't drop to a group of ep geared ppl Imo.No biggie if you disagree or have a slightly differant sense of balance,but, try to leave my posts in the context I place them if you want to argue against them.I'm happy with 18/20 stun proc weapons dropping in GOD.Just put them in rings on mobs of equal strength to similiar loot droppers in ep's/time.</div></div><hr />

18/22 a DD proc, 125 hp and even a little AC.  Judging by the items that have dropped from the first few raid mobs we've seen, i would say this is almost definitely something that would be easy for a non-raider to attain.
