<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>angrif77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main is a 65 shaman but wanted to re-equip my 32 dwarf warrior who had been naked and functioning as a mule.  I can't spend a boatload of cash on him.  What are some things I should look for?  I know HP is always most important to a warrior... but what target AC/HP should i shoot for at that level?  Would I be a deteriment as a tank with this gear? I don't want to spend all my money on him as my 65 shaman needs some ornate, but I can probably camp for some stuff for him or for cash if anyone has any suggestions.  Magelo is below.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">crust bracer instead of the gotchic. new kind of guants. anything with hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could get some more Enchanted Dwarven stuff it has good ac and sta.  Crusty is better than gothic, but you need some dex items to offset the loss of dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The answer to your question: &quot;Would I be a detriment as a tank at that level?&quot; is no, you can tank just fine at level 32 with what you've got on now. Will you mitigate damage as well as a twink in full cultural? No, but then you don't have to, either. If you've been paying even casual attention to what tanks do as you leveled your shaman, then you'll be a better tank than most 32 warriors who have never fought anywhere except in the chaos of PC and HHK, never ask healers about mana levels, never pay attention to LoM messages, can't time spawn rates, have no idea how to position mobs, fail to notice that two mobs are beating on the cleric, don't have any idea what /shield does, etc etc.<br />
Right now, your armor is fine and you can get by with it for a few levels if you have to; In 10 levels you'll need to boost your AC. <br />
In 15 levels you'll really need to spend some plat on significant upgrades (to cultural armor levels). At that point, upgrades get much more expensive.<br />
If you don't have boatloads of pp now, you might consider saving now for a bigger upgrade later, rather than marginal upgrades now.<br />
<br />
I'd look in library at the haste item post and see if your shaman would farm something--he could solo for several of the minor items, I would think. At level 32 your warrior doesn't need it, but around the low 40s it wouldn't hurt to have some. And a significant haste item (let's say 31% or better) can be expensive, and is something you'll also need to be saving for (or make it a goal of your warrior to raid Vox/Naggy when he gets high enough, then hope you win the roll).<br />
 I'd get a bow and some arrows (doesn't take long to fletch arrows suitable for tagging, so I'd do your own). <br />
Halas 10-pound meat pies would boost your dex over 100 and add hitpoints and STA. Very cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>angrif77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the thoughts.  My warrior is an odd case as i stopped playing my shaman at lvl 19 and stipped him way back pre luclin.  I started playing this warrior and around lvl 20 met the people that I eventually helped found a guild with.  After restarting my shaman I finally left the warrior in the dust at 32.  I never had to tank much as the guild leader's main at the time was a warrior a couple levels higher.  Now I find myself itching to play my warrior a bit as well (i admit I'm an Alt junkie tho as I have a 36 ranger, 20 monk, 13 necro, 16 pally as well).  I've been farming droga with my shaman for drops to sell.  I figured after I make enough to buy the ornate boots for my shaman, I'd keep farming droga for an Enchanted Sash of Wonder for the 31% haste and Kingly Boots of Splendor.  I grabbed him a Bow of Gloaming and my ranger can make good range arrows for pulling/tagging.<br />

Funny that as I did the magelo profile for him recently I noticed that when I created him so long ago, I put my points into dex and agi lol.<br />
