<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well my guild tried vindi for the first time, heres how it went down<br />
<br />
We started at 5:30(gathering people not raiding yet) and we started clearing the arena for armor drops, did that for 4 hours, at that point we had picked up 22 people and said what the hell lets do vindi<br />
<br />
I had helped other guilds on my sever kill the AoW and i had learned alot(2 boc's 2 rings and 1 legs btw, didnt win any of it) so i knew cornering and the east wall and all that good stuff<br />
<br />
first pull<br />
<br />
had people not on the wall even after being yelled at, vindi got stuck on the ramp while incoming because some people sent in there pets before i called assist, i didnt let the pets die because if they did then it would go right for the shaman(pick up) that used the 3 aa pets and after that kill everyone else on the wall, anyhow i died, so did the raid, got it down to 80%<br />
<br />
second try, <br />
<br />
was incoming, shaman(pick up) was LD so we got it to the corner, then the rampage tank out agro'd me and it ran out of its corner, i yelled for assist and told the rampage tank to get in the corner and do my job if i cant get agro, this time we didnt get him fully cornered eather BUT with 2 warriors and 1 paladin we got him down to 50% but we wiped, again because of the way people wernt following orders <br />
<br />
(i neglected to mention that we had people off the wall, and they got creamed before i finally got it in the corner, /sigh minus 3 patch healers)<br />
<br />
anyhow was in keal for a total of 6 hours, 2 of that attempting vindi<br />
<br />
what i wanted to ask for is some solid vindi advice, perhaps some guides on the subject?</div></div><hr />

This will make or break any boss mob fight.  If you have a bunch of people not following orders, expect a wipe.  Tell em to get rid of pets until if they are causing problems.  If pet owners cant handle the pets, they dont have any business with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i wasnt raid leader i was in a adviser position, but im leading the next one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if you're not the raid leader, you are in a position of some authority. MTs get to yell, bitch, complain and threaten if they want and people will listen. Use caps and use yells to show where they need to be. If the raid won't follow orders, especially after already dying, then you might want to start with some follow through. If you have wizards, have them start TLing people that aren't listening. Tell your pullers to NOT finish the pull until people are in place. <br />
<br />
 A couple things: Don't try to pull vindi back to the corner. Engage him where you can (in the range of the healers) with your back to the corner and have the raid push him to you. Also, talk to the rampage tank about how rampage works. He doesn't need to be attacking at all to be rampage tank, so he should start attacking later then the rest of the raid to avoid aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on your pull strength and the intelligence/positioning of your cleric crew, cornering vindi may be a -bad- idea. When we were still farming vindi, it was our common practice to let the monks play games with the icewalls to split vindi's pets and kill them. Once this was done, we'd run up the ramp into the upper arena area, position clerics not far from the angled corner, you see as you run up, and let the raid walk Vindi from the post to the corner and back again. <br />
<br />
Now, the downsides to this are that your raid has to have some brains. You've got to understand how to harness the beast they call push, and when it's time to flip vindy around onto the raid's face and let them circle around him. Further, your warrior has to be pretty intimately familiar with the range on cheal.. This goes hand in hand with flip timing. <br />
<br />
What it gains you is Archery/Bolt damage, and a warrior that's used to it has less trouble with those fucking 'you cannot see your target' messages. <br />
<br />
If you possibly can, kill him in under three minutes. This may or may not be a problem, it used to take us 5-6 minutes with 30 level 60s. However, Vindi has a massive attack rating, and while his spike damage isn't impressive, he can really put a hurting on you if you don't have a good chunk of the defensive AAs or the gear that makes killing Vindi worthless for your mains. He steamrolled me at level 60 w/CS3 and a 1400 AC, by your magelo I don't expect you to do terribly much better than I do without /disc. You can tank switch, but if your dps is on the money and your healers are sharp, one /disc should last long enough to put him down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proximity aggro is God on Vindi... he's almost like undead. Debuffers, DPS, aux melee all need to stay the hell out of the way while you as MT get him where you want him. <br />
<br />
And your weapons should be fine: I tanked him with Willsapper and Seb croaking dirk the first kills we did. People need to wait on assist call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, I wouldn't say your weapons are the problem.  I tanked Vindi one time at lvl 59 with Priceless (13/20, no proc) and a Frostbringer (12/22, decent proc).  Holding aggro on mobs while defensive REQUIRES cooperation from raid members.  People in raids where the content is challenging must let a warrior keep aggro while defensive.  I will give a couple of suggestions but these are for your raid party and not so much for you.<br />
<br />
1.  People with pets need to keep them on a short leash.  The couple hundred pts of damage that Jibober does BEFORE assist is called isn't worth screwing up the placement of the mob for the raid.  And they will screw up placement if a pet engages before assist is called.  Vindi doesn't cast spells so there is no way Pet_01 tried to defend its master from an AE and there is no excuse for pets engaging early.<br />
<br />
2.  Melee may need to cycle attacks in order to avoid aggro.  On boss mobs when I started raiding it was standard practice to go with 10 seconds of atk on followed by 2 seconds off.  My weapons always lagged behind my guildmates so I could push this more than they could.  This pretty much solves holding aggro off of other melee types in the raid.<br />
<br />
3.  People must follow directions from the raid leader.  There is no excuse for anyone besides the puller/MT/SA to be off the wall in your case.  IMO there are only two ways some of these people will ever learn to follow directions.  First is to let them die and know the raid might wipe.  Second is to trans their butts out before the pull so they can't screw it up.  If either of these happen often enough they will get the message.  Make sure that people are paying attention on all mobs.  Make them be on the wall for clearing the mobs too and tell the puller to not pull until everyone is where they should be.  Start out nice in tells with peeps but escalate to /rs Hold pulls until Clueless_class_02 gets into position and ENFORCE it.  Idle threats are your worst enemy.<br />
<br />
4.  People must pay attention to what is happening in the raid channel and their surroundings.  I get annoyed at having to spam a raid channel 10 times with a message like LET ME GET THE MOB OFF THE WALL.  People just quit paying attention sometimes after assist is called.  Usually it is a pet pushing and pinning a mob high up a wall.  If people aren't paying attention I let them and their pet die and resume on with the mob.<br />
<br />
5.  If you are drawing aggro from damage or spells, stop attacking or nuking.  Let the MT regain aggro and wait a while before resuming.  You may need to adjust the amount of damage you are doing by increasing pauses between nukes or turning off atk periodically.<br />
<br />
6.  If you get aggro, do not run around like a chicken with your head cut off trying to get away from the mob.  You screwed up ( unless you are healing/debuffing), so stand there and let the MT regain aggro.  Running only results in the MT getting the &quot;your target is too far away to taunt&quot; message and the chance to wait for taunt to refresh while you are turned into paste.<br />
<br />
7.  Do not explore zones when you are on a raid.  I have been wiped far too many times by people who &quot;wanted to see what the zone looked like&quot; and wandered off while on a raid.  They inevitibly aggro mobs and run back to the raid.  The semi conscious ones will try to die not too far from the raid knowing they screwed up and can be drug back and rez'd.  Unfortunately a healer usually notices them taking damage and heals them, thus bringing the train into camp.<br />
<br />
So many of these skills have been lost or never learned by many high level people today with the advent of the exp changes lately.<br />
<br />
Now for the MT, I would offer some minor suggestions as well.<br />
<br />
1.  Make sure you use the best Magical arrows you can for tagging.  Ones that actually hit and do damage.  Same for Rampage tank.<br />
<br />
2.  Use Disarm skill.  It causes aggro, so use it everytime it pops.<br />
<br />
3.  Increase the amount of time you attack a mob before you call assist if you are having trouble holding aggro.  Our DPS goes into the toilet when we use defensive.<br />
<br />
4.  Damage shields on Vindi are your friend.  Figure out the best combo you can get and let him help kill himself.<br />
<br />
5.  If you lose aggro do not be afraid to tell the raid to stop attacking so you can regain aggro.<br />
<br />
6.  Test your raid group when clearing trash mobs on waiting for assist.  Kill a couple mobs calling assist normally and wait a long time before calling assist on a random mob hopefully soon before the boss is pulled.  Many tanks are predictable on calling assist at x seconds or a mob at y% health.  Make sure they aren't getting lucky on when they are guessing you will call assist.<br />
<br />
7.  If someone jumps assist /tell them and be nice about it to start.  Everyone makes mistakes.  If the problem continues stop attacking and back away from the mob.  Tell the healers to let them die if necessary until they understand what the assist call is for and what it means.  Rezing one person from dieing to a trash mob is infinitely easier than rezing a raid because they ping ponged the boss mob.  It is amazing how clear concepts become while waiting for rez effects to wear off :)<br />
<br />
8.  Pets are not exempt from waiting for assist, nuff said.<br />
<br />
Yes, these may seem harsh to some, but when people are raiding content appropriate to their level it is better to use good raid skills which can include sacrificing a person or two so the raid can succeed.  I cannot count the number of times we lose a MT because a healer switched to someone who drew aggro and the MT got it back but missed a heal because the healer was healing someone other than the MT.<br />
<br />
In my guild now, I have offered to be a sacrificial tank on boss mobs.  Our warriors have AETaunt and usually if you dont have a heal coming before you start taking damage it can get ugly, so I have tried to get a spot defined between the first and second assist as a sacrifice tank.  I would aggro mob and die while CHeal chain starts on SA who aetaunts when I die.  Human nature is tough to let a friend die and so far the healers haven't embraced this idea yet but as mobs get tougher they might.</div></div><hr />

Several ideas will be put to test:<br />
<br />
1)  CH rotation and dealing with Vindi's huge damage output.<br />
2)  Rampage<br />
3)  The fact that Vindi's guards are tagged pets.  Whenever Jobober engages a pet, that pet plus the pet owner are put on his hate list.  In the case of Vindi, if pet owners do not /pet back off, Jobober will go charging after Vindi the moment he gets within a certain range.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the pet classes of that raid did not know #3.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get your raid force into position, that is all against the wall, no one needs to be out jerking off and jeopardizing the raid.  Vindi's prox aggro is nasty and will start pounding on the 1st person he sees.  When he is inc, have MA and 2 rampage tanks shoot arrows at him...at this point rampage is set.  Hit defensive and get him in the corner, be sure to assign 1 healer to your rampage tanks.  call attack and beat him down.  Watch for enrage!  Clerics should start their rotation right after you shoot your arrow, oh and be sure they dont sit down for the 1st couple of rounds of attack...they will die if they do, I promise you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">P.S. Make sure to stack highest Damage Shield humanly possible (i.e. 65 mage and Bard with you and a big fat Shaman DS potion)<br />
<br />
This will help you turn Vindi into Mush in 3 mins or less.<br />
<br />
The first time I ever did Vindi I had the same hps as you. I went 5 second chain (you should do 4) and I think a 101 pt Damage Shield on.<br />
<br />
he died right at 3 minutes. I believe I brought 36 to the fight and I was level 60 at the time. I was using Red Epic and some other weapon, I think Horn of Hsagra...<br />
<br />
Btw, I just did it recently with 17 people. It took us 5 mins and 17 seconds.<br />
<br />
40% of the damage of the whole raid was a level 61 ench with Dire Charm Hasting his pet with good weapons and dotting :)<br />
<br />
My Damage Shield accounted for another 20% or something ha ha :)<br />
<br />
Long Story Short, Damage Shield and Hasted DC Giants = win!</div></div><hr />

The knowledge you get from just TRYING vindicator is the most valuable loot you will get from this encounter (by a mile)<br />

20 bucks says you kill him in your next time at Kael.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back pets right before the Vindi pull. We had all kinds of trouble with pets rushing up the ramp until we started doing this. I was told it's because the guards are Vindi's pets so your pets already have Vindi on their hate list and having them back off will keep them in place. The reason may be bullshit but I know it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah the vindi fight is pretty simple. Head to left arena, clear it. Then kill his guards. Have a monk pull him over the wall and engage/corner him. (can have RT pull, or tag with arrow on way over wall) Start the CH chain on inc, or right when he pops over the wall, cripple, and call assist. Did him with 8 or so a few days ago....heh, earing :P<br />
<br />
edit: also his agro is pretty much proximity based, a few months ago, in my old guild, the MA went the whole fight with attack off by accident, all he did was AET for initial agro :)<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is also currently doing the Vindi encounter as one of our 'challenge' raids.  Something that's pushing us to be better.  Here's what I can add from the past 5 fights, of which 2 were successful... :mad: <br />
<br />
1.  Proximity is a HUGE factor, use Maximum-melee range.<br />
2.  Spam heals till the CHeal chain lands first round works just as well as starting the chain early I find.  This also keeps the clerics further down the Rampage list.<br />
3.  Rampage- Learn it, learn it again, memorize it, make it a religion.<br />
4.  No Pets unless owner has /Pet Hold.  Just makes it SOO much simpler.<br />
5.  Use this as a time to absolutely DRILL your guild into shape.  They have to learn to follow directions.  Even if that means hopping on one foot while mob is inc, have them hop.  I practice this by using regular giants in the arena as 'test mobs'.  We treat the pull 100% the same as we do Vindi.  When I have them good and worked up, I don't call assist till mob is at like 20% life.  Then I look back at hits and see who was hitting early.  I then verbally assualt the person over the raid channel.  They seem to have gotten the hint now.<br />
<br />
Now, our last raid on him failed because they appear to have changed Vindi's pathing a while ago and we can't get the monks to split him properly now.  We are always getting Vindi + 2 guards.  Now, this should be a major issue, but 4 of our plate tanks are offline due to hurricane or military service.  Is there a way to separate Vindi from his guards now?  If so, please, give me detailed instructions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Is there a way to separate Vindi from his guards now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes there is, what the monk has to do is agro vindi and his guards, run them into the main part of the arena, then go behind the &quot;glass&quot; wall thing. From there, vindi and the guards will get stuck on the wall. Have the rampage tank or MA watching as the monk does this. After a little bit, maybe 10 or so seconds, vindi will warp to the other side of the glass, after which the monk FDs, and vindi will begin walking his little bridge thing,  but his two guards will still be stuck behind the glass...the Rampage tank/2nd monk/MA, will then use a range attack and tag the two guards. Kill guards and get vindi single after they die. :)<br />
<br />
gl, hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe you described quite well why we never allowed pets when we started doing Vindi.<br />
Last Vindi pet was over in less than a minute, bunch of swarm pets (mages and shamans) and charmed pets by chanters make a lot of difference.<br />
<br />
For your first attempt you might forbid pets as well, unless your pet classes have pet hold AA and actually park their pets at wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only done vindi once since the pathing changes.  Its much harder to get him to warp through the wall without his guards now.  At one point I sat there for 5 minutes while he walked into the wall slowly sliding down into the corner.<br />
<br />
I came up with a trick back when we didnt have any FD classes to split him.   Roll up a level 1 ogre worshipping rallos zek.  Buy him a bow and some arrows.  Plant him near vindi.  When it comes time to pull vindi have him shoot, duck behind the ice wall, and run like hell.  Turn around in the middle of the arena and wait for certain death.  Its pretty random which one warps through first and pummels ya, but unless they miss the whole first round (highly unlikely) you get an automatic split.  Sometimes its vindi, sometimes not.  But its always only 1.<br />
<br />
Key point mentioned there is have your MT and RT tagging.  If its one of his guards that sets up rampage nicely.<br />
<br />
I recommend using the corner at the bottom of either ramp.  That seems safely out of vindi pursuit range.  I've had him warp into the back alley corners before after guards were split.<br />
<br />
If you get the weird / buggy behavior of him shouting but not following you while you shoot him after you've cleared his guards, just sit.  As long as you're sitting he'll come after you.  Ease him back into camp that way.  Eventually he'll get close enough to go after whichever caster healed the most.</div></div><hr />

I also made it perfectly clear to the raid that if they got aggro, they weren't going to get heals.  A few pet classes were invited to leave as well.  They caught on pretty quick.<br />
<br />
Be very clear about the rules...and enforce them.  Eventually people will either get with the program, or you'll have identified the ones you need to leave behind in the future.<br />
<br />
...so I have tried to get a spot defined between the first and second assist as a sacrifice tank. I would aggro mob and die while CHeal chain starts on SA who aetaunts when I die. Human nature is tough to let a friend die and so far the healers haven't embraced this idea yet but as mobs get tougher they might.I dunno Fried...I seem to recall a CH rotation last week starting on the SA before you even engaged :)</div></div><hr />

I made a rogue play Vindicator before the pull. I had him run in. I showed everyone where to set up.<br />

I made sure the RT knew when to Tag.<br />
<br />
I showed everyone how to use the top down F9 key to make sure they saw how far away they were standing and to make sure they kept Vindi Pinned with a semi circle.<br />
<br />
I called out each assist, the beginning of bard song, the beginning of nukes, etc...and let them get a feel for it.<br />
<br />
Once everyone had seen exactly where Vindi would be, where RT and SA were standing, Where the clerics needed to be and how far they could stand from Vindi and still hit him, it was super easy.<br />
<br />
It's worth the extra pop of giants to be able to show everyone exactly how the fight will go.<br />

<br />
My guild circles him when we do BP farming.  But we circle because we have a ton of AM3/EQ rangers.<br />
<br />
I can't stress enough about the MA bitch factor!  As the MA, you are a linch pin of the raid.  if you can't do your job, the mob lives.  Set up hot keys for things like back off melee, watch agro, etc.<br />
<br />
The warriors in my guild are very particualr about how we do things, and we are all very good at communicating them to others.  Its important for your guildmates to become disciplined in the fight.  Once that hurdle has been lept, then you'll really be able to apply what you learn on raids.<br />
<br />
best of luck and I hope you enjoy him =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will be as quick and to the point as possible sir, if you have any questions please feel free ot drop me a message.  (I have done vindi from each position, mt, rt, st, 3t, dps)<br />
<br />
Position everyone on the wall behind the healers, who are at the cornors max range. <br />
<br />
Make sure in big bold letters that does ANYTHING (except debuff or heal) untill a tank calls assist or they will be deguilded/no loot (if pickup).  Every warrior is shrunk, and in the cornor with the possible exception of rt who is shrunk and at the ramp bottom.  I have always had superb monks get solo pulls so its never been a real issue with adds.<br />
<br />
Go get a GSoT now, not tomarrow, now.  GSoT &gt;&gt;WMBS for aggro.  I have mt'ed everything from fire beetles to BoT Tower bosses with it and its marvelous for its 50k price tag (I am in denial, dont correct me).<br />
<br />
Everone with a Tank as their role, fires 5-10 arrows from the moment the RT (who obviously must go first) shoots at the ramps end (and runs back to the cornor) till he is towering above you.  Only the MT engages with melee, but you absolutly have to have every tank on that list before the healers.  The RT confirms his status and calls it loud.  I usually wait untill the debuff cycle is done to call assist (cramming taunt like a sob, since the range hatebonus means aggro |= highest hate).  After that its all a numbers game between your healers and Vindi.<br />
<br />
The tanks should be on his butt, with everyone else at max range.  The quickness for 2t, 3t, and if the shit really hits the fan 4t can get in that cornor and keep a cool head can make the difference.  When my guild did vindi regularly we coined the phrase &quot;Ung style&quot; after our guilds mt, he died at 5-15 percent to go every time.  Our healers are good, damn good, they transition well, but stuff happens /shrug.<br />
<br />
Vindi is a the near defining melee battle.  And easy to simply practice on, since failure is not hard to recover from (ie reclear, and position).  All and all good luck and good hunting<br />

<br />
I often wonder what the first guilds entering the high end raiding level of Velious first thought of good ole Mr. Derakor.  Knowing Furor, I bet even God covered his ears with the amount of swear words coming out of that man's mouth.  More importantly, I wonder what people's reactions were when they saw the stats on the Vindi BP for the first time.  That must have been somethin'.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Positioning<br />
<br />
Healers are closest to the corner, dmg casters are behind them, dmg melee behind them, MT and RT are near the corner off the wall, ST and TT are with the dmg melee group and do the same thing until they are needed to preform a tank swap.<br />
<br />
Buffing<br />
<br />
This is to be done after all the giants are cleared except for the ones behind ice wall, people may buff before hand while killing the trash but i ask that people only buff main tanks and off tanks to save mana for the final bout, also when monk informs us he is working on vindi's little area pulls that is when DMG shields need to be thrown on MT, ST, TT and RT, when the MT,ST,TT,RT know that vindi is incoming this is when they also need to drink their dmg shield shaman potions, would also be smart to use a rune skin on the MT<br />
<br />
Pulling<br />
<br />
Our monk will need to set their own pace and be aware of repops, but i will say that i have heard you can use the ice wall, the ice pillars, and the mini bridge to help split vindi from his guards, we have to take down guards first, once our monk starts pulling from vindi's little area they need to inform us so we may start buffing, finally when the way is clear to vindi the monk must pull him to left/right arena where we are, but rather than going down the ramp they should jump over the wall(inform us right before you do it for tagging) after the RT and MT have tagged it FD and /quit once you get a success, or you may stay and fight but if you got a half success (the one that doesn't memblur) you might get killed by a rampage<br />
<br />
Engaging<br />
<br />
(PETS MUST BE KILLED AT THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE THEM, UNLESS IT IS A DIRE CHARM PET AND YOU HAVE PET PARK AA, OR IF ITS YOUR OWN AND YOU HAVE PET PARK AA&lt; USE THE PET PARK AA RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE VINDI WILL BE ON THEIR AGRO LIST AT THIS POINT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO)<br />
<br />
After the monk has preformed their duty as listed above, and the MT gains agro CH/patch heal rotation needs to start, paladins need to watch the MTs health, if it gets below 30% you have permission to run up to the MT and use LoH, inform the raid if you blow it on the MT, also if a cleric cant get a heal off in time they need to call for a LoH save so that the MT doesn't bite the dust because of low mana or because of a fizzle, if a cleric has to ask for a LoH save for the MT it would be awsome if a necro could pump that cleric 2 times, talk to ______(guidies name) for more information on healing<br />
<br />
Damage classes listen up, your the real stars and the bleeding wound here, so listen well,<br />
<br />
Nukers, stay at max casting range, i do not want you getting proximity agro, this guy doesnt work like a normal mob, you get much more hate by being close, DONT NUKE at all untill assist is called for, and even then PACE IT OUT please, count 5 seconds before popping off your next shot, if he gets on the wall, and any clerics die we are scrued<br />
<br />
DMG melee'er<br />
<br />
WAIT FOR ASSIST, when i call it(it might take awhile before i call it but that is because i want a certain saftly net) you get agro before i call for assist, and your a melee class, i might not let you come on the next one, if you die from getting aggro after assist you will have to sit the fight out and wait for res. when i call assist engage him at MAX melee range, this means as far back from him as you can get before you get the &quot;get closer&quot; message, and use all your pushing power to push him into corner, this brings me to my next point, melee dmg doing classes need to form a loose semi circle to insure he gets cornered and not &quot;walled&quot; the reason we corner is because he cant reposite anyone but the MT after he has been cornered our casters can focus healing on MT with out fear and we wont have anyone dead so our max consistent dmg stays high, this fight is all about killing him before you burn thru all your defensive tanks, so we need all the dmg we can get<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
<br />
what can I say aside from establish good agro, pop defensive, and hope the CH chain keeps up, thats all there really is to it, oh and don't kick because that will un-corner him sometimes<br />
<br />
Tricks<br />
<br />
If we lack a monk, a level 1 rollos zek following warrior can be bound in zone and can make it past all giants safely, it can pull for us<br />
<br />
If we mess up, this level 1 war can also drag corpse, BUT this is one of those zones where that can get you killed so it will be slow but they can do it, id prefer if we had a paladin camped in a close by safe area tho.<br />
<br />
Dire charm pets with a decent weapon and chanter haste can end up doing 20% to 30% of the dmg depending on what you give them(of the whole raid)<br />
<br />
Hot keys need to be discussed before the pulling even starts, so everyone knows what to do<br />
<br />
Corpse Runs <br />
<br />
Best to leave it to raid leader at the time to sort it out<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
************** <br />
MT= main tank, first to do most of the stuff<br />
ST= second tank, MT goes down he has to take over in tanking<br />
TT= third tank, covers for ST, if s/he goes down we are scrued<br />
RT= vindi rampages, this is the guy that gets to enjoy it, in old world mobs like this, rampage means he gets to attack another tank for a full melee round, there needs to be 1 patch healer assigned to keep this guy alive now and then, in old world mobs, rampage list is set in stone, so it will be the RT that gets it all the time.<br />
CH chain= complete healing chain<br />
Patch heal= quick heals that give 800-1500 hp, used to save the tank while the 10 second cast time of CH is counting down<br />
Tagging= shooting a arrow to secure a spot on a boss mob agro list or to use a arrow to pull 1 mob off of a monk pull<br />
Tank swap= if the MT goes down everyone, and i mean EVERYONE but the next tank in line needs to stop doing dmg, the CH chain now focuses on the tank being swapped to, once the new tank has agro they are to tell raid to assist, the new tank needs to stand in the corner where the last tank was ment to be or died at, Tank swaps go in order of MT ST TT and can be done if MT dies or MT's defensive runs out (6 min timer on it)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gart</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone touched upon this, but pets and Vindi do not mix.  <br />
<br />
Absent any direction from the owner, pets will charge Vindi on the pull.  The pet hatelist idea is probably right.<br />
<br />
Best thing is to simply ban pets.  If you have a high level of trust, folks can keep pets if they mash the /pet back off key continuously until the MT has the aggro established.  <br />
<br />
First time I did Vindi my pet simply launched at him, and I had no idea what was going on.  <br />
<br />
There's no reason for a pet caster to know this quirk until they try the encounter - unless they get prepped on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ban pets unless they have Suspend Minion or Pet Discipline then.  The pet isn't going to jump from suspension before the owner lets him out, and Pet Discipline will make the pet do nothing while the owner gets slaughtered if the owner doesn't give him the command to attack.  At the second level of suspend, you can even buff him and give him weapons completely before suspension and bring him out fully prepped.<br />
<br />
I've asked for similar setups in my guild when fighting major mobs or AE mobs.  No pets unless you bring him out after start of fight (by summoning or suspension) or have Pet Discipline.  Completely banning pets entirely with no exceptions loses a lot of damage, honestly.</div></div><hr />
