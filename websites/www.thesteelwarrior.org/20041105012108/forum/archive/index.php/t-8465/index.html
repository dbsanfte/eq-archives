<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a 57 War with Fletching at 136.  All my known recepies that allow me to skill-up are more expensive, and create arrows with a shorter range... so I do not see where it makes sense to skill up in my Fletching skill at present.<br />
<br />
Also, will it be possible for me to make magic arrows at some point?  I need some explanation of the value fletching, so I can decide whether to save the extra $$$$ for various equipment upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For Fletching I brought my skill up to the 182 mark just so I could make magic arrows, any of the silvertip series are magic.  As to saving for upgrades, why not just get a Bloody Ancille's Pouch (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23257) and spend 9pp for 400 magic arrows, the distance isn't a big deal as I was using the longest range silvertips and my stonewood compound bow and don't find that much of a difference for the cost difference.<br />
Just my 2pp worth hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rukekak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would go with the Bloody Ancille's pouch as well.  Best investment I ever made.  You can get a quiver full of arrows in about 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />
