<br />
FYI, Stormfeather is randomly pops somewhere inbetween 16 and 54 hours after the last time he was killed, but it WILL be in that time somewhere. Have fun! Took me about 12 hours total on one day to get him. Finished the whole quest in just a tad over 24 hours after I started.</div></div><hr />

<br />
His profile is at the bottom of his post - eyepatch would be a 15hp upgrade and a couple of trivial stats/resists, at a trivial AC loss (2). IMO, there's no way in hell that's worth enduring Stormfeather camp, unless you're just passing through the area and spot him up luckily.<br />
<br />
As was alluded to, ornate clicky is 30% haste and lasts 72 minutes.  Eyepatch clicky is 20% haste and lasts ~10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Of and on camping for 3 damn years... still no stormfeather, cept for once when he killed my druid watching the camp after I passed out at the keyboard.</div></div><hr />

Stormfeather camp is heinous.  Even if you don't have a haste self buff already, I still don't know that I'd recommend this one to anyone.  He's that damned hard to find up.</div></div><hr />

Ive camped that hill for more hours than I know and I still never saw Grimfeather (was up on track once on my druid for like 5 secs).<br />

Just pick up a fierce heraldic mask and move on.  Kizrack's got you covered for haste and the stats on the mask would be better for you.</div></div><hr />

The Kizrak's gaunts replaced my SCHW's. after buying the ornate mold i dont have any cash to buy another worn haste item. Im comteplating attempting to camp the soulscream belt as i have my wifes in-house 62 cleric with clicky for duoing. The belt is running 22kto28k in my server as of 8:00am this morning. So i either camp it or wait.<br />

<br />
That's how I would play it for the time being. The buff lasts 72 minutes. If you have trouble camping soulscream belt or something better, consider camping FBSS with that cleric and slaughtering as many frogs as you can between spawns, Guk isn't a terrible place to farm up a little plat as an added bonus. I think a stack of phosphorous powder will net you about 34 plat, for example. Aside from gems, fs weapons, and other junk (ssoy vendors for like 280pp(?) if you can clear to the Lord spawn, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stormfeather quest sucks and as other mentioned pharming cash to buy kiz gauntlets would be a wiser choice and will help you stay sane. By the way the stupid pidgen does not pop on server up and spawn time is between 14- 32 hours after death/server up. I had a spawn time table for about 5 pops in a row. He pops any time after 14 hours. So if he was just killed come back in 14 hours and start camping then. Also character with &quot;hide&quot; skill helps here immensley so you dont have to keep killing greens.<br />
<br />
My advice thought stear clear of this crap quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hinedor</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm, im not sure what happened here but i already have the Kizrak's gaunts. I don't need to go farm cash for them. My original question was whether the eyepatch had any real value to me now. <br />
<br />
I finally broke down and bought a soulscream belt this morning. Im very glad i did. i went to GD to judge the performance and it was awesome. Back to HoH i go in hopes of another windblade drop to sell.<br />

Don't go believing in that 18/19 hour, can skip spawn rubbish, that may have been the case for SF when velious came out, but SF's and Lodi's spawn times were changed almost 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />

Just want to verify: Stormy is on the same cycle as Lodi and the other. Meaing if Lodi was killed at 1:30 am Tuesday Morning.. one of the 3 will spawn 30-34 hours from then? Or do they all have their own timer, just the same clock?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're all on their own timers, Lodi's respawn is roughly 12 hours, I never bothered to learn his exact respawn due to the fact he's perma camped, SFs is 32 +/-2 hours, so yes, he'll respawn in that 30-34 hour time frame, and if you meant the stalker as the 3rd, he's random, just slaughter the dire wolves to get him to pop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I now have the quest completed... Three weeks of lazy camping him (logging on at the 32 hour interval to hope he showed, but not parking for hours) and I now have the Eyepatch for my level 29 Ranger  (haha). Thanks for the tips again everyone!</div></div><hr />

Teamed up with a monk who could play days while I covered nights and we were able to pin his spawn down.<br />
<br />
Monk nailed him at 3:30am, then I got him at 10:40 am the next day. 31 hours and 10 minutes. Only took us three days to get reliable info on his last death. I'm still in shock that we got him so fast.</div></div><hr />
