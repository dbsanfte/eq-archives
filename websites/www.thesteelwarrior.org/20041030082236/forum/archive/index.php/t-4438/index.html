<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tak armor exceeds most of my current gear.  However, it takes me so long to get the points I want to make sure I get the biggest bang for my buck.<br />
<br />
I am looking at Ornate for my bracers, so I didn't analyze them.<br />
<br />
Here is a chart (I hope it formats well) that shows what happens when I wear Tak armor relative to my current gear.  You'll see the slot, about how many HPs I gain if I am max STA buffed, about how many I gain if I am not STA buffed, and the net AC * 1.5 which I believe is our AC bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
slot              helm       BP     arms      legs     hands<br />
buffed HP net       40       10       55        85       -15<br />
unbuffed HP net     34       28       61        37        21<br />
applied AC          23       36        6        20        11<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, you can see that the mighty Tak BP adds a relatively minor number of HPs to my tally - 19 assuming an average.  Yet 36 AC sounds nice.   The arms add a very stout amount of HPs, about 58. But the AC bump is modest.  The legs, being 60HP and 20AC sound very good.<br />
<br />
In the old days, it was HP HP HP.  Now mobs are hitting for 500, and I wonder if AC is more important again.<br />
<br />
So, which stat, AC or HP, is more important?  I'm mostly and exp group player and not the guild's MT.  I tend to play more in LDoN lately.  Level 65, 58AA all typical defensive, about AC1250 5100HPs unbuffed.<br />
<br />
(Or should i just table the armor, and go for a new weapon?)<br />
<br />
Anyone have an opinion?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just by looking at your magelo, your leg slot could use some raw HPs so get the Tak legs if your looking for your first piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since you are not your guild's MT, I would edge towards HP over AC.  <br />
<br />
IMO, if you spend most of your time exping in LDoN and not MTing the big hitters on raids, HP would do you better in the long run.  And you can never have enough HP when you hit some nasty AEing raid mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go legs, then arms, then BP, in your case.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Whoops, arms and sleeves are the same thing! Corrected that goof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get Everfrost legs.  They take half the time and have 8 sta vs the 10 agi on the tak legs.  The AC is 44 vs 48 and they have 70 raw hp vs the 85 on Tak.  I bought the everfrost legs and threw an 8 percent dodge mod on there for less than the cost of the Tak ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Buun is right about Mir legs.<br />
<br />
I think, with respect to stats, the Tak legs are broken, as well as the Mir BP.<br />
<br />
So thumbs-up for Mir Legs, with 8 STA and 70 HPs, vs Tak with 0 STA and 85 HPs.</div></div><hr />
