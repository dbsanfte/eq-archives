<br />
There's always been the big debate of what gets XP faster, questing, or grinding...I believe both. I chain-kill when rested, and quest when not -- but that's me.<br />
<br />
What's everyone else do? I'm constantly trying to learn and better myself by seeing how others play their warrior (the best way to learn.) <br />
<br />
As a 48 Warrior now, questing is sometimes...bleh. Grinding can be fun, especially when going for that one purple drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both. Unless you grind in very money spots, your gear will likely suck, plus you'll miss out on immersion and gryph points and a lot of other benefits.</div></div><hr />

I was max level in EQ for a LONG time.  I'm gonna be max level in WoW for a long time.  I'll enjoy the ride, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Actually, just re-read my third sentence.<br />
<br />
edit: which my third sentence was; &quot;What's everyone else do? I'm constantly trying to learn and better myself by seeing how others play their warrior (the best way to learn.) &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
A) It's a KoS mob that's in the way, OR<br />
<br />
B) We need something farmed, like material for tailoring<br />
<br />
I had my fill of meaningless grinding in EQ, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe it all depends on my mood and how busy I am away from the game.  I spend some nights farming instances for enchanting parts and money.  If I am pushing to get levels I quest as much as I can.   Some nights I'm running lower level guildies through instances to help them get some levels.  But for the most part, if it will give me exp, I will kill it.  Especially if its a dog type mob, cause they make me laugh everytime I crit on them and they sound like Fippy Darkpaw getting pwnd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darmok</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I came from SWG -- talk about pointless grinding. One of the only games ever where all that there was was grinding.<br />
<br />
It takes skill to ruin Star Wars...:(<br />
<br />
<br />
I like being able to quest and grind :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of people confuse the question of questing vs grinding.  Unless you spend your entire time traveling from continent to continent there is no such thing as leveling by just questing (at least not on the horde side).  At some point the XP lost from the time it takes to travel to zone X to get quest Y done becomes greater than if you just grind in one place instead.<br />
<br />
It's really just common sense.  It doesn't make sense for you to run all the way to The Hinterlands at level 38 to do the one quest you can do there (Grim Message), and then run all the way back to STV.<br />
<br />
Generally if you've at least say 3 quests in one area that doesn't require you to jump through too many hoops (and doable, of course), I'd get them out of the way first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally explore an entire map in a new area...pick up the quests for my level +2, maybe, taking note of the ones 3-4 levels higher than me.  Then I rock and roll.  If there is a shortage of quests but in my travels Ive discovered a not so crwded corner of the zone with a target rich environment.  I go there and grind say for a full level.  This activity say every 2-3 levels keeps me in cash.  And, it breaks up the monotony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 48 and I've done mostly quests.  Now with quests come some grinding due to the fact that you have to kill stuff for most of them.  And on the way to lots you have to kill mobs in your way!  That being said, I've done little true EQ type &quot;grinding&quot;.  Most of its been quests and instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play on the Horde side (lvl 37 hunter), and I level almost exclusively through questing - either completing quests for me, or helping friends with their quests.   I only remember twice when I finished up the last 2 bubbles of a level via grinding.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah...in both &quot;grind&quot; instances it was because I wanted a new pet and I needed the level (that's how I got Bubba, my new pet gorilla, last night   :p .)    (i.e.;  I've never done an xp grind in WoW for the sake of xp...I did enough of that in EQ to last a lifetime  ;) )<br />
<br />
As to the earlier comment about xp efficiency on the horde side for levelling via questing...I guess it's not that efficient (I do travel around alot), but I'm having a blast so I don't mind the travel.  In fact, I think I like it this way because I'd get bored staying in the same area for days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends for me.   I Quest ALOT.  I personally like the following scenerio.  I have 2 or 3 quest's in once instnace.   I am rested for the next 4 or so bubbles of xp .  The instnace has mostly elites at a lvl or 2 below me.<br />
<br />
THis is REALLY the formula for some great XP hit's.   <br />
<br />
Other than this it's pretty much a matter of my mood.  SOmetimes I'll just grind (especially when no group), and sometimes I'll quest.   If I have quest's I can do solo, I'll typically work on them if no group, which normally is the same as grinding.<br />
<br />
THis is a little off topic, but What WoW really need's IMO, is a way to get more info when trying to share quests.  Here's an example of what I'm referring to.  And maybe it exists, I just haven't seen it yet.<br />
<br />
I try to share a wuest with someone.  They are not elligible for this quest.  Why?  Is it lvl's?  Is it because this is a teir'd quest?  If so, what did I do to get to teh step I'm on now?  With some quest's stretching accross 8 or 9 lvl's, and with being able to have up to 20 quest's at a time (I typicalyl hang around 14 or 15) ... alot of times it's hard to remember what all got me to the current teir I am at.   If it's a friend I haven't grouped with in a couple lvl's, this could be a headache, as this lead's to the possability to having VERY few quest's in common for which to quest together.   I'd like to see a in game summation, including starting info for the first teir.  It'd be a big help to be able to help my friend(s) start the quest's, knock them off real quick, to get them caught up to me so that I can finish the elite part of it with friend's rather than pick up group number 5 with assclown number's 2 and 3  killing us with stoopid mistakes like constantly breaking sheep mez, or not offtanking a third mob.<br />
<br />
A tool like I described above would REALLY help in alot of way's.   As it stand's now, I have to attempt to go to thottbot, or allah and look up the info .. and with the current search option's on either site, which need expanded IMO to actually make them more useful, it'd be MUCH quicker too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agreed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, well I think questing goes a lot faster, but sometimes you just get to a point where you can't do anything solo or the quests are so far apart that I think it's more worth it just to sit and grind. I'm to the point where I would rather just grind it out because I'm sick of running all over for a bubble of exp. It gets obnoxious having to take a wyvern after you finish the zone's five quests it initially gives you just to fly back a couple levels later. <br />
<br />
I had plenty of quests until 40ish, but I just hit a wall around there and wound up grinding off a few different ogre camps. Seems to take just as long honestly, give or take an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furyobill</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in WoW the only real ways to get decent xp is to:<br />
<br />
A) Quest<br />
B) solo non elites<br />
C) group instances<br />
<br />
Questing gets old just as anything too much is a bad thing.  Sometimes i just wana sit back and rape a massload of mobs like we once did in EQ.  <br />
<br />
I wont even go into soloing mobs because thsi is a MMO not some single player game.  I pay the 15 bucks a month to play WITH ppl not off in a corner.  For all i care the solo option could be removed cause i simply wont do it.<br />
<br />
Well final option is my favorite because in instances theres always great quests as well and great loot.  The only problem is that as far as i have seen up to 34 there arent many instances.  They get really old really fast once youve beaten every name every quest in all 3 of em that ive seen =/.  WoW needs to add more instances or instance like dungeons across the lower lvl ranges to support more group play.  Honestly atm there isnt much to do as a group in the lower lvls wich is becoming more and more annoying.  I hear theres more instances as we lvl up but  by lvl 10 i think the majority of xp should be gotten with others or its not a TRUE MMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I either quest or farm for drops in instances.  I see no reason to grind when my quests often require I do grind-like things (like fight in the same general area for extended period of time waiting for drops for myself and my groupmates).  That said, instances are my favorite part of the game.  Once we have &quot;beaten&quot; an instance, I'll usually try to convince everyone to go back at least 3ish times just to have fun, get upgrades, and get some cash.  If they like the instance a lot too we'll go back numerous times.  Go go Striped Sabertooth!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I primarily solo and duo, but my guild is a big mish-mash of different levels, classes, and races. It makes it pretty difficult to try to quest together, so we've pretty much settled on solo quests, call in for help on elites, and we all get together for some of the best dungeon crawling ive ever done for instances.<br />
<br />
If im close to a level, i'll grind the rest of it out. If i'm rested and in an area where i'm fighting mobs +-1 my level, i'll grind until im not rested anymore. If I like the zone im in, i'll grind mobs and group with others to help them clear out the mobs they need for a quest. I also hang around areas grinding if there's a lot of silk or ore to be had, as I need a LOT of both for my tradeskills.<br />
<br />
I imagine the most &quot;effecient&quot; experience would be doing an instance while you're rested. Can't get much better than fighting mobs your level @ 2x the experience rate, then finishing it off with a few quest turnins to get 10k+ experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you do sometimes have those quest dead zones where alot are elite, can't do many on your own or they're too high etc.  I either try to bang out a level or just do instances etc.  I will say that questing is GREAT xp.  At level 50 I did the crystal quests in Un'Goro crater.  (talk to the gnome in back of the crystal cave in Marshal's Refuge)  Easiest 16K xp ever.  All I did was wander around and get crystals, got like 5100 for that one.  (they're just all over on the ground)  Then she tells you to go look at these crystal obelisks at different parts of the zone.  Wait, she gives THREE quests, one for each of them.  All you have to do is run up to them and click on them.  Some mob dodging invovled but you really don't have to fight much if any.  Went back to her and I got 3950X3 for those.  I was like man...hehe.  Anyway I kind of digress, but great xp from that quest.</div></div><hr />
