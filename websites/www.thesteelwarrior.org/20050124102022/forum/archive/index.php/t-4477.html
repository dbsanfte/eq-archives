To be frank and to the point I want better.  Recently moved to new server to play with all RL friends and these are the classes avail. to help me get the upgrades.<br />
lvl65-paly/druid/warx2/wiz/shm/mnk/nec<br />
lvl60-clericx2/paly<br />
All gear is mix of ornate/heraldic/mid quest and bazaar.<br />
No PoP bosses on up gear or kills avail.<br />
Given those classes what 2hander can i get for a DPS upgrade and agro upgrade.</div></div><hr />

That one axe from Ssra off the arch lich is good. So is the Bloodied Berzerker's Blade from Seru. Planes wise, Blade of War, SEWS, and I suppose Anathema from the new plane of hate are about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can handle ToV named, Gozzrem for Shovel of the Harvest or Eashan for Twisted Steel Bastard Sword.<br />
<br />
Anything better and its going to take a decent raid force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you can't get them, but my point is those are about the only good warriorish 2handers out there. I forgot about the greatstaff of the 4 winds from BoT though. That is probably the only one that's semi easily attainable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh, le poop.  Welp GSot4w will be a nice DPS upgrade.  Time to try and find a force for RZ !! That or hawk one o the teste's again :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSo4W is decent agro too, even without putting an aug on it. I drew agro off the MT just the other night on Mith Marr. Of course, he then killed me in about 4 seconds, since I wasn't *supposed* to draw agro, but hey, what are you gonna do? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to help me get the upgrades.<br />
lvl65-paly/druid/warx2/wiz/shm/mnk/nec<br />
lvl60-clericx2/paly <br />
<br />
Yes GSo4W!<br />
<br />
My suggestion is:<br />
<br />
- Go to the Battlefield section<br />
- Read the Strategy guide of the tower named<br />
- Lead an open raid on all 4 towers<br />
- Loot rule: GREED<br />
- GREED = highest roller get to do what he/she wants to do. Sell loot right of no-drop, Give loot right to friends, Loot and Destory... whatever<br />
- So you will have your own network of friends, just need 1 of them to win and you can get the loots.<br />
- Help your friends to get other upgrades such as the Pally 1hs, Hybrid Shoulder, Ornate stuffs, Spells, Ft2 helm, many more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Go4W is about the only really major improvement you'll likely see.  You might be able to take Auliffe with that crew, but it would be better if you brought in a few more friends.  I use the Go4W for almost all of my xp group tanking, the dps is nasty and it holds aggro pretty well, especially if you are working well with your slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victatious</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">or augement a Guadralek sword of the sky with anger III.... drops in ToV im trying to remember what mob ....... great 2H 41/38 dmg/dly 50AC, 100hp 179dd unresistable 0 sec stun proc woot! great sword</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think it's feazable with the people listed and maybe a few others?  If not I'm prolly stuck with workin for GSot4W and call it cool.  If only RZ took souls for BoW /sigh.</div></div><hr />

 As for a better 2H with a small crew. You could build a decent one from LDoN. Timeworn Desert Spear + Permafrost Chunk of Marring = 38/32 2H weapon. For 2200ish points. 3300ish and you have Anger 3 on it for a great agro 2H with a lot of damage too. No AC and it's piercing though. no idea why the top LDoN 2H are both piercing, more anti-warrior conspicy!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
 Just another realistic option for a small crew if yer desperate. Personally I'd go the 4 Winds route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it really is pretty odd that the best bought LDoN 2H weapons are piercing.</div></div><hr />

Vindication of Stone<br />
2: Decrease Hitpoints by 70<br />
3: Stun(2.00 sec)<br />
<br />
This weapon is one of the results of the Reactivate the Portals quest from the revamped Ruins of Paineel zone.  I think the hardest mob you're going to have to face is The Guardian of the Seal, which I hear is 2-3 groupable.  Also, you'll need a researcher to collect all pieces needed because they're going to have to combine them for you.</div></div><hr />

Then, hit the BoT tower named every night until your eyes bleed. GSo4W rocks and is a common drop.<br />
