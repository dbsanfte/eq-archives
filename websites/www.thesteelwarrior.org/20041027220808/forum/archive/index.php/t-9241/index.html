<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I may have been out of the loop too long..my poor tank is only 53 and I havent played him in a while, I did however take the advice and go to the droga combo which Im thankfull for.  I am familiar with Augmetns, and what is this attunable deal. I searched the forums and found a bunch of items that are attunable but Im not sure what it is and how I go about getting a weapon to that status.. Anyhelp would be apprecited, Im looking to take up playing my Warrior again. Thanks all..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Attuneable tag is basically SoE's answer for a few problems (and it is a good one, at least in my opinion. A beer to the man who came up with this (though I imagine he got it from another game anyway)).<br />
<br />
The Attuneable tag means that the item is tradeable until equipped (for gear) or placed into a piece of gear (for augments). After that, the item turns No Drop forever.<br />
<br />
This allows for a higher quality items to be allowed into the market without them getting farmed to the point that everyone can have them for little to no work. It's also a way for raid guilds that aren't entirely end-game to take some loot that would otherwise rot and either give it to someone else or sell it to buy something worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears up your question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does this mean that augments will not be no drop untill they are equiped and such?  If so, I hate to see the price on an anger 3 aug or something to that effect.. Anyways..I think I get what your saying.. IE, the weapons that were no drop, stay no drop untill they get put into a usable slot or have an augment placed in them?  Either way I appreciate the effort and the repsonse.. Have a great day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not all augs are attuneable. Any aug from LDoN is, and most likely will forever remain, No Drop at all times. Some of the new augs and the player-made augs from Omens of War are the ones that are attuneable.</div></div><hr />
