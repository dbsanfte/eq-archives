<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klaive</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm a 41 Dwarf warrior and I'm wearing some rather old gear.  About 90% of it is old world stuff and it's not bad but it's frustrating being a equipment based class w/o having great gear.  I was wondering if anyone could point me towards a good spot to solo for cash I would be much appreciated.  I have really odd hours and don't always have the option of grouping but if someone knows a good spot for me to farm I can make plenty of bandages and work on that low 2hb skill anyway.  I don't have PoP and I don't have Ykesha so I can't use any suggestions from those zones.<br />
<br />
So where can a lvl 41 warrior farm solo?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only place I can think of off-hand is maybe take a group to Lguk.  Every weapon that drops there is FS and that sells for like 5pp each.  Might take awhile but can make money that way and earn decent exp. at the same time.  Or maybe take 1 or 2 friends out to OoT and camp Gornit if he isn't camped.  He can drop up to 40pp FS and gems.  Along with killing Seafury's who can drop nice gems.  Lvl'd my Necro from 39-53 their made about 20k in all those lvl's from gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Farming means killing greens so I don't think you can work on your 2hb and kill greens at the same time.  Now, if you go to South Karana and take the gnolls near the spires or in paw these should be light blue to you, well most anyways, so you can practice your 2hb.  On top of that, they have FS weps and drop a couple of pp each.  I made as much as 250pp there after a couple of hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klaive</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gnolls are something I didn't think of.  FS is decent I guess and 500 -750 in a night would be great for me.  Thanks for the idea.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has ideas as to where I could farm by myself at 42(I leveld since the last post) I would really appreciate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A couple of options might be farming trade skill components like spider silks and HQ pelts in EK.  You should be able to kill a lot before having to bind.  Tailoring = suxors to raise as you have to farm components, so many people pay for your time here.  Kill spiders and lions and you will get many silks and high quality cat pelts.<br />
<br />
A second option is evil eyes in the Gorge.  6 minute respawn and they drop coin and small gems, (pearls, etc.) which sell for several pp a piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seneder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Read my post to the lvl 35 needing upgrade path, you can do the same with underfoot armor, silks and hides pay very well, boring as it is spiderlings in feerott pay extremely well.... good luck..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQguy1980</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">when my warrior was around 40 I started killing spiders and Lions in East Karana a few hours a night like every other night. i would get about 6 stacks of spider silks in 2 hours of killing. I would set up shop in bazaar when i went to bed and they would be sold morning. I sold silks for 5pp each (which is 100pp a stack) and HQ cat pelts for 15pp each (which is 300pp a stack). Before i knew it i had like 7k. Now that I am lvl 48 I run through Runny eye on my way to EK and kill the named goblins then hit the Evil Eyes in gorge. Usually gives my like 50pp - 75pp before i start killing spiders. Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EQguy1980</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also knew someone who made a Necro and lvled it up to like 55 and they soloed in HK at night killing the guards and make 2k an hour....just another thought.</div></div><hr />
