<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We all know that one of the biggest arguementsabout class balance is itemization and the difficulties involved in going back, by hand, and tweaking every single drop of every single encounter, something SoE is far from willing to do.<br />
<br />
We also know that itemization is a major contributor to the off-shoot of class balance.  If a paladin can derive exactly the same benefits and more from a piece of gear than a warrior then he is that much more powerful.<br />
<br />
So my idea is this:<br />
<br />
What about Recommended Class?<br />
<br />
Basically code it the same as Recommended Level, which is extremely easy to code.  It would be something like:<br />
<br />
If class does not = warrior, then -X Hit points, -Y Armor class, -Z STA<br />
<br />
and so on.  They can add this to a specific series of equipment that seem to be causing the most grief about class balance, it's not that hard to code, and paladins would no longer acquire greater useage from gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that would def make some ppl mad.. but i like the track you are thinking on... however rather than taking stuff away for other classes should give a boost for the reccomended class<br />
<br />
if class = warrior, then +HP +AC + STA etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont want a boost!  I just dont want anyone else to be able to tank like me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is a sound idea.  Of course there would be other recommended class items and we would not always be on the positive end of the stick (nice compromise IMHO).  But such is balance.<br />
<br />
Anything is better than the Generica &quot;one size fits all&quot; itemization marginalization of warrior equip that currently exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think this is a damned good idea.<br />
Recommended class: warrior<br />
Required class: plate/all<br />
Make it give anyone other than the warrior less bang for their buck on the HP/AC melee stat end of the spectrum.  That might actually work, and the code for it seems to be, for the most part, already in place.  Sounds like a damn good idea to me.</div></div><hr />

I concur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great idea! Recommended class: warrior, everyone else gets a 20% penalty to hp/ac on the item. Then have some recommended class: paladin stuff, or recommended class: shadow knight stuff, with mana/int/wis on it and about 10% less hp/ac than the warrior stuff. <br />
<br />
Just use the existing gear, have a small chunk of the vaunted 50-person team take a break from enhancing the newbie experience with a free backpack and go through the item database for the last 3 expansions to fix them.</div></div><hr />
