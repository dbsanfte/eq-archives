<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Astimas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow warriors!<br />
<br />
I am in bad need of some serious armor upgrading.  I have been off EQ for about a year and a lot has changed.  I have Kunark/Velious armor at the moment which is &quot;okay&quot;.  But I have seen earrings with more AC and stats than my current Bp.  I noticed the need for upgrading when I was doing some tanking in PoV and was getting creamed.  I was wondering if you guys could help me out as to what to look towards to that is reasonable in acheiving.  I do not expect to get the uberest of the uberest armor right off the bat either.  I know Hp, Sta, Agi are valued over AC, but that is if I am not mistaken.  I also just hit level 60.<br />
<br />
My weapons seem to be treating me good as far as dps and taunts as I got Copper Hammer of Stricking (Primary) and a Defender's LightBlade (Secondary).  <br />
<br />
I have been looking at &quot;Valorium Ring of Gallantry&quot; for the two rings but do not know much from there.   Hope you guys can get the time to lend a hand and hope you could mind the bit of ignorance on my behalf.  Many thanks in advance!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would help if you went to http://www.magelo.com and created a profile for your character so people could see exactly what you are using so that suggestions can be made from there.  Post your message with the link to your magelo and you should have plenty of replies with suggestions.</div></div><hr />

While you're at it with the CoV faction then, quest Draconic Pauldrons.<br />
<br />
I also notice you're a Human Warrior, if you happen to have any skill in Smithing, Luminent Heraldic would be a nice upgrade (i know it's nto Fierce Heraldic, but still)<br />
<br />
New Haste.  Runebranded Girlde, Rune Bolster Belt are nice.  If you have the cash, Cloak of Flames, Cloak of Crystalline Waters.<br />
<br />
New back slot (if you don't get Back Haste)- Lodizal Shell Shield will do more for you than the CBS, Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak isn't too bad.  If you have the cash Hiero Cloak, Pernicicy Cloak.<br />
<br />
New Face: Eyepatch of Plunder quest isn't too bad.<br />
<br />
New Neck: Clattering Bone Necklace, Dragon Tooth Choker<br />
<br />
New Ear: Orc Fang Earrings with the +15 HP will do more for you than the Cougar Claw.  If you have the cash, Mosquito Leg Earrings are nice, so are Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement.<br />
<br />
New Helm: Even Cobalt, with 5 more AC and Clicky Serpant Sight will do more than the +5 Int +5 Cha. Helm of Raldukan is very nice.<br />
<br />
Look for people selling MQ SS plate armor, and of that would be an upgrade.<br />
<br />
All I can think of right now.  Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AC is not the redheaded stepchild it was in SoL either.  You need a smattering of all the above to get by now.<br />
<br />
Earrings, get Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement.. Woo, magelo up in another window now. Greater Cloak of Pernicity, Heavy Rubicite Girdle, your visable armor slots you can fill with as much ornate as you can possibly afford... hard to tell what you can afford though. What is your limit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aratus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your weapons look good, so I'll just focus on the armor.<br />
<br />
If you're on Claws of Veeshan faction, working on the quest in Western Wastes is simple and easy. Kill the dragon hunters, hand in their heads in Skyshrine. Results are these (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12557).<br />
<br />
A decent, low cost, upgrade to your neck item can be Tracking Wolf Collar (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=8905) or Clattering Bone Necklace (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6418). I've seen the Necklace drop as low as 500 platinum.<br />
<br />
Valorium rings are a nice upgrade, some new earrings would do you good as well. There's many earrings out there you can upgrade with. Twisted Ring Loop (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40104) being one of them. These drop randomly off the miners in Torgiran Mines. It's hard to find the right earrings to suggest. There's just a ton of decent HP/Sta earrings out there right now. If you have money to burn though, get some Bloodmetal Earrings.<br />
<br />
For your greaves, you can keep an eye out for Barbed Rubicite Greaves (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27860) in the Bazaar, prices have pretty much tanked on them.<br />
<br />
If you're able to, spend some time in Kael/Skyshrine and grab yourselves some Plate armor. Time in Veksar would make for some nice upgrades also, specifically a Soulscream Belt (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65570).<br />
<br />
An' lastly... that range item has gotta go. Lots of stuffs you can put in there. I'm not sure how much a Nightmarewood Compound Bow goes for, if it's cheap enough it'd make for a low cost decent upgrade. If you can manage Nadox though, go for a Darkwood Bow of Suffering (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40074).<br />
<br />
An' like Wychway asked... what's your limit that you can afford? That'd help out suggestions a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Astimas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have about 20k at the moment.  I was thinking about saving up for a rarer more prestine drop once I get into the 75k+ caliber.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Of course buying some of the ornate armor molds and making up some Kizrak armor is also a nice option.  It would just bypass all of the other armors for the most part in the slots that you can get.  I am not sure what the ornate plate molds are selling for now, but I got my helm, arms, boots, and gauntlets in the 20-35k range per item.  For now it might be best to upgrade several slots with the money you have rather than saving up for one item at a time because using the armor that you have now in PoP will get you stomped pretty good unfortunately.  Lots of the suggested items are a few thousand plats or less, so you can easily upgrade several pieces significantly with what you have.  I am not sure how they compare now, but the earring of solstice is still quite nice and the items to make that combine are generally buyable for 3k or less now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You have a ton of needs and with only 20k, not much to meet those needs with.  Kael or Skyshrine quest armor is a huge upgrade across the board and reletively cheap.  A Solstice earring would be a very nice upgrade.  I would say that you could safely ignore that Valorium rings, they are not that big of an upgrade and you have far more pressing needs.  If you are in a guild that can do ToV for Kael/SS armor, they can also do Vindi, which covers your BP needs.  There are a bunch of decent masks in the 1-2k range which would help as well.  Ignore big ticket items, just get a lot of decent midlevel upgrades rather than one or two big ones.</div></div><hr />

Im not sure what Forgotten Alliance is capable of, but you can probably find a few friends to go with you to HoT.  1 group is all you need really, but take 7-12 peeps to be safe.  You can probably buy most of your SS MQ pieces for almost nothing, but the real xp u get tanking dragons in HoT is a must.  This costs nothing but your time that you invest.  Dont expect to be armour drops on every dragon, but I think I remember SoE up'd the drop rate long ago.  You can alos find a few nice items with decent HP for all under 20k.  Chokadai shoulders (+55hp) are down to 6-7k... /bazaar is your friend.</div></div><hr />
