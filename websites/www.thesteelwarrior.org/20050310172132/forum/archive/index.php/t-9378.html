But since I had just installed Windows XP SP2 before the patch, I am not sure if that is the cause, or if it have to do with the new everquest patch  :confused:</div></div><hr />

When I run up to players it will freeze up to load them I guess.  I don't know if its the same deal but sounds kinda like my HD, constantly doing something.<br />

edit - I'm on 98 so not sure if its an os problem</div></div><hr />

Ahh, thats something else though, press Alt+J and disable the journal feature, should fix it nicely.</div></div><hr />

It might be a memory leak. If you're using all your RAM, your system will be accessing the swap file on the hard drive pretty much constantly as EQ runs. You may want to keep your task manager running and watch your memory utilization, and specifically how much memory the eqgame.exe process is consuming.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, its highly annoying. It seems to write 6-10kb to the dbg.txt file every time you zone. And members/leaving raid also generates debug out there..<br />
<br />
I can understand why they need to log debug output for people that have gfx problems etc, but they really ought to make an option to turn debug logging OFF for those of us, whose only problem is.. the debug output itself :p</div></div><hr />

I have seen the exact same behaviour since the latest patch.  Changing leadership of the raid is the most blatant trigger (see a delay in UI and HD spin).  I have 2 gigs of pc3200 400mhz ram so I doubt its my machine.</div></div><hr />

Just a wild guess but it could be loading the MP3s for that particular race in case that person uses a voice macro?</div></div><hr />

I assume that it's swapping out the textures for the zone from the HD to memory. After being in the zone for a few minutes it seems to even itself out unless a bunch of players I haven't seen yet or a big train runs by...then everything slows down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm running with 2gb ram and all models off, so I doubt thats the problem. Coding-wise, what I found really strange is that even when I zone back and forth between the same 2 zones, its still thrashing my HD. You would think it would have cached all the information it needed to read in some of the spare memory.<br />
<br />
But there seem to be a few posts about this on the Tech Support forums as well, I hope one of their programmers will notice and look into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frawdo</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having the same problem at well. I honestly thought my hard drive was broken, the noise and amount of noise it was making was very unusual for running Everquest. Glad to see I'm not alone, maybe I won't format after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed the same thing as well, and was watching my eqgame.exe while playing, and it seems to vary between 200 and 350 megs, which would still leave ~50 megs free ram after winxp and all its services and eqgame are loaded.  It seems like the game gets swapped out to disk as often as possible, and I don't know why.<br />
<br />
There are times, when I will zone into a zone (which takes FOREVER now) then after a bit, run around a corner, or turn, and the whole game will lock up for a long long time (like 10 seconds or more) while the HD thrashes.  This happens even when I have quite a bit of free ram.  Its total BULLSHIT that the game pages itself to the disk, even paging files that are currently in active use.  <br />
<br />
Anyone know if there is a way to make WinXP run a program with priority set so it stays in ram if at all possible, swapping EVERYTHING else first?  I'm thinking of turning off the page file and running solely on ram to see if its the game getting paged to disk, or the game not loading all the files it needs in the first place.  I have a feeling that its the game loading and unloading additional files that is making it slow down.<br />
<br />
Also, I just now thought, I have my EQ set to run at a max of 40FPS...perhaps its not just a FPS slider, but more of a &quot;nice&quot; slider (a la linux nice settings), in linux, you can run a program and set a &quot;nice&quot; level for it, from -19 to 20 and depending on the nice setting, the program can either be the last thing to get processor cycles and get paged constantly, or be the last thing to get paged, and use all the processor cycles.  Perhaps setting the FPS slider to the max it will go will keep EQ in the forground as much as possible.<br />
<br />
The REALLY odd thing is, I have the same processor, a MUCH better video card, faster HD, same amount and speed of ram, and same mobo as my wife's computer, but hers NEVER locks up for 10-15 seconds at a time, nor does it ever take more than 15 seconds to zone...Her FPS slider is set to max, she runs mostly old models (I run new, on a MUCH faster video card).  When she tries to alt-tab EQ it crashes the game a lot, while I can usually alt-tab, very very odd.  More I think about it, the more I think it might be the new FPS slider that is the problem.<br />
<br />
Tonight I will set my FPS slider to max, and restart EQ (just to make sure it runs with the new setting) and see if I get the same problems.<br />
<br />
PS If I remember right, these problems started after the patch that added the slider for FPS and the advanced tab on display....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try checking your dbg.txt and see if its spewing a lot of info out every zone etc.. if it is, some people are saying if you make the file read only it will stop. It doesnt happen to me so no idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, nothing wrong in the dbg.txt file, and it wasnt being written to very often.<br />
<br />
Here is what I did:<br />
<br />
Turned off all the new models, except iksar and woodelf female, since thats what the wife and I play.  I think this help very very little.<br />
<br />
Then, I turned off the social animations...went from 30 second to 3 minute zone times to 5 seconds, or less...<br />
<br />
Why the HELL does social animations make it go up so much?  That is rediculous.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all fixed now, I will try turning on all the new animations again, and see if it was soley that crappy social animation thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrathbane</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys think thats bad?<br />
<br />
I leave both covers of my PC off, I have a HD cooler fan, and when I play EQ (ONLY in EQ mind you), my HDs STILL heat up so bad, that when i touch them, I have to remove my hand immediately else i get burned.<br />
<br />
Now THATS not right. And it only does it when I play EQ too. Got 2 gigs of ram so I know its not a ram issue as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if you wanna see a MAJOR increase in performance, turn off sounds from the options menu. I used to get 20fps with sounds on, now when they're off, i get a constant 40fps, even in raid situations with full models and particle effects on, I just listen to music in the background with Winamp.</div></div><hr />
