<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One quick question: This came up last night because we kinda got f**ked by another guild in Ssra and were forced to start the Cursed cycle early.<br />
<br />
I know the Exiled and Cursed despawn but does the GLYPHED despawn after he's up?<br />
<br />
If you want to know the details on what happend basically we were waiting for a few more to get to Ssra / login and someone from another guild pulled a taskmaster. One of our scouts said he saw the TM's corses so we decided that we better start the cycle or get screwed and have to wait 2 hours. We pulled all the TM's Wardens and Roths. Once those were dead Glyphed didnt' spawn and we checked track to find the the last TM ( that was pulled by other guild ) was still up but not in the basement and we couldn't find it.  We petitioned and blah blah and after about 30-40 min we decided to just cut our losses and run back to take out XtC and HP. When we got up to Comm1 we found the Taskmaster that was missing.   The person from soandso guild pulled him up their or agro'd him up there and he got stuck. We killed him but it was already past the 1 hour mark we needed to hit to start the cycle.<br />
<br />
This would have been our first Cursed attempt.  We killed XtC fast but since it was our first HP run it took us a little longer than expected to set up and we ended up losing cused to another guild /cry. <br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
Okay basically I am just wondering if you can spawn the glyphed and then just sit on him until people show up or does he despawn?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
