<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i'm having a few agro issues, and i'm looking for some insight.<br />
<br />
I passed 2 DBoW for warriors that didnt have a BoW<br />
I took a 2 Month break and 2 more DBoW dropped.<br />
(Guild Stopped doing Time during my break)<br />
Thats 4 DBoW in almost 12 months of Time Farming<br />
<br />
We killed Braxt 5 Times, got 2 Fleshbiter.<br />
Passed them for warriors witout Agro weapons.<br />
<br />
So i'm still using my BoW i got Almost two years ago.<br />
We arent going to do Time/Barxt again so thats out the question.<br />
Starting in Txevu atm, not very deep yet.<br />
<br />
And i'm starting to feel that i dont get enough from the BoW anymore.<br />
Despite beeing Full AA and having CE25.<br />
<br />
Do you know anyone in a similar situation ?<br />
What would be your choices if you were in my position ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
PS : All i have is a JoS gotten for the cool look</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if you wanna keep up to the 2h in the past. Halbred of Endless Pain would be a nice upgrade.  Jos + a3 mainhand plus any decent offhand works nicely as well until you can get something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't rule out piercing. <br />
<br />
There's some very nice 1hp items that would own with anger 3 on them for someone without the option of EoE or JoS (I'm assuming if you're not doing Barxxt Ikkinz 2 is WAY out of the question) Also, don't discount BoC as a viable off hand option, 3 ppm of 600-700 hate's nothing to sneeze at even with the loss of melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you could rally some boredom on a Saturday to go clear PoTime and pray?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could beg for them to do Time again! =(<br />
<br />
If you already have a JoS, I'd consider rounding up some friends to farm cursed for a bloodfrenzy.  When aug'ed, it's probably the best offhander for aggro..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zoo Scimitar? (Forgot name) Dunno if you still do that,<br />
<br />
HoEP would probably be decent too but 2hders  arnt great anymore, but it will be a lot better then a BoW.<br />
<br />
dunno if i missed another post, but wb! (and update sig!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lanamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Zoo Scimitar? (Forgot name) Dunno if you still do that<br />
Chaotic Black Scimitar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68834)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">discussion came up about a warrior in our guild that is using bow as well . <br />
the arguments boiled down to the statment, (notmy own)<br />
<br />
&quot; Any set of 1hand weapons auged with anger 3 will be &gt; in terms of aggro than bow&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
logic being  :bow = 2 anger procs and some meele dps<br />
<br />
             <br />
                    : ANY 1hander set would be 2 anger procs and some meele dps ( AND  2 more inate weapon procs )<br />
<br />
the difference is the 2 additional weapon procs.<br />
<br />
if u can match or beat the BoW's dps ratio then go for it , if not its a measurment of the loss in dps ratio compared to the gain of 2 more inate weapon procs,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gonna try Chaotic Black Scimitar + JoS   (Even if i hate the extra rune idea)<br />
<br />
Bye bye DBoW/JoS or Fleshbiter/JoS dreams.<br />
I dont like Demerix's look, so will  pass on that one.<br />
<br />
Wonder how good the Halberd would be 65/35 Stun is a rather nice ratio.<br />
<br />
4.5 Anger +  4.5 Runic/Frostbite   vs   3 Anger + 3 Stun.<br />
<br />
Seems adding extra procs tips the balance in favor of the dual wield combo.<br />
Specially with WA5 , this is amplified by having CE.<br />
<br />
<br />
WTB big phat 2H !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HOEP is a nice weapon, but you wont hold a candle to DB or Fleshbiter with it auged with anger 3 ....If you seem to just off tank some and not really thrown into the mix take the HoEp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not a half bad idea honestly either....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>recurse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One of our guys dw's the JoS and a 'Obsidian Scimitar of War' offhended he does just fine. It blows the bow warriors that we have left out of the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i use bloodfrenzy/jos for tanking... sigh...rz... i hate you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use Dbotw/Gbos. My problem is opposite of you, err the other side of you. Not been able to find a decent offhand. Our drop rate on EoE is 2/16 where our drop rate on dbotw is 5/14.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Promethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I still use Vanazir for tanking, and it works just great.<br />
<br />
I'd be less concerned with your gear and more concerned with your dipshit guildmates who are intent on pulling aggro off you, if you can't hold aggro with a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We don't do Time, and had horrible luck with Fleshbiters, so I sucked it up and used JoS / Demerix with Anger 3 aug's in both, then took Edge of Chaos and moved the anger 3 to it with Demerix in offhand and do just fine tanking, not as good as the others but it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd be less concerned with your gear and more concerned with your dipshit guildmates who are intent on pulling aggro off you, if you can't hold aggro with a BoW.While I am a firm believer that the agro equation requires both the tank and the DPS to cooperate to maintain solid agro, I have to disagree with this statement. The BoW was a great weapon for a long time, but with the addition of proc augs, WA, EoA, and the insane better than 1:1 ratio on 1hers now, BoW is hardly the godly weapon it once was. At the high end of the game, you have to have appropriate tanking weapons to hold up your end of the bargain. Once you get to the point that your DPS classes are cranking out 400+ DPS, you can't reasobly expect them to drop their DPS low enough to allow you to keep agro. With a solid set of properly set up 1hers, a warrior can generate more than enough hate to keep solid agro even with rogues, monks, and wizards unloading massive damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Next time I see your name in HoTT im soo linking this thread to the tank channel Prom :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well BoW+A3+Raex+CE25+SoPM was enough for GoD until Uqua.<br />
<br />
With the arrival of all that Qvic armor and some badass ratio weapons i  have trouble.<br />
After Inktuta this became even worse , now in Texvu i avoid all burn fights.<br />
<br />
Thats why i asked here for some information, in case there are people in my case.<br />
<br />
The guild could full burn from 95% since the day i got the BoW and did just that for 2 years.<br />
Thats not the case anymore. So its not the guild by mostly me falling behind.</div></div><hr />
