<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">12 banked but Im gonna blow 7 on origin I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">30, of course.</div></div><hr />

Origin wont be buyable till lvl 67</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had 30 banked and 99% in 65 for a week, on the last kill last night I died and like an idiot looted my whole corpse before getting my rez, so now i have to grind again for a bit before I ding 66 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Banked AAs? I wish. I have 1 1/2 AAs sitting but that's half of my ID5 so doesn't count. I'm just a lowly gimp with 99AAs so banking them wasn't really an option for me. After I grind out lvl 70 over the next 2-3 days I'll get back to the AA grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have had 30 banked for a while now, I just would get to the 30 then spend some. Then rinse and repeat. Also had 100% into 65 on and off for over a year now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Marduka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I already saved 30 aa's like 1+ month ago and then always bought some crap aa's so i can save more. Getting close to 500 now  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">only 3 because i havent been able to sit and xp for a long time</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have 22.  For about 3 milliseconds I thought about buying sturdy 5 but immediately came to my senses.  IMO if you buy sturdy 5 and you have less than 400 AA you are an EQrankings whore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Figure, even though I only have Sturdiness 1 and WA2, the first thing I will do when hit 70th is grind more defensive AAs so, may as well get them started now and then get back to the &quot;fun&quot; AAs... maybe even earn my marshall title. Only 120 or so AAs here, so 10 banked is not a small percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">30, waiting since more than 2 months</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vendak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Last night, the night before OOW went live, I had just dinged Strudiness 5.  So i've got 0 banked.  I wanted to cry when I realized I had *just* finished all my Defensive AA ever, just in time to have more set in front of me + 5 more levels.  That Marshall title and Offensive AA will have to wait even longer =(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">28 banked and itching for the servers to go up.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I have just over 500 now and 30 saved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think for 20 AA you could buy delay death 4 for 400 HPs, which is just as good as regular HPs (well you can't attack while you're unconscious, but let's hope you don't stay there very long).<br />
<br />
21 banked here because I had to do Warlord Tenacity 3 the last minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">30, and 99 percent into level, i died to the last mob on our raid at like 2 percent last night ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, guess im an eqrankings whore then. I've been wanting to get sturdiness 5 done with for ages now, and I dont give a rats ass if the expansion has better. Sturdiness 5 done, and then im moving on to the next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well before OoW sturdiness 5 with under 200 aa's would make sense but yeah omens will change aa progression quite a bit.  I guess it's alright though because I remember the arguements around the PoP era that there's really not a huge difference between a 200aa or 500aa warrior which at the time was pretty much true.  Yes, sturdi 5 sucked ass spending 20 aa's on though, definantly not gonna be worth it for a good while now with OoW out.  28 banked here but I forgot to cap my damn regular xp cause I didn't realize when omens was coming out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">30 of course. Didn't quite make it to 600 before this morning. Pesky Weddings and jobs and real life!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>biggpudge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">had 30 aa but had to buy something stupid (living shield 2) at 27aa. had a raid last night so I'm at 97% reg exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have a grand total of 3 saved up...  (190aa spent, atm)<br />
I'm debating getting my marshal title or getting defensives as I level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">All AAs gone... ID6/LR6. 53 HP on ding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">lol, finally gave up and decided to tell sturdiness 5 to go bonk a sheep.<br />
<br />
Ding 66 + Oow defensives rank1 + Oow stats rank 1. Think I gained 106hp from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Was 99% percent into lvl.  Had 30 saved last night and spent one for a total of 29 logging into new expansion today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I had 29  banked a couple weeks ago and kept considering buying sturdiness 5.  Then I decided screw it, took a much needed break and didn't play EQ much for a couple weeks, then came back for OoW, dinged 66, and bought the first level of avoidance and mitigation.  So I have 20 more points saved.  I might hold on to them until 67 and then blow 17 on avoidance and mitigation 2 plus origin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just 7 banked here.<br />
<br />
Have spent most of my time in RL the last 3 months....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">All AAs gone... ID6/LR6. 53 HP on ding.<br />
<br />
53?  I got 83 when I dinged.  I made sure to make a note of it.  STA went up to 310.  No idea what we get per point of STA anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also got 83.  Since someone else got 53 I think it's safe to assume that those 5 points of sta were were 30 hps, which is back to 6/sta like we got at level 60.  Will be interesting to see if it stays that way.</div></div><hr />
