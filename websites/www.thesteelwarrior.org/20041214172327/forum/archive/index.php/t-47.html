<br />
Well I submitted a petition last night to ask if that was indeed the case and 3 GM's swear til they are BLUE in the face that there is no loss of exp if you split it at all ...<br />
<br />
Does someone have some proof or an explanation for my tired brain ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Whether they have all been addressed, no one knows.  Myself, I find exp grinding tedious enough that any chance is too much...</div></div><hr />

While you will get the same amout of levels and AAs as someone who goes 100% either way, the person going 100% will get the results quicker.  They will get either the AA's or levels sooner while the split person will get them at a slightly slower rate.<br />
<br />
Its really preference.  I say keep it 100% either way, espically if there are split bugs wandering around as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said that they fixed it, but I'm with Raun.  Even if there's no bugs, splitting isn't a good idea.  If it takes you 2 weeks to get 1 level and 3 aa points on a 50/50 split, you would have been better off getting the level in one week and the 3 aa points the next week.  Probably getting the level would even make the AAs go faster, or vice-versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as stated before, it was buggy before and corrected since. but anyway splitting xp has no use other than psychologics ones ... it is more effective to go 100% one then 100% other , as you will have to wait less before you see 1st increase , even if at the end u finish at the same state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you are already level 65, its not too big of a deal to go 90/10 split. Thats what I do when I get below 10% regular xp. Sure getting an aa xp point is a little slower but its not that noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe its cause i dont have a great need for AA anymore but i have been doing a 90/10 split (aa/regular) for some time and its nice cause you still get AA but im almost 40% into 65 which is just nice to have.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, it's fun to ding every time you get rezzed :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chongo</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did was;<br />
<br />
powered it to 65. 100% exp into Regexp.<br />
<br />
I did this up to 10% into level 65.<br />
<br />
Then, I went 100% into aa.<br />
<br />
I've been nearing the point, after dying numbers times on raid encounters, that i've been 0% into my level before rez. <br />
<br />
So I've been rebuilding that buffer again. 100% reg exp up to 10% into level 65.<br />
<br />
However, that seems time consuming. So what I've started to do, get to 10% into level 65, then split exp 90% to aaexp and 10% to regexp.<br />
<br />
In the upcoming weeks/months, this should even out nicely.<br />
<br />
As it was said before, taking 10% away from aaexp really isn't that noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there are any bugs with it.<br />
<br />
As for splitting or non splitting I didn't split when I was doing exp for aa points or for levels, but now that I am 65 with most of the AAs I want, and the experience I get is mostly on raids, I tend to do 10/90 or 20/80 split.  It allows me to die and retain the same level of experience in 65, but also gain a lot of aa exp on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the same as Chongo... 100% reg to 65, 10% in, 100% to AAs, then once i get low (omg, I die one more time and I re-visit 64) and I re-do my buffer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most players don't trust eq math....  So therefore going 100% one way or the other is safe.  If you split up the xp then your trusting vi to do math properly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If indeed the math isn't being done correctly, it's sooo minimal that I can't tell.  I group w/ others that are doing 100% aa vs my 90/10... and they approximately ding an aa when i'm ~90% through.<br />
<br />
And that's all the proof I need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point.. but if the 10% you're not getting into AA is so minimal.. is it affecting your normal EXP bar any?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can easily test this. Just choose a camp location, measure the amount of exp you get after 10-20 kills at 100% reg, then measure the amount of exp your get after 10-20 kills at 100% AA, then go 50%/50% for 10-20 kills and see if the amount of reg versus AA is half of what you earned a few minutes ago with the same number of mobs in the same camp.</div></div><hr />

Good point.. but if the 10% you're not getting into AA is so minimal.. is it affecting your normal EXP bar any?  <br />
<br />
Yes, the amount of exp added to my regular exp bar IS very minimal.<br />
<br />
But so is the exp loss when you get a 96% ress.<br />
<br />
For arguments sake, lets say I've been exping 2hrs. Lets say i'm at a 90/10 percentage. Let's say I walk away w/ 1.5aa earned in that 2hrs. I'll probably only have gained 3% regxp.<br />
<br />
But remember, the point isn't to actively level my reg exp, it's to save my buffer. Hell, if i could go 95/5 I would.<br />
<br />
This is all coming from a 65 war, I have no need to get reg exp anymore. You Baadan, on the other hand, may not want to use this method until later.</div></div><hr />

I would say its about 20-25 mobs per 1 percent of real xp when you are on the 90/10 split. which isnt too bad and it really doest slow down your aa xp all that much</div></div><hr />

If im fighting low blues or light blues , i put it almost all to AA , as they will actually move the aa bar. If im fighting mobs close to my lvl or above i go all to reg exp. Not sure if it really matters at all , but at least my bars keep moveing heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did 100% regular xp til I hit 65, stayed there til I had 20% into 65, then switched to 100% AAxp.  Any time I drop below about 15% into 65 I switch to 100% regular xp again until I'm back at 20.  10 is probably fine too, I just like a nice big buffer in case something goes horribly wrong or I have a couple of deaths without a res.  Plus, like others have said it's just more efficient to go 100% either way unless they have the split messed up such that you gain more total xp with it split.</div></div><hr />

Fuck no!! My luck, I would brain-fart someday and loot without a rez and then wouldnt be able to wear half of my gear from lack of lvl65!! :D  lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here's what I did/do.<br />
100% level to 65.<br />
got 10-12% buffer built up.<br />
Went 100% into AA, but noticed that dying a few times on raids was not very nice to my buffer, so I went 90% AA 10% level.<br />
In BoT with 90% going to AA and 10% going to level, I still get the 1-2% AA per kill that I was getting at 100% AA, and every once in a while, I would get 1% reg. level... so when xping in BoT and everywhere else I just keep it at 90% AA and 10% level. Keeps the buffer strong, and still gains me AA's at a normal pace. <br />
I must say, I love the Sol Ro XP... though the mobs are not too nice as far as the dmg they hit for, split pulling, amount of HP they have.... but 2-3% a kill is a nice thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had it set on 20% AA, after reading this thread and considering the levels &gt; aa threads I switched it back and still don't notice any increase in exp.</div></div><hr />
