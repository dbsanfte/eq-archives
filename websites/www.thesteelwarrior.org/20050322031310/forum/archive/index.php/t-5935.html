Which do you think is the better of the 2 (I know there are more but I am just tlaking about these 2!) fast food estiblishments?<br />

I prefer McDonalds myself.  Nothing like sitting down to a Big Mac and grabbing a 20 peice box to take home for late night raid snackage!</div></div><hr />

If that's not a viable choice, then Wendy's<br />
<br />
If I simply must choose one of those two, then McDonalds for the 20 piece Chicken nuggets.</div></div><hr />

I usually just buy a ton of frozen dinners and cans of soup and heat up something when I get hungry.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Burger King burgers are the highest in fat and calories than any other fast food chain.  BK also ranked lowest of any major fast food chain on cleanliness.<br />
<br />
That said, their burgers are pretty good.  I try to stay away from all those places tho, that stuff will kill you.<br />
<br />
I really wish they had Hardees down here, becuase sometimes you just need a mushroom and swiss burger and they are the only ones that have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neither. I'll make a sandwich instead.<br />
<br />
As for Hardees, I lived in Augusta, GA for about 13 years and they had atleast 10 Hardees in the area. They used to be the absolute worst fast food restaurant, especially the hamburgers. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what was in them, but they didn't taste right. Sorta like they put spam in or some other filler, but they boasted 100% beef like everyone else. It mighta been all beef, but not ground steak. I especially liked the commercial where they fessed-up to being crappy food and decided to use angus beef. Haven't heard from them since, but judging by the reactions here they have done a full 180.<br />
<br />
Out of the 10 original restaurants only 2-3 were still open when I moved in 99'.<br />
<br />
edit: Just checked online and there are still 2 of them, but they used to be all over the place. One road even had 2 of them about a mile apart.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when I was still willing to eat in fast food places I liked BK because it was cooked over a fire, and you just cant beat meat (or whatever it is) cooked over a flame.  Since I've been actually eating like a bodybuilder is supposed to I just avoid them.  Tried one of Hardee's new burgers once and it was pretty tasty for a fast food burger, far superior to Mickey D's. <br />
However, there's a little locally owned short order place across the street from my job that makes some outstanding burgers.  They use real meat, cook on a flat top grill, and their portabello mushroom and swiss burger makes one hell of a good cheat meal on Fridays. :)</div></div><hr />

Mc Donald’s &gt; Burger King<br />
<br />
BK microwaves ever shamich they make, which makes it slightly soggy. No way can you successfully nuke a burger the same way every time. Besides... McD's adds sugar to it's buns for added flavor...mmm mmm good.</div></div><hr />

it's basically an open faced sandwich made with whatever ( you'll never eat the same one twice ) is on the grill after 2 am with a side of homefries and a coke for like $4.00<br />

McD's fries tho are the win. Plus the all-white meat McNuggets.</div></div><hr />

Oh man Albertos owns.  Even after they got busted by INS and one of their branches got caught with cats in the refrigerator, I still went there.  I really missed that place when I left Phoenix.  Carne Asada Burrito and the Chimichanga were awesome.  Albertos taught me that when it comes to Mexican food, the grubbier the place looks, the better the food is.</div></div><hr />

Where in Pa Tarn?  I am from the King of Prussia/Philly area and have never heard of it.<br />
<br />
Now someone mentioned Cheesesteaks earlier and I still get into arguments w/ the few guildies I got from back there about which is better Pats or Geno's.  Personally I love Pats, but when I am back home I'll take whatever I can get.</div></div><hr />

Man it's awesome if anyone has a Rallys around them should try it.  Coming in close 2nd would be the Mushroom and Swiss Burger from Hardee's it is pretty awesome to.  Also those new Atkin Wraps from Subway are pretty uber I eat them all the time.  <br />
<br />
If I had to pick between McDonalds and BK though Mickie D's all the way.  There is nothing BK can do better than McDonalds at least where I live.  BK fires suck it's like they cook a whole thing and use them all day always soggy and cold.  Burgers taste like shit.  Drinks are always flat.  McDonalds whew nothing beats a Big Mac and 20 Nuggets since the ones here are open 24 Hours.  <br />
<br />
Wendys ugh I don't know how anyone can like them besides just for there Frosties.  The ones here there Burgers are mega soggy there fries are half cooked there Frosties do own though.  Incase you all can't tell I eat Fast Food a lot :p.  Thats because never anything to eat at home.  Taco Bell is good I love there Steak Soft Taco and KFC sucks ass.</div></div><hr />

There's a few of them about. I didn't think they were too spread out over the state or country, but around here, it's the busiest &amp; best place around for burgers or chicken sandwhiches.<br />
