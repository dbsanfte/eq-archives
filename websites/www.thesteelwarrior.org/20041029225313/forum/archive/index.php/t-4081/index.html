I honestly don't know what the hell happened.  I merely logged in to read guildchat say, &quot;Emp at ZI!&quot;.  I laughed at first because it's not exactly something you hear every day.  You figure, you spent countless hours, depending on your luck of course, to get access to his chambers and now he's kicking everyone's butt at the zoneline because he decided to follow a wizard after they succored themself.  Believe me, everyone's reaction, including myself, can be best summed up by a good ole WTF.  I think it had something to do with a dot being on him at the time, but I must admit, I'm not entirely sure.  I had just gotten home from work when this all happened.<br />
<br />
The point I'm trying to make though is, umm, shouldn't Emp be limited to only his throne room? <br />
<br />
By the way, I do want to thank the guild for cleaning this up.  The mighty Emperor camping the entrance of his own temple is NOT cool.  :eek: :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How much people were ur raid force? average lv? Composition?<br />
Easy fight? overkill? wipe? MT needs CH chain or just patch will do? ty for the info ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok does this mean that you can get into VT without camping com1/2/taskmaster/etc? eheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doubt it...i'd assume that the wraiths would still pop in Emp's room after he dies, so you would still need Emp keys to finish the VT key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raiddinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, Kroghar, For toughness I guess if you take a guild that just got their first kill on the AOW into prep room and tell them to go you would have a wipe in probably 3 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
This fight required a lot of planning and healing power.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">that happened all the time when i have fought him, sucks cause  it takes for ever for him to path back so you can actully fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">seen it happen a couple times as well.  Most recent bout 2 weeks ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Haven't seen this for my guild in 20 kills. Heard about it happening for other guilds though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What happened is that he forgot to bring his key to his own palace, so he just sorta wondered around after that, with all his snake buddies laughing at him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehe.  That's nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The same thing happened to us last week. We decided to try an 18 man kill (btw - even with a 11k pally you need more than 1 cleric healing the MT) which turned ugly after the first 5 or 6 minutes. We went back to summon and rez and suprise! Emp is at the ZI. After training him down the hall a little way we pulled him back and killed him. Sure makes it easy when there is no CC to worry about. The other guild that had shown up to kill him must have asked us a million times how we pulled him to zone. Wish we knew, sure makes it easy for small raid kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild was passing out loot from Cursed in the basement when Emp got trained to ZI last night.  They say that a wizzy/druid Evac'd to the zone and he followed somehow.  The Time guild on Druzzil heard someone talking about it in PoK and went OTM and killed him:o<br />
<br />
We killed him tonight when he spawned after the reset this morning.  He didn't get a chance to go to the zone:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Razzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Happened on Mith Marr to Illumanati about a week ago.<br />
<br />
And I happened to be at the zin, coming off a succor from TMs. &quot;Ouch&quot; was all I could say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">this usually happens when some one spawn emp but fails to kill him. from what i gather, he pretty much runs a muck and kills everyone in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tuendal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We had Emp warp on us to zone in tuesday night, we waited for about 15min hoping he would pop back, after that we went to zone in to kill him.  We had him down to 30pct and a GM-Admin named Chrol popped in and worked his magic and put Emp back in his room, needless to say he didn't set the emps hatelist and Emp warped back on us at 100pct health, nearly wiped us and then with all that crap, the entire emp room was bugged.  Took the GM nearly an hour to stop the carpet trap from constantly going off, and even after that you couldn't get into emp room with out all the mobs aggroing instantly.  Was not a fun night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Happend on Tarew Marr a couple of times now.  Really sucked once.  He would run down to the zone in and munch on some folks, then come back up and whipe us again in the Emp room just as we finished getting GM res'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Toham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Happened twice on Innoruuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Has happened 2 times that I have heard of on Seventh Hammer.. there was quite a flame war against the guild that wiped in the Emp's room, only to have him warp to the zoneline, they regrouped and killed him there and entered VT because of it. I dont blame them for making lemonade out of the lemon programming.<br />
<br />
But yeah its happening everywhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Emp is tired of being stuck in the basement methinks</div></div><hr />
