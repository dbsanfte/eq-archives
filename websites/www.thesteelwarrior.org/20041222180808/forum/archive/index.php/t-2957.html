<br />
 <br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.  We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.  We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield<br />
<br />
<br />
I see this going one of  two ways.<br />
<br />
If they're smart, they're going to make a whole line of shields that are warrior only. These shields will have far better blocking abilities than the ones the hybrids will get. Hybrids will have to content themselves with far lesser blocking abilities in shields if they want to break out their kickass ratio 1hander. I have my doubts they'll do that however.<br />
<br />
The way I think they'll go, is pretty much make all shields about as good, and make then war/pal/shad only (except for a VERY few, rare, raid level, war only kickass shields) which of course means the knights get far greater benefit from them. The knight can now break out his better than 1:1 ratio, with his kickass new shield, and grats knights, you just got an upgrade and can now do MORE dps than warriors in MORE situations. Meanwhile warriors lose DPS fromt heir secondary weapon, break out the under 1:1 ratio weapons, and become the lowest DPS tank in the game, while receiving only as much benefit from shields as the pallies do.<br />
<br />
Oh, and they're also going to make a whole line of shields for casters with better blocking stats than anything a melee can get, but the melee can't use it.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know, I'm being cynical, but I wouldn't put it past SoE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While wearing a shield, you block all ripostes.<br />
<br />
It doesn't change anything for casters. It isn't that big of a deal for the knight classes either (unless tanking something very difficult). It would allow a warrior to use a high aggro 1 hander and shield and actually take LESS damage. It wouldn't lower average damage taken that much, but it would reduce spike damage a fair amount. Isn't that the point of a shield? To add a defensive bonus at the cost of damage output?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, a shield blocking all repostes would help out Knights quite a bit. It might even put PoEarth well within their reach as exp group MT's.<br />
<br />
Add to this an innate chance to block with a shield and the new demi-Defensive and we've got a good start in making the necessary improvements to our replacement MT's.<br />
<br />
Next, since Knights can Bash with a 2H weapon - count them as shields and have them block all repostes as well when weilded by a Knight.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but perhaps the Warrior posters here hadn't noticed that we got our shield upgrade already - Furious Bash. I haven't used mine since I tried it with a BoC and got ZERO BoC procs when tanking one of the birds in PoFire. Those are fixed, right??<br />
<br />
Why do Paladins regualarly come here to propose changes that would solidify their grip on the exp group MT slot and act like it is a boon for Warriors? I just don't get it.<br />
<br />
Sure Graal, it should be an effect that appears only on WAR only shields. Nice idea 8P<br />

I have a nice warrior only shield with furious bash on it. but it stays in my backpack because I have no aggro weapon to use with it &gt;&lt;;;<br />
<br />
It wont be coming out either anytime soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Battleblade, I guess you aren't thinking it through. What benefit would this have for knights? No, really? Knights already have lower default riposte damage because we use 2 handers almost without exception. We generally don't need a 1 hander for the aggro. Equipping a shield would add no intrinsic defensive benefit beyond the AC and stats.  Knights ALREADY take less ripostes than a warrior using 1 handed weapons.<br />
<br />
Adding a riposte block to shields would benefit warriors much more than it would knights IMHO. I know very few knights that actually use shields currently, because using a shield implies using a 1 hander. I have a decent weapon, nothing spectacular, but decent. 50+5 fire/39 is my weapon. How many 1 handers are there out there that would even BEGIN to approach the damage output of that weapon for a knight? There's only 1 1 hander that would arguably outdamage this mediocre 2 hander, and it is the paladin 1 hander from time. It is questionable whether even that would outdamage my mediocre 2 hander. On top of that, we have damage improving AAs that ONLY work with 2 handers. It used to be true that knights were essentially shield users by default, but it isn't anymore.<br />
<br />
Adding riposte block to shields would not add a significant boost to a shield's usefullness, except for those situations where riposte damage is more than just an annoyance or an efficiency factor. Basically, adding the riposte block to shields would have a much bigger impact on raid level tanking than it would on the xp portion of the game.</div></div><hr />

According to some of you the only bad thing about it is that its not Warrior only and therefore it should not be done because it can benifit Knights.<br />

I would think any raiding Warrior would love the idea of extra mitigation.  And its not &quot;fake mitigation&quot;, but real mitigation.  Oh well...I guess I was wrong.</div></div><hr />

It takes  dual wield away for warriors,  and takes what? The ability to use 2handers (same as warriors) from knights.<br />

Use your head and think a bit. It benefits knights more. Where are warrior 1:1 ratio weapons from Velious and up? Warriors have to cripple their dps far more than knights to use this. <br />

<br />
Its been rehashed before. Knights already take hits too well to the point where its moot in exp groups. Adding more to the knights weaker half of tanking (aggro being their stronger half with it being lockable) is more beneficial to their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll have to agree with the warriors here.  Knight 1 handers are balanced for shield use, warrior 1 handers aren't.  Unless they TOTALLY revamp warrior main hands (or increase ratios for warriors when using shields), shield revamps should be if not warrior only, significantly better for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never said there wasn't a problem.  Actually the problem runs deep and has been in the game forever.<br />
<br />
Since the original game, any 1H weapon that was shared between Knights and others sucked for a Knight to use.  An 13/20 weapon absolutely sucked for a Paladin to use but is semi-interesting to use Dual Wield.  It was clear that shared weapons were designed for DW in mind.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed about this.  DW weapons suck with a shield.  Improving Shields still has merrit reguardless.<br />
<br />
The best idea would be just to change the DB formulation when a weapon goes from DW to 1H + Shield.  One wonders why Warriors don't have a different DB calculation entirely or AA skills aligned with DB in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Warriors cap Parry at 230, Paladins and Shadowknights at 205.  It would benefit all 3 Tank classes, but would benefit Warriors more than Knights.  Rangers, Bards and Rogues would be the only other classes affected by the change.  <br />
<br />
I think this pattern would combine well with both a general increase in mitigation as well as the suggested ability to block Ripostes.  (Not a guaranteed block, with Warriors and Rogues more likely to block a Riposte than Knights are... that could work).</div></div><hr />

And we also lose out on about 1/3 of our damage, which is not insignificant.<br />
<br />
If they set shields up to generate more aggro than currently, that would help.  But it would need to be a Warrior only feature, since Knights already have cheap readily available aggro generation.</div></div><hr />

While Vie will help out Warriors (in an area that is their strength) a rational person would admit it helps out Knights more (in an area that was a comparative weakness).<br />
<br />
Nice comeback, but the truth remains that Vie and a posible shield change is more of a boost to Knights than Warriors.<br />
<br />
A counter-example would be a 750 Hate augmentation from LDoN. We could all use it, but would it be a boon for Knights?<br />

<br />
My first solution is give warriors something like triple wield, 2 1handers + a shield. If you think about it, a shield is generally strapped to the arm, it could work... maybe.<br />
<br />
My second idea is making WARRIOR ONLY shields spiked with razors and flag it as a shield (with blocking mods as opposed to a weapon with high AC) AND a 1HS weapon, now that would be pretty badass. Well, just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
Any input? How are my ideas? I'm sorta new at this, so let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate having one of the major weapon combinations in the game completely worthless at the higher levels of the game.  Look at the cover art for LDoN, what do you see?  A SHIELD!!  Of course, no high level tank will use one.  This seems odd to me.  I hear the complaints that the game is too old for new ideas, and that any change to shields could only help Knights.  I'm going to try to look outside the box a little to see what it might take to upgrade shields in a way that they become viable for WAR/PAL/SHD.<br />
<br />
If shields were increased in an 'even-handed' manner, the changes would help Knights more than Warriors.  Added defense, given to both in the same level, will help the group that had poorer defense to start with, Knights.<br />
<br />
OK, now that I have acknowled that, what could be done to make 1H+Shield a viable combination for Warriors and Knights in a way that actually helps both about the same?<br />
<br />
I see three things to consider:<br />
1)	Warrior 1H weapons &lt; Knight 1H weapons<br />
2)	Warrior aggro would suffer with loss of DPS/2nd Proc while Knight aggro would not<br />
3)	Warriors would need a larger mitigation increase than Knights for it to have equal impact to both<br />
<br />
1) and 2) can be addressed more or less with one strike.  The answer is to make Warriors using 1H weapons do about 90% of the damage they would with Dual Wield.  This would still allow them to DW for that bit 'extra', but would reduce the hit they take by using a shield.  This could be done by creating warrior 1H weapons with Knight 1H ratios that cannot be used to DW.  Similarly, you could code a Warrior only bonus to 1H weapons when a shield is equipped.  In any event, allowing Warriors with 1H+Shield to do 90% of DW damage keeps their DPS up, and reduces aggro lost due to lost DPS.<br />
<br />
The aggro issue can also be helped because those Furious Bash shields will be used occasionally now, instead of living in the bank or bag.  Also, other shield procs could be introduced, preferably on WAR only shields.<br />
<br />
3) can be addressed with level limits.  Add a 'block' skill for WAR/PAL/SHD while using a shiled.  Let Warriors top out at 225 and Knights top out at 175.  Make this increase Knight mitigation by 10% and Warrior mitigation by 20%.  Have it scale based on the level of mob you are fighting so that it works out to 3% and 6% respectively against PoP boss mobs (so we don't really break raid content).<br />
<br />
The effect of this would be to allow both Knights and Warriors to get a real mitigation increase out of using a shield, with a loss of about 10% to DPS (probably more than 10% for Knights, actually unless you are looking at the 2-3 best 1H in the game).  It also recognizes the fact that Warriors would need a larger increase to find a change worthwhile.<br />

<br />
I agree inate block on shields could be a good thing for all tanks.<br />
<br />
But, so long as Warriors completely lack ranged (snap) aggro on demand, I'm reluctant to see any changes to AC/HP or mitigation.<br />
<br />
Knight AC/HP and mitigation have been fixed enough to MT - not every Knight able to tank every mob, but enough to be exp group MT's, the prefered tank for several big named mobs, and some Knights can tank anything.<br />
<br />
Ranged (snap) aggro on demand has not been addressed at all for Warriors. If it continues to be ignored and (for Warriors) already sufficeint AC/HP and mitigation is increased there will continue to be less and less reason to have a Warrior MT.<br />

This idea isn't about mitigation, it's about making shields a viable equipment option (and shields, by any plasuible definition are a way to mitigate damage... hence the confusion).  In other words it's not about class balancing as much as it is about content balancing.  An minor increase in Knights mitigation isn't going to amount to a hill of beans to them as long as Warriors get an equal or greater benefit.  Implementing the feature in a way that doesn't completely nerf Warriors' already lagging aggro abilities is the tirck.</div></div><hr />

The thing about aggro is that it is a binary set: yes or no. You either have it or you don't.  <br />
<br />
Graal, I would expect you to know better. The trick to aggro is having the person you want the mob to hit have more aggro than everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OlavSkulcrusher</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I submitted an idea similar to Boleslav's through both /feedback and through their website about 2 years ago. Guess they either figured they needed to work on coding familiars not to do inconvenient things more than fix something that should have been designed right at release.<br />
<br />
Shields should have been a viable option for warriors from the beginning, but I suppose aradune &amp; co. figured that was low on the list of priorities relative to other things.<br />
<br />
They already do all sorts of complicated calculations with level, skill, weapon damage/delay, etc. So having some code that gives warriors a bonus to weapon damage rating when using a shield shouldn't be a big deal. It could be something that scales with level, and maybe even bash skill, since that could represent how well you use a shield. (though us biguns would get a possibly unfair advantage in being able to raise that without having to use a shield) Scale the damage bonus so a 1h weapon typical for a warrior's level gives you this: 1hander + bash = 90% the damage of 2 x 1h + kick.<br />
<br />
Add to that some bonuses to bash aggro to more than make up for the lost dps, a way for a shield to hold a proc when bashing, and a warrior might find shields an interesting option.<br />
<br />
As Boleslav said, some 1h weapons with higher ratios that can only be used when a shield is equipped (exempt from the warrior bonus, naturally) could be interesting too. I think the damage bonus formula would be easier to implement that creating a whole set of new items.</div></div><hr />

Instead of 3 choices in weapon setups, that would reduce the choices to 2.<br />
<br />
Battleblade, when would either a warrior or a knight equip a shield with the change I suggested? It wouldn't be during xp groups because the benefit would be minor compared to the tradeoffs of significantly lowered DPS and aggro (even for knights this is important). The only time shields would used by the majority of plate tank classes would be when facing a difficult tanking situation, i.e. raid tanking. Do you really think a knight in an xp group is going to cut his DPS in half for a very minor increase in tanking ability? Maybe on a named or a kriger or something similar, but that's it.<br />
<br />
They should find a way to introduce bastard swords into the game to be used while tanking. Basically a 2 hander with the dmg/dly of a 2 hander, but it allows you to equip a shield. Have the damage bonus change from the 2 handed bonus to 1 handed bonus and maybe lower the damage stat on the weapon by 10% if a shield is equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A SHIELD SHOULD GIVE 70% OF AN EQUIVALENT WEAPON DPS/AGRO USED OFFHAND <br />
<br />
Make it so that shield DPS scale up to 150% of weapon DPS.<br />
<br />
Warrior only, hell put a 1 AA skill to enable the &quot;Special Bash Coefficient&quot;<br />
<br />
Best Time offhander = 20/20 (Edge of Eternity)<br />
Best Time shield = 85ac (Shield of Strife)<br />
So the 85ac shield should do the same DPS as a 30/20<br />
<br />
Best Elemental offhand = 19/20 (Coirnav Hammer)<br />
Best Elemental Shield = 75ac (Aegis of Earth)<br />
<br />
Best Non elemental Offhand = 16/19 (Acrylia Handed BroadSword)<br />
Best Non elemental Shield  60ac (Bone Chill Shield)<br />
<br />
Best Easy Offhand = 14/18 - 15/20 (Blade of Carnage)<br />
Best Easy Shield =  45-75 (Horrors / Twice Forged / Seacsale / Honor)<br />
<br />
So if u want to fix Shield :<br />
<br />
1) Parse the DPS of a 20/20 offhander (random guess X dps)<br />
2) Parse the DPS of a 85 dmg bash 6 sec refresh (Y dps)<br />
3) Incease the Bash DMG coefficient so that (X*1.5 = Y)<br />
<br />
Since haste wont increase bash rate (i never used a shield cant be totally sure)<br />
Unhasted Shield DPS = Hasted Shield DPS so it has to be HIGH<br />
<br />
A 20/20 will do 40 DPS (example) buffless &amp; naked.<br />
A 85ac shield should do 60dps (example) buffless &amp; naked<br />
<br />
Why ?<br />
<br />
No haste :<br />
20/20 = 40 dps<br />
Ac85 = 60 dps<br />
<br />
40% haste :<br />
20/20 = 56 dps<br />
ac85 = 60dps<br />
<br />
100% haste :<br />
20/20 = 80dps<br />
ac85 = 60dps<br />
<br />
So a warrior with the best time combo (suppose 20/20 &amp; 20/20)<br />
Would do 160dps raid buffed in dual wield.<br />
While only 140dps using a shield.<br />
<br />
Of Couse Ambidex + Fury + Atk will mess these numbers.<br />
But all that needs to be done is tuning. <br />
Still if EoE does 40dps unbuffed, 80 full buffed.<br />
My shield proposal puts the best shield in the game at 70% of the best offhander.<br />
<br />
This will make shield great &amp; viable offhanders.<br />
<br />
 You will gain <br />
- AC / HP / Less ripostes<br />
<br />
 You will loose <br />
- Some DPS , Offhand Procs<br />
<br />
In theory if u are lucky enough to have a FB shield things get tricky....<br />
- Is the bash agro generated from the bash ? then keep FB as it is <br />
(minimal agro so the FB factor is totally null)<br />
-Is the bash agro generated from the bash+dmg ? then nerf FB<br />
(because the refresh rate is too high, if u cant, just remove FB<br />
Or code FB to be small hate value proc that goes off on every bash)<br />
Something in the lines of Bash = 10 times per mins.<br />
FB 1 =  15 hate per bash<br />
FB10 = 150 hate per bash</div></div><hr />

Or put WAR and a -100% dw skill mod on all the pally/sk 1hd weapons~</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point exactly. It would help out Knights with Krieger type mobs in exp groups solidifying their grip as prefered exp MT's and potentialy opening up new zones.  In addition it would assist them in tanking named mobs. Not only big named mobs, but tower named in BoT (for example).<br />
<br />
While Knights enjoy ranged aggro and snap aggro advantages over Warriors, anything that strengthens Knights further against any mob is unfair to Warriors even if Warriors receive it too.<br />
<br />
So what are you after Graal? Balance and more effectiveness for all tanks?<br />
<br />
If so, join in when we reach the chorus - Ranged Aggro and Snap Aggro for Warriors.<br />
<br />
After we get that, then things that allow Knights to MT harder targets will sound a lot more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Naubi,<br />
<br />
I agree completely. It's silly to shut the door after the cow's left, neh? Btw, I've used Swollen Fungusbeast Glands and Cystalline Silk Nets to get ranged agro and snap aggro.<br />
<br />
So, lets all sing it together shall we? Knights Able to Tank in the Planes and Warrior Aggro Fixed.<br />
