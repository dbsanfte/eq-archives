<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">about to buy my first augment soon ... my weapon selection at that time will be<br />
<br />
greatstaff of four winds<br />
greatstaff of thunder<br />
<br />
GBoS and CHoS combo<br />
<br />
i dont care about ripostes or my dps, i just want to know which one will help me hold aggro the best?  should i augment one of my 2handers?  or should i start augmenting my duel wield setup?  by the time i get a second augment i will hopefully have either CHSD or an Obsidian Scimmy of War.<br />
<br />
i currently have 1 adventure away from anger2 augment.  i have heard that GSoFW with anger3 is like a mini BoW, etc, so would it behoove me to suck it up, save another 700 points, and buy anger3 for it?<br />
<br />
i'm still only 62, but i hope to take the point-man position for my guild in tanking smaller targets when our MT is not available.  our healers are talented, so i know i can tank anything that wont 1-round me undefensive as long as i can hold aggro like a mutha.<br />
<br />
so ... what to do?  what will give me aggro such that i dont need to worry about losing aggro save by an extremely overzealous caster, chain stunning knight, or warrior with an even better weapon setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have anger2 on both my GBoS and CHSD but for a long time only had it on GBos and it was fine for tanking just about anything, only put it on the CHSD because I wanted a better chance at proccing early in the fight.<br />
<br />
I also have anger3 on my GSo4W but I use it mainly for tanking in LDoN hard, and although it holds good aggro I really prefer dual wielding when I tank on raids.<br />
<br />
So I recommend anger2 on the GBoS if you're going to tank on raids, or you could hold off to see what comes out of GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Blade of war with anger 3 will give you the aggro you seek! Sorry, had to taunt ya. Gonna agree with Fenring(even though he did gank my colors a long time ago! Or...i ganked his...i'm not sure). Put anger 3 in both 1 handers, GBoS first(and that should be your mainhand). Keep GSo4W the way it is for DPS when you're not tanking...like when your MT is tanking and you don't want a turn WHACK WHACK WHACK Splat turn on ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thank goodness i found this. or i would've just made a topic on it<br />
<br />
i don't got GBoS yet but i got BoC so when i get anger aug i'll prob anger GSo4W. the only problem is then i lose a darn good dps weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've got GSoT, Windblade, Ancient Prismatic Lance, Sword of the Bloodsworn, and some utility weapons.  We did our first attempt on Auliffe the other night, wiped at 24%, but I think we can get him next time.  Clerics were just slow last time.  I also have 1300+ points banked and EF is fully unlocked.<br />
<br />
Anyways, assuming we do win next time, I'll get the GSo4W.  With that added to my current set, I'm thinking Aug'ing the GSo4W with Anger 3, and if I want a DPS, aug'ing the Windblade with the Disease DD.<br />
<br />
Sanity check?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dobbo, you said you had a BoC ? <br />
<br />
Augment your BoC and leave your GSo4W for DPS. Unless your main tank all the time, and unless you have a 2 hander that out damages your GSo4W...I think your going to lose out big when you are not the main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just one man's opinion here. I am going to get a GSo4W and Augment the hell out of it with Anger III.<br />
<br />
After that, I dont really care what happens. I will use it to hit things all the time. <br />
<br />
If someone doesnt want me to tank, I will pull out any schlocky thing I got that is close to a 1:1 ration without a proc and use it to hit things. <br />
<br />
God forbid it is my warrior DPS that is the make or break on the raid when I am not tanking.<br />
<br />
41/31 with 2.6 procs per min plus another 1200 hate every minute?<br />
<br />
Yes please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you raid, I would highly suggest you find a decent 2h weapon and augment that with anger 3.  I had an anger 3 auged boc/chsd for my aggro set up and a gsot4w for my dps.  When I got to mobs that were just absolute assplow like magmaton and reparm, I had to use the gsot4w, but I had a lot of trouble holding aggro against the raid.  Wish I would have auged it with anger 3.  Now I have an anger3 bow so who cares anyway. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would say anger your GSoT and keep GSo4W as dps.  I've been dual wielding for aggro for a while now and it's kinda starting to bite me in the ass now that my guild has broken into EPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">but wouldnt a duel wield setup with both anger 3 procs and innate hate/stun procs be better aggro than gsofw???<br />
<br />
in which case duel wielding would be a better choice for straight aggro, and gsofw will be best left for dps or hard ldon tanking where mob ripostes cause for extreme spikes in damage?<br />
<br />
once again, from a raiding perspective i dont care as long as the mob + possible ripostes wont 1-round me dead while undefensive .. our healing team is top notch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">a bit more aggro, yeah, probably.  From what it sounds like you're raiding, ripostes won't be a huge deal, I don't think.  If you're able to get VZ for the scim, I would recommend trying to get your guild to hit up ssra and kael to get BoC or HG/BF.  Really though, it's your call at this point.  Either setup is viable for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VZ is a gimp, and not all too hard to find up.  my primary character till recently was a ranger with buttloads of aa's etc, and we've done him with 2-3 groups and that was almost overkill.<br />
<br />
we can kill ssra-stuff/AoW easily, but finding them up is the hard part as our server is hopelessly overcrowded.<br />
<br />
sure a BF/BoC/HG combo would be ideal, but GBoS and VZ scimmy are both very nice aggro for a lesser time-sink, and both are readily available often.   (Hell, heh, Towers pop every few hours, and we've had a few GBoS's already rot on us.)<br />
<br />
the stuff i plan on tanking wont be hitting for more than 1200 anytime soon, and most are slowable to some degree.  i'm sure if i was elemental where stuff quadded for 2k or even much much more, i would be worried about the riposte factor pushing me over the edge, but that doesnt seem to be an issue anytime in the near future. i'm at 7k hps fully raid buffed atm, and still lv 62 with no hp aas and several gear upgrades to make, so i think my hps will suffice to keep me alive through extra ripostes by the time i start tanking non xp group stuff.<br />
<br />
so i'm all about the aggro .. gimmie gimmie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, lets get something straight first - you can put Anger 3 on ANYTHING and it is going to be at least above average for holding agro. That's just common sense.<br />
<br />
Now, here is what you need to keep in mind when augmenting weapons -<br />
<br />
1. What do you use the weapon for? If you have a DPS weapon - DON'T PUT ANGERX on it!!! Now, you are taking a DPS weapon and turning it in to a half ass agro weapon. GSoT+angerX is going to be better agro than any dps weapon with angerX. For the couple hundred PP this is going to cost you, suck it up and use it until you can get a SEWS or BoW or other real agro weapon. Don't waste the points trying to make a DPS weapon in to an agro weapon. If you have ever wiped to a mob at 1%, then you know how important it is for everyone to do the max amount of damage you can do. Put life tap or DD augs on DPS weapons.<br />
<br />
2. For agro weapons, there is something else you need to consider. The vast majority of warriors have at least a SotB and a CHoS available to them through the bazaar. While these are fine agro weapons, chances are very good that you will have a viable upgrade some time in the near future. Unless it is a weapon that you think you will be weilding for several months, put anger2 on it rather than anger3. There is no point in wasting the extra points because a) you will probably be upgrading soon and b) 2x anger2 is better than 1x anger3 for less points. I would not recommend getting anger3 until you get to a point that there are no viable weapon upgrades for at least a couple of months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ruges</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hope this is not burried to far down for anyone to take notice. But do not want to start a new thread since it is so close to the subjects that have been posted.<br />
<br />
With the new proc AA. basically doubling your proc rate. along with the added agro melle has goten. and the addition of more in the future. I have been wondering how viable 2 1hs weapons with DD procs on them will be. Just guessing here. but I am thinking you could add 8-20dps. <br />
<br />
I currently have GBoS/CHSD/Wicked shank.  have been planing on putting Anger3 on GBoS and getting a BoC to go with it. But then these new additions come along. and I am thinking that if I add DPS augs to it I should get plenty of Agro plus the added DPS. <br />
<br />
And then I am also considering how hard some of these mobs are hitting now 1k+. So I am thinking a 2H weapon would be best. but I am worried about keeping agro. getting a GSoTW would be easily attainable.  Have not done much research in what would be a better 2H for ago/dps. guild has cleared up to Sayrn. and probly capable of going allot further in the near future.<br />
<br />
So there are so many directions I can go. and I am basicaly lost in which way I should go. basicaly what I want is to keep good agro take less dmg and do more dmg. asking alot I know. But I think this is possible, just have to find the perfect combination. If I had to priorities them I would say, Agro, DPS, less dmg. Although I feel it shuld be Agro, less dmg, DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">DPS != agro<br />
No way, no how. Otherwise warriors would never be able to hold agro. In order to hold agro with DPS, you are going to have to be doing 250+ DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Originally posted by Dafrog <br />
Dobbo, you said you had a BoC ? <br />
<br />
Augment your BoC and leave your GSo4W for DPS. Unless your main tank all the time, and unless you have a 2 hander that out damages your GSo4W...I think your going to lose out big when you are not the main tank.  <br />
<br />
but wouldn't BoC/GBoS be enough aggro? I know theres never too much but what if i want to tank in hard adventures?</div></div><hr />
