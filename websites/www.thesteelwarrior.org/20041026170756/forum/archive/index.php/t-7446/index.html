<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have done this raid alot. We always corner him in the corner just down the first flight of steps from his room. With healers around the corner and all melee going to one healer for a heal.  But with all the cornering and wall bugs going on its i swear imposible to corner this bitch perfectly.  Used to do it with no problems. Latly I fall into the wall and get ported back to entrance.  The last two times i did this mob i got ported back to entrance 5 times. Then just once. Does anybody have any ideas on what might be a better way to do this mob? Because of the stunn cant let him near healers. Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Last few times we've done him, we had him pinned just inside the door at the top of the steps.<br />
<br />
We didn't have any falling thru the wall problems though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you dont need a cheal chain for greig, his dps output is complete crap so i wouldnt worry about healer stun</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. After he is slowed one cleric can keep the main tank up for the fight. What is needed is a spot healer in each group to keep the other melee healed from his spells.<br />
<br />
I haven't tryed him since Dx9 so I can't really help with the original question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guild did him recently.. after June 2nd patch.<br />
<br />
Things were going smoothly til he used his AE toss. <br />
<br />
Once people got knocked into the wall, no matter where we positioned him (we cornered him in 2 completely different spots to test), about 15 or so NPCs from the floor below agroed and came after us with a passion to kill us all.<br />
<br />
The first time was a wipe since we werent prepared for it. The 2nd attempt we succeeded the rush of about 20 mobs while MT kept Grieg busy and chanters did their best to keep as many adds mezzed as possible while all other melee and casters took the adds out so we could all get back on Grieg and kick his ass.<br />
<br />
So, if anyone is doin Grieg soon and reads this before another patch - whether it gets fixed or not, be ready for a fight! It was fun though, I thought, simply cuz there was more to do with it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">o/t; but i remeber MTing grieg way back yonder and i was the last fool standing...funny thing was it took like a minute+ for me to die after the rest of the raid died..my guild was like 'Die Already you asshat...we're waiting.....'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just shrink once, make sure all pets are parked in the first port up room (incase people dont have pet hold, this prevents mobs from going into the wall) have someone chain rgc so you to prevent blind.  hold the down arrow, press enter, congrats your cornering greig on hopefully a win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last time i did him he was buged like normal Grieg ends fashion.  I swear this zone has the most bugs out of any zone ever. Heh but ya he is way easy and our guild hardly farms him anymore. SSRA and other things have us ocupied.</div></div><hr />
