<br />
I was thinking of a solution to this (imho) problem.<br />
<br />
1  Give all three tanks classes a choice of new aa's to work for.   These aa's would be like an equivlent to spell casters specializations.   It could be set up something similiar to what follows<br />
<br />
Say 5 specializations slots.<br />
1 Wis casters  NPC who's spells would be wis based<br />
2  Int casters  NPC who's spells would be int based<br />
3  Non-casters  NPC with no casting abilities<br />
4  Undead   NPC who's marked as undead<br />
5  Hybrid-ish mobs.  A catch all for mobs that have either minor casting abilities for their levels or derived from player hyrbid classes or fits no other choice well.<br />
<br />
Tanks would chose one specialization to be their primary.  <br />
Tanks would choose two others to be their &quot;minor&quot; specialization<br />
Tanks would have the last two types of mobs that actualy had a slight chance to be tanked actualy a lil worse then usualy.<br />
<br />
Some bennifits could be as followed<br />
<br />
Better Def Disc for the non casters ( a minor def disc of say 10%-15% might be given to sk/pal if they chose these mobs but warriors would gain a similiar bonus to def disc  say 5% more reduction in damage and or a 10%-15% durration increase in def disc)<br />
<br />
A new attack ability to stun a wis caster<br />
<br />
A new attack ability to syphon mana off int casters  there by increaseing hate <br />
<br />
A better dps on undead there by increaseing hate<br />
<br />
A  attack that acted like a minor dot/mana syphon dot, lets say a facial wound on the hybrid-ish mobs.<br />
<br />
I haven't posted hard numbers just ideas because there'd need to be a totaly of four levels.  2 possitive levels of increase n one nuetral level (current non specilizations) and one neggative level of decrease.<br />
<br />
There would have to be in place a way to reset your specialization with either a quest or aa's incase eq made a pirmary specilization worhtless in a expansion.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Well  it's in rough form but feedback is much welcomed.</div></div><hr />

Necros are kings of the dots and wizards are kings of the dd and enchanters with their charmed pets have pets that put even the best geared warriors/sk/undead fighting pals to shame.  That leaves mages.  Mages are sold and still doing more damage then tanks.  <br />
     Bringing LDoN mobs into this discussion isn't exactly fair seeing how these mobs dps/hit points are pathetic.  I've been in groups with a onrush of 5-6 mobs and no one had a problem despite no mezzer.   <br />
     /shrug   I want diversity in designing my tank to have mob specialization.</div></div><hr />

We crank out steady DPS, casters do it in bursts, then have to med.  Of course, with mana regen being what it is these days, I'm not sure how legitimate the argument is.  I don't play a caster so I'm not really up on mana costs/regen rates these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Melee will pretty much always win if you're fighting straight for more than half an hour compare to any caster, unless your group really sucks (so you have to wait for healer's mana) or you run out of mobs.  The first is a problem of your group not the class and in the second case there would've been nothing gained by replacing the warrior (can't make mobs spawn any faster to get XP).<br />

As for Charm, it outdamages entire groups.  If you have an Enchanter using charm, it's irrelevant to worry about DPS anyway.</div></div><hr />

How about high 50's low 60's monks and ranja's with FBSS, Bards with under 3k hps buffed? Thats what I am running in to now, people who level with sad, inadequate equipment. People used to wait to have level approprate equipment, not anymore.</div></div><hr />

This is because while you can twink weapons there is no way to twink a caster with FT15.  There are more FT/focus options now yes but having a few extra FT in no way compares just being able to grab a better weapon.  <br />
<br />
If anything melees are more powerful than ever in groups than casters.  Now casters probably can still do stuff a melee can never do solo just because they dish out damage in range, but sustained damage melee wins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OldMerc</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">????????? Last I looked my &quot;caster&quot;  had many options to increase mana regen which is their dps.  FT is one option used in conjunction along with buffs such as c3 extended and Druid's 9 and even cleric buffs or beastlords.  Shaman and necro can use their hp for mana and aa's afford mana regen which can't be debuffed by LDoN.  I've gone through LDoN without ever haveing a caster saying they needed a mana break like they once did in other expansions.  Despite the polular &quot;don't buff in LDoN&quot; talk many people are totaly buffed before they go in since forming groups take a lil while.  In LDoN I average about 3 junk buffs followed by a few decent buffs.  As a mana relient tank I find lil trouble maintaining my mana.  <br />
<br />
     As for melee sustaining dps?  You are as dependent on mana because You don't heal without a healer.  I.E mana gone=no more hp for melees.   So  try now and explain this &quot;melee sustained dps&quot;</div></div><hr />

Me too.  I wish I could stack up all my guild's tanks into a big pyramid so we can give AoW a titty twister right as he comes around the corner.  <br />

Me: Ok guys here he comes<br />
Tanks: Hurry up, this is gettin heavy<br />
Monk: Inc ~ The Avatar of War ~<br />
AoW: I'm going to eat you<br />
Me: Take this!  *twist*<br />
Tanks: LOLOLOL pwned, n00b<br />
AoW: You guys are assholes<br />

Yes.  That is why I love VT.  Unmezzable mobs in camp=stackable tanks.<br />
<br />
I really hope the EP's have lots of area's like this.  I don't know as I'm not quite there yet.<br />

<br />
This is true, but there are 3 major tanking classes.  The Warrior, Paladin, and Shadowknight.  Only one tank is needed per group.  That leaves 1 spot for a healer and 3 or 4 for DPS type class, depending on the situation.  In those 3 or 4 spots just about any dps is interchangeable and just about all them stack quite nicely.<br />
<br />
I also think about which classes I most often see LFG.  It seems I most always see druids and tanks at #1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanking certainly stacks in Gates.  Need a 2nd tank when you first one dies, and it'll happen a lot.  Also you need a second tank to tank a second mob so it doesn't instant kill the cleric on the first heal or the enchanter on the first mez resist.  It actually works out pretty well since you want defensive for all the named in Gates dungeon anyway so have one warrior MT and one Knight backup/offtank while mezzing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OldMerc</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure Phantron that shadow knights and paladins are all proud to be nothing but a possible back up tank in a exp group if two warriors can't be found.   Perhaps we best ask vi to nerf those mobs at the end and any others in exp groups that require def disc.  If we don't then sk/pals will have a fairly strong case for getting our eva/def disc in some form or other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well a Knight is a backup tank with a Warrior around.  That's how it's always supposed to be.  While I do not advocate for absolute supermacy of Warrior class, they should be second tank when a warrior of comparable gear is in the group.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Knights still contribute plenty for XP mobs.  SK still brings their usual DPS, and Paladin stun heals a lot on mobs that can hit for 1300 + a 600 Chaos Claw proc.  On the one group bosses, though, I'm not so sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is because while you can twink weapons there is no way to twink a caster with FT15 <br />
<br />
FT3 boots of slime<br />
FT2 belt of thunderous auras<br />
FT2 ornate bracer<br />
FT2 ornate Bracer<br />
FT2 droga quest neck<br />
FT1 Earring of solstice<br />
FT1 Cogboggle's range thingermabob<br />
FT1 Mask of Contemplation<br />
<br />
That's FT14.  If you can manage to get ahold of some slime gloves you can indeed &quot;twink&quot; a toon to FT15 as soon as he can wear ornate.  Course with all those slots eaten up he's gonna suck it on the focii, but that's another matter entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OldMerc</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron they are not our lackies to hold or swords and fetch us water.  Knights should be our equals yet be busier casting n working harder to achieve it.  There by makeing the average warrior the prefer tank do to less differances in quality of player then the knights who could have a idiot watching tv tanking or one working almost as hard as a good bard.    <br />
<br />
With out new taunt upgrades I serverly suggest we look to nerfing these new def disc only exp mobs in GoD or like I've stated we'll lose some of our def disc.   Then again if Phanton is the normal warrior here maybe it's time we did.  After all paladins lost their LH in a fashion to clerics long ago and even somewhat to shaman and druids.  The fabled sk's have lost their HT to tons of casters.   Just perhaps we have abused our station as wel if we seek to be regard as we were once wrongly regarded in RoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cannot comment on GoD, but you are never going to win the argument that knights should be as good a tank as a warrior as long as they work harder here. Why? Because this board has a lot of warriors who do work hard, and I am sure would do the job of a knight/tank just fine if all it required from them was playing hard. Only they get bells and whistles as well.<br />
<br />
Anyone that only uses knights for add tanks on raids again is not tapping into their abilities properly. Shadowknights add more dps/mana regen to their group, Paladins add more healing and buffing to the raid. When a Paladin teamed with a druid can buff me as well as a cleric and provide 6% less of a rez, coming from a &quot;tanking class&quot; I don't think its insignificant at all. When a Shadowknight is the main puller and snarer for my group, I don't call that insignificant.<br />
<br />
And at this current time Knights will never get Evasive/defensive simply because of how bad itemisation has become. I can see SOE are trying to fix this with aa and small migitation boosts, but end game itemisation still rules the day as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
Again all I have said does not apply to GoD, so maybe its completely changed there. But thats how I see it in old world content, content that is still often used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OldMerc</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kavak with our latest aggro upgrades we are at the end game better aggro generators then paladins and arguablely better then even the shadow knights.  We beat them in snap aggro and we beat them in long periods.   I've watched as the majority of warriors here have yelled again and again for more and more aggro.  We have it in spades now.   In GoD every normal group requires a warrior.  So in short we've do in great deal to this board returned to kunark in GoD.   If you think this will be a good thing for our class then you have underestimated both the PoN boards ability to change eq and eq for watching balance.   As a warrior I've never had a porblem with holding aggro.  Mind you I'm a professional warrior and have leveled well into the aa of 65.  I've also leveled up friends warriors through out my career.   I never once had any real problem with aggro.  <br />
<br />
Warriors aren't &quot;easy to play&quot; but our limited options ment there was less chance of misuseing a option so bad as to be a leathle blunder to one's group.   Mean while paladins with far more options had many more ways to screw up.   <br />
<br />
As for non GoD exp runs, a damn ranger could tank the damn mobs these days. <br />
<br />
BTW itemization has jack to do with GoD.   You need 10k to do these mobs and def disc if you expect to tank them.   As for tank kiteing?   Tell me one time as a tank any of us would ever accept that as a role in exp grinds.   Once in a great while when all other tricks have been used we may use a pathingbug and do it but it's in no way a role we'd ever accept and I doubt the knights would do that or even could.   How are knights going to hold aggro if hey need to constently run?   With insite we warriors have a much easier time then any knight.    <br />
<br />
The loud warriors here will do as they see fit I have no doubt.   I merely figured I'd warn you of this folly you are pursueing.   I'm a old warrior  I have no need to come to this board and debate with the likes of warriors who had to cry to get unrequired upgrades to a unbroken ability.  Perhaps instead of you playing this game with one eye on the screen you should either leave or use both?  I for one expect to leave eq in 6 mos and to never try eq2.  Flame me if you want, come june I'll be enjoying the lake.   <br />
<br />
Times and money are getting better.  I think it's time to abandon the unreal digi world soon.</div></div><hr />
