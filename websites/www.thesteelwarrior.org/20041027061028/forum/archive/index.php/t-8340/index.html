<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Headboss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not to sound like an ass. The thing i liked about Everquest was the surprises and the challenge. Little things like this, takes the fun out of the game. This game doesn't hold the secerts as well as it use to be. The learning, the dying, the wiping, made fights well worth it. How fun would this game be, if you could win everything first try? All im saying this game isnt the same anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>naerron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for the past 3 weeks + i log on and see uqua 6 pm EST on guild motd, every night cept the one day we take to clear time we do uqua, i am ready for qvic. finding out uqua is less than fun, fun was figuring out how to beat TZ and VZ in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You aren't going to get helpful hints here about finishing Uqua, as solving it grants access to the candy-land that is Qvic.  My guild beat Uqua about 6 weeks ago.  We waited till we beat it again and got more flags before starting on Qvic, and for the last month or so have been farming the hell out of it because we know there are three more guilds that will beat Uqua at the very least when the level limit goes up in a month.  <br />
<br />
I would imagine that the guilds beyond Uqua on almost every server are looking at a similar situation.   I'm frankly kind of surprised to see the amount of info that's being shared here about the Ikkinz raids, given that they are also needed to get to Qvic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ikkinz raids are easy tho. a lot of it is croud control and heavy tanking. uqua is &quot;kick you in the nutz over and over while running a triathalon&quot; hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gundahar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In fact I liked Uqua. It alway remembered me on a shooter where you have to react pretty fast and unlike Ikkinz it never becomes boring for a warrior. This zone is only hard as long as you don't know what awaits you behind next corner and in Barxtt script. Being ready for Qvic also means to be for Inktu'ta and you won't beat it if you can't handle Uqua. So it's good they built in a barrier you have to overcome like it was with RZtW when you wanted to enter EP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Uqua is hella fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it took you 10+ raids to beat the current Twins where the only info needed is  pretty much learnt on the golems before them, I hate to say it, but even with the best infoz in the world, Barxt is gonna descimate you.<br />
<br />
Keep at it and you'll get there, but 6 days a week is probably pushing it a little hard. Get your officers to ease up a little before people stop loggong on (If they   haven't already)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>WarM0nger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When my guild started Uqua we were pleased to kill one mob, of course this was before they first nerfed it. We were very excited to get to the death box after the first part of the plow. If you are just now experimenting with Uqua and are frustrated with it you would have definitely killed yourself pre-nerf.<br />
You'll love it once you beat it. Qvic practically gives you loot for free so it is well worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wiping in Uqua is the opposite of fun<br />
<br />
learning how not to wipe in Uqua is the fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The nice thing about Uqua is the expansion is downhill from there for awhile on the learning curve.  Qvic trash, Kelekdrix, bombers, Noquifel, most of the Txevu nameds (save HP, screw him) are all pretty easy and considerably less stressful on a guild.  There's not much hours and hours of wiping endlessly for 0 loot until you're working on finishing Txevu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SincroFashad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I loved learning Uqua.  There was no dragging, everyone's corpse was conveniently piled up right at the zone in for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rampagious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">After it was tuned (and even a bit before) uqua was alot of fun. It doesnt take  much to learn, its really all about execution. Even now when we back flag from time to time i actually enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Guild tried Uqua for the first time last night...killed the 5 mobs that come one after another...then we entered one of those little rooms (ovens?)..some1 asked for keys, I stood there...then the fun happened and we were all dead withing 30 seconds lol...haven't laughed so hard in ages...won't give away what happens..it's funny if you don't expect it :D</div></div><hr />

The best is the mysterious fry when you end up half wiping and noone knows who used the wrong key.  On a side note the door time sinks suck dick.  Between the 2 doors it can tack on up to 45 minutes on this gay already 2 hours too long raid just to get your whole guild through.  This shit is 100% unnecessary.</div></div><hr />
