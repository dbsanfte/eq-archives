<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some high end helms that don't have a helmet graphic, unfortunately when you are searching for upgrades Allakhazams doesn't list what graphic each helm has so it makes it harder for the fashion concious warrior to plan ahead ;)<br />
<br />
Can I get a list of high end helms (Ssra / VT / PoP up to the elementals) that don't have a helmet graphic?  <br />
<br />
I have suffered bad stats for too long to not enjoy looking pimp in my old age.  Sure I could just turn off Luclin Halfelf graphics for the funky batman hat, but I just can't got back to wearing a penis helm.  Leather helm graphics (eg. tiny cap of sight) are definitely out too.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Crown of the Kromzek Kings from Tormax, Circlet of Disguise from Blob 2/3 in VT, Kizrak's Helm of Battle, and Raex's Helm of Destruction are the decent ones for war with no graphic that come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kizrak's is probably the best way to go. I think they sell for about 15k on my server and give nice ac, hp, and ultravision/see invis to boot. There's also the White Dragon Helm, but you'll pay a pretty penny for it. I shelled out 195k tonight for one for my wife. The nice thing about the helm is, if you have the faction and you're a caster, you can turn it in to Yelinak in SS for some 85 HP 110 Mana FT2 boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh stand tall with that peen on your head brother Half Elf.<br />
<br />
( they should have a turn-in to &quot;un&quot;customize helms .. i swear the line would be out the door )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah,i'd go for a kizraks,prolly about the easiest thing to get and not too expensive now days</div></div><hr />

<br />
And lucy has graphics for armour if you are curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice to know about Kizraks and Raex not having a graphic.  Was kinda looking for something a bit better than Kizraks, but not Raex's seeing as Im gonna be pretty low on the loot order for that.<br />
<br />
Good to know I can check them in LUCY too.  Gonna aim for a circlet of disguise or tormax crown, though I think alot of peeps have the circlet on their wishlists.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Circlet has only dropped once for us out of many many kills..seems quite rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Great Helm of True Vision from Ssra has no graphic.  Drops off AL I think.<br />

youre tellin me *both* elemental and ornate helms ahve no graphic???????<br />
<br />
well shitfuck.<br />
<br />
what helms in the high end do have a graphic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What, you LIKE the plate look on iksars heads? I HATED it...it made me look like I had a carved bowl on my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">honestly? I love it.  I'll never upgrade to an invisible helm, stats be damned.<br />
<br />
This post has saved me some serious DKP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I liked not having a helm graphic...made me look bad ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw you man, I don't need a stinking helmet!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's hard to argue with a Helmet of Rallos Zek even though it has a graphic though. Mega AC, HP, and even ultravision/see invis... all this for very little DKP since it's like the AoW's MOST common drop (unfortunately).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">AOW helm has a nice graphic and is tradeable to boot. Then of course, my warrior is a dwarf so he looks good with or without a helm.</div></div><hr />
