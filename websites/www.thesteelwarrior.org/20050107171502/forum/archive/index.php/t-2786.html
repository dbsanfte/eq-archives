<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalbe</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's fine for your lvl if your exping in tier1. But I think you'd get eaten alive in tier2 with that hp/ac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say that's not bad, but its been a long time since I've been level 56.  Post your magelo link and I'm sure most folks here would be happy to suggest some upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kremib</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK then my next question is what do I need to be at HP and AC wise for Tier 2. I was in POS last night as MT and didnt have many problems there. We were pulling in the desert I believe.  And fully buffed I was at 1200 AC and 5450 HP. Thank you in advance.<br />

You'll pick up 40-50 free AC with skill-ups in defense as you level up, and will get  a big level HP bonus at 57 (mine was about 160HP with 200 sta unbuffed), and another one at 60<br />
<br />
At 56, I'd just filled out several cultural pieces of Helanic Tundra for face, neck, hands and legs, so I was sitting at 3400ish and 1152 if I recall correctly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3.5k/1100 unbuffed is a good goal for tanking in T2/3.  It will make your healers happy if they don't have to start their CH's before the mob gets there =)<br />
<br />
Kidding aside, if you want to serisously tank in Valor, get 60 first.   People get so impatient, and think because they are 55, they have the right to go to valor/storms and xp there.  I like to run my logs, and often watch how my group members are doing DPS wise.  I was grouped with a 56 ranger, no epics.  I was doing about 80-90 DPS on average that night (outside of DS), while the ranger couldn't clear 40, miss, miss, miss, and more miss!  I toughed it out and leveled to 60 before I went to the trials and earned my flag for Valor.  I xped wherever I got an invite from.  PoN isn't so bad, nor is PoI to get to 60.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying you can't go to valor and try to tank all day, I'm suggesting that you get 60 first, which will make your life easier.<br />

Sorry, hungover rambling =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as an experiment while I was helping a friend level up in PoD yesterday I drank summoned ale til I couldn't drink any more. My AC dropped from 1450 to 1000 and the crawlers in the castle courtyard started completely owning me. Went from 1-cheal after a fight to 3 cheals during a fight to stay alive. <br />
<br />
I started tanking PoV (outer cave camp) at 59 with about 4k unbuffed hps (5.5k buffed) and 1200ish ac buffed. It was pretty hard in a full group. Now at 8.5k and 1450 (and 230 more aa's) I can duo the place with my druid. <br />
<br />
At what point it becomes easy, easier, not too bad, not a drain on the cleric etc I am not sure, but one thing I noticed today is that it was enormously harder on my druid's mana to keep me alive at 7k hps with pot9 than when I had 8k with Aego. If I had only had 6k hps my kill rate would have dropped massively as I chewed thru more heals to be safe. Of course Clerics get cheaper Cheals and if you have a cleric there with c5 and a bard he ain't much gonna care how many cheals he needs to cast. <br />
<br />
My honest recomendation is - to be fair to your group and yourself - aim for 1200ac buffed and as many hps as you can muster plus at least cs3 and ca3 before you consider yourself a capable tank in tier2.<br />
<br />
Kremib, I'd guess you were at the Dillo's camp, or thereabouts, killing dillos, scorpions, cacti etc. I did that today myself then moved to PoV and did a few golems and a few lizards (well 8 hours of lizards). Those PoS mobs are not a patch on the PoV ones and that's why they're worth half the exp (in fact they're barely worth the trouble being only a fraction more exp than spiders in PoN). Try a few giants in PoS, they're about the same difficulty as PoV Golems, Lizards being a little easier. <br />
<br />
And Raun 3.5k hps, 1100ac tank in Tier 3??? I SOOO hope you are joking! I'd tell 'em to go back to Sebilis... when that diaku elite gets trained on you, oops! In tier's 2 and 3 to be a GOOD group you need a tank who can take a beating from 2 or 3 unslowed mobs on those bad pulls while the extras are cc-ed and that won't cut it AT ALL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think for places like BoT and if you want to  take down giants in PoS, especially the slow mitigating ones, then you should be aiming for as close to 4k unbuffed as possible. That will put you at or around 6k with normal buffs.<br />
<br />
If your struggling to find HPs, then I would definitely go the route of getting as much defensive AAs as possible before you start exping in places like that. <br />
<br />
But the poster above is right - its not just a question of whether you can single tank and be kept up by a cleric. In most places ive exped in - CoD, HoH, BoT , PoS, there will always always come a time when you have to contend with 2 or maybe more mobs. Assuming you have a ench on the ball, thats still maybe a few seconds of taking punishment. Of course you have the option of maybe hitting your riposte disc or fortitude, but if you don't want to burn it, then you have to be able to soak it up. And no one can soak it up better than a warrior with decent hps and his defensive aas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kremib</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will say this, The level of mobs in POS compared to POV is night and day. I was in POS this weekend with Guildies and the exp is great and we didnt wipe once. Now I did have the full line of buffs as we had a 64 BL there to give me Talisman and IOS and also I had Virtue before I walked in there. The exp is great and a lot better than PON or POI. I am going to try to get to 3.5k HP and 1100 AC this week unbuffed. Hopefully I can link a Magelo to you all and you can help with telling me what to look for.<br />

Thanks for all the help,<br />
