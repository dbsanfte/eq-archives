<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So the servers go down and I'm running through Droga with my wizard.  I see this Earth Mystic Gedak dude up, so I pull him.  I screw up the pull and get myself pumelled.<br />
<br />
I come back and some druid has taken him.  Oh well I say to myself.  I'm going to get some revenge.<br />
<br />
So I camp him for a bit, and he pops after a couple placedholders.  He drops his common, ornate long sword of slaughter.  Crappy warrior weapon, but should net me 7-10k on Stromm, not bad.<br />
<br />
Next time he pops he's not wielding the ornate long sword, so I'm thinking he must have his rare.  I get my revenge and he drops his rare, the Monstrous Flamberge of Alacrity!  I'm looking at it.  It is 25/23.  So the damage bonus is pretty weak and it's 10AC, 65 HPS.  I have a velium gemmed great sword (got a GSot4W later that night), so it's definitely not an upgrade.  So I'm thinking, ah well another decent sword to sell.<br />
<br />
I decide to equip it to check it out.<br />
<br />
Holy crap that is a freaking cool looking sword!  I think it's the best looking sword I've seen in EQ.  Two eagle heads on each side of the hilt, big blue gem in the middle.  Cool shaped gold blade with sweet looking runes carved on it.  Yeah, I know, a weapon should be for utility, but I'm keeping this bad boy for style for a long time to come.  Screw doing my epic, this sword looks way better....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah, it is a neat looking sword.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KermeyKhazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got a screenshot of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It looks exactly like Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky from NToV,<br />

<br />
And Petrified Heartwood Flamberge from Plane of Growth,<br />

<br />
Can't seem to find a screenshot of it, but it's true.  It's probably the best looking weapon in EQ.  Aside from the Jagged Time Forged Blade ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice to see that graphic get used again hehe, it is a nice one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">too bad it wasn't used as the model for Epic 2.0 ... replace the blue on Gaudralek with blood red, toss in some particles...and the world will beat a path to it's competion.<br />
<br />
It's the wickedest (real word? dunno ) looking weapon in EQ. Hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll see about posting a screen shot.  Can we upload graphics to here?  Can anyone point me to a good free hosting site just to upload a pic or two?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you can upload it here; just make sure for the love of karana it's not a *.bmp :D <br />
<br />
JPEG is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Edit: gah, well I think I uploaded them, but can't figure out how to link to them and such.   :confused:</div></div><hr />
