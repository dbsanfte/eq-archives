Warriors are not in need of improvements. In fact, they're just a little too powerful to be considered perfectly balanced. <br />
<br />
I think we can all agree that a warrior's most basic complaint was that he had trouble getting agro in comparison to knights. If only he could get agro quickly enough so that the group didn't have to hold back waiting for him, he would be happy.<br />
Enter Droga. Most warriors said that EB weapons were decent. Droga added easily obtained high agro proccing weapons which soon showed up in the Bazaar cheap.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Paladin - Stun, heal, root, cast spells<br />
SK - FD, lifetap, fear, cast spells<br />
Warrior - does more DPS, better defensive abilities and statistics, /shield, does his job without having to worry about mana, flowing thought, focus effects or casting times. <br />
<br />
it gets better</div></div><hr />

His magelo's are an enchanter and a warrior. Different rickshaw required, mebbe ... overall, a distressing level of uninformed or ignorant viewpoionts are shown in that thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep points out the biggest problem other people think nothing is wrong. that it's ook for a kinght to take agro without risk, tank raid lvl mobs without defensive, to ect... basicly step on warrior toes and hig in the heel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hahaha, bit like the SK's in that SK thread who said (in proof that a bazaar equipped SK was no better off than a bazaar equipped warrior) that they were disadvantaged because they didn't have focus effects and mana regen items and '8k mana without focus effects is no better than 5k with' (or something like that).<br />
<br />
Helloooo, all the spells are still there, you still have mana to cast 'em, they still work :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
