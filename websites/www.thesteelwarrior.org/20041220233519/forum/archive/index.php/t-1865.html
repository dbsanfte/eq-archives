<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Description:  This skill, mastered by warriors, allows seemingly normal actions to be more annoying than they normally would be.<br />
<br />
Premise:  Allows warriors to produce more hate from hits and procs than any other class would.<br />
<br />
Specific:  Skill Type:  Passive.  Effect: Every hit, proc, and skill produces more hatred than normal, increasing 1/10th of a percent per skill point.<br />
<br />
What does this do for us?  With maxed skill (250) every hit and proc that we score would produce 25% more agro than if it came from any other class.  Not only would this make dps agro more possible, but it would also even the agro production discrepancy between warriors and paladins and shadowknights, all the while not giving us so much agro that other classes no longer mind the agro they produce.  Example:<br />
<br />
Joe Warrior engages A_Mob_01.<br />
<br />
Bill Enchanter casts tash on A_Mob_01.  Joe has enough agro that Bill does not gain agro.<br />
<br />
Bill Enchanter casts slow on A_Mob_01.  This puts him 400 agro points higher than Joe Warrior on the mob's hate list.  The mob goes charging after Bill Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Joe Warrior successfully taunts A_Mob_01.  With how it works now, he would gain 401 agro points on the mob's hate list, thus putting him 1 point ahead of Bill Enchanter, and thus gaining agro back.  However, because of irritation, he instead gains 501.25 points of agro, putting him 101.25 hate points ahead of Bill Enchanter... so that when Bill sits down, he will not immediately regain agro.<br />
<br />
**Note: a wizard that chain nukes for 45 seconds is still going to gain agro, regardless of Irritation or not.  Because of this, it is not &quot;broken&quot; in making maintaining agro absolutely infallible; it merely evens the odds that have been presented to us recently.<br />
<br />
This was just shown in order to illustrate how it could affect taunt.  In addition, it would affect the dps hatred you produce, thus keeping your duration agro more in line with that of the heftier dps classes, and would also give our procs a distinct advantage (EB producing 875 agro instead of 700).  This would also open the door to upgrading preexisting PoP items with a +irritation %, thus further increasing the agro each hit produces, regardless of the weapon that is being swung, and thus giving SoE an easy way to fix the recent warrior itemization problems.<br />
<br />
This would not only allow the non-phat-geared warriors a better chance in groups, but it would not be unfair to high end warriors either, nor would it make pallies and SKs useless.  It seems to me like it would be a very viable solution, and not even so difficult to code that SoE would find it impossible to impliment.<br />
<br />
I confess, this idea WAS spawned by the effect on Raex's Chestplate of Destruction, but assuming it stacked with Irritation, it would just further increase the agro produced by the warrior who was wearing it, and thus wouldn't make it any less useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that I think the concept is good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every time SoE brings in an active effect, people call it a &quot;bandaid&quot; (discs, /shield, area taunt).  I think they've beaten that line of abilities to death with a stick.<br />
<br />
I think the effect on Raex's Chestplate shows the current idea that they have atm regarding agro management, and this idea follows that line of thought.<br />
<br />
And do you wonder if dodge is working?  parry?  reposte?  How about your offensive skills... do you ever doubt they are taking full effect?  Gotta wonder about that piercing score, it seems to be hitting awfully softly for my 240 piercing score...<br />
<br />
...gimme a break, passive abilities have never bothered us in the past (CA, CS), why should they now?  They are the only thing that we know are ALWAYS working, and don't have to worry about refresh rate, or a timer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only bandaid fixes I was aware of as far as active abilites went was /shield.<br />
<br />
I would love to be able to decide when I want to dodge, ripost, or parry; rather waiting for the random number generator to decide that I am going to do so. <br />
<br />
Things like CA/CS which give boosts to the ability to avoid and mitigate hits it makes sense to have as passive abilities.<br />
<br />
I want to see an end to the &quot;hit auto attack and go afk&quot; when not tanking. That will only come from abilities and skills that we can activate like we do with taunt and disarm. <br />
<br />
But, the skills and abilities would actually have to be worth being there to activate.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I do sometimes wonder about ripost. It says that I ripost but how much am I damaging the mob?<br />
<br />
The riposte is the strike immediately above the riposte message.  Dorky order to go in, I know, but it's the truth.</div></div><hr />
