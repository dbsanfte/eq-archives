<br />
First time here and looking for some well needed advice.  I currently play a 63 warrior     <br />
who is doing very well in the zones that I currently XP in.  But unfortunately like everyone here has said in many of the posts that I have read.  As your groupmates grow and grow the warrior must grow as well.  My Magelo looks something like  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=946384.  I know everyone is talking about Ornate upgrades and what not but I really dont have the capital to be able to drop 60-100k depending on the bazaar prices.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, enough self pity.  I am looking for some ideas on upgrades.  I know without money and what not its tough but I really just want to get going into the higher end zones as a tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Battleleader Ceremonial Cape (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70145) Drops in the same zone off random mobs, this is the only rare random drop I have yet to see myself.<br />

Your Geomancer's Ritual Hoop needs upgrading but I'm not sure of easily camped items or cheap upgrades in the bazaar. Something with raw hp would do, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First and foremost, I would get rid of the DD augs on my weapons and get anger augs.  After that, I'd look for an earring with some raw HP such as another mosquito leg earring or a bloodmetal earring.  A magnetic helm would be a nice upgrade in AC and HP if they aren't to pricy on your server.  If you LDoN a lot, start looking to fill your weaker visible slots with LDoN armor or hard LDoN drops.  A lot of the drops coming out of OoW are pretty awesome, but I'm not up to speed on where to camp any of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't have easy access to any money or a way to get it, I might suggest selling off the Blade of Carnage and buying a pair of Droga weapons. Aggro will probably be better than your current setup, and at the loss of a few stats you'll have (depending on server) over 200k to throw around. Use that to get:<br />
-a Bloodmetal Earringx2 or a Fiercely Hooked Claw/Bloodmetal. <br />
-Depending on prices you might be able to have enough to get a Helmet of Rallos Zek. If not, Ornate, Magnetic or a Dented Draconian Helm are all good choices and very good upgrades. <br />
-A new cloak would be nice, too. Whether it's a Conqueror's Cloak or a Shroud of the Fallen Defender (which is great for the clicky alone) you could make up a lot of stats/HPs there.<br />
-Stonewood Compound Bow<br />
-Articulated Battleleader's Gorget<br />
-Mask of the Kuua or a Blazing Eye Skull Mask<br />
<br />
Keep your DD augs until you can replace them with hate or stun augs from LDoN or the one that drops in the Bloodfields (there are several threads about camping it here). Other than that your gear looks pretty good. Just work on those AAs/levels some and the gear will continue to get better. LDoN is great if you can get groups for it, and don't forget about OoW expeditions, very good risk vs. reward for drops there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the awesome inputs.  I have been looking at the Magnetic stuff and its honestly not as bad as I though.  As for the hate / DD augs I knew that was coming but unfortunately I just didnt have the 450 AP???? in EF to get them yet.  But thanks so much for ALL the inputs.  I will write back as I get more things going.<br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
<br />
Just traded 3 old items for the Conqueror's Cape &amp; Bought a Magnetic Helm as well.   Also upgraded Magelo incase anyone wants to throw out more ideas now.</div></div><hr />
