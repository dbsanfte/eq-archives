<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanakus</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I've been an avid and devoted reader of these boards for several months now, I haven't felt compelled to post until now (and I will continue to do so from now on). Anyway, my guild is planning a Naggy raid for the near future, and I figured asking you grizzled veterans of raiding how I should prepare to tank him would be beneficial. Here's my questions:<br />
<br />
<br />
- My resists vary from 30s to 60s unbuffed (42-ish fr and 65-ish mr) - is this enough for Nagafen, factoring in the summoned Elemental Blanket, the Resist Fire/Resist Magic buffs, and the Bard Songs that add to resists, and possibly the Resistant discipline, all of which should be present at the raid? If not, what would you suggest for resistances that would be cheap and easy to acquire?<br />
<br />
- As you likely know, the Resistant and Fearless disciplines are both on the same timer - which should I use? Of course, +20 to all resists helps tremendously against Nagafen's numerous detrimental spells, but I've heard his AoE fear is likely his most damaging overall. Your thoughts?<br />
<br />
- I currently have around 2350 HP unbuffed and 975 AC unbuffed - is this enough to successfully tank Nagafen, factoring in the Discipline &quot;Evasive&quot;?<br />
<br />
 By the way, I am using a Snowchipper/Frostbringer combo at the moment. Would this be appropriate for aggro-holding?<br />
<br />
Comments would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">100 FR/MR used to be the rule of thumb. It's a decent benchmark even now, as long as you don't give up too much HP/AC.<br />
<br />
gnomish tunic (FR)<br />
skull shaped barbute (MR)<br />
crown of the froglok kings (FR)<br />
plat/velium emerald rings (FR)<br />
silver jacinth rings (MR)<br />
plat/velium diamond rings (FR/MR might still be expensive)<br />
gold blue diamond earrings (MR/FR also may still be expensive)<br />
runed bone fork (MR/FR)<br />
<br />
I think one of the gypsies in Lavastorm sells a +5 FR earring. There's lots more, but those should give you an idea.<br />
<br />
Your stats will be fine if you have enough clerics. I brought 6 to my raids, but that may be overkill with today's gear and abilities. You can never really have too many clerics though.<br />
<br />
Snowchipper/Frosty will likely work. It's hard to MT Naggy, so aggro may bounce around among all the warriors (which is fine as long as your healers pay attention).<br />
<br />
Since you're level 52, you'll likely be fine with Resistant over Fearless. I'm not current on all the latest melee changes - be sure you can simultaneously run Resistant and Evasive.<br />
<br />
Just one unrequested tip - bring wizards. You may already know this, but lack of wizards sabotaged many raids I attended before I started leading them myself.<br />
<br />
Good luck =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been a long time since i've done a naggy raid.. and I do mean a long time.. but I would think that you would be fine.  I used to tank him with Indicolite armor and Ykesha's, in fact the first time I tanked him I think I was primarily wearing crafted armor.  I havent done him since the expansions started to come out, but I would imagine that disciplines and new gear makes it a fairly easy fight.. his melee is nothing to worry about, the fear is the thing to worry about.  I would try to pump up my magic resist primarily and then fire after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if its a pickup raid expect to die right away cause your clerics will be feared. His mele is weak and anyone can tank him now days. You will be ok as long as you can make sure that some healers wont be feared meaning 150+ mr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's two things that should help out a bit-<br />
<br />
-Shaman potions: MR, FR, and IG toe heals.  The resist ones stack well nowdays, and the 10 charge ig toe potions are like 3khp as fast as you can click em.  Get the DS ones too for some extra DPS.<br />
<br />
-instant click snare items: there's a number of them available, some *easily* campable by level 40-50 toons or buyable in the bazaar.  Massive starting aggro = good lock for MT.<br />
<br />
Get your AC in the high 900's and naggy won't hit for max each round.  And like the folks said, a bunch of wizzies with acceptable HP and MR/FR and basic knowledge of the fight = win.  Massively twinked rogs help too...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your HP and ac seem around where they should be.<br />
<br />
On his damage I always found his AoE to be only a small part of damage out put to a MA. I would be worried with getting RM up so you will not get feared and not would too much about the AoE.<br />
<br />
Of course anyone not tanking will be takeing most of there damage through AoE so they need both resists high but likely not as much AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya,<br />
My warrior (lvl 50 at the time) was second tank on a Naggy raid a month or so ago (I was main tank after the first tank went down with Naggy at 40% or so).<br />
I would suggest that you not worry about your AC, but instead focus on fire and magic resist gear. If you're on a budget, runed bone fork should be well under 100pp and gives you 10+ to MR, CR and FR (CR is handy when you get to Vox). Also, stat bonus food is very cheap (Kaladim constitutionals and Holy cake, for example, both add +5 to the resists you need). Crown of the Froglock Kings gives you 20+ cold and fire; it drops in Lower Guk and sells in the 200pp range (depends on server, obviously). And, of course, if your guild has high-level players with no alts in Naggy's range, you might be able to borow some nice resist jewelry.<br />
You will save yourself a lot of damage and your healers a lot of manna if you bump the MR and FR--even, in your case, if you have to modestly lower your hp and AC.<br />
Our first attempt wiped because when we tried to pull Naggy's giants out of the room, he came with them into the buffing area (can you say caster death cycle?). On our second attempt, the first two tanks simply ran in, got Naggy agro, and held his attention while other raid members parked the giants in various ways. Then we killed Naggy and mopped up the trash. That's less elegant than splitting the room, and it requires very competant enchanters/rangers, but it worked for our raid (around 22 people).<br />
I had around 110 FR and MR before buffs and resistant disc, and I was only feared once, very briefly, in the two encounters (fear faded before I got out of the room). <br />
At 52 and unbuffed MR over 100, you *shouldn't* have to worry too much about fear; I'd use resist disc, especially now that it lasts 5 minutes.<br />
Be sure to do the junk buff thing, and be sure to have bards to do resist songs. I'd even put my most important buffs last because Naggy will debuff more than four slots, especially if something happens to your bard.<br />
Also, have an established tank order, since even in a successful raid the first tank can die. Everyone (healers and melee for sure) should know the tank order three deep. I found it useful to make a raid hotkey that said HEAL &lt;MY NAME&gt; NOW PRETTY PLEASE. Use this if the clerics in your group run OOM; will make it easier for back up healers not in your group to realize you are in trouble. Test it before you go in, letting everyone know what it's for.<br />
Your weapons are quite good enough to generate substantial hate; I held agro with um, well let's just say I'm untwinked and leave it at that, heh. I was surrounded by good players, though, which also helps. Nukers and other melee have to respect the mob a bit no matter what you're carrying, and Naggy's been tanked with far less efficiently geared warriors than you.<br />
This is a long post, but one more thing you should know: if this is your first dragon, then you are in for the biggest rush of your character's life. Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaos13</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my last naggy kill was with one of the most fun guilds ever....i remember i was in the north part of my city and the raid started in like 45 minutes so i sped all the way home just to get home in time and had my friend park me next ot the raid....<br />
<br />
man the good ol days<br />
<br />
potion/song/spell with 50 would be more than enough, if you can't get ap otion get a mage...thats lal you need for resists rest you shouild worry about hp</div></div><hr />
