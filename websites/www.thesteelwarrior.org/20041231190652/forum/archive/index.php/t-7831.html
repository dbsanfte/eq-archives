I heard in a discussion on one of the serverwide channels that taunt doesnt actually increase hate by X amount, that all it actually does is add 1 point of hate to whoever is highest on the mobs hate list.  I have tried to find out this information on the forums here but havent seen anything to confirm nor deny this.  Any help on this topic would be great, and thank you all<br />

So if a shaman slows on incoming, giving them say 600 hate, and you successfully taunt without doing anything else you will be at 600 + small bonus.</div></div><hr />

For example an SK building up mad hate on a perma rooted mob for a few minutes can give a warrior outrageous aggro with a successful taunt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SK works the best, because then they can FD and wipe the aggro. Then again, no one really cares if the ranger dies, so maybe it doesn't matter...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, also note that this feature of taunt implies certain things about how it ought to be used.<br />
Spam taunting does not help you build significant hate if the mob is already hitting you, for example. That means (for me anyway) that if the mob is hitting me, I let the taunt button refresh and keep it ready incase the mob *stops* hitting me.<br />
Also notice that it implies a proper sequence in the order that you do certain things. On a mezzed mob, for example, it makes more sense to taunt until you get a success and *then* use the incite line, because incite hate comes in set units. If you incite after a successful taunt, then the taunt leapfrogs you over everyone else's hate, and the incite hate will be added to that. Suppose on a mezzed mob you are 1000 units of hate below the top character on that mob's hate list. Let's also say that at your level, the incite line adds 600 hate. If you use the incite line first, then get a successful taunt, then your hate will be 1000+ some small amount. But if you taunt first, you jump to 1,000+a small amount, and then when you hit your incite line you will add 600 hate to the &quot;1,000 + a small amount.&quot; (The incite line numbers here are just sort of made up for illustration purposes.) For similar reasons, if you are trying to pull a mob off a caster, taunting first then kicking/slamming get you marginally more hate (assuming successful taunt) than first kicking/slamming then taunting.<br />
That's what I think, anyway.</div></div><hr />
