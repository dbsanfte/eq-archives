Walk into the armor shop in the PoK and buy some of the new LDoN smithed stuff that people have skilled up on and sold back to the vendors.  It's cheap and will be a major upgrade for you in virtually every applicable slot. <br />

Oh and I did things the old fashioned way of killing them for my gear back when I was less than level 30. I went to stonebrunt and killed the shiznet out of some snow kobolds until I had myself a full set of Black armor. And then I killed allot of animals until I got two of those Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies .<br />

<br />
<br />
Ding ding ding!  Get this man a cupie doll!<br />
<br />
SotSU is a 40delay/10dmg 1HP weapon, that just happens to have 10 AC.<br />
<br />
I am dual wielding.  I just may be dual wielding something that sucks, without knowing it.<br />
<br />
Maybe in my late 20's I'll go quest those Wakizashi... for now I'm going to take the above advice and go slaughter spiders for silks, maybe with my ranger, just to make some cash.<br />
<br />
Weapons. Endless opportunities there - probably for under 100 plat you could do better than what you have now.<br />
<br />
Any specific suggestions?  I bought the BAL for 35-40pp, thinking it was a good weapon, SotSU was a gift, and the GHL was a skill up weapon because I was mostly hunting with the centi warspear and my 1hs was teh suck.  I'm on the lookout now for a Barnacle Bladed Axe (or somesuch) but I don't know how much it will cost.  Any specific set up I should look at?  <br />
<br />
I now know the basic rule of low delay/decent damage in main hand, F**K delay/HIGH damage in the off hand.  Is that correct?<br />
<br />
I've had some suggest I use GHL in primary BAL in offhand to better manage aggro... but my damage seems to suck so bad in that configuration that I was nearly laughed out of an LDoN group.<br />
<br />
Everyone's input is much appreciated.  And it would be pretty cool to have 2 Wakizashi's... NinjaKitty!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldnt do it this way, but in the lower levels it doesnt hurt you as much as it does in the higher levels when you have 100+ dps rogues to keep aggro from and ebay wizards chaining SoS w/o concing. <br />
<br />
For making cash kill animals for pelts and spiders for silks. I think its east or south karanas that has all the spiders on the hill and around it, very good place for silks. <br />
Killing bandits in Karanas and taking the sashes to the man in paladin guild in qeynos gives you bronze weapons, which is a great source of cash. <br />
Goblins in Butcherblock Mtns (the goblin camps over by the docks) are also decent sources of money in lower levels. <br />
Lightstones to the gypsies is another way of getting cash, albeit slower than the rest. <br />
Gear is so cheap in bazaar though that you should have no problem getting some decent gear, cant see your magelo but im guessing your looking like me at that level :P that SotSU i used too at one time to skill up piercing, but then I got bored actually connecting with a hit maybe once every 12 seconds :p Grab a centi shortsword, Netherbian Chitin (you can camp that yourself in Netherbian Lair off the Swarm Leader) And if you camp the Chitin you can grab yourself a Netherbian Uingis also. The possibilities are endless ;) Good Luck! <br />

<br />
But mainly used cystaline spider fang and smouldering brand.<br />
<br />
As somebody said above these are both cheap, or not much its stats on them, but they are quick, ok ratios and fun little procs from low levels. Didn't have a problem with agro on those either for a while.<br />
Good thing about that combination, is that it works 2 skills fast that alot of warriors ignore, and you can offhand them when you upgrade your primary.<br />
<br />
Think my next upgrade after that was a fungus encrusted hammer which drops from quest in FG i think, was just over 1k when i got it but cheaper now, prolly a few 100 if you can find one.<br />
<br />
10/21 with +2 disease damage. Its either hand also, so you can off hand it when you get better and its quick with a nice ratio, and again useful for keeping 1hb skill up.<br />
<br />
needless to say at level 22 you would have to find all those in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Oh I also wore the chiton Bp from netherbian, also yup sell silks etc, and buy bits of crusty for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't want to be using either of these past level 45 as they have undesirable procs, but that shouldn't be a worry for a while. <br />
<br />
The LDoN smithed stuff is Calcified Steel, Deep Cavern Steel, Frosted Steel, Gothic Steel and maybe one other.  Check the race before you buy - I don't think you can wear the Gothic - not sure about the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my server<br />
<br />
Jarsath Trident ~ 100pp (70 lowest I saw)<br />
Shaded Dagger ~ 250pp (200 lowest I saw)<br />
Smoldering Brand ~ 150pp (only saw one)<br />
Spider Fang, Shaded Longsword, velium shortblade I didn't see in about an hour of looking<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.  Should I use one of these type weapons in each hand then?  Was it erroneous to say that delay on your offhand weapon doesn't matter?<br />
<br />
Right now I'm messing around with a packmasters lash in primary and a blackened alloy longsword in my off hand.<br />
<br />
And given folks suggestions and what looks like availability, I'm going after crustacean armor, and I'll check out the LDoN armor too, though I really don't have that much PP available.<br />
<br />
Also, big, possibly stupid question.  Lot of folks suggest that I get spiderling/Spider silks for money.  I presume I'm not selling to vendors, but going to the bazaar or auctioning.  How much should I expect to sell them for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I'm going to hit the spiderlings for a while.  Looks like this is going to set me back on the order of 1-2k pp (right now I have about 150pp in the bank.  Dang druid g/f keeps buying spells with my loot!<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if I buy a full suit, here's the outcomes, in terms of difference if I could just slip into it *right now*<br />
<br />
Frosted is int bonus armor, so I left that out.  The crustacean set below is supplemented by gothic armor, because it doesn't have certain pieces (collar, visor)<br />
<br />
But my inclination so far is to go with either Gothic (if I can afford it) or Crustacean supplemented by gothic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC above stats until you are &quot;uba&quot; right? <br />
Not beyond a certain point.  You probably don't need 600 AC at your level.  Sure, it doesn't hurt to have it, but you're getting diminishing returns beyond a certain point, and if you're sacrificing something else just to get AC, you may be hurting yourself. <br />
<br />
HP's (STA) are always helpful - the more the better once you've got your AC to a good number for your level. <br />
<br />
I would not recommend going out to fight with your Dex below 75.  I would be reallly surprised if you got many skill increases with a Dex of 70 for one thing, and once you get a procing weapon you definitely want it above 100.   <br />
<br />
If you can sacrifice a little AC and get your AGI above 100 and your DEX to 100 or close to it, I think you'll be better served.  There appear to be 'break points' with stats - 75 is definitely one - anything below that and you're getting what boils down to a negative effect.  For example - drop your AGI below 75 and you will see your AC drop precipitously.  100 has always appeared to be another one.  Getting a stat to 101 seems to make a bigger difference than getting it to 98. <br />
<br />
The Glowing Black Sword I mentioned earlier would still serve you adequately as an off-hander and has +20 dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hold on now people before you go mindlessly converting him to another HP &gt; ALL clone!<br />
<br />
&quot;Not beyond a certain point. You probably don't need 600 AC at your level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Misinformation. At HIS level, the AC is actually MUCH more valuable and has a MUCH bigger effect on the mobs he fights.<br />
<br />
Remember, he's not even level 30 yet. At those levels, ARMOR CLASS is a HUGE stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, it doesn't hurt to have it, but you're getting diminishing returns beyond a certain point,&quot;<br />
<br />
The point of diminishing returns on OLD WORLD mobs at low levels is 1001 AC. 1200 if you're in Velious. He's got a ways to go before he hits that.<br />
<br />
&quot;and if you're sacrificing something else just to get AC, you may be hurting yourself. &quot;<br />
<br />
Sacrificing what?<br />
<br />
Hit points? There is no raw HPs on Crusty.<br />
<br />
So he's sacrificing STA.<br />
<br />
And again, before we go converting him to the mindless, level 60 MANTRA or HPs/STA &gt; ALL ... remember at HIS levels, 1 point of STA counts for LESS hit points than it does at YOUR levels.<br />
<br />
So that 16 STA on the crusty legs isn't going as far.<br />
<br />
IMO, the AC 27 Gothic BP is far superior to the crusty ... at his level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hold on now people before you go mindlessly converting him to another HP &gt; ALL clone! <br />
Ummm, the following is all I said about hp's in my post: <br />
HP's (STA) are always helpful - the more the better once you've got your AC to a good number for your level. <br />
I don't think that quite qualifies as trying to 'convert him to another HP &gt; ALL clone'.  HPs are always helpful.  I don't hesitate to stand by that statement.  They're helpful at level 1;  they're helpful at level 22.  <br />
<br />
If you read the rest of the post, I was mostly trying to address deficiencies in his other stats, particularly DEX, and just suggest that he not forget about those. <br />
<br />
I also did NOT specifically talk about Crusty vs. Gothic - I was only trying to give general guidelines. <br />
<br />
Lastly, I said at any level you get DIMINISHING returns beyond a certain amount of AC - I didn't say you get NO returns.   For a level 22 on a budget, the amount of plat/effort required to get to 1000 AC seems clearly not worth it.  He is just not going to get that much extra benefit from that much AC.  <br />
<br />
He can fight and fight well at his level with less than 600 AC.  I think that suggesting that he could benefit a lot from more than that may lead him in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />
