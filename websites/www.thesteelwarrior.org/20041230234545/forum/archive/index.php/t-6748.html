<br />
Delegate Main Assist (loved it)<br />
Health of Target (is ok)<br />
Find Path to pc (use it, but is lag city.. not nesescarly worth it)<br />
<br />
and now im working on th enhancemnts.. i ve seen spell awareness and inspect buffs.. to me they arnt really worth it.. the shamans in my guild say they dont really care what buffs i have &gt;) and spell awarness is kidna dumb..<br />
<br />
 :D  :D</div></div><hr />

I plan on getting either health of target next or the attack enhancement.  My regular group already has the attack enhancement and we did see a difference with the increase.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Group:<br />
I went: Delegate MA (Our mezzers like this one) &gt; Spell awareness &gt; NPC health (yay was just so cheap) &gt; HoTT (LOVE this one) &gt; HE1 &gt; HE2<br />
<br />
I think I will max HE and go for OE, most other abilities are mainly toys.<br />
<br />
Raid:<br />
I went: Delegate MA (nice for addtanks and mezzers) &gt; Find path to PC (for the poor lost lemmings) &gt; HoTT <br />
HE next.<br />
For raids, HoTT is kinda priceless. Especially if you have tons of unmezzable mobs and want to make offtanking easier. The other use is to see what tard agroed the adds or.... Time VZ (RAWWWRRRR) *GG*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have quiet a few leadership aas, but I would say that the &quot;instrumentation&quot; aas are much better than the aas that give more attack or hps and such.  That said knowing what I know now I would rank the aas in this order<br />
<br />
1) Health of Target's Target:  As the MT you should always see your name in this window, if you dont someone stole agro from you and you can see instantly who it is.  If its a caster you can shield them, if it is a ranger you can turn off attack and watch them splat :P<br />
<br />
2) Spell Awareness:  This rules I cant play without it now<br />
<br />
3) Delegate Main Assist<br />
<br />
4) Hps I guess<br />
<br />
5) Attack<br />
<br />
6) Maybe health % when used with DMA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Health of Target's Target<br />
2) Spell Awareness<br />
<br />
3) 100hp<br />
4) 100mana<br />
5) ATK 1<br />
<br />
The rest is complete &amp; utter bullshit.<br />
Delegate MA does nothing exept screw up my UI.<br />
Targeting Sequence is useless.<br />
And the rest are even worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question about raid aa's and group.  First, why is delegate MA 3 lvls for raid vs 1 for group and how does it scale per lvl for the raid aa?  Also for HoTT it still works for your group say on a raid even though the other target involved isn't part of your group just as long as someone in your group has the mob targeted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Health of Target's Target is the best of them all for a tank imo.  You instantly know when you lose aggro and who it's to.  It can mean a lot with mobs who can eat through your casters fast.  Knowing to just aetaunt immediately can save time and lives.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness is great.  Especially if you like to try new things (though certain spells don't show the name of the spell, which is complete ass).<br />
<br />
Delegate MA is decent.  Helps cc most of all.<br />
<br />
Those are the order I feel about them, enhancements come next for me.<br />
<br />
Inspect buffs isn't much for us melee, but can be great for buffers.  The first level is kinda pointless, however the second level says how long the effect will last.  Which means refreshing buffs before they drop, knowing how long negative effects will last, and such.  I don't use it much, but my buffers love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems like Spell Awareness only works up to a certain level... or it might be on a per mob basis.  It's hard to tell, but a good rule of thumb is that it will not work on anything that is obviously an important boss, though even then it's kind of messy.  I mean you can see say Pixtt Suir Mindrider casting Chaos Guard but you can't see Guardian of Glorification casting Throw, and those two sounds roughly equally uber.  But on the upside, usually uber's spell effects are easy to tell anyway.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness is pretty nice to see when a mob is going to dispel, CH, etc... but I think the best part is just seeing what your groupmates are up to exactly.  Especially for the healers, knowing when they're casting their heals help me better gauge the group's ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rookz</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, each ability has it's place...  <br />
<br />
For warrior HoTT is the best bar none. <br />
<br />
My Shaman main can't live without inspect buffs II (allows you to see how long is left on each buff... invaluable for timing).  <br />
<br />
Delegate mark npc is nice for chanters to communicate CC better, allowing them to let everyone know the mez breaking order.  <br />
<br />
Delegate MA also helps CC run smoother, and helps ensure people are on your current target incase they /assisted too soon (Seen a couple of LDoN's go awry when a pet class made this mistake and sent the pet running into a herd just to add a good 3 mobs to the current pull).  Also really useful if your in a place where you need to switch targets alot...  It let's everyone know instantly and accurately which mob to move to.<br />
<br />
All the enhancements are ok...  Personally I like things that let me do stuff I couldn't before.  While hps are nice for the group, the small difference isn't going to make or break us.  Same with mana.  The ATTK difference would be nice though on a melee heavy group, so I put offense enhancement on my to get list... though not that near the top.<br />
<br />
find path to PC has a pretty crappy range, making it not as useful as I imagined it would be...  Really not all that much use with this one.  A fun toy sometimes, maybe even a little helpful moving a group through an unknown area, but certainly not a prime choice.<br />
<br />
Spell awarness is God imho.  I'd put this just behind HoTT.  When you get use to this (and when your group get's use to it) this can really save you alot of headaches.  Getting a big fat red flag pop up as a mob is trying to c-heal or gate is pretty dang helpful.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten target's health, and in all honesty, I can't see much use for it.  This may be nice for a shaman or chanter who are slowing/mezzing the adds to still keep an eye on the action, but as a person who's main is a shaman, even then, I still don't think it would be anything more than eye candy<br />
<br />
That's all I can remember off the top of my head atm.  So of the's here's my ordering:<br />
<br />
HoTT<br />
Spell Awarness<br />
Delegate MA<br />
mark npc/delegate mark npc<br />
Offense enhancement<br />
Inspect buffs II (only if you group with shaman often...  kinda worthless for most other classes)<br />
Health enhancement<br />
Mana enhancement<br />
Target's health<br />
Find path to PC</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get exactly the same window from raid HoTT vs group HoTT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HoTT is a godsend when you are in a tank order.  You can see exactly when the tank in front of you falls....very nice especialy in high lag/mt out of position situations where you cant easily verify their status visually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went health enhancement, spell awareness, delegate MA, HoTT, mark npc, ummm...offense enhancement.<br />
<br />
spell awareness is great.  you can see people doing stupid things and yell at them for it.  WHY ARE YOU WAITING TO SLOW AT 80%?!  When I break charm, is the gar/dru on top of snaring, or do I have to run around/mez?  <br />
<br />
mark npc is very handy as an enchanter.  I end up putting /gmarknpc 1 on my tash hotkey and /gmarknpc 2 on my mez hotkey.  Also, when in a multiple mob situation, my tank knows that the NEXT mob to attack will be  &quot;1 - Target&quot;.  This is useful as there are times where I cannot get everything slowed/blurred by the time the current target dies, or if there's a mob that I'd like to hold onto for mana tapping or because it looks pretty or something...good stuff.  Speaking of which, does anyone have delegate mark npc?  I'm wondering if you can delegate one mark per person.  ie; if I have mark npc3 and delegate mark npc, can I assign 3 marking abilities to 3 different people?  Would be nice to have another enchanter in the group and let him have mark 3 on his mez so that we're not overwriting.<br />
<br />
Offense enhancement is too expensive, imo.  Is it worth it to max all the way out?  I've got the 3rd tier, and 1 point away from having enough to get the 4th.  <br />
<br />
Not sure I see the usefulness in inspect buffs.  At level 65, I'm casting group buffs nearly all the time.  I'm pretty sure I'll know when stuff is going to fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Health of Target's Target.<br />
Spell Awareness<br />
Health Enhancement (I dont care what anyone says, 100hp is 100hp)<br />
Inspect Buffs II (if you make the casters happy, they're more likely to give you leadership :p  Its good for Beastlords/Shamen, its great for determining how much time you have left on that Virtue/KEI/Nine if you're grouping with a druid healer or a shaman slower or whathaveyou)<br />
<br />
After that, I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
What I would NOT waste points getting until I had nothing left to get:<br />
- Mana Enhancement (uhm, okay, so we're looking at an extra 25% of a CH that my cleric has.  That's about as useful as dirt -- in a group situation, max mana doesnt mean anything compared to mana regenerated...because there's no CH for mana)<br />
- NPC Health.  Most UIs show this anyway.  If you really want to see the percentage of health your target has, download one of many UIs.<br />
- Group Regeneration.  Although I haven't seen a parse of it, I was under the impression it was 1hp/level (if I'm wrong, shoot me please!)  Not worth it.<br />
- Find path to PC.  If you don't know how to get to somebody in your group, they can bloody well give you directions.  I dont trust the pathing EQ gives me; after all, it gives you a mob path route)</div></div><hr />

I really don't see why people are saying HoTT is worth the effort, especially in a group: do people not look at the health bars in their party windows? Do MTs not have an idea of when they lose aggro and to whom?  Do your clerics not know how to assist the mob and heal its target? HoTT seems redundant to anyone who pays attention to what is going on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When on a raid, and you are not cornering a mob, it may not be apparent when you lose aggro, to someone standing next to you, not in your group.  The lack of damage done to you, could either be a loss of aggro, or some lucky misses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Otherwise it's not really worth the 20% reduction in XP unless you don't need anything from regular AA.<br />
<br />
It's 20% reduction?!?!?!?!  OMG... guess I may turn it off now, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK...

<br />
It might just be one of those things you have to use to fully understand...<br />
<br />
Typical Example: <br />
Hard LDON.<br />
6 group members + Warder in Feral Pack (7 puppies gathered around a mob.)<br />
Cleric nooking mob<br />
Beast Lord Slowing Mob<br />
Cleric knows instantly before the slowed hit lands that the mob is no longer focused on the warrior.<br />
Warrior knows again before group lifebars change that he can hit that incite key and see his name again INSTANTLY appear back in the window knowing he has aggro again.<br />
Beastlord can think twice about hitting that next DD 'cuz he knows he's already pissed the mob off enough :)<br />
<br />
Could all of that have been done previously?  Yes but not as efficently particuarlly with slowed mobs.  What HoTT gives in a single group encounter is a level of certainity for who has aggro at all times.  At the Raid level it works better for Clerics and Druids...  Clerics know when the CH loop will end by for the first time being able to watch the boss mobs hps go down.  Druids can get their wanna be wizard fix of nooking the mob but if they see a non-Tank name pop up on their screen can /assist it faster then would be likely before...</div></div><hr />

<br />
See here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=84474#post84474) for my post on Leadership Abilities cost and effect.  If you read the whole post you will see things like . . .<br />
<br />
I disagree with the usefulness of the utility skills, most of these are things that good players know/do anyway.  I'll break it down . . .<br />
<br />
Mark NPC/Delegate Mark NPC - The only real use I see for this is marking the mob to be attacked or mez'd on a multipull so that the chanter can mez quickly.  My guildie chanters don't seem to have a problem with simply assiting me then targeting the other quickly, just not an issue.<br />
<br />
NPC Health - All the melee should already have this in their target window if they're assisting properly.  For casters its very very simple to setup an assist MT button(something they should have anyway) and then use the toggle last two targets key to switch back and forth between mez'd mobs or heal targets and the MT's current mob.<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist - Dear god, if you don't have a key &quot;/assist (insert MA name)&quot; which you change to the MA everytime you join the group, you don't need to be grouping with me.  Again for casters the toggle last two targets makes assisting the MA to check their target without losing their current target very simple.<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs - If you're too lazy to tell me when you need a buff, I'm CERTAINLY not going to inspect your buffs every 10min to determine if I need to rebuff you.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness - This could have some usefulness, though in general if you don't know what castertype you're dealing with by the first spell they cast then you're just not paying attention.  If its a cleric and its under 40% health and it makes the healing sound when casting, its probably chealing.  If its a chanter and it makes the same sound, its probably dispelling.  Just about any other class and you can assume its gonna nuke or debuff you.<br />
<br />
Health of Target's Target - WTF is this? If you're healing a group member(stop me if I sound like a broken record) just use the /assist MA + toggle last two targets method.  if you've targeted a mob, then most likely this would display a group member, HELLO PARTY WINDOW.  The only good I see this doing is quickly ascertaining the first PC on a mez'd mob's agro list, hardly seems worth the points when targeting the mob and using /assist does the same thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
However I now have HoTT, Inspect Buffs 2, and Spell Awareness, and I can say I love all three.  <br />
<br />
HoTT just owns, I won't play without it now, I know if I lose agro before the mob even turns around, I know WHO I lose agro too, so I can decide if they can take it and I can just Incite/Taunt till I get it back, or if I need to AET to keep my cleric or chanter alive, this is especially huge in KT/Ikkinz where the mobs can splatter casters pretty quick.<br />
<br />
I use IB2 to check my buffs before named, see if anything is close to fading.  I also use it when I form a group for group rebuffs, to tell if I need to click a BSS with only 10min on it in favor of a SoT . . . things like that.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness is actually just as good for the ability to see what your fellow players are casting as it is for mobs.  For mobs, I've watched mobs get hasted and DS'd in Ikkinz and it helps to know those kinda things, as well as the obvious cheals, charms, slows . . . ect.  For players, I LOVE seeing when slows are inc, whether my slowers are debuffing before slowing, what heals are inc and when without the need to watch for /gsay hotkeys.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I'd say get HoTT before anything else, other than that its kinda up to you.  I actually maxed HE and OE before I touched the utility AA's and I regret not getting HoTT sooner.  I'm getting ready to run outta decent stuff to buy though . . . I have 76 LeadAA atm giving 100hp, 50atk, 30mana, HoTT, IB2, SA, I'm going to finish out Mana Enhancement and then get Delegate MA then I'm kinda lackluster about the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HoTT is nice for a few more reasons I don't think were covered.  You can INSTANTLY tell who has aggro.  If you're in GoD trials and a mob gets slowed then has aggro on the slower (who is right next to the ma for /shield or to let dps classes have the back, right?) then you've got some downtime before the next hit.  The warrior and the slower both know who's on aggro.  Does the warrior taunt?  Can he get away with not taunting?  You don't need to wait to watch the slower's hp go down.  Healers can keep the MA targetted and view the hp of the mob to budget mana accordingly.  Sure, you could use /assist really quick, but what if the ma loses aggro for a sec and you have to juggle unnecessary panic?  Oh and then you don't have people calling Target at x%.  I don't think any of the leadership aas are do-or-die, but they're definately nice to have around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like wasting the very few leadership points I've gotten.  I finally got my 3rd one and purchased Mark NPC.  Sigh... I'm a moron.  I'm almost always the main tank.  I might as well have just purchased Delegate Main Assist and saved myself the extra keystroke.  Now everytime the mob is incoming, I end up hitting my mark npc hot key.  /sigh<br />
<br />
By the way, I started doing leadership abilities when I'm slumming in LDoN normals.  The exp sucks at L65 there anyway.  I've found that the leadership exp rate is kind of stupid.  You get about as much for killing a really low blue as you get for killing say, an even con mob.  In other words that 5 level regular exp bonus doesn't apply here.  So if you're fighting mobs below L60, that 20% you lose to leadership points will be a lot less than if you have it turned on while fighting L60+ mobs.<br />
<br />
As to whether or not they're worth it vs. the exp lost from regular AA... well, how much leader AA does getting that +100 hit points for your entire group cost?  I'm looking at 16 AA just to get +100 on myself (sturdiness 4).  Given that if I have the leader AA turned on for LDoN normals, it actually goes up a lot faster than my regular AA bar, it seems like giving up 20% of myexp would be a better deal then keeping the exp to spend on sturdiness 4 and 5.  The leader AA goes up fast enough that it might be worth it even against L60+ mobs give how much sturd 4/5 cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spell Awareness - Absolutely, hands down, the best!  Anytime I go to a new dungeon, I know exactly what the mob is doing.  And, although you may think it's silly, I know EXACTLY what buffs and  spells my teammates are casting.  This is invaluable.  Tired of getting Virtue in slot 1? Just watch for it and cast a few clickies!  Get this!!!  <br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist - This is pretty nifty, but even as the puller and CC'er, I find I only look for it some of the time.  Still, it's handy. <br />
<br />
Offense Enhancment - +atk is good.  I have level 2 and will get some more. <br />
<br />
Health - This is next on my list.  hps are teh good. <br />
<br />
I like leadership points.  There are a nice alternative.  The only problem I have with them is that, it pretty much means I'm the only one that can do them.  It's silly to spread them around, as you get no benefit.  So, I will always be behind everyone else in terms of AA's...  /shrug.<br />

It's the fastest and most accurate way of knowing what's going on with aggro.  And it's not just you who benefits from this.  The healers that I group with absolutely adore it.  You can see sub-second aggro bouncing with HOTT.  You can tell exactly when your aggro is marginal and when it is locked.  On mobs that don't pursue their target (e.g. stupid powater bosses), it shows you the instant you fall out of range, before you even start seeing the &quot;get closer&quot; spam.  It shows you when someone else is tanking and they fail their taunt.  You can actually see when someone could use shielding and make practical use of that skill.  I could go on and on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like wasting the very few leadership points I've gotten.  I finally got my 3rd one and purchased Mark NPC.  Sigh... I'm a moron.  I'm almost always the main tank.  I might as well have just purchased Delegate Main Assist and saved myself the extra keystroke.  Now everytime the mob is incoming, I end up hitting my mark npc hot key.  /sigh<br />
<br />
By the way, I started doing leadership abilities when I'm slumming in LDoN normals.  The exp sucks at L65 there anyway.  I've found that the leadership exp rate is kind of stupid.  You get about as much for killing a really low blue as you get for killing say, an even con mob.  In other words that 5 level regular exp bonus doesn't apply here.  So if you're fighting mobs below L60, that 20% you lose to leadership points will be a lot less than if you have it turned on while fighting L60+ mobs.<br />
<br />
As to whether or not they're worth it vs. the exp lost from regular AA... well, how much leader AA does getting that +100 hit points for your entire group cost?  I'm looking at 16 AA just to get +100 on myself (sturdiness 4).  Given that if I have the leader AA turned on for LDoN normals, it actually goes up a lot faster than my regular AA bar, it seems like giving up 20% of myexp would be a better deal then keeping the exp to spend on sturdiness 4 and 5.  The leader AA goes up fast enough that it might be worth it even against L60+ mobs give how much sturd 4/5 cost.<br />
<br />
Few things...<br />
<br />
1) Set the hotkey in the leaderbox for Mark NPC to be one and add /gm 1 to your 'assist' hotkey.  It'll automark when you hit it.<br />
<br />
2) The amount of xp you get is VERY much related to the level of mobs and Hard LDON is almost one per adventure.  Go slumming at the tables where your average mob level is 68 and watch the xp fly.</div></div><hr />

Join a raid, note how many mobs you kill to get a bubble.<br />
Then exp in the same spot (I used earth)<br />
You'll notice the number is exactly the same</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right and you're wrong.<br />
<br />
Turning LeadAA on DOES decrease your xp gain by 20%.  I play two characters, all the time, always grouped, always getting the same amount of xp, I can watch my cleric gain regular AA faster than me in a single day, its very noticable.<br />
<br />
That being said, the amount of LeadAA you gain per kill is based on mob level, and you will gain the same amount for killing the same level mob whether you are in a single group or in a full raid.  The easiest way to think about it is that there is simply no raid penalty placed on LeadXP like there is on regular xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I *meant* to say is:<br />
Every mob gives a set amount of leadership, and is independant of how much exp you're losing by having leadership turned on.</div></div><hr />
