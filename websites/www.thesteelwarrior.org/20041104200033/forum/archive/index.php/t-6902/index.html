I have been spending some time upgrading/leveling since my recent return to EQ.  My magelo is up to data as far as i know :)  Thus far ive gotten Anger 3 for the BoC and put Yak on the Copper Hammer.  Got a few armor upgrades as well (legs, earing, boots) and working hard on finishing out the basic tank AA's.  Finsihed with LR5 and am working on LD,PD and WA next.  <br />
<br />
Not really sure what to shoot for next as far as upgrades?  Im hitting NRO next for adv points and planning for Tak BP for sure.  Im thinking bracers &amp; neck are some of my more weak slots?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? advice? jokes?   Pretty much do single group stuff with friends but if needbe i can probably &quot;seduce&quot; enough people to make 2 groups.  Maybe even 1 or 2 peeps from EP guilds. :)<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />
