<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently acquired a Stormrider Carapace, and I'm trying to decide what 1hander to suggest to my guild so I have something to use with it.  I currently use a 2hander, with zero 1handers.  We can take Eindride or Xana easy, and they seem like the two best choices available.  So I'm wondering which of the two would be greater aggro.  Leening towards GBoS, but I'm not sure if the proc of CHSD would put it in the lead.<br />

basically just posting to confirm the topic being moved :D</div></div><hr />

No EB yet for us, both are great weapons, just wondering if one comes out ahead</div></div><hr />

It was a huge upgrade in agro control for me, and my guild does Xanamech at least 3 times a week (still plenty of people who needs upgrades from him), and out of the 15+ kills we've done on him, we got 3 CHSD in our guild.  It's kinda rare, but worth it when it drops.</div></div><hr />

In a single PoV or BoT trash mob I'd say it goes off 7x plus.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm crazy, but I get gain and hold agro better with GBoS in primary than CHSD.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention 179dd combined with ingenuity3 gives a nice lil critical blast message ;) , not to mention its got a better ratio , hitting harder AND faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use both; however I am reasonably confident that CHSD is a better agro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenelan</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Majority of the big tanks in our raiding force have the CHSD...which I'm now passing on as I have GBoS and epic hehe.<br />
<br />
I think...that the CHSD might be more reliable agro but it's really hard to tell not owning one. I've noticed I can be trading agro with another tank who has one (yea bad I know, not supposed to steal agro ;) ) but I just get the feeling from watching others that the proc rate on the CHSD is slightly higher.<br />
<br />
I love my GBoS though...and it works great for extra DPS in exp groups too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't own either but I'd probably wager that the Greatblade of Storms is slightly better from looking at the two.</div></div><hr />

FB shields still don't seem to be generating enough agro to me unless you have a high high proc rate weapon, IE: Bloodfrenzy or bust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harkov</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use em both together, they rock<br />
<br />
I'd say the GBoS tuants slightly better but they are both pretty close.  Either way they both proc a ton regardless which hand they are in hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both CHSD and GBoS are &gt; red blade.<br />
<br />
As for my decision.  I believe the GBoS would be somewhat better than the CHSD, but in my guild I am the only active warrior without a CHSD, whereas many people would use the GBoS permanently.  So since this would be just for playing around, the CHSD would be the best choice for me.  If I really need aggro, I'll stick to my 2handed weapon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lourdin</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have all 3.  Red epic, GBoS and CHSD.  The diff of agro from the CHSD and GBoS is nominal esp. in shorter fights it is usually a game of &quot;I hope this procs quick&quot;  and they both have the potential to do that.  All that being said, I prefer the GBoS because of the DPS.  <br />
<br />
As far as an offhand weapon, you can't go wrong with either the RE or the CHSD.  I have not parsed out the diff. in DPS by using one or the other but the CHSD seems to proc more often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azurik</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find myself in a somewhat similar position and wanted some advice.  I've been using a BoC mainhand with a SoD offhand for quite awhile now.  I recently picked up an Ancient Prismatic Mace.  I decided to bag the SoD in a recent BoT exp group and used by BoC primary and prismatic in the secondary.  I didn't notice any change in aggro.<br />
<br />
So, my question is what combo would you guys use given those 3 weapons?  I realize I can just constantly switch them out based on Avatar procs, but when I can sell the SoD for +300k it makes me wonder if I really need it.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are in for a disapointment trying to use the stormrider carapace with any weapon (except maybe bloodfrenzy) for agro.  I usually use 2x SoD and with those mobs stick to me like glue.  If I swap my offhand SoD out for the stormrider carapace agro is terrible.  The furious bash hate from the shield just can't make up for the loss of DPS from having no offhand weapon.<br />
<br />
Oh and the GBoS is a lot easier to get than the CHSD IMO.  18 people can kill the water boss in BoT pretty easily and it takes far less time than killing xanamech.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gelding</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use gbos main + boc offhand for dps in exp groups,<br />
<br />
boc main + gbos offhand for aggro on raids or in exp grps where monks and wizards go crazy o.O</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just bagged the red blade when i got the GBoS.  I like the CHSD in primary for aggro, 450 hate, almost unresistable give more aggro that the GBoS imo.  Friend in my guild uses the reverse, steal aggro sometimes, but can never tell if that is just a run of procs or not.<br />
Either way, cant really go wrong.<br />
BOTH is the answer.</div></div><hr />
