<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey guys, havent posted in awhile, just realized that the board has a &quot;Forgot my password&quot; feature<br />
<br />
heh, well im currently 53, and my usual aggro setup is a frostbringer/silken whip of ensnaring combo, works great, but i been trying my best to get a new offhand, i had saved up nearly 2k towards a wavecrasher, but the money poofed cuz i didnt loot my corpse before patch or something, so now im pratically living in UP trying to get any of the tawro/radir items.<br />
<br />
but i seen these new weapons popping up with the DD/stun procs and they look neat<br />
<br />
anyone recommend what weapon would be doable by a 2group mostly 58-63 raid could pull off?<br />
<br />
also it made me think back to my yak and i been thinking about maybe one of the new smithed yaks. I havent seen them in bazaar, especially the non-deity one i need, anyone know what they might cost on bristlebane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(if there are any troll smithes on BB that would like to negotiate making me one if i provide most of the pieces post here ill contact you in game)</div></div><hr />
