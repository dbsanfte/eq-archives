<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So...been checking out this, since getting everyone to do those 4 sewers will be...well, not too easy. I did the 4 sewers trials and they can be pretty time consuming. <br />
Smith rondo seems like an easier way. From what i know so far, looks like ya gotta kill 4 elites and collect the different weapon pieces. We can even 1 group this part. Now, what happens when ya turn them in to smith rondo? Does weapon master autopull on the raid? Or...could you clear the room before ya do the turnin?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It only takes an hour or 2 to get the hand in bits and you get some nifty augs while doing it.<br />
<br />
Go hand them in and find out, its painless enough to get another set ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hand them in, fight the weapon master that spawns, kill him, fight 2nd version of smith rondo, voila 54 flags.<br />
<br />
weapon master does not rush the raid, use a rog/bard/any FD class to turn in the stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are all 4 of the turn-in items supposed to be &quot;Broken bla bla bla&quot;?<br />
<br />
Or some of them are &quot;Chipped&quot;, &quot;Tarnished&quot; etc?<br />
<br />
We spent a few hours clearing Elites, and although a few &quot;Broken&quot; dropped, there were also other pieces that were &quot;Chipped&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dont quite know the mechanics. did this last night.  theres a few blue spawns in the room where rondo is. clear then first then do the hand in. <br />
<br />
when u do the hand in we had red con guy zun muram mutal come with 3 weaponmasters. weaponmasters are mezzable.<br />
<br />
zun doesnt hit very hard ithink, but he either had a lot of hps or a high regen rate as it took a while to beat him down. i was playing an ench for  a friend and even 2k crit nukes wouldnt budge his hps. <br />
we just put him in a corner. its not a fight to be underestimated. for some reason we were off the ball a bit and before we knew it had a bunch of corpses and for the first time in a while raid leader asked a cleric to camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get one piece off each Elite Pixtt ____Master</div></div><hr />
