however a friend of mine is having a problem on the KB site..i will paste his info:<br />
<br />
THE PROBLEM : THIS IS ON KANE BAYLE SERVER <br />
<br />
1.When I zone into Velk. Lab or Trak. Tooth I crash to server selection screen <br />
<br />
2. When I log back in to the server , I get to the character selection screen and it says that my charater is in Velks. Lab or Trak. Tooth <br />
<br />
3. I hit enter world , he loads , takes normal time too , screen goes black - then instead of seeing the world I get send back to server selection screen. <br />
<br />
4. When i hit enter swerver again it says I now have a active character. <br />
<br />
5. This goes into a cycle , I log in jump back hence repeat. <br />
<br />
<br />
WEIRD FACTS : <br />
<br />
1. I can not go to these zone with ANY characters on that server , not even with a newly created character , trust me , I tried. <br />
<br />
2. un-installing all eq files and then re-installing all does NOT help. <br />
<br />
3. Un-installing and Re-installing my Operating system does NOT help. <br />
<br />
4. Livetech support says they cant help me ( except reinstall blah blah ) <br />
<br />
5. GM's in-game can NOT help me <br />
<br />
6. email tech support can NOT help me <br />
<br />
7. WEIRDEST FACT : I can zone into Velk. Lab and Trak. Tooth JUST FINE on ANY other server. <br />
<br />
Conclusion : IT IS NOT CLIENT RELATED AS TECH SUPPORT TELLS ME. <br />
<br />
IT IS OBVIOUSLY SERVER RELATED ( Kane Bayle ) <br />
<br />
Note that a few others on my server have this bug too , some have it for 10+months , they simply cant go to diferent zones .. some cant go in Paineel , some cant go in Quenos etc etc <br />
<br />
<br />
PLS community , PLS advice.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated as we will probably lose a good friend if this situation is not resolved quickly(</div></div><hr />
