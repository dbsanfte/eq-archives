<br />
I was recently told that disciplines such as Mighty Strike do NOT require AA's to learn...is this true?  And if it is...how do I learn them?  My dwarf warrior is Lvl 51 at the moment, and I don't think she's learned any new skills since she learned how to shield.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help!</div></div><hr />

you will see what you have available ... to use a discipline, type &quot;/di disc_name&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good warrior has 1 discipline :<br />
<br />
1) Defensive/Evasive<br />
<br />
Then maybe once in a while , rarely<br />
<br />
2) Aggresive/Precise (if there is ZERO chance you will tank)<br />
3) Fortitude (whent the shit hits the fan)<br />
<br />
I absolutely NEVER EVER NEVER use anything exept Def/Eva anymore.<br />
<br />
Needing a disc, and not having it, because you wasted it on some flashy critics is lame.<br />
<br />
Its like LoH, you avoid using it because you want to ALWAYS have it up.<br />
When things are gonna get REALLY ROUGHT<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, no discipline is tied to AAs.<br />

You will actually use those.  Like Emilia said, the rest of your disciplines might as well not exist.  I use Aggressive maybe two or three times a month and that is about it for disciplines other than Evasive/Defensive.</div></div><hr />
