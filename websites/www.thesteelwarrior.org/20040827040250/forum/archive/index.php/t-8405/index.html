Using my guild leader's Planar Progression Flowchart, I created a little program that will allow you to keep track of your progression through PoP. It's fairly easy to use; all you have to do is click on the Tier you wish edit, then click the Plane you wish to edit, and then click the flags that you have completed in that zone. You can enter your character name in the field provided, save the file, and reload it at a later date if you wish.<br />
<br />
The link is: Planar Progression Manager (http://mannhec.home.insightbb.com/PoPProgress.zip) <br />
<br />
Feel free to download it and distribute it to friends and whatnot. If you have any questions, post here or email me at waeolwen@yahoo.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nifty Idea, however it would be significantly more useful if it could print a hardcopy out.  If you could get that worked in this would be a nice offline way to track flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, still trying to work out a way to do that that wouldn't take pages of code.     :eek: <br />
<br />
If I'm able to get that done, I'll let ya'll know. <br />
<br />
Print commands suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are getting errors when attempting to run the program that say something about missing files or whatnot this is how ya fix it:<br />
<br />
If the &quot;missing file&quot; is COMDLG32.OCX go to this site and follow the directions therein:<br />
Missing COMDLG32.OCX File (http://www.ascentive.com/support/new/support_dll.phtml?dllname=COMDLG32.OCX) <br />
<br />
For various other &quot;missing files&quot; download the VB6 Runtime files (the program was created in VB6). Go here and follow the directions:<br />
Visual Basic 6 Runtime Files (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ba9d7924-4122-44af-8ab4-7c039d9bf629&amp;DisplayLang=en) <br />
<br />
Also, I recently updated the program to add a print function. This new version should be available for download soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit Button WRU !!!<br />
<br />
Anyways, new link is: Planar Progression Manager (http://home.comcast.net/~obrret/PoPProgress.zip) <br />
<br />
Changed some things in the program. Now has a Print function and the Saving works off the player name instead of the &quot;Browse&quot; button. Enjoy, and post any comments about it.</div></div><hr />

I think there's a (similar?) utility linked over at the safehouse, it's a sticky on the quests board.  Basically you paste in the results of the &quot;guided meditation&quot; text from the Seer, and it tells you which flags you have, and what you are missing.  Pretty slick actually.<br />
