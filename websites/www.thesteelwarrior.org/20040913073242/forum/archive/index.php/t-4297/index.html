<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wait, I figured it out, this is about the STA post.  At some levels, the amount of hitpoints you get per STA goes up.  If you get STA AAs before you level, your hps will indeed go up more than if you didn't.  This isn't a trick though, if you get your STA AAs after you level, you will have the same hps.  You will get more hps when you train STA than you would have if you trained them before you leveled.<br />
<br />
I can see what made you believe you were getting extra hitpoints, but it doesn't really matter when you get the STA AAs, you will wind up with the same total hitpoints.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Well the investigation is still on going and I've found some information out. I've found that Haass has a character named Haass. But this is all I've figured out I've talked around the campus and no body has heard of this character &quot;Haass&quot; he must be one of &quot;those invisible&quot; people I've heard rumors about. Let the search continue!!!</div></div><hr />

You handed me the gun and by saying god you some what believe aka were afraid of hell to take your own life so you asked me. So techinally I could go to jail for assisted sucide.<br />
<br />
Assisted suicide: killing oneself with help from another, e.g. taking pills that someone else gets for you, injecting yourself with poison using a machine that Dr. Kevorkian set up for you.<br />
<br />
Aristotle (384-322 B.C.): suicide is cowardly, and is a crime against society.<br />
<br />
Augustine (354-430 A.D.): suicide is a blasphemous rejection of God and His gift of life.<br />
<br />
Aquinas (1225-1274): suicide is against the natural law of self-preservation, it is a crime against the community (cf. Aristotle), and it is a crime against God (cf. Plato).<br />
<br />
<br />
Reconsider taking your life there are things and people out there for everyone!</div></div><hr />
