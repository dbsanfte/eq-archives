<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obeareaun</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My wife is looking at creating a Warrior.  She has narrowed it down to 3 races with 2 being looked at very seriously.  She is currently looking at the Halfelf (seriously), Dwarf (seriously) and to some extent the Vah Shir.  Appearance does matter and that is why the Ogre and Troll have been eliminated.  She does not care for the nightblindness of the Human or the Barbarian.  The Iksar have never appealed to her (sorry, mates) and she feels they are very limited on armour.  I am tellin you ahead of time these things so as to eliminate the Iksar&gt;Human and the &quot;you mean there is another race OTHER than an Ogre for tanks&quot; kinda posts.  I need some serious looking into these 3 races.  I would like to know about point spending in creation and deities (for cultural armour reasons).  I would like for my shelled brethren to give her some good insight into our chosen pursuit into the damagetaker as well as the damagemaker.  Please look at these races also in regards to the armour that is currently ingame.<br />
<br />
IF she were to go with Halfelf she will likely use Helanic cultural and go Tribunal.  If there is a better way... let her know.<br />
<br />
With the Dwarf... to Brell or not to Brell... that is the question... or does it even matter?<br />
<br />
Vah Shir... hell... we will take anything...  They are limited on cultural armours simply because of mandated Agnosticity... <br />
<br />
So... if ya can... elaborate my mates in arms....</div></div><hr />

I run a wood elf warrior and have just started a new barbarian warrior so I don't have to much input on the other races you mentioned. It really is a personal choice though :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stamina will be your primary Stat 'weakness' it's worth giving yourself the leg up for it. A few points in strength wouldn't go amiss if you can spare them just for ease at lower levels (carrying capacity and max hit). Have 'ok' dex, int, wis and charisma if considering skill ups and general ability to do non-warrior stuff (no ability to tradeskill cultural).<br />
<br />
Dwarves have a 'better' initial warrior focused stat set up, their cultural armour doesn't compare with helanic. Women with beards... &lt;shudder&gt;<br />
<br />
Vah shir - forget cultural, Good stats in main warrior area's but as with dorfs let down elsewhere if looking for a rounded character., personally I'm not a fan of the kitty female model....<br />

Also, while in the endgame starting stats dont mean much, in the beginning, the high str/sta of the large races is tough to beat.  If I had to start over again, I'd probably be a barbarian again, because they get many advantages of being a large race, but still fit better into most places than ogres and trolls, and can wear medium sized armor.  Also, while faction is nowhere near the issue it was pre PoP books, barbarians can move freely through most starting cities, ogres and trolls can't.  Helanic is some damn fine armor also.  Nightblindness isnt an issue unless you are in a cave and don't have a lightsource of any kind.  Even then, carry a glowing stone band(infravision ring) for emergency use and you're set.  And if I decided to be something other than a barbarian just for variety, I'd play an iksar.  Ugly or not they have some damned nice racial advantages, particularly regen and innate ac bonus.</div></div><hr />

Helanic Tundra armor is very good buyable armor for a warrior.  Plus, the Vah Shir and Dorf thing have been done to death.  Who wants women with beards or whiskers anyway?<br />
<br />
I have fought with the night blindness on my Barbarian, but it hasn't been so bad that I regretted the Barbarian at all.  Someday I might have to due the Nobility badge quest from Qeynos to obtain a see invis item.  So you might have your wife re-consider a Barbarian, although there are many of them as well.</div></div><hr />

Personally me being a Dwarf of course I will choose Dwarf for her.  You can't really beat the jump/roll :D Out of those 3 choices I think Dwarf would be the best for stats I know Str/Sta can both be high depending on how you spend the points.  I'm not clear on Cultural armor for Half-Elf's and I know Kitties don't have any that I know of.  Brellium has nice AC granted 51AC Breastplate and 40AC Legs.  Personally I think Brellium is really geared towards Clerics/Paladins due to the Wisdom/Mana.  Still is nice for Warriors but stats aren't suited mainly for warriors :)</div></div><hr />

That stuff has great hps, and I like the WE look......after all I play one.<br />
<br />
Once again, untill you get to raid level gear Sta is gonna always be a primary concearn.  Put as many points into sta as it will let you, after that it's a tossup.<br />

I went with Dex, as that Dex effects proc rates</div></div><hr />

Sorry off track for a second. I think for my first warrior I couldn't have chosen better then a wood elf :D I got lots of twinkage because female wood elves look damn hot in plate :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want STM =&gt;100, agi &gt; 75. All 3 choices are rare as female warriors (which is nice). Almost all the advantage of starting stats can be made up with a pair of 6 AC 65 HP rings.<br />
<br />
Otherwise its sounds like the Halfelf has it on points.</div></div><hr />

Well, if appearance counts, then there really isn't an option other than  Vah Shir (http://home.earthlink.net/~robkeating/tuscan5.jpg) <br />
<br />
Aside from our stunning good looks, we have good starting stats... and the sneak ability is actually very handy for questy type stuff when you need indifferent faction.<br />

<br />
Seriously though, halflings have awsome stats, are able to follow RZ, and can make some awsome WR bags.  Also, they look cool in plate armor (in my opinion) due to the two-tone coloring they get.<br />
<br />
I have made close to 20 warriors from different race/religion combinations to try to figure out which one I like (and leveled them all to about 20 or so), but I have settled on my halfling.  <br />

<br />
Kind of like giving you a selection of 3 sexy-looking racing bikes and telling you to pick the one best suited for off-road use...<br />
<br />
Luckily, if you can afford full deity cultural and presumably equivalent gear in most other slots, then race choice doesn't matter much unless you choose one that can't actually WEAR cultural gear.<br />
<br />
By the way, infravision items like glowing stone bands are cheapish, don't drop much AC and will get around the night blindness issue if she likes the idea of racial slam for barbs.  When she hits 45 she can buy a cobalt bracer for shrinks so size doesn't matter either.</div></div><hr />

If she wants to play a race based on looks then encourage it, otherwise shes just going to get bored and quit the game before any of this &quot;but she can wear this &quot;   crap will even matter.<br />
<br />
Any of the 3 she has narrowed down too are fine enough and have decent starting stats.   I tend to think you should increase the agility more than the stamina like everyone seems to automatically spout.  Warrior gear especially the rallos and tribunal cultural will give a lot more increases in stamina than it does in agility.   <br />
<br />
If i had to give you any one recommendation it would be to take a race that can have Ralloz zek as its god or the Tribunal.  Both have great cultural armors that she can wear at lvl 46 with the RZ being a little more available/cheaper.     <br />
<br />
As far as the eyesight problem,  well you can fix that with a lot of cheap items.   A good one I used for a very long time until getting a cobalt helm  was a  Froglock crown.    Naked corpse runs can be a bitch at night though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The primary reason is http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29508 .  Right click, 40% spell haste that lasts 20 minutes and can be used from level 20 on (I think).  Only 10 charges, but a 50 plat Mana battery Class V in a toolbox recharges it.  It's surprisingly useful, and should be fairly cheap, on Brell I've seen them usually for well under 1k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bractos hit it spot on comin' straight from a member of the estrogen-laden club :D   I had a halfling warrior up in the mid 30s that I just flat out deleted once Luclin looks came out and she was in pants  :mad:  *cry*<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, I know, I could just keep the old model on for halflings but you have to understand that that didn't matter - OTHER people would still see her without a skirt :eek:   It honestly and truly bugged me that much :p <br />
<br />
<br />
Some things to have her consider aside from all the uberosity issues -<br />
<br />
*As a half-elf, she's very likely to have a lot of problems from the less mature crowd.  There's just something about little leather aprons that bring out the stalker in the XY crowd ;) <br />
<br />
*As a kitty, there's a lot of people who tend to have the stick-figure cat model on for performance reasons.  If she's really taking looks into account, that might bother her to the extent that she rules them out.<br />
<br />
*I'm not real sure if she's looking at having a beard on her dwarf, but I know dwarven chickies were having problems with coloring on beards, so she might want to look at the character creation screen and see if she can get the look she wants.<br />
<br />
<br />
The key to a lot of the guys who successfully get their previously non-gaming ladies into their lil' geekified world is that they realize they're going to need to make compromises on their ideas of what is &quot;right&quot; to merge with her idea of what is &quot;good&quot; and fun.  Even when you're dealing with a gamer chick, she's often going to have different ideas - and stating (or even implying ;) ) that these ideas are wrong is going to make you a sad sad man  :p<br />
<br />
My fiancee and I double and triple box, and thought a warrior might go nicely with the set-up we had going.  When we were first discussing it, he was all &quot;ogres are the way to go!&quot;  He picked up on my oh-so-subtle clues though  (&quot;BAH!  No!  I already have one!  I can't waste a dolly!!!&quot; *makes the icky face* :D ), and simply worked with me on gear for what race I wanted to play.  He says he's glad that I picked one I liked every time he looks over at me giggling at a backflip or cooing over my ubah-cute stripies!  And he reaps the benefits of me being happy with lots of playtime kisses and more tolerance for his occasionally impatient behavior ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, the most important part is for her to have fun so that she'll be happy - happy girly = more playtime &amp; a happier you!!</div></div><hr />

However, that doesn't keep me from being one of the best tanks you've ever seen.  Of course part of that is because I had to learn how to play my warrior when full bronze was acceptable well into your 20's.  So, does she really want to be a warrior, learn all the ins and outs and frustrations, or does she want to be a fashion model?  Besides, once she gets into her late 50's she'll need to dump the cultural armour for better stuff anyway.<br />

For what it's worth, half-elves are where it's at.</div></div><hr />

We compare well to other races statwise and look good to top it off :)<br />
