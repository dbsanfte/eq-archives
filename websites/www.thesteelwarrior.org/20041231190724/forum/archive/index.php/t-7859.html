Never hurts to ask for a buff either if you know your headed into alot of casters.<br />
<br />
I would shoot for about 150 to get a decent resist rate. Grab all the dropped +MR LDoN augs you can :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm. Your post suggests to me that I need to get out more. You appear to be extremely, even surrealistically, well equipt for your level. Every piece of resist gear I'd normally recommend would involve big cuts in your AC/hitpoints.<br />
Runed bone fork fits in the range slot &amp; has some resists, but can't remember if any of them are magic resist. Bloodmetal earring of engagement has 15MR on it at lvl 65, but not sure what it works out to at level 43. I only bring it up because it appears you have access to a good source of cash.<br />
You could look around for Holy cake (stat bonus food w/ magic resist, I believe). There are other, more rare resist foods out there too. Look around EQ Traders for exact stat bonuses. You could switch these in before taking mobs that have given you problems before.<br />
Also, you do have a resist disc. No reason not to use it against mobs that give you trouble, especially named in LDoNs. It's on a 30-minute timer, I think, which might give you pause if the mobs you're talking about come before the named, but otherwise no real reason not to use it if ya got it.<br />
I assume you are slamming mobs to interrupt if possible. I assume that your groupmates with the capability to interrupt are doing so as well.<br />
I assume you are asking for and getting resist buffs from your group members.<br />
Other than that, pfffft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkmoose</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks both. I ususally end up getting a chanter endure magic buff, from the one I group with. He's not high enough to cast the Resist Magic buff yet. I do try slamming, and have used the resist disc. However, with your mentioning that, I think I will try and save it for enchanter type mobs since those seem to be my main problem now. I think the bloodmetal earring of engagement has a req level of 45 or 46, can't remember exactly, but that's a great suggestion to look forward to, thanks. I also didn't even think about swapping resist food and drink out with my normal Halas and Grobb meals, when it is needed. As for equipment, I've pretty much got the best my chanter could afford. I've played a couple warriors without twinking them, the highest is 51, and for once I just wanted to have the best stuff I could get, so I started this guy. It's been a blast so far, and this site is great for all the good advice given. I will see if I can boost my MR up there to 150ish then, and hopefully laugh at them enchanter mobs in the near future. Heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately EQ gear is pretty lamely thought out, and if your budget is limited, your resist is gonna be limited.  I wouldn't really worry about resists, because you really don't have much option anyway, when you start getting &quot;raiding&quot; gear, your resists will go up, and you have more options to pick up, but very few pieces of gear strays from the better gear = better resist format. Basically if you want MR, roll on the +6 Mr augs in LDoNs, wether you concentrate on MR with gear or not, you won't make much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am at 256 unbuffed MR. Was doing a normal (!) LDON in Miragul a while ago and I got mezzed by a normal mob (not a named, just one of them flying monkeys), the SK in our group got mezzed and one other as well. The mob hadn't even used tash. Donno what the resist check is on mez but I guess we can be glad chanter mobs don't use it that often.<br />
<br />
Edit: looking at the various mez spells on Lucy, I notice they alll have a -10 resist adjust, except for Rapture which has -1000, irresistable thus. Works up to lvl 61 on mobs, but think that doesn't count for mobs using it on players. Pretty sure that's what he used and no amount of MR will prevent that.</div></div><hr />

in spite of what happened to you in mm i would say that there are relatively few encounters where you will get charmed or mezzed. certainly high MR &gt; low MR and it is my favorite resist type. but i wouldnt make too much of your charming experience in mm since i think for exp groups its rather rare.</div></div><hr />
