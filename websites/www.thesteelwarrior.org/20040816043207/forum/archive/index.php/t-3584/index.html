<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think you'll be impressed by Romidar's insight into the current melee class imbalance.<br />
<br />
Yeah, he's a paladin but you'll be surprised at his insights and sympathy to pure meleer's balance issues.  Kind of long, but worth every word.<br />
<br />
Give it a read: Romidar's Class Balancing Article (http://nmcs.com/spawnweek/displayfile.php?FILE=articles/006melee_balance.txt)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I still disagree with the idea that minor negative changes to the Stun spell line would be more gamebreaking than giving Warriors aggro lock.<br />
<br />
 As a matter of fact, a question for Romidar, if he reads these boards........<br />
<br />
 Given that the Paladin and SK abilites of aggro lock are derived not from the melee side, but the spell side.......<br />
<br />
 Why is it illogical to think that the spells as they are now are simply too good at what they do? Clearly spell casting power has grown out of proportion to melee abilities......and aggro generation by Knights is done with spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just finished reading the article - very well done.  In general, I agree with most everything in it.<br />
<br />
What he doesn't touch on is the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of EQ.  With Knights having ranged aggro-lock, I feel the game has simply gotten too easy.<br />
<br />
For this reason, I think the aggro lock capabilities of both Paladins and Shadowknights needs to be reviewed and modified (nerfed) to restore an element of risk to the game. Note that I've never played either, so I don't know what is entailed for them to acheive aggro-lock - my understanding is that if they mindlessly mash on their spells they are virtually assured of keeping aggro.<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, warrior taunt/aggro needs to be improved so that all three are at about the same level - meaning there is inherent but equal risk regardless of which class is the Main Tank.  <br />
<br />
Let the utility of the class and more importantly the skill of the player be the determining factors for which is more desireable in any given group or situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I generally agree with what Romidar has written in the article.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sure you all know my viewpoint by now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Warriros need something like an instant &quot;hurricarama&quot; or something...or even an upgraded &quot;kick&quot; type ability like monks' kicks...<br />
like &quot;smash mouth&quot; or &quot;groin shot&quot; or something....<br />
<br />
That thread was pretty spot on though. Good Reading and Ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find these days that Romidar and I are pretty close to complete agreement with the current balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cuedyen2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would dare say that most paladins agree with Romidar's view.  However, you will always have the &quot;seventhsword's&quot; running around giving people the impression that paladin's &quot;should&quot; be the premier class in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, first let me say that I don't believe experience grinding has ever been really risky - knight aggro control hasn't changed that. Second, it's not risk free either.<br />
<br />
Fighting mobs even in Tier 2, a non-uber paladin can get the smack down very quickly. I have all of the tanking AA's (well, minus planar durability which would add about another 200 hp) and can't really improve my gear much outside of LDoN. Trash mobs in PoV can still put the hurting on me to the extent that I need to be chain complete healed - not all of them for sure, but some.<br />
<br />
Now let me qualify that some. My group rarely has a slower, so when I'm fighting mobs that are hitting for 500-600, it takes my group's being on their collective toes to keep me alive and win. I have to stun for more than just aggro - I need to slow the mob's damage as much as I can. Without the mob's having it's magic resistance debuffed, Akera gets resisted a lot (and it only works up to 61st level mobs anyway - I have one stun I can rely on to hit mobs that are, say, in the &quot;back cave&quot; of Valor).<br />
<br />
In other words, for my group, experience grinding is far from risk free. It isn't like I expect to die a couple of times a night, but I do die in regular experience grinding - if the healer is waiting to start a CH at 40% and the mob gets a spike - especially if I get stunned - I'm dead (it's annoying to die stunned when I could have used Lay Hands, but it happens every couple of weeks - just the roll of the dice). The healer can start their heals at 50% instead, but then I'm a mana drain.<br />
<br />
To put it another way - aggro lock only trivializes things when you have a slower. The warrior tanking advantage is important only when you don't have a slower (how many times have people said &quot;my wizard can tank a slowed mob?&quot;).<br />
<br />
Knights had snap aggro and practically aggro lock (I do lose aggro - it's not perfect) before PoP. Slow existed before PoP. However, the combination of slow, extremely hard hititng mobs and aggro lock is, I believe, what has really let warriors out in the cold. Nerfing our ability to generate aggro takes away something we've had for years because in SOME contexts (PoP and, to a lesser extent, LDoN) it makes us much more desirable for groups. The same goes for slow, for that matter.<br />
<br />
The environment changed. Think of it is natural selection - slow and aggro control became much more vital because of how the game world changed. Warriors were not allowed to EVOLVE to keep up with the game world, so of course &quot;natural selection&quot; means that warriors will start losing spots in groups. I don't know how this isn't obvious from looking at the game world as a natural environment.<br />
<br />
Paladins (and shadow knights to some extent) DID close more of the HP gap (both due to itemization and new spells) on top of already having abilities that became MORE desired as the world changed. It was a NATURAL progression for paladins to gain more as they levelled because all spell casting classes gained more.<br />
<br />
However, where the real screw up is, as I said in the article, warriors got almost ZILCH as they levelled from 60. You didn't keep pace with your &quot;competitors&quot; in the environment. In the natural world, when that happens, you get extinction of the species that didn't keep up. That's what's happening now. Just this morning, my wife saw someone /ooc &quot;LDoN group looking for paladin.&quot; Her response (to me, not in the game) was, &quot;you guys are going to get nerfed.&quot;<br />
<br />
In nature, there's no outside &quot;force&quot; that can make a species do better by giving it some new adaptive abilities - Norrath isn't analogous to the real world in that sense. SOE has and has had the power to have warriors keep up. One thing about the game that is practically undeniable is that there's been a caster bias since day one. Years ago paladins were considered MUCH more as melee (the old &quot;75% warrior, 25% cleric&quot; thing) - and we got the shaft because of it as well. Now our abilities are much more balanced between the caster and melee side (we're primarily melee, but we rely a LOT on our caster side to melee well) and so we see more benefits as they improve casters again and again.<br />
<br />
I've really been trying to mentally put myself in the shoes of a warrior (which has been helped by those of this community that have stopped by PoN to post their ideas in a reasonable and calm manner). One of the thing that strikes me most when I do that is, &quot;What do I have to look forward to as I level?&quot;<br />
<br />
When PoP came out, I didn't level due to how they restructured the blue con range. I valued my ability to go somewhere with just my wife (oh, and my 2-boxed druid) and get experience. I didn't want to be forced into needing a slower just to get experience. The months that I spent just grinding out AA's without levelling, I was sorely anticipating getting my new spells. I couldn't wait to level up and get Ward of Nife, Pious Might, Deny Undead, Aura of the Crusader, etc. I knew they'd make a big difference for me, but wasn't willing to sacrafice my flexibility for them.<br />
<br />
Now, if I imagined myself as a warrior instead, what would I have been anticipating? A few more hitpoints, a bit better tanking performance and a slightly larger damage bonus? Well, I got those as a paladin too and, though I understand their value, they weren't exactly something I'd really look forward to. Further, I wouldn't be able to see their effects on my performance except by parsing anyway. How about a warrior in a group where a parchment/rune dropped? Assuming I'd be allowed to roll, I guess it represented some decent cash for a while, but that's it. A paladin missing spells would be itching to get back to PoK to turn them in.<br />
<br />
How in the hell did they make an expansion where several classes got almost nothing from it but other classes got a bunch of stuff? LoY didn't show QUITE the same disparity, but it was there. I was already 60 when LoY came out, but I still did the spell quests to get Light of Life - it was &quot;better&quot; than Superior Heal simply because of the cast time, even though it healed less. My druid uses Pure Blood constantly in LDoN. So, again, what did pure melee classes &quot;get&quot; to balance out what casters got? It would make sense for them to get nothing ONLY if casters need to make up some ground because pure melees were so far ahead.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand from casters that Luclin was SORT OF a dry spell for them because of the long fights and inability to provide consistent value over the fights (thus the need for all the mod rods, etc.). It was not party for melee, either, though, with the high AC values of mobs, the small DI that made mitigation almost worthless, etc. Luclin was a dry spell for everyone in that fashion. Maybe SOE thought they &quot;owed&quot; something to casters after Luclin? *shrug*<br />
<br />
Even if warriors had been still in balance, it would have been a reasonable thing to do to at least give them some new &quot;flavor&quot; abilities so they were getting SOMETHING out of the expansion - just on a basis of &quot;fun&quot; (not that that necessarily fits into EQ ;)).<br />
<br />
Anyway, an average paladin will tank noticably worse than a warrior IF they are using equipment of similar quality AND the paladin doesn't cast any spells. We can almost completely close that gap by our spell casting, at the cost of mana. Finally, that's the achievement of the design impetus behind the paladin class - we use spells to make us the equal of warriors. However, that assumes that spell casting comes at a cost - mana.<br />
<br />
The problem is that for SOME cases, mana is no longer a cost. A paladin with VoQ, Spiritual Purity (or whatever), FT10, MC3 and even a bard is never going to run dry of mana in an experience group. They are going to be able to chain stun, heal and also nuke.<br />
<br />
However, that's not the majority of paladins. I have FT4, which is an outlier for a casual paladin (Earring of the Solstice and Jaylia's Boots). A RICH casual player can do that or slightly better (e.g., Narandi's Crown). A rich casual player who is also a high level tradeskiller can do even better by getting the 8th shawl. However, few &quot;casual&quot; players are either rich or master tradeskillers (a few are, but the vast majority are not).<br />
<br />
Even with KEI, which I have 90% of the time (it DOES get dispelled, or overwritten with a debuff, or just drops in the middle of an adventure because you thought you had 4 hour KEI and it was 2.5 hour KEI), I have to make a choice: chain stun to hold aggro and mitigate damage OR use my other spells. I can't cast Deny Undead or heals WITHOUT actual, honest to goodness downtime IF I'm using Force of Akilae and Force of Akera.<br />
<br />
For high end paladins, it's a different story and I understand warrior complaints about it. I've had people on PoN tell me I'm dumb for not casting Deny Undead because they can hold aggro with stuns AND cast 1-2 Deny Undeads per mob. It ALWAYS turns out that that person has extremely high mana regeneration and it's very frustrating to have people (your own class and others) judge you by that standard.<br />
<br />
However, those paladins worked for those abilities - it is what makes them uber and makes me unuber. The balance issue is that I don't see such a distrinction between an uber and unuber warrior. Sure, the uber warrior has higher AC and higher hitpoints. That's true for paladins too - I raid buff to around 7k, which is laughable to the really high end paladins.<br />
<br />
Warriors just do NOT have the room to grow that knights do, and I tried to touch on that in my article. Where are the melee &quot;focus effects&quot; that would allow warriors to actually tank better?<br />
<br />
Also, as I said, you could nerf paladins to bring them in line with warriors. Then we'd be in the same boat as you currently are - looking up from the bottom of the heap while casting classes get improvement.<br />
<br />
Instead, it makes more sense that warriors also gain in a manner similar to how casters and hybrids gained. I thought that my idea of having runes &amp; parchments result in new melee abilities for warriors was sort of an epiphany, though it's probably been said on these boards before.<br />
<br />
I can tell you that the casual paladin is nowhere near the level of godhood that some people seem to believe. We are still very limited by our mana regeneration - if we're tanking, we don't get to use our other spells (if we do use them, it means the group gets to sit and wait while we regenerate out mana). My normal group actually has 3 paladins in it - which greatly limits our abilities, I should point out. When I'm tanking, the only spells I get to cast are stuns and root. The other two paladins are free to use their spells, so they help the cleric with healing, use deny undead against appropriate mobs, etc. A second paladin in the group is free to use those spells to the point that their mana regeneration allows, but the MA, if he's a casual paladin, is limited to a very great degree. (I don't mean to imply that paladins stack well - we don't really, though perhaps we do stack better than warriors - we'd be better served by having two DPS classes than the other two paladins, but we play together because we are friends, not because of the classes we play.)<br />
<br />
For a casual player, a paladin is an effective class. We can do what we were designed to do. We have a small amount of utility in addition to being able to tank - no one would invite us for that utility if we weren't also tanking, however. I do believe we have it much better than warriors do right now, however. The solution should be to provide warriors with tools that make them current with the game, not to nerf paladins back by two or three expansions. Instead, SOE continues to make the same STUPID mistakes (e.g., the same armor for all the plate classes? What the hell?).<br />
<br />
As a few people here have said, I think most of us at PoN are behind you and know full well that you are underpowered. There are some, I think, who are afraid to admit that for fear of being nerfed to oblivian (I hope the better approach is to point out where we are better and describe how warriors can be improved). Then, of course, there are those few who seem to have blinders on. Unfortunately, they are also the ones who go around posting to other message boards a lot. To be honest, I used to come here to read fairly frequently and posted ocasionally. It's become a bit inhospitable to be a paladin in these parts, though I can't blame you for your furstration. I'm trying to make the class balance board at PoN a better place by stomping on those few who are unwilling to discuss things calmly and reasonably (even if they completely disagree with me ;)).</div></div><hr />

It's become a bit inhospitable to be a paladin in these parts, though I can't blame you for your furstration.<br />
But you see, you're not an idiot, unlike some people wh post here (see: Warriors, just plain STFU)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I forgot to add that I fully enjoyed, and mostly agreed with your article.<br />
<br />
 That being said, when placed with your post here, it shows a bit of your personal blind spot when you remark about balance.<br />
<br />
 My personal example may be instructive.<br />
<br />
 I'm a brand new 60. I have 9 AA's. My gear has upgraded from my Magelo, but not significantly. Most importantly, although I can and have played in Tier 2, I'm fully cognizant that I'm not really geared for those places and so do not go there. My time in groups splits half between MT and half between being 6th member DPS/emergency offtank.<br />
<br />
 I've only been in one group, whether I'm MT or not, whether I form it or not, in the past six months that has not had a slower. Whether or not you see it because you rarely have one, the vast majority of groups are made with a slowing class.....even BST or Bard slow. This, combined with aggro lock, IS a problem for warriors.<br />
<br />
 There is genuine risk when I tank for a slower. That risk might be lowered if/when I am able to get bandaid fixes like the CHoS/SotB/Anger/Ykesha procs/EB weapons, but I and a larger number of warriors than you might suppose do NOT have these weapons, and have very little chance to get these weapons.<br />
<br />
 (And please, anyone who wishes to flame - it is NOT trivial to most people to raise 18-20k for CHoS/SotB together. There are also a grand total of 29 people with the 23 wins in Miragul for a 65 to gain procs on my server or more - few of whom are Warriors. Not to mention the fact that as you go lower in level, you need more wins for those points.)<br />
<br />
 That risk is minimized almost to zero with a Paladin or a Shadowknight. They, through the use of cheap spells, are able to gain aggro at the beginning of a fight such as I can never get.....even enough to fight off, from personal observation, the vast majority of slow aggro. The ONLY time I've seen anyone able to consistently pull aggro off a Knight that wants to hold aggro was in Veksar - by a Necromancer 6 levels higher than the Knight MT, by using undead slow, his best dot, AND his best nuke. And that didn't last long, because his best spells cost a lot more than a Light Heal.<br />
<br />
 (yes, I am rechewing old meat.)<br />
<br />
 Also, for all the talk of the post-60 problem, this aggro disparity is most felt well before 60. At levels when you're not supposed to be able without large raid forces to GAIN aggro weapons, Warriors need aggro to avoid being in the multihour LFG hole too many are consigned to with Monks, Wizards, and Rangers. Even with those weapons, however, they're frequently passed over because they don't offer the lowest chance of risk. This is not 'competition' over the job of MT - this is a reversal of positions from Kunark.<br />
<br />
 I can, if you wish, head over to the Paladin boards and pull page after page of quotes from different Paladins stating that giving Warriors aggro lock capabilities similar to Knights will leave Knights back in Kunark days. I can also give you quote after quote, even from the most reasonable arguers from both boards that to give Warriors aggro lock would force SOE to redesign a large portion, if not all high end raid content.<br />
<br />
 So - the problem is aggro generation.<br />
<br />
 Too much Warrior generation is unbalancing.<br />
<br />
 Too little Warrior generation is leaving the class in a hole.<br />
<br />
 Aggro lock trivializes the game.<br />
<br />
 Paladins and SK's can generate this aggro lock while being almost equal to the Warrior in all other skills.<br />
<br />
 What do you do to fix it?<br />
<br />
 I'll give you my ideas. Do not dismiss them because they are detrimental - do not dismiss them because you fear how far Sony would go with them. Dismiss them ONLY if they do not end with viable tanking power distributed more equally among the three classes than what we have now.<br />
<br />
 1. Low level hybrid spells should work on mobs like low level pure caster spells do. Although you CAN, as a pure caster, drop a level 9 spell on a high level mob, with rare exceptions it is inferior to using a spell gained at a level on par with the level of the mob.<br />
In damage, in effect, in aggro, no level 9 or level 15 spell should have the ability to work on a level 55 mob - this is clearly how things SHOULD work.<br />
<br />
 With this in mind, I would recommend hard caps on level 9 Hybrid spells to level 35 mobs and level 15 Hybrid spells to level 41. This would go a long way towards the idea of making Hybrids use more level-appropriate spells for level-appropriate mobs.<br />
<br />
 2. Paladins should get the /shield ability. This is warranted both from a design and a roleplay standpoint.<br />
<br />
 3. Taunt should, for all classes, work on a sliding scale - at level 1, it gains the top of the hate list +1. at level 65, it should scale to top of the hate list +150. As you grow in power, your abilities should scale upward. Actual changes to the rate at which it works, I leave for the more math inclined of us.<br />
<br />
 4. Fully resisted spells should gain 1/4th the aggro they currently generate, rather than more hate than a landed spell. Partially resisted spells should generate 3/4 of the aggro of a fully landed spell. If you wish to argue those percentages, feel free - once again, the more math and parse inclined of us may have better ideas.<br />
<br />
 5. Perhaps at higher levels, Warriors need an extra boost in HP/AC. I can honestly say in the 50's and at 60, Warriors and Paladins in similar levels of gear gives a good HP/AC differential with similar buffs on. Beyond that, I am unable to state.<br />
<br />
 6. Unlinking of offensive and defensive /discs with the exception of Defensive/Evasive with a retuning of refresh times would offer Warriors more......not necessarily utility, but more options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well sir, I would like to thank you for a well thought out and analyzed article.  I believe alot of the backlash to pally's is dying down as respectable Warriors and Pally alike come to the unavoidable realization that the answer is not in the pally, but in the Absor.  I love having pallys in my group (I usually have a sk, but its about the same for utility).  I use a GSoT and it holds fine though chain malo/slow from my shaman god friend.  If a SK is with me VoT rocks for aggro, otherwise HoH dies to my hand quite steadily.  However if I am lucky enough to have a pally with me from the guild, then heck I use him to no end.  When pally mana does not need to go to aggro they are an absolutly wonderful source of patch heals on stray caster hits, melee riposte, or shaman overcani.  With pious might (or whatever it is) and the decent 2h's yall got, your dps is far higher then mine is (riposte parry blah blah mt dps go down the hole).  Yet in an emergency your johnny on the spot with aggro.<br />
<br />
In any group I am in #1 absolute priority is caster safety.  Any tank that says otherwise is a disgrace to the sword.  If I fall in battle I like knowing that there is a sk with festering darkness, or a pally with a lovely 3 second gobstopper to keep my backfield alive.  This however is where I see the biggest discrepency.  If I have to tank 2, or am hunting with pickups who dont know HOW to hunt with warriors (my friends know, and utilize me to the upmost, however it does take practice), my aggro is wandering and my /shield is at its limit, I can AET to save once, but after that its faith in the RNG and Planar Stun.<br />
<br />
I do not believe in nerfen yall one little bit.  I like you in my groups, I like you protecting my casters, I like you patchen my lizard hide, and I like you whoppen some undead ldon butt.  I would just like VI, SOE, whoever to realize that they created a monster in the neccessity for snap aggro (and in a pickup with dumb chanters its a neccessity, they wont survive a Hard Adventure 900 quad).  Give us the tools we need to fill the role YOU created for us.<br />
<br />
Till Victory er Death, the tank shall protect his casters.  This and only this is important.  The tanks that forget, and worry about their prowess, shall fail their duty.  Now lets go get hit in the head for 2 hours because WE LOVE IT!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can, if you wish, head over to the Paladin boards and pull page after page of quotes from different Paladins stating that giving Warriors aggro lock capabilities similar to Knights will leave Knights back in Kunark days.

<br />
This is true, but you will find at least as many posts saying that that is not true. I disagree with the belief, myself. The problem with the Kunark days (and before) is that a paladin had NOTHING to offer groups other than an experience penalty for including them. We don't stack well if we're not tanks, but we're certainly better than we were back then even if we aren't tanking. (Slay Undead has become something of a red herring, making some people believe that we are a DPS class against undead.) Will paladins lose some spots now that that they aren't losing, if warriors get better aggro? Undoubtedly, and that's fair. <br />
<br />
It is a tricky balance - groups should not want one tank exclusive to another. Really good balance would even allow a group to go say, &quot;well we don't have a slower, but we don't really need one since we have a warrior.&quot; I'm sure that's never going to happen, but what we'd at least want to see that if a group is looking for a tank, it should be a tough choice whether to take the 65 paladin or the 65 warrior (or, it should not be the case that a group WAITS until one of them is available).<br />
<br />
In terms of the ideas you posted:<br />
1. Low level hybrid spells should work on mobs like low level pure caster spells do. Although you CAN, as a pure caster, drop a level 9 spell on a high level mob, with rare exceptions it is inferior to using a spell gained at a level on par with the level of the mob.<br />

6. Unlinking of offensive and defensive /discs with the exception of Defensive/Evasive with a retuning of refresh times would offer Warriors more......not necessarily utility, but more options.<br />
<br />
I posted this on PoN on September 12:<br />

<br />
My own opinion here (don't want to give the impression that I'm &quot;lobbying&quot; for it) is that ALL of the following needs to be done. If only a subset is done, then there are severe problems as a result:<br />
<br />
1. Change the taunt key so that it isn't pass/fail. Each press adds aggro just like a stun (or similar). Making it have the taunt capability that Cease currently does would probably be workable.<br />
2. Warrior taunt key works better than paladin taunt key, but not by a WIDE margin (uhh, 20% better?).<br />
3. Taunt has a bigger range - you don't have to be in melee to have it work. (Would be nice if being closer made it have more of an effect than if you are farther, though.)<br />
4. Stuns do not cause aggro on mobs that are immune to stuns. This also includes stuns that will not affect the level of the mob you are fighting.<br />
5. If aggro control in raids is such a sticky issue, give some mobs &quot;taunt immunity&quot; or allow them to &quot;mitigate&quot; taunt, but do it on a mob-by-mob basis.<br />
<br />
I think that's a similar system to what you're proposing. I like the idea of the sliding scale for taunt, but that's just the details anyway. Where we might differ is that I do not believe the ability fo stuns to cause aggro on resists, immune mobs, etc. should be removed until they fix the taunt key. Right now, Taunt is broken - nerfing knights before fixing that ability jut subjects us to the same problems you're experiencing now.<br />
<br />
If the taunt ability were fixed, as described above, then both warriors and knights would have reliable aggro generation. Knights would be SLIGHTLY better, but not by a lot. Aggro lock by knights would be less likely (stuns get resisted a lot at high levels). We'd be able to use stuns to generate aggro on mobs up to 61, after that we'd be have reduced abilities (this is the sticking point for raiding paladins) - against the toughest mobs, a warrior would be a better choice.<br />
<br />
I would be fine with a reduction in stunning aggro (where appropriate) as long as Taunt was a workable tool. Paladins have been fortunate in that we don't need to rely on a broken tool that has seen little or no improvement since the game's release, whereas warriors have had to do so (well, even warriors try to get around it by getting weapons that proc stuns, etc.).<br />
<br />
I've seen warriors argue against nerfing of stuns as well, in that they also rely on them as a crutch to gain aggro (but they don't have it &quot;on demand&quot; as paladins do). If the taunt skill were fixed to build aggro (based on the skill of the taunter, basically), then I think that concern would be largely addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I appreciate Romidar's well-written article, understanding of the issues, and suggestions on how improvements might be made.<br />
<br />
Much of this has been the topic of discussion on The Steel Warrior and Paladins of Norrath for many months. Furor in particular has written forcefully about these issues.<br />
<br />
Absor's statement that &quot;Classes are not that out of balance.&quot; sounded pretty outrageous and challanged us to prove the opposite was true. We discussed the advantage confered by snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro. We re-discovered the fact that a Warrior HP advantage is largely an illusion. We shared opinions on how Warriors might be fixed.<br />
<br />
Many Warriors and Knights wrote endless posts about these topic. Some denied any imbalance existed. However, most discussed these issues honestly, even though improvements to Warriors might dimish their class.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, EverQuestLive does not mention any of these things. It is not clear that SoE will look into our concerns or even knows we have them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I read and reread this article by Romidar, and it is a very good article. It gives a good history about what has happened to change the balance of the game. However, I do think it still serves to the paladins own interest. It comes to the conclusion that warriors are completely broken, and paladins are where they should be. While many of us agree warriors need upgrades, many also feel that knights are overpowered.<br />
<br />
I was very interested in the changes that paladins have recieved over time. And when I look back at these, I truly see that Verant/SoE has no idea what class balance truly is. I do feel, and some paladins will scream for my head for this, that the original balance effects were not bad ideas, but may instead have been poorly implemented.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Looking at the original balance items--<br />
<br />
I am going to rate the Terrible, Bad, Poor, Average, Good, Great, Excellent.<br />
<br />
1.) Smaller mana pool. A hybrid’s mana pool was based on their actual level minus 8. For example, a 9th level paladin had the mana pool of a first level cleric. <br />
<br />
This is by no means unreasonable. Every RPG that I know of, uses this to balance out a 'hybrid' class. And what I mean by 'Hybrid' is a class that uses melee AND spells. The benefit  of being able to use both should be that you are not as good as a pure caster or a pure melee. Since EQ uses a mana system you should NOT get as much mana as a pure caster. This is excellent balance.<br />
<br />
2.) Lack of Specialization. Specialization reduces the cost of all spells, but primarily for the specialization skill. This also reduces the likelihood of fizzling. <br />
<br />
This is also very reasonable. by the idea of the 'hybrid' you should not be as good as a pure caster at casting spells. However I do feel that in the original class design, and classic design of a paladin as an UNDEAD SLAYER, Paladins should have gotten a special class only school of spells that work towards this that they could specialize in. This would have been balanced. No specialization is not as good, but it is not that much of a disadvantage, because again, they do also have the benefit of melee skills that pure casters do not. This is average balance.<br />
<br />
3.) Penalized spell cost. It cost hybrids more mana than their parent class to cast the same spell (still true up to 60th level). <br />
<br />
This is and always has been just wrong. If you limit the mana pool of a class, and then increasespell cost, you are double dipping. This is TERRIBLE balance.<br />
<br />
4.a &amp; b)  Reduced benefit from mana and wisdom items. Hybrids did not receive the full benefit of +mana items and wisdom was less effective because the wisdom to mana equation was based on an 8 level penalty for a hybrid. <br />
<br />
The problem with this is more of itemization. As to the +mana a class should always get the actual value of the item, hidden eq modifiers to items is bad. As far as the +wisdom, as stated above a 'hybrid' should be on a different casting chart than normal. I would rate this poor and average. Poor for the + mana, Average for the + wisdom.<br />
<br />
5.) Melee timer was reset by casting. Casting a spell meant that the melee delay timer started again; if you had a 4 second delay, casting a spell meant that you had to wait for another 4 seconds before swinging a weapon. This meant that casting any spell during combat greatly reduced melee damage. <br />
<br />
In every RPG you get actions, these actions take a certain time. You cannot cast and attack at the same time. You must decide what action you want to do and that is part of the balance ability. This was excellent balance.<br />
<br />
6.) Long delay between when a hybrid receives a spell and its parent receives it. Spells are balanced based on when the parent class receives them – e.g., Minor Healing is a useful spell at 1st level, but by 9th level will barely move a hitpoint bar. Hybrids receive many of their spells 8 or more levels after their parent class. <br />
<br />
Again in many RPG's this is a common occurence. Since caster level is lower, spells should come later. However, they should not come so late as to be utterly useless. Some utility spells Never are useless, so no matter what level they are still usefull. Many low level spells are used by lvl 65's many times a day, sow, invis,snare,etc... it is mostly damage and healing that are affected by this.  Overall, this is average balance.<br />
<br />
7.) Overlap with parent classes. Hybrid spells were almost completely redundant with their parent classes. Many paladin spells, for example, are buffs that clerics receive many levels earlier. This meant than when a hybrid was grouped with a priest class, the majority of their spells were rendered obsolete. The lack of unique spells meant that a hybrid’s casting side was nearly non-existent in almost any experience group. <br />
<br />
This is just plain terrible. the basic utility spells are fine. but each class needs its own defining types of spells. This to me is one of the worste places that they dropped the ball. as above healing/damage are greatly affected by levels, making 90% of the spells redundant reduces the utility of the spells for the hybrids. Also lack of specialization type spells was poor. If they would have stuck to the class designs. could have been much better. This is a Terrible balance.<br />
<br />
8.a &amp; b) Fewer spells that are received further apart in levels. A hybrid’s spell book required many fewer pages. Further, the gaps between spell levels grew over time: 9th, 15th, 22nd, 30th, 39th, 49th. For hybrids, there were many points at which their power (relative to the mobs they fought) actually reduced as they leveled, as their spells became less and less effective. <br />
<br />
Good design, poor execution. Again, as hybrids they are still capable at melee so their spellcasting should not advance at the same rate as pure casters.  The choice of spells, and the longer than needed delay along with lack of specialty spells ruined what was a good balace idea and made it bad. For concept this is good balance. for execution this is bad balance.<br />
<br />
9.) Melee skills received later than warriors. Gaining levels early on was more challenging; early on, for example, a paladin did not receive bash until 10th level, whereas warriors received kick and bash at 5th. <br />
<br />
this is excellent balance. Again they do have the benefit of spellcasting to  augment their melee. they should not get skills the same as pure melee. This is excellent balance.<br />
<br />
10.) Hit points for hybrids were lower than warrior hit points (one of the most reasonable of the penalties). <br />
<br />
Excellent balance. for all the above reasons.  This curtails with the mana balance.  This is excellent balance.<br />
<br />
11. a&amp;b ) Experience penalty. Hybrids suffered an experience penalty, requiring more experience per level than other classes. The penalty was passed on to a group when they added a hybrid. The original thought behind the experience penalty was that a hybrid’s flexibility would result in a group earning faster experience than if they had added a “pure” class, so that balance required that experience be reduced to the level one would have gotten with a pure class in their place. <br />
<br />
This is just terrible. It is terrible in concept and it was even worse in execution. Balancing the class with pure caster &amp; pure melee means that there should be no penalty. Forcing that penalty upon the whole group is making something terrible, just twice as bad. This is terrible balance for concept, and terrible balance for execution.<br />
<br />
12.) One thing missing from the analysis by Romidar was Offense/defense/weapon skill caps. The skill caps on 'hybrids' were lower than they were for pure melee. What this did was lower paladin ac/dps. <br />
<br />
This is a balance problem I have with the entire EQ system. The current system works up to a certain point, kinda. Well let me explain. Skill is based upon level. You get 5 skill points per level. The problem is skills cap before a character gets to their max level, and also if for example a character gets a skill at level 15, the max skill for that character is 75.. so all the delay in skill did was mean they had to wait. there is no difference in that characters skill at level 16 as a character who has had the skill since level 1. This to me is a flaw in game mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
By looking at this on a rational basis I get that original class balance actually was a little above average. <br />
<br />
By now all the paladin's are sure to be screamin, but 'Those were the dark ages, we sucked back then' So then, how can the class be decently balanced, yet still have problems?<br />
<br />
Well 3 Huge errors are from my viewpoiunt what created this bad times for paladins. <br />
<br />
First and foremost was the XP penalty. Either real or percieved, the exp penalty made hybrids undesireable. Exp was ALOT harder to gain back then. I myself spent weeks in Oasis leveling in order to just get to 20. Now people spend a weekend and they are level 30+ <br />
<br />
Second was a 'hybrids' signifigant uselessness as far as spellcasting. Just about every spell they had could be cast by a pure caster and could be cast better by them. the smaller mana pool, while balanced along with the casting penalty, and the poor spell selection, made hybrids virtually useless casters. They were either OOM or they had no effective spells to cast.<br />
<br />
Third is a 'hybrids' inability to take damage. Lower Hp's combined with lower skill caps, meant that 'hybrids' took more damage than pure melee. This in itself is not necessarily all that bad, but at the time, all classes, including the healers were much weaker, and the added mana required to sustain a hybrid was noticable.<br />
<br />
One thing I think not discussed here, is the added skills for knight hybrids just were lacking. LoH and Harm touch, while nice just do not compare to say a rangers Tracking. More needed to be done to the Knights to give them more uses. Track Undead would have been a neat ability usable by both classes. <br />
<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
So what has changed in regards to balance?<br />
<br />
from the list of balance issues above...<br />
Well all of the issues with spell casting have been changed over time.  Now hybrids as almost as adept at casting as pure casters. I do not believe that they have specialization, but all the rest has been changed. they have larger mana pools, better spells, class specific spells, no delay time for melee while casting. The defensive skills are virtually identical to pure melee. The experience penalty was removed.<br />
<br />
So what is bad with these changes? <br />
<br />
First off, it removes any 'penalty' for being a hybrid. Just so you remember, I am not saying a Paladin is a hybrid in the '75%warrior, 25% cleric' sense. A hybrid uses spells &amp; melee to become a complete class. Now a hybrid is a complete caster as well as a complete melee class. <br />
<br />
Again, this would be acceptable except for three LARGE changes to the game.<br />
<br />
1.) Mana Regen - meditation used to be the STANDARD form of mana regen. No longer is med time needed in normal settings. Introduction of FT, AA's, KEI+, Mounts has made mana regen trivial in all normal enviorments. It is not that hard to get a 4hr KeI for an experience group setting. And it is standard practice. <br />
<br />
This is not just a melee/hybrid/caster balancing issue. it is a magic using balance issue. casters frequently can regen 20+ mana while standing and casting spells. this is wonderful, however it is NOWHERE near balanced to melee HP regen. Consider this. a melee with good gear and full buffs will regen at the rate of 30-40 hp per 'tick' While a standard caster will regen mana at 20-30 per 'tick' Advantage you say to the melee? Well look at the different costs... in combat a normal mob in say tier 2 will do somewhere at the rate of 100-200 dps. Since a tic is 6 seconds. at the low end this is 600 damage a 'tick' so the melee now is at a negative hp per 'tick' this is clearly a losing situation, the melee has regained at best 5% of damage . Now lets look at complete heal. this spell casts in 10 seconds and costs 400 mana. a relatively high cost spell. in 2 ticks this cleric has regained 10% of the mana spent. <br />
<br />
In melee vs caster, the melee is clearly on the losing end. The costs to cast spells has not increased anywhere near at the same rate as the mana regen capabilities, while at the same time the hp regen capabilities have not increased anywhere near what the mobs dps abilities have. <br />
  <br />
2.) Focus effects- So while the ability to regain mana has become almost trivial. focus effects have been introduced to make spell casting even more effective, less mana, less time, longer lasting,  greater effects, etc. A multitude of focus effects have been added to help casters do all sorts of things better. Many of these only require the item during casting, so they become easilly swapped for other useful items. Focus effects have easilly increased casters effectiveness by 30% in my opinion. No such effects were created outside of time that even come close to the ability of these focus to affect gameplay. And these focus effects are available from level 1-65<br />
<br />
3.) Itemization - This is a dead horse, but the above two could problems could probably be mitigated IF itemization was not as problematic as it is. The problem is two fold. Lets look at my warrior. <br />
<br />
 Landrain  (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=753811)<br />
3185 hps naked unbuffed. With full gear I am at 6552 hps. More than double. 1850 hps directly from +hp gear. but I also have 555 Mana from + mana gear,  and 9 of 20 slots are WAR only so no mana on them.<br />
<br />
Now I examined  Barraind  (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=429465)<br />
2548 hps unbuffed. With full gear 6430 hps. Way more than double. 2285 hps from +hp gear, but also 2170 mana from gear. He also had 1235 mana unbuffed, and 2026 mana from wisdom, giving him 5431 mana.<br />
<br />
Granted Barraind is a little farther than I am in progression, but there was no time gear on his character. Only EP items. Looking at this it is quick to see that the original class balance of hps per classes is almost completely eroded. Add into this the HUGE gain in Mana from class design. And it is easy to see why pure melee have been left behind.<br />
<br />
Itemization. In my opinion there needs to be some value that is assigned to balance mana and hps. The current slew of all/all, all caster, all melee, all hybrid gear  has really created a problem for melee classes. <br />
<br />
Here is what i mean. lets say we give a value of 1hp=1 mana, Then for example an elemental bracer has a value of 145. for a pure melee this should be 145 hps, for a pure caster this should be 145 mana, for a hybrid it should be some ratio in between. <br />
Such as 75 hps 70 mana.<br />
<br />
The current way that this is set up is Warrior - 145 hps, Knight 135hps + 130 mana, Pure Caster 135 mana + 130 hps. basically what this says is that for 10 hps a hybrid gets 130 mana. or for 5 mana a caster gets 130 hps. Anyone with any sense of balance must surely see that this is very poor design. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Even with these imbalances warriors were still effective. And through Luclin even wanted in group situations. <br />
<br />
What changed all that was the new 'Design Implementation' of Mobs. In PoP Mobs dramatically increased in DPS, and were Greatly decreased in HP's. What used to be hitting for 200-300 Now they hit for 800 and faster. What used to have 64k hps now had 20-30k. This made it so that if a group were to use melee to combat a mob, they were at extreme risk of death, UNLESS, the mob is slowed. Slow however has a very HIGH aggro component. This shown a light on the HUGE WEAKNESS of the warrior class. No innate aggro generation, and no ranged aggro generation. Slowers began to get pounded, hard and fast, a resisted slow was almost as good as a death sentence. This is where the knights stepped up. Using their stuns/snares/spells they were able to get aggro at a distance and MAINTAIN that aggro through slows and debuffs.<br />
<br />
The growth of knights into as effective tanks as warriors. Along with the NEEDED requirement of ranged aggro and ability to hold aggro better has relegated warriors to the back end of the list. What once was the strongest advantage of warriors, our ability to tank, has become a liability for us. No longer do a majority of players feal safe with a warrior tanking, they want and ask for knights. <br />
<br />
Even though we have a slight advantage ~10% in mitigation (only noticable through extensive parsing and analysis) the HUGE AND NOTICEABLE disadvantage we have with aggro control has made warriors inferior tanks in 90% of the game currently played. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
How to fix this has been greatly debated in many many posts and discussions. I feel it needs addressed in a few major ways.<br />
<br />
1.) AGGRO - give warriors some form of &quot;RELIABLE&quot; aggro control. And allow this to be used at range.<br />
<br />
2.) UTILITY - unhook all disciplines, give warriors better skills than hybrids, give all melee styles/techniques so that there is more than just auto-attack - kick - slam etc.<br />
<br />
3.) ITEMIZATION - stop the all/all crap. Give melee something for the caster stats on their gear, get the class gear more in balance.<br />
<br />
Well I guess I have rambled on long enough...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Paladins are Tanks. They are going to want to MT in groups and in raids. So long as they do not become Warriors with spells at no cost to their Tanking abilities that their spells have to be used to mitigate there should be no problem.<br />
<br />
As near as I can tell, the major outstanding issue for Paladins is their inability to tank the toughest mobs. On PoN I proposed a posible partial solution -<br />
In my view a Heal over Time self heal ought to be created that has a really high mana cost (like your whole mana bar) but heals on the order of 3 CH's total distributed at xHP's a tick for 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Yes, I understand a Paladin would not be able do this and still cast Wave of Prexus or chain stuns and this falls far short of Defensive. But it is a move in the direction of providing Paladins more of a Defensive-like capability in exchange for an inability to cast spells if it is used.<br />
 <br />
Are Paladins more powerful generally than Warriors? Probably. But unless we can get ALL Tank classes to embrace the idea that tanks should be balanced and pressure SoE to achieve balance, nothing will happen.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Paladins do still have casting penalties, as I tried to describe. Less effecient spells, long recast times, spells that come long after the parent class, lack of specialization, excellent spell caster AA's unavailable (Spell Casting Mastery makes a huge difference; Spell Casting Reinforcement Master would make a big difference, etc.).<br />
<br />
However, though things like resetting the melee timer, giving paladins a smaller mana pool, etc. sound reasonable on paper but result in a class that has spells but never casts them. So what is the point, then of having the spells?<br />
<br />
Where you end up driving major disagreement between paladins and yourself is making the claim that we are overpowered. We are nowhere near as powerful as just about any spellcasting class, so it is difficult to get any agreement that we are &quot;overpowered&quot; due to the fact that we do tend to be more powerful than MELEE classes.<br />
<br />
Casters &gt; Hybrids &gt; Pure Melee<br />
<br />
Paladins don't trivialize the game, and we certainly have our weaknesses. My group can't win most assassinate missions on NORMAL difficulty because I can't tank many of the mobs long enough for slow to stick. Even with KEI, I can't cast anything more than stuns in an adventure.<br />
<br />
Maybe paladins at the very high levels are overpowered - I'm not in a good position to judge that stage of the game because it's not one with which I've had direct experience. They get high AC, high hitpoints, big mana pools and very useful focus effects (spell haste, mana preservation, flowing thought, etc.). Please don't make the mistake of thinking that that holds for the vast majority of paladins who rarely have better than FT1 and often have NO other focus effects (my only other is Extended Ranger III, which does nothing for me actually).<br />
<br />
If you look at a paladin with FT15, VoQ and other mana regeneration buffs, then you'd probably never see them sit to med. That's not the case for us regular mortal paladins who lack those resources. We still have small mana pools and very expensive spells to go with them. Simply put, it's barking up the wrong tree if you think paladins are overpowered when we're weaker than 75% of other classes - we are, however, at the high end of the power curve for MELEE classes. I try to be very specific about that by pointing out how much our spells mean to us; if you compare us to rangers, for example, they rely much less on their spells to fulfill their group role (their ATK buffs are useful, but you could take away almost their entire spellbook without making a dent in what they do). <br />
<br />
Knights, however, rely heavily on their spells. I was just chatting with a shadowknight friend in game today who was lamenting the fact that even with KEI he couldn't use most of his spells in LDoN - the pace of the game there is so fast that using ANY spells other than his taunting spells resulted in downtime, which a group won't tolerate there. In LDoN, at least, most of the main tank's spell book may not exist because we DO need to meditate if we use those spells. Our mana has to be devoted to the one thing that makes us the choice over warriors - aggro control.<br />
<br />
Just one final point in terms of the historical perspective. Paladins in AD&amp;D 2nd edition did certainly have penalties, but they were far more powerful than a pure fighter. Melee was almost the same, but they also got goodies like lay hands, spells, a holy mount, holy sword, etc. The rules tried to balance that by:<br />
<br />
1. making it very difficult to roll a paladin (17 charisma and the other stiff requirements).<br />
2. an experience penalty.<br />
3. roleplay rules - paladins could have fewer magic items, had to tithe to the church, and, of course, had to maintain their lawful good alignment.<br />
<br />
In other words, AD&amp;D is a very poor place to look for balancing ideas, and that's exactly where the original devs looked. Paladins WERE the superior class in AD&amp;D, but they were supposed to be rare and hard to play. That's no the case in EQ, or at least in the EQ of today. For there to be balance, paladins need to be able to serve as tanks by using their spellcasting abilities to make up their tanking weaknesses - but the only way to measure &quot;weakness&quot; is to look at the warrior class as the standard, and they currently are a poor standard to use (at least in experience groups).<br />
<br />
So, I understand where you are coming from by believing that some of those old penalties made sense but I can also tell you that they only look good on paper. In practice, it results in a casting class that can't cast. Many of the penalties are just better &quot;hidden&quot; now because they have to do with effeciency (e.g., how many HP can a paladin heal with a full mana bar?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A couple of points, Romidar......<br />
<br />
 Maybe paladins at the very high levels are overpowered - I'm not in a good position to judge that stage of the game because it's not one with which I've had direct experience. They get high AC, high hitpoints, big mana pools and very useful focus effects (spell haste, mana preservation, flowing thought, etc.). Please don't make the mistake of thinking that that holds for the vast majority of paladins who rarely have better than FT1 and often have NO other focus effects (my only other is Extended Ranger III, which does nothing for me actually). <br />
<br />
 In return, please stop people from assuming that the vast majority of Warriors have even the CHoS/SotB combo for aggro generation. They don't, and that makes Paladin stuns even more attractive to an XP group. And, when I combine this part of your post with this -<br />
<br />
 Our mana has to be devoted to the one thing that makes us the choice over warriors - aggro control. <br />
<br />
 I'll note that, if you use three Ceases per mob, (Some more, some less. Resists are less of a problem than with other spells), in a normal LDoN slaughter 50 mission (The most popular), the Paladin will use, what, minimum 2250 mana? At my level and lower, even 3 Ceases tends to be excessive if you're looking for aggro lock, but meh. 2250 mana, however, is easily available to a Paladin in an LDoN group. Even if they 'only' have FT1 and c3 - not counting if anyone is manatapping or if you have a bard or mage.<br />
<br />
 I have yet to see a Paladin take a med break in an adventure unless he doesn't have any form of mana regen available. Now if Paladins were using either FoA instead of a level 9 spell, I'd easily see them needing med time or casting fewer stuns. As it stands now, however, they're not doing either from my view down here on the ground floor.<br />
<br />
 This all being said, I still prefer my ideas to shrinking mana pools or bringing back the melee refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Romidar came right out and said:<br />
Our mana has to be devoted to the one thing that makes us the choice over warriors - aggro control. <br />
<br />
And that alone = overpowered to me. Paladins shouldn't have anything that generally makes them the choice OVER warriors. An equal choice, fine. Prefered in a dungeon with a lot of undead, ok. But not the choice OVER warriors.<br />
<br />
And I'll tell ya, Paladins may not cast the lowest level stuns for aggro because they want the stun to have an effect, but a lot of Warriors are using aggro weapons who's stun component does not stick. We KNOW a stun that doesn't stick aggros. We Suspect that a Deepwater Bracer could be used with 0 mana cost (or at least I think so as I've used one in WW on a mob and it was a lot higher than level 9).<br />
<br />
You comment about spell efficiency and use heal as your example. Think hard about heals. You and I stand in front of  Freeport guards and let them wail away at us using only heals to prolong our lives. Who dies first? Paladins have a bucket load more HPs than Warriors - not the elusive Warrior 800HP advantage. Paladins have thousands more HP's than Warriors!<br />
<br />
How powerful is spell casting? My 56 Druid can solo mobs that I can't solo as a 65 Warrior. So maybe Paladins come up a little short as melees when compared to Warriors. But add in the spell casting and Warriors aren't even close.<br />
<br />
I understand that your combat spell gems are filled with spells that make up for shortcomings. But they also contain spells that make you superior.<br />

When was the last time you saw a 'REGULAR' 65 paladin solo anything?<br />
<br />
The fact that they can even think about trying.. says something.<br />
<br />
The fact that Warriors are 100% required to have a group to support them, and that Paladins do NOT, yet Paladins are MUCH more PREFERED in groups than a warrior, should be enough to show anyone that there is a MAJOR PROBLEM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, there is a problem, pretty much everyone knows it.  Romidar's point is that paladins are where they should be and warriors need to be brought up.  Personally, I agree with this.<br />
<br />
I don't want to see stun aggro nerfed, because most of us do rely on it.  Sure there are warriors out there without a CHoS or GSoT, but at some point, you WILL have one or both.  Considering that a GSoT was going for under 500pp 2 months ago on my server, I'd say they are available to anyone who can use them.<br />
<br />
I do want to see pure melees rebalanced.  Taunt needs improvements, warriors need some utility beyond /shield, disciplines need to be reworked (and there are great suggestions on doing this), oh yeah, and our piercing cap needs to go up.<br />
<br />
With the appropriate gear for what they are facing, paladins and shadowknights are great tanks.  That does not need to change.  What does need to change are ways to bring warriors up to that standard.  Just because we are the unwanted redheaded stepmules of EQ doesn't mean we have to drag everyone else down to our level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The subject of the thread is Romidar's article, and the ensuing discussion.  In his article and further comments it is clear that he feels Warriors need some change.  In his mind this change needs to address the diminishing HP gap, aggro generation, and perhaps added ways for Warriors to contribute to a group.<br />
<br />
So when he says &quot;Our mana has to be devoted to the one thing that makes us the choice over warriors - aggro control&quot;,  he is talking about the current situation.  If you improve Warriors, then we would have to spend that mana to remain competitive with the newly balanced Warriors.<br />
<br />
The big point I see is that while a very good case can be made that Paladins are overbalanced compared to Warriors, the case can be made that Paladins are underpowered compared to pure casters.  If you rate the group power of classes from 1 to 15, Paladins might be a 9.  Just because Warriors are lower than that doesn't mean that you tear Paladins down.  <br />
<br />
The game has progressed and characters have improved directly in relation to how much they use magic to perform their functions.  Paladins have seen significant improvements over the last few expansions.  These improvements have been on par with other hybrids, but have fallen behind pure caster improvements.  Pure melee, meanwhile, have fallen way behind even the hybrids.  Is the solution then to tear down knights so that all tank classes are two expansions behind everyone else?<br />
<br />
It would seem that a more reasonable solution would be to honestly address pure melee for the first time in a few expansions.  That is what I took as the main thrust of Romidar's article.  Nowhere in that article does he suggest Paladins should retain the status quo of being the preferred tank.<br />

<br />
That was an outstanding article.  You Sir are a credit to your class. /salute<br />
<br />
What has been both interesting and sad to watch is the reaction of warriors to the increasing state of imbalance. Months ago, there were few warriors calling for knight nerfs; instead, they kept plugging away at Absor and SOE about their issues. For months, there was no response at all and there were many posts about the fact that Absor seemed to completely neglect melee boards (he really only comes by hybrid boards once in a blue moon, usually to shill for a new expansion, actually). More warriors started to become bitter and began to point to nerfing knights as an acceptable solution – after all, if we sucked and are their closest competitors, they would suck relatively less. <br />
<br />
I think your interpration is entirely accurate.  Hopefully SoE reads your article (as they have taken little lead from this board) and hears *enough* to understand where the frustration really comes from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As Bolesav explains, the entire point of my article and subsequent posts is that our spells shouldn't make us the superior choice. We should need to use our spells AS WE ARE CURRENTLY to MATCH a warrior, and that's now how the game is working.<br />
<br />
In terms of using Cease; Cease alone will not suffice to hold aggro. One Cease is less aggro than a snare, for example. When tanking more than one mob at once we MUST use the higher cost stuns because of the refresh time.<br />
<br />
As I posted above, though, I'm perfectly fine with nerfing spells such as Cease ASSUMING taunt is addressed - which is what I posted above.<br />
<br />
No, you won't see paladins with any form of mana regen (i.e., KEI+) call a med break very often at all. That's NOT because we have mana flowing out of ours, it's because we refrain from casting other spells if we're the tank. I don't heal or nuke or anything else. If we lack a haste casters (which we do at times), I have to spend 300 mana every 39 minutes on my own haste, and that actually does call downtime.<br />
<br />
I have about 3000 mana. Casting one Light of Nife is 400 mana, which drops me to 87% if I was FM before casting it. One Healing Wave of Prexus is 650 mana, so one cast will drop me to 78% mana from full. Our spells, outside of Cease, tend to be very expensive to cast, so if I'm called on to use them, then I do pay for it in downtime. With VoQ, Aura of the Crusader, FT4 and MC1, I'll start an adventure at full mana and end it around 30%-40% if I didn't have to cast ANYTHING but Cease, Force of Akilae and Force of Akera (I need to cast the latter two in order to tank unslowed mobs).<br />
<br />
We had an adventure in Miragul's two days go in which half of our enchanter went LD and never got back. My VoQ was dispelled two pulls later when I pulled a room full of goblin casters (no mez and can't possibly keep them all interrupted). After that, we had to stop several times so I could meditate - I could not maintain even my stuns. As we all know, it has become standard practice to get a KEI before adventuring. However, if you don't have an enchanter WITH you, there's a reasonable chance of losing it - not a great chance, but it's happened to me 3 times (doesn't seem to matter where KEI is in the buff order). I can tell you that I'm crippled when it happens. (This goes to show how much KEI has affeced balance, too.)<br />
<br />
Both paladins and warriors should be able to use taunt to do our jobs. We could back at, oh, 10th level. Wasn't perfect by any stretch, but mobs didn't hit that hard compared to player hitpoints AND players couldn't generate HUGE aggro so quickly. People weren't slowing mobs as the fight started. Mobs didn't need to be debuffed at the beginning of the fight, etc. All of that has changed and taunt has not. It worked out to the paladin's advantage that we had another means to control aggro.<br />
<br />
I do believe that if warriors controlled taunt as well as we do, there would be a slight preference towards warriors but we wouldn't be displaced as we once were. If I could use the taunt key to do my job, I could actually cast fewer stuns and spend mana on other spells - my second rating tanking would be countered by my spells (e.g., in a group with a cleric, Divine Arbitration + a group heal is a very effecting strategy; in a group with a druid instead of a cleric, my buffs would be useful). In other words, I belive that for casual players, at least, the relatively minor advantage in warrior tanking would be made up for by the paladin's relatively minor utility. I could, of course, be wrong, but paladin spell casting is much better now than we were completely outclassed and had really nothing to offer in that arena.<br />
<br />
In return, please stop people from assuming that the vast majority of Warriors have even the CHoS/SotB combo for aggro generation. They don't, and that makes Paladin stuns even more attractive to an XP group. And, when I combine this part of your post with this -<br />
<br />
I was specifically asking you not to make that error in your arguments. Neither of us can counter what the uninformed believe. Certainly neither in my article nor in my posts here did I assume that warriors would have any sort of aggro generating weapons - I believe that they are a crutch in the same way that Cease is a crutch. There'd be no need for either of them if Taunt worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A couple of comments.<br />
<br />
One problem with 'Fixing Taunt' is that do not knights also have Taunt? So would that not then free them up to use that mana bar for additional purposes? So how would that help the status of warriors improve? Paladins would still maintain aggro lock AT WILL, above and beyond the new taunt, and this would be a a lower cost than it is now.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The HP gap, I have zero confidence in seeing SoE fix it. The only way to truly fix it, would make EVERY class in the game scream and complain. And to illustrate that, lets look at Elemental Bracers. Warriors are very happy with these, they are incredible.. untill you look at the other classes...<br />
<br />
WAR Bracer == 145 hps<br />
PAL Bracer  == 135 Hps + 130 MANA!<br />
ENC Bracer == 130 Hp's + 135 MANA!<br />
<br />
If you want to fix this, the War bracer should have 200hps MINIMUM. There are dozens of examples of caster gear that has 100+hps/100+mana the array is incredible, yet warrior gear no where near compares. <br />
<br />
People say that 1 mana is not as valuable as 1 HP... sorry I COMPLETELY disagree. 1 MANA is worth much more than 20 HP's... Want an example?<br />
<br />
 Wizzy Nuke (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3339&amp;source=Live) this spell does 2740 damage WITH NO modifiers for crit/AA/focus, it can do upwards of 6.5K damage.<br />
<br />
Now take a TOP END TIME warrior with 200 dps! It takes him anywhere from 10 seconds to 30 seconds to even come close to this amount of damage to a mob. <br />
<br />
Now I am not saying we should outdamage a wizard.. But in that 10-30 seconds How mana HP's will that warrior expend? I am guessing it will be ALOT more than the 640 mana the wizard spent...<br />
<br />
So what is more valuable 640hps ( LESS than ONE HIT) or 640 mana?<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
the Utility question. Well since Paladins insist on telling us their UTILITY doesnt get them groups, and this author has said the same.. how will utility help warriors? help us be a more usefull unwanted 3rd class tank?<br />
<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
As to Nerfing Stuns, all of you warriors crying no it will hurt us, need to look past that GSoT, CHSD, BBoTE...<br />
<br />
And Ask, do stuns hurt us more than these weapons help us? The answer should be EXTREMELY OBVIOUS... If it wasn't would we be having this discusion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Actually, no, stuns help the 95+% of all warriors who will not get BoC/HG/BF/BoW/DBoW.  THAT is what you see if you look past the stun aggro weapons.  Currently, unless you have EB, stuns are all you have to do your job.<br />
<br />
Remove stun aggro completely and watch all the classes with castable stuns go wild with no repercussions - not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Remove stun aggro from resisted stuns and paladins simply pay the mana costs of using stuns that will work.  At the same time remove every single one of those stun weapons from warriors because they just became useless.  Enjoy tanking raid mobs with your Frostbringer!<br />
<br />
Does it suck that as a class we are essentially tied to a very small number of weapons?  Yes.  I'm not thrilled about it.  Guess what, even if taunt gets fixed, we'll still use these same weapons for the exact same reasons that we do now, because the have great aggro.  You hate stuns, want to see them nerfed out of existence?  That is your choice, but I think that if resisted stun aggro got nerfed out of existence tomorrow, within 2 weeks you'd be bitching about SKs and how aggro-lock from their darkness line screws up the game and makes warriors inferior.  <br />
<br />
The answer IS extremely obvious, stuns hurt us, but unless you have EB, they are worth every bit of the pain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is what the two options are, plain and simple -<br />
<br />
Option 1 - SoE fixes taunt, makes it ranged, makes it a dot, tells you when it fails, whatever your pet theory is on fixing taunt.  Thus, we mostly stop bitching about stun aggro, this becomes a non-issue.<br />
<br />
Option 2 - SoE doesn't fix taunt.  Resisted stun aggro continues to be the crutch that almost every pre-EB warrior relies on.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, we absolutely rely on resisted stun aggro and aggro on immune mobs.  CHoS - resisted or immune to essentially anything at 65.  GSoT - resisted or immune on most raid mobs which almost by nature are higher level than you and usually stun immune if they are older content.</div></div><hr />

Procs. I hate being chained to them but it seems to be the crutch SOE won't throw away so:<br />
<br />
1) Why can the Dev team not make a stun proc that is not identical to a spell, and code it so that the procs on certain weapons do not have a target level cap on them? Very few, aside from the most reactionary seem to support the fact that level 9 spells can be used as aggro on demand.<br />
<br />
2) Why can't the Dev team make high aggro procs without stuns and use say debuffs or DoTs? It wasn't that long ago that we considered Frostbringer, Willsapper, et al to be decent &quot;aggro&quot; proccing weaps. Why not design some procs with short duration/high aggro procs? You look in your exp group, and the #1 Aggro Gankers are things like Tash and Slow.<br />
<br />
Hell and what would be wrong with going in and actually retro-fitting some weapons with these procs, like they did with Time upgrades, and like they did when they introduced spell casting focus items? <br />
<br />
Back on subject now<br />
I have about 3000 mana. Casting one Light of Nife is 400 mana, which drops me to 87% if I was FM before casting it. One Healing Wave of Prexus is 650 mana, so one cast will drop me to 78% mana from full. Our spells, outside of Cease, tend to be very expensive to cast, so if I'm called on to use them, then I do pay for it in downtime. With VoQ, Aura of the Crusader, FT4 and MC1, I'll start an adventure at full mana and end it around 30%-40% if I didn't have to cast ANYTHING but Cease, Force of Akilae and Force of Akera (I need to cast the latter two in order to tank unslowed mobs). <br />
<br />
I think the above illustrates a lack or at least oversight on part of the issues with regards to paladins. You talk about yourself as a non-uber paladin, with limited mana pool/regen. What you fail to appreciate is that while you are non-uber, you have about 85-90% of the tanking abilities of an equivalent warrior in addition to this mana pool and casting ability. <br />
<br />
I also kinda disagree with the contention that knights are far out of order with other casters, because while they may not have quite the soloing ability, they don't fill the same role in a group. Its a red herring and I can see it as a bit of defensive posture to avoid a nerf (and I agree nerfing knights rather than building warriors a bit will just make us both suck). Knights are tanks and should be viewed as such. Perhaps with regards to tank stackability yes, all the tank classes need a boost but not in terms of functionality for their primary reason to exist.<br />
<br />
I agree with a fair chunk of what you said in your article but I feel you were a bit soft on the itemization issue (especially given the fact that there are more and better Knight Only weapons to compensate for the melee DPS inequities and weapon itemization appears to be where SOE has been floundering with regards to trying fix melee aggro).</div></div><hr />

My intent wasn't to garner sympathy - my intent was to show how NOT to try to balance classes, to show how a class that couldn't fulfill it's role changed so that it could.<br />

And, in any case, release through Kunark was about 18 months and the game has been out for 4 years - it was a signficant portion of the time that the game has been played.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 If taunt worked CORRECTLY, aggro weapons would become for Warriors what they are now for knights - BONUS, not the FEATURE of their tanking power. Evidently you don't see that because they cast for their aggro. IF taunt worked, as Romidar and I have said -<br />
<br />
 It frees Warriors from HAVING to have EB items.<br />
<br />
 It frees Knights from HAVING to have aggro generating spells loaded.<br />
<br />
 You could still ACQUIRE weapons with nice EB procs for additional aggro control, but you would not NEED them like the case is now.<br />

 Freedom from multigroup highend content raids or farming hundreds of K of plat to be competent at your job? I dunno HOW I ever thought that was a good idea. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Up until Kunark was released Paladins were generally as ubah as any other melee class. My Paladin was a god in LGuk with a Ghoulbane. He was so powerful and wanted in groups that he farmed the 2 Yaks and FBSS that I ultimately put on my Warrior.<br />
<br />
There were Warriors everywhere at this time. The result was endless PoHate raids (I went to about 75). Paladins and SK's were significantly less common than Warriors and were able to complete their suit of Valorium much more quickly.<br />
<br />
Players were not terribly HP concious during this period. That Diamondine Earring with 12 HP's was concidered uber. But so were Dwarven Work Boot, Chestplate of the Dark Flame, BiBS, FBSS, and a whole lot of stuff concidered trash today.<br />
<br />
While Kunark was a disaster for many Paladins, early EQ was not. Perhaps some of the newer players missed out on the days when a Paladin weilding a flaming sword was the most uber player on EVERY server.<br />

I'll admit that Romidar's History of Paladins is a better story though. I especially liked the part at the end when Scrooge lifted Tiny Tim in his arms and said he'd make it all better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Actually BB, its been mentioned before that resists shouldn't generate as much agro for all classes of spells.  That would partially solve the problem there.  <br />
<br />
A Shaman gains huge amounts of agro because they have to attempt the same spell multiple times due to resists.  If they never got big agro from the resists they might not draw it on thrid attempt.<br />
<br />
I've repeated this point so many times it gets old.  Go ahead and mess with agro on the Stun line.  It will just make me use it more.  This sounds selfish but if Cease disappeared from my spell book tomorrow I wouldn't notice since I haven't loaded it in months.  <br />
<br />
If stuns don't work the way I want to I can cast equally agro drawing things like heals (which never resist).  Its purely a difference in given skills.  As long as Paladins have more skills to activate against a monster a Paladin will have more control over a monster than a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 That depends.<br />
<br />
 If messing with that aggro means that you get to stun mobs for free, then yes, you'll use it more.<br />
<br />
 If messing with that aggro means that your stuns become not merely ineffectual hate generators and become bona fide useless, you'll cast it no more that you do True North in combat.<br />
<br />
 (Oh, and I'll take the post after post of Paladins on your board about the wonders of Cease and how they never unload it over your claim of not having used it in months. Hard cap of 35 plz.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then all that is necessary is to set trivial levels for all spells and then adjust aggro and mana cost to reflect the actual impact on the fight that a spells has when it is trivial, resisted, and sticks.<br />

Do you think paladin's should get large amounts of aggro off spells mob's are immune to, or B resist fully.<br />

Yes I know shaman's get aggro due to slow resist's. That's not the question, I am not asking about how any other class other then a paladin generates aggro. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Only someone who dont know eq will compare hps with mana.<br />
<br />
You know what the sense behind mana is or ? Mana should limit the casters offensiv power. Casters was allways able to make fast damage on cost that there offensiv power can run out of mana where melees not was limited but was able to make dmg over time. If you will balance it you need to limit the melees offensiv power to that we us stamina with every hit and when we run out of stamina we cant fight. Then 200mana+0stamina will be like 100hps and 100mana. But then the melee dont get a offensiv upgrade and the caster get a half defensiv and half offensiv upgrade which will be balanced. Or the warrior get 100hps+100stamina which will be the same upgrade then. The flaw here is that you cant compare both when the caster need this mana to be effectiv and the melee dont need anything else then hps.<br />
<br />
Allso it will make the endgame undoable when we have casters with 4k hps because they will low hps aggro every ae nuking mob and so raids will get hurt from it. Casters need 6k hps there.<br />

If not, then there's your answer.  Going by memory: When they modified disease counter aggro (when they added disease counters to slow to make it curable), they broke SK taunt - as a replacement, they got the taunt lines.<br />

I would expect roughly the same equivalence with stuns.</div></div><hr />

I dont have all the answers.  I can tell you the Ive never seen a paladin using spells that mobs were immune to.  Ive never seen a paladin my level (trust me, I know most of them on my server) that use cease... there are other other spells in our book out there, why waste time on useless ones?  Since your post is all about agro generation, i suggest logging on a Beastlord, then ask your questions again after laughing at all other classes in your group who tried taking agro from you while you were slowing and doing more dps than them at the same time.  If you think all paladins generate agro through stuns, youre reading from one that doesnt and I can tell you most of us dont stun to agro, taunt works fine most of the time.  I only cast them when mobs are 1) gating 2) CHing 3) running 4) hitting casters 5) when a heal seems late... and even then i still get resisted, interrupted, dont get agro.<br />
<br />
You said only about paladins... but all casters can agro at will somewhat.  Dont know what to say about the immune spell thing since Ive never used cease and cant think of why I would want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for not casting cease -- maybe YOU don't, but many of your classmates do. Ever read PoN? Try running a nerf cease proposal there and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Dalantia, when they nerfed disease cloud, we bitched, then we learned to cope by use of the half dozen other tools we had for aggro in our spell book. When they rebuilt the spell resist system from the ground up, they -also- rebuild the spell aggro system from the ground up, and those tools went out the window.  All of a sudden, our debuffs were no longer flagged as lifetaps, and the exponential aggro from that was gone. For that matter, so was the absurd aggro on health taps.<br />
<br />
As a community, it took shadow knights about a week  to learn how to taunt again. During that week, most of us made warriors look like the shining bastion of aggro generation. I remember being in tears, screaming at the guild warriors and paladins to just tank, because -I- certainly couldn't. We now generate aggro with snare, and in the appropriate places, with fear. Why? Because they work. Terror doesn't. The much vaunted 'pure hate' line simply doesn't get used unless fear lands. It can take 4-5 casts of Terror of Thule just to out aggro tash.<br />
<br />
Many shadow knights believe that melee damage and pure hate spells interact with each other in a non-linear fashion. E-blow works. It's a horrible, horrible bandaid fix, but it works. Why then, don't our terror spells?</div></div><hr />

I find it amusing where you came up with this, never have i said such a thing, NEVER.  PLEASE find where i said that.  what im saying is true to my knowledge. I am well aware of how much agro stuns will do, and how its not enough alone to get it off a mob already getting tanked.   You need a video or somethin or can you find a PAL on your server to prove it to you.  i'll be happy to get you one, better yet, get a friend warrior on CT server and it would be no problem for me to show another warrior that chaining stuns alone does not = agro.  Ive ran this test numerous times, and even had other paladins run the test in their own groups.  im well aware of how over exaggerated stuns are here, seems like theres not a page on these boards where stuns arent mentioned.<br />
<br />
  No, i hardly if ever go to PoN, ezboard sucks, though lots of good info there.  Maybe some paladins do cast cease, I dont know, like i said ive never seen one, and I told you from my experience ive never seen one use it, but it dont mean that we all use it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I'm one of those inbred backwater Paladins that uses Cease.  I use it mostly to pull, because it casts fast, generates enough aggro to get the mob headed my way, and has low mana cost.  I usually do not cast it again during a fight, as I can usually cast Force of Akilae as often as it refreshes without killing my mana pool and that tends to be enough to hold aggro in most situations.<br />
<br />
Is this an exploit?    Well, I don't expect to be banned for doing it, and if a GM entered the zone I wouldn't stop doing it for fear of being caught.  So from that point of view it is not an exploit.  Is it using a tool in a way that Verant (and now SOE) didn't intend, I believe so.<br />
<br />
Partha called for a hard cap on Cease so that it had no effect (stun or aggro) on mobs over level 35.  I believe that is uncalled for.  We get additional stuns as we level, but none of them replaces what Cease does.  Cease is designed to interrupt spell casting.  It is quick casting and short-lived stun perfect for interrupting CH, Gate, or whatever other spell you don't want to land on you.  We don't get any spell that does that until Divine Stun, which is an AA ability.  We don't get another fast-casting stun until Force of Akera at level 53 (which is very mana intensive) and Force of Akilae at 62.  <br />
<br />
Putting a hard cap on Cease on level 35+ mobs instead of 55+ mobs limits a Paladin's spell interrupt ability considerably from levels 40 – 61.  It is appropriate that our base level stuns work on mobs up to 55.<br />
<br />
The idea of removing aggro from resisted spells, or spells that a mob is immune to due to level is more worthy of discussion.  However, remving stun aggro from mobs too high to be affected would affect mid-level Paladins (50 – 61) much more than higher level Paladins.  So if the intent is to balance Warrior vs. Knight better, it doesn't make sense to do something that hits mostly 50 – 61 Paladins hard when the balance problems are just as bad from 62 – 65 +AA.  Perhaps it is part of a broader solution, but certainly is no panacea by itself.<br />

No Tank class can tank at a &quot;superb level&quot; without snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro. That as silly as saying you can be a surperb tank with 3000HPs.<br />

A Ranger gets silly and shots an arrow or an Shaman slows on incoming and they are some distance away from me and the mob makes a beeline for them. What do you suggest I do? Grow wings? A Paladin presses a button - thank you very much.<br />
<br />
A Warrior makes initial contact with a mob. 30 seconds no procs. Fails 4 Taunts in a row. What do you suppose happens when someone casts slow or CH?<br />
<br />
During a fight a Warrior is getting badly outdamaged and is only hanging on to aggro because of his Taunt button. What do you suppose happens when someone high on the Hate list nukes?<br />
<br />
Sure, stun alone won't guarantee total aggro lock, but a stun after a slow on incoming, or after a CH and the mob turns toward the Cleric absolutely helps when combined with the ability to use eary other aggro tool posessed by Warriors except for AE Taunt.<br />

 You yourself say you don't use Cease except on the INITAL pull. then you spam other stuns.<br />

 Then you say you don't want Cease nerfed, because none of the others 'replaces what Cease does'?<br />

 I'll also note that Paladins have MANY of the same options that a Warrior does to prevent Gates/CH's/Whathaveyou WITHOUT needing to use a level 9 spell. And you claim Warriors aren't that bad with the tools they have.<br />

Do you ever use disarm?  Or do you use kick/bash<br />
<br />
We dont get an upgrade to cease/desist. None of our spells have the same use those do. Akilae/akira come close (and is what i use) but they are different things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">You know,<br />
<br />
I can't believe how &quot;inside the box&quot; all you people think.  I already on this board showed how one could limit the effectiveness of stuns which cannot affect the target while continuing to enable their use as procs, and that's 'BEFORE the spell is cast&quot;.   Just like with pacify, you simply prevent the spell from being cast in the first place if it will not affect the target, no mana spent, no problem.   Procs aren't under the same ruleset, so wham we have the answer.<br />
<br />
The question is, is it the right answer?  I dont' know, makes sense to me, but I don't think it's really going to solve anything.<br />
<br />
Hate Dot, hate arrows, and a success/fail message on taunt, along with a moderate mitigation upgrade should do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Do you ever use disarm? Or do you use kick/bash <br />
<br />
 Those are skills. Not spells. There is a difference. :p <br />
<br />
 Second, of course Akilae and Akira are not the same thing. But outside of a couple of GLARING exceptions (Harmony being one) where it's more practical to use a lower level spell over a higher one. If Stuns follow the same logical progression, there's no harm to the Paladin class except it's not as easy as it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Do you ever use disarm? Or do you use kick/bash<br />
<br />
1. No, I don't use disarm, ever.  it's worthless<br />
<br />
2. Yes, i use kick all the time.   The last upgrade to kick I got was at level 1.   Kick was at one time an advantage that warriors had in that they had a '3rd&quot; attack without having to make a gear consideration, such as putting on a shield.   Now thanks to AA's, that's no longer a benefit for warriors, because it doesn't matter, since Paladins and SK's have the opportunity to have that 'extra attack' when wielding a 2hs.  <br />
<br />
It's more gayness in action</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Well Aeka it makes perfect sense to remove aggro as soon as a resonable level cap and mana cost is put on each spell. (BTW, this breakdown is far from perfect - I'm just making a point)<br />
<br />
Cease - up to 30<br />
Desist - up to 49<br />
Stun - up to 52<br />
Holy Might - up to 53<br />
Force - up to 54<br />
Force of Akera - up to 62<br />

Force of Akilae - up to 65 but still generates aggro beyond 65<br />
Quellious' Word of Serenity -  up to 65 but still generates aggro beyond 65<br />

Note that a scheme like this still preserves the ability to chain stuns with a macro (although the ability to stun lock mobs would be gone):<br />
<br />
/cast 6<br />
/cast 7<br />

at level 15-29 Spell Gem 6 is Cease and 7 is Desist<br />
at level 30-48 Spell Gem 6 is Desist and 7 is Stun<br />
at level 49-51 Spell Gem 6 is Stun and 7 is Holy Might<br />

What would be ended is the ability to get aggro &quot;on the cheap&quot; or to even use the Deepwater Bracer for 0 cost aggro and to always be able to build up aggro on Mezed mobs in 25% of the time it takes a Warrior to use the Taunt button and wait for it to pop before attacking.<br />
<br />
Yes, Warriors would still need snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro, but the chances are good that they would be adequate with a 4 second cast and 15 second refresh.<br />

Ten stuns (including Deep Water Bracer) all capable of generating aggro and half of them having  a mana cost below 70 ought to be a little embarassing.<br />

Actually a fair number of posts here and on PoN show that Cease is used by some higher level Paladins. Because the Cease and Desist actually stick on mobs up to level 55, aggro control is a virtual gimmie to mid-level Paladins. Cease allows you to build up aggro on mezed mobs without breaking mez and is very fast which is useful when you are trying to interrupt a mob that is trying to gate.<br />
<br />
Aeka,<br />
I agree high level Paladins can get along quite nicely using level appropriate spells. My post clearly states that the solution to the Warrior aggro problem is snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro.<br />
<br />
I pointed out the foolishness of 10 ways to cast stun at level 65, that mid-level Paladins can chain stun and have the spell stick for as little as 25 mana a cast, and that high level Paladins can continue using these low level spells for unrivaled aggro control at an insignificant mana cost.<br />
<br />
Yes, fixing this wouldn't have nearly as much as changing the mob type of 2 mobs in LDoN, fixing Warrior aggro, and putting Warriors on a separate mitigation table. But it might help convince players that SoE was in fact trying to balance the game rather than unremittantly increasing the power of Knights.<br />
<br />
While I don't advocate such a change, if SoE took a serious objective look at Knight/Warrior balance I suspect a few areas needing revision would be identified.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Battleblade,<br />
<br />
Is your issue that Paladins are able to lock aggro, or that it costs too little mana to do so?  I would have no problem with requiring Paladins to use level appropriate spells to stun with if they were available.  At first blush this might sound crazy, because as you have pointed out we have 10 ways to cast a stun at level 65.  But bear with me a minute.<br />
<br />
Paladins have 4 different types of stuns, 3 of which we care about<br />
<br />
We have interrupt stuns (Cease, and Divine Stun)<br />
We have 'vanilla' non-damaging stuns (Desist, Stun, Force of Akera, Force of Akilae)<br />
We have a damage stun (Holy Might) [We can live without damage stuns]<br />
We have knockback stuns (Force, Quellious Words of Tranquility, and Serenity, and Divine Stun has a little knockback too)<br />
<br />
Once one of these lines is introduced, it should not be taken away.  So making Cease top out against level 30 mobs, for example,  removes a Paladin's ability to have a fast casting interrupt type stun until getting Divine Stun with AAs.  Desist is not an upgrade to Cease, neither is any stun we get until the AA one.  If you wanted to cap Cease at 30, then I would suggest another spell with maybe a 30 mana cost to work on mobs up to 55 and a third with maybe a 60 mana cost to work on mobs up to 65.  <br />
<br />
Our non-damging 'vanilla' stuns lump up at the bottom end, but otherwise seem to work fine.  Clearly, Desist is upgraded by Stun so it would be easy to hard cap Desist on level 30 mobs (the level you get Stun).  <br />
<br />
Holy Might is a bit of an oddball, and most Paladins don't seem to mind that it never gets upgrades so I won't discuss upgrading it here.  <br />
<br />
The Knockback stuns scale pretty well now.  Force works on mobs up to 55, QWoT on mobs up to 61, and QWoS on mobs up to 65.<br />
<br />
So if the goal is to make Paladins use level appropriate stuns (with corresponding mana costs) to do their work with, would a lineup like this be acceptable?  In this case, all spells would have no effect whatever on mobs over their cap, aggro or otherwise<br />
<br />
Level 9 – Cease (15 mana), 1.0 second interrupt stun, caps at 30<br />

<br />
This would introduce two new interrupt stuns with progressively higher mana costs to put some mana bite into chain casting them.  Maybe even make CeaseII 45 mana and CeaseIII 90 mana.  If that were done, there would be no reason for Paladins to gripe about having level inappropriate stuns not affect the mob.  Or better yet, not even allow the level inappropriate stuns to be cast, a-la Pacify.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the level capping could be done with these specific stuns, instead of all stuns.  That would allow proc aggro from weapons with a stun-proc to remain unchanged.  Most of these weapons cast a variant of Stun, and not the actual spell Stun.  So capping the aggro on Paladin stuns could be done without ruining aggro weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Couple of things with that setup, Boleslav -<br />
<br />
 1. If you want to have a Cease II available, there should be a reassessment of the mana costs involved. An interrupt stun should logically cost MORE than a vanilla stun of the same level, because you have to balance the much lower cast time. Actually, looking at it from that perspective, the REAL problem with Cease is that it costs too little, rather than it's effect.<br />
<br />
 Point is, if you have a stun that is more efficient to use, it should either cost more or work less. <br />
<br />
<br />
 2. Cease III is a bad idea period. Stunning 65 mobs is WAY too content breaking, wouldn't you agree? :) <br />
<br />
 That being said, I'd agree with you on these points:<br />
<br />
 A. Level Cap the lower stuns.<br />
 B. Bring in a Cease II, and realign the mana costs or success rate on the Cease line of stuns to reflect their much lower cast time vis-a-vis other stuns.<br />
 C. Reduce aggro on resisted stuns.<br />
<br />
 Of course, we should chain these to a taunt upgrade, and introduce more parity among the tank classes. Oh, and Paladins should still get /shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Cease2 and Cease3 are completely unneeded. Stun (level 30) casts in 1.5 seconds, just like cease does now. That is plenty fast enough to work as an interrupt - in fact that was our primary interrupt for years. Cease 3 is unneeded because Force of Akera fills that role. It has a 1 second cast time and fast refresh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I rather intentionally set proposed level caps on stuns to insure Paladins did not have all 3 of the capabilities you mention available at all levels and to inhibit chain stunning.<br />
<br />
As things are now, having more than 2 stuns available is way to powerful as is having all three of the capabilities you outlined. By my way of thinking you should have 1 type of stun and only 1 available at any level.<br />
<br />
Yes, I object to stun locking. I also object to those wishing to be thought of as Tanks not using the Taunt button and aggro weapons to do the job of Tanking.<br />
<br />
Now if it was just a matter of Knights getting a Warrior's snap aggro and ranged aggro capability by another means then shrug. But as it stands these are capabilities not available to your melee parent class and they allow you to outperform him in his speciality, Tanking.<br />

same argument could be said about 75% slows (is there a higher slow?), 7.500hp heals from 1 class only, charming/mezzing high level mobs, being able to snare / root high level mobs, or maybe its just me, a number of things are quite over powering in EQ /shrug<br />

Using spells with virtually no mana cost, to gain a guaranteed aggro with no apparent penalty, from spells that do not affect the mobs.</div></div><hr />

Partha, think about this.  <br />
<br />
I put in a honest note here from what Ive personally experienced, saying how bards swarm kite in HoH for fat xp and then you come back shooting me down with my HONEST input, out of nowhere with your &quot;You make my job easier everyday&quot; comment.  <br />
<br />
THEN another confirms what I have witnessed, and rather than saying of how i was right and you were wrong, or that you were not aware that it was still possible, you make a useless comment with &quot;Lamini, youve trolled enoug.  Away with ye&quot;, along with yuor cute smiley thing as if youre some use putting a patch message info about that we all already knew about.  How bout you learn some manners and know when people are trying to offer their knowledge to others in their honesty instead of trying to shoot them down.  I dont troll, Ive never trolled, I have no reason to, ok?  Where you got the reason or idea that I do, i have no idea, but I want to let you know now that i dont just as I assume that you dont, ok?</div></div><hr />

Bard kiting and 75% slows may be unbalancing, but they are not things that affect Warrior groupability from a competing class. While I do think that yelling troll everytime someone responds to a difficult to justify Paladin advantage over Warriors with an irrelevancy is unfair, so is the Jedi Mind Trick.<br />
<br />
Now it may be that Paladin stuns are not a big deal, if you think so just say it. Just be ready to defend your position.<br />
<br />
Responding to someone's post about an imbalance issue by suggesting Warriors should get improved tradeskills or replying that manaburning dragons affect Warrior/Knight class balance IS kinda lamish. But I agree, yer not a troll (I think, gotta wonder about some 'o these pallies hehe - Actually Graal that was my cat's opinion, he just doesn't have an account).<br />

 I call you a troll because a spade is a shovel.<br />
<br />
 You came onto these boards stating that you never use Cease and that most Paladins your level don't. This is a statement in direct contradiction with not only anecdotal Warrior evidence, but threads on your OWN class board where Paladin after Paladin talks about the wonder of Cease as a pulling tool and a spike aggro tool.<br />
<br />
 Then, a little bit later on, you say:<br />
<br />
 id have to agree on fixing this stun thing. Using stuns that mobs are immune to should not be able to build up that much agro and is to me, an exploit, specially with the cheap mana costs. Its easy to see that it is class unbalancing. <br />
<br />
 Which is the same thing Warriors who USE their brain have been saying all along. But retuning it? You said<br />
<br />

<br />
 So, it's an exploit, but you don't want them to retune a spell you never use. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
 Furthermore, if you wanna talk about HoH kiting, Aeka only agreed with you that Bards kite up there. He also noted that they can't do the whole zone anymore, because of specific changes to the mobs in the zone. Before the patch, a Bard COULD PBAE the whole damn zone. After, it's down to parts. I'd call that a 'nerf'. Maybe not as much of one as we'd like, but still a 'nerf'.<br />
<br />
 By comparing your stuns to things that got changed, you make my job easier. Get it now?</div></div><hr />

our ONE stun with 30seconds recast time and stuns level 65+ mobs for 1 second is game breaking but a bard getting 40% of an AA per swarm in HoH is not (4-5% aaxp / mob X 8 = 40%aa max).<br />

<br />
 Who said anything about Divine Stun? I was addressing Boleslav's wish for a NEW spell that COULD stun 65 mobs. Had you been actually following the thread rather than doing a 'find all' on your name, you'd have seen this.<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, if you knew anything about Bards, they'll tell you that once you hit 65, There's maybe, what, half a dozen GOOD XP swarm camps in game. Having places at high levels where it's viable is no more game breaking than Druids in UP quadding to their little heart's content.<br />
<br />
 (BTW I notice you say nothing about quadding, so I assume your broken range for xp is between 20 and 40% of an AA point.)<br />

 Re: reading your own class boards, it's obvious you do yourself a great disservice by not doing so. Not only do you learn things about the class that you didn't know or only half understood, it also allows you to come onto, say, Warrior boards, and look like you know what you're talking about. Notice that I don't call Romidar, Graal, Aeka, Boleslav, and most other Paladins who come here trolls........even though they disagree with me in a lot of cases? I don't call them troll because at least they got their shit firmed up.</div></div><hr />

Nothing ive said here is incorrect, so if you could stop with your &quot;homework&quot; and &quot;firmed up&quot; comments.  There was a bit of confusion here was all with you getting my comments involved with others not related.</div></div><hr />
