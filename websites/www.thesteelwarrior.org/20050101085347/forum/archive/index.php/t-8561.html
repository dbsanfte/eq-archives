As for AA cost I think that these AAs will have to have insanely high costs.  I would expect the improved LR/ID aas to cost 4/8/12/16/20 per rank or so like sturdiness.  Also many of the AA skills re upgrades to GoD skills so the costs are definately going to be higher IMO.  Since sinister strikes costs 15 points improved sinister strikes will probably be 20-30 points and such.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they have to be high costs, or they have to nerf XP across the board.<br />
<br />
And since we all know that no one wants XP nerfed, be prepared for AA's at 10 a rank or some shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the warrior stuff... eh... only see a few good ones there.  Another hit point one to go with it would be nice.<br />
<br />
Expect high AA costs given the exp giveaway that places like KT are (3-4% AA per kill).  Lines that don't have GoD abilities as pre reqs might not start too bad, but they'll go up fast just like GoD.  Like the last time we could get more combat agility, it was 3 pts per rank.  Now it'll probably be 3/6/9/12/15 or maybe 4/8/12.  I'm not sure how many ranks there are.<br />
<br />
The way exp is done in existing grind zones kind of fits that model, so I figure it will continue.  If you're more casual, you can get exp fast enough to reasonably earn the lower ranks of GoD AAs.  If you're a more hardcore and raid oriented player, you can get to the more expensive ranks because you have access to high exp zones.</div></div><hr />

Those are great changes along with increased Sinister Strikes (in my view, Sinister Strikes is the most underrated GoD AA there is, it's worth every AA you spend on it).<br />
<br />
Resolute Difiance is gonna be fantastic when it comes to Soloing for those crucial moments where you're cutting it close, as well as making you completely unmezzable in PvP I already like Warlord's Tenacity 3, which is again, totally underrated because it's use is completely misunderstood.<br />
<br />
Press the Attack will be *miraculous* when it comes to mob positioning, particularly on raid encounters if the refresh is short enough that it allows us to circumvent mob push.</div></div><hr />

The point of the Dual Wield AA's are simple, they're allowing you to sort of do away with many of the drawbacks of Dual Wielding<br />
I think that's a valid viewpoint. Another is that these drawbacks were both put in the game by the vendor and Warriors pointed out that they were not a burden Knights faced. SoE is willing to remove them - not mind you as a fix (which is what this really is), but as an AA ability. To my mind this is simular to &quot;selling&quot; an AA ability that made Furious Bash actually be a benefit to Warriors instead of doing the right thing and fixing it.<br />
<br />
The other AA abilities you note are, as you indicate, actual improvements to the Warrior class.<br />

So now you don't have to worry about taking more ripostes/DS damage as well (I think maxing out the prevent riposte thing will prevent ripostes completely in the offhand).  Exactly what's wrong?  For the record, most Knight 1H weapons that are so wonderful in ratio suck for aggro because they've useless procs so far as aggro is considered (Light of Marr, lifetaps, etc).</div></div><hr />

1. Warriors don't get anything like Diamond Tipped War Javalin or a reasonable selection of really high quality 2H aggro weapons from PoTime+. 2H high DPS/aggro setups aren't a viable choice for Warriors.<br />
<br />
2. Warrior advanced one hand aggro Weapons do not have the kind of ratios of Knight 1Hdrs. Lets remember Knights are not dependent on aggro procs to obtain aggro and with FT25 in the future, mana is hardly going to be an issue. FB shields do not seem to benefit Warriors as much as Knights - we don't &quot;cast spells&quot;. Even assuming Warrior get the change to block with a Shield, the reduced aggro proc rate makes tanking with a shield a less attractive choice for Warriors than Knights. 1H + Shield high DPS/aggro setups aren't a particularly attractive choice for Warriors.<br />
<br />
3. Having more or less herded Warriors into DW aggro, two disadvantage that affect Warriors more than any other class are not eased, but instead are treated as Warrior Advancement and for ?? plus ?? AA are repaired.<br />
<br />
Warriors didn't ask SoE to not provide a range of 2H high DPS aggro weapons with a procratemod sufficent for us to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
We didn't ask for 1H aggro Weapons with tepid DPS without a procratemod sufficent for us to hold aggro. Nor did we ask them not to make shields or shield bashing replace the aggro lost by not weilding an offhand aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
We got DWing aggro weapons with damage from the offhand weapon's causing us to take more DS and repostes. Knights can afford to tan with a shield and will probably get a chance to block with shields, yet our aggro offhanders don't typically have Improve Parry 1, 2, or 3 (or did we get such things and I missed it). Instead, the disadvantages thrust upon us are something we can &quot;elect&quot; to cure by grinding AA.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what's wrong.<br />
<br />
Mind you I won't quit the game over it, but I'm not afraid to criticise SoE when I think they have earned criticism.<br />
<br />
Sure, this is fine if SoE:<br />
1. Provides Warriors with high DPS 2H aggro weapons and allow Warriors 2H Bash with a chance of stunning or doing a Cripple (primarily for aggro) and a high procratemod.<br />
<br />
2. Provide higher DPS primary aggro weapons with an elevated procratemod and shields with an aggro multiplier and shield bash with a chance to stun or doing a Cripple (for aggro and to lower the amount of DPS the primary weapon would need to deliver).<br />
<br />
3. Offhand aggro weapons with Improved Parry 1, 2, or 3. (They can produce modest DPS so that total DPS DWing remains fairly constant.)<br />
<br />
That way we'd have a range of aggro alternatives insted of being fulnneled into 1 choice and be told the disadvantages of that &quot;choice&quot; is something we can remove by grinding AA.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what's wrong. I don't want to rain on our parade so I'll drop this, but I don't carry water for SoE, so ya can't expect me to say &quot;Wow!!! Whee!!&quot; when they give us a &quot;Make Your Own Bandaid&quot; kit.<br />

Well we will have to disagree on this then. Personally I think its great that we now get the option to grind some AA and remove all ripostes from our offhand.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell the only valid objection one could have to these new AAs, is that once again, the balance between 1-hand and 2-hand weapons is tipped. This time in favor of 1-hand weapons(or 1-hand+shield). Once your offhand no longer is getting riposted, then with the current available warrior 2-hand weapons available there is no reason to use a 2-hander, since you will have lower HP, AC and less procs(only 1 proc slot).<br />
<br />
However this IS something they can fix through itemization if they choose. They just have to up the ratios on the 2 hand weapons, and increase the HP/AC on them, so that it matches the hp/ac you can get from 2 similar class 1-hand weapons. SoE might also consider giving 2hand weapons 2 augment slots for procs(I dont know if this is technically possible though) OR simply increase the procrate for 2-hand warrior weapons by 50-100%.<br />
<br />
Having said all this, I have no problem with 1-hand weapons being the superior choice. Gives you more choices of what to wield, and allows for incremental gear upgrades as you swap weapons around etc etc, and its plain more fun to see a steady stream of hits/procs flying across your screen :)</div></div><hr />

Man, I got a Lodestar and am *extremely* pleased with it's performance as a DPS weapon that I can put in my range when tanking, when auged with a 30AC aug it makes an 80AC range item... BONUS.  I dont' know what you're thinking, particularly in that Lodestar is WAY easier to get than Diamond Tipped.  Furthermore, in order to make 2h even remotely effective, you gotta spend a boatload of AA&quot;s anyhow.  Why having a different standard for making 2h weapons effective offensively, and making 1h weapons effective defensively is a little odd to me.<br />

<br />
Either dual wield is broken (due to ripostes and DS's) and should be fixed for FREE, or it is balanced and these AA's increase the power of one side of a balanced equation. Personally I think it is quite well balanced.  DW=higher aggro and more damage taken, 2h-ed=lower aggro (but sufficient) and less damage taken. During our mid-PoP progression it makes sense to take a trip into 2h-ed use as there are some very nice ones available and we aren't such high HP/AC that the reduced ripostes isn't a decent factor in our survvability and the success of raids. Later we move back to dual-wielding as we have vastly higher HP and AC stats and this is no longer such a problem.<br />
<br />
If there is an issue that the increased 'risk' of dual wielding is greater than the benefit of the extra aggro then a better solution than offering these AA's to further narrow the gap between the two choices would, in my opinion, be to itemise more higher delay 1h-ers. It seems pretty much every 1h-er since time began is around 20 delay. Add more in the 30-ish delay range.<br />
<br />
The shield blocking AA seems a bad idea to me. I can see uses for it - grab that add and kite it off or pull a named away so clerics can camp while having a better chance of living long enough to be successful. Also if it works with the /shield command it could come in very handy. However if it is useful then it's yet another item to pay DKP for, yet another item to augment and knights will be pissed when we outbid them on that uber shield they really would put to good use full time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it's broken at all,  it's the player's choice, there are in the planes good choices of 1handers and 2handers to get aggro, do what you want, make high aggro with risks or less with no risk.<br />
<br />
Also if it works with the /shield command it could come in very handy. However if it is useful then it's yet another item to pay DKP for, yet another item to augment and knights will be pissed when we outbid them on that uber shield they really would put to good use full time. <br />
<br />
That's why in pop there was warrior only shield, the firsts series of FB items were warrior only, then no problem with knights, DKP have nothing to do with the game, it's a player notion, and all guilds doesn't use this system.</div></div><hr />

Some of the drawbacks you will be able to minimize through AA's.   That's like saying that tanking is &quot;broken&quot; because 60AA's will buy you 500hp.   No, it enhances an ability that works well already.   You can tank just fine without Sturdiness but you can tank better with it.   You can dual wield and survive just fine without the new AA's, and you'll be able to dual wield more effectively with them.</div></div><hr />

I would agree if there was a &quot;good intention&quot; effort to balance advantages/disadvantages in the first place.<br />
<br />
There are more than one disadvantage to each aggro system - 2H, DW, weapon and shield. I don't think Warriors are at all convinced the advantages and disadvantages are in fact well thought out and balanced.<br />
<br />
I've pointed out that as we mudflate, SoE could in fact provide Warriors with higher Knight eqivilent ratio primary 1Hdrs (a needed adjustment to make weapon and shield equally attractive to Knights and Warriors when tanking) providing that future Warrior secondary weapons hold the DMG/DLY ratio static and secondary weapon advancement is achieved by having for example a Parry 1, 2, or 3 effect (does this make more sence than putting Parry 1 ,2, 3 on shoulders or an earring??).<br />
<br />
I've pointed out that there aren't a lot of 2H high DPS aggro weapons for Warriors EP+ that compete with for example a Paladin with a Diamond Tipped War Javalin (or their multitude of EP+ 2Hdrs) plus stuns for aggro. Lodestar doesn't have an aggro proc, neh?<br />
<br />
I've pointed out that with shields providing a chance to block, that giving Warriors (for AA) 2H Bash and Shield Bash with an enhanced chance to stun for 0.0, would ease the Warrior only reduction in the rate of aggro event generation that make weapon plus shield and 2Hdr aggro setups less generally used.<br />
<br />
I've suggested how itemization and abilities (Bash stun) could address some Warrior Issues as distinquished from Warrior Advancement, which is to my mind what Alternate Advancement should be used to accomplish - a fine distinction.<br />
<br />
I tend to agree that DW is not broken and these two AA abilites are icing on the cake. However I don't accept the idea that the disadvantages/advantages of 2H, DW, weapon and shield aggro setups are currently balanced, equally viable, or should be addressed with AA abilites in general.<br />
<br />
These abilites, even if just icing on the cake, do not even by your logic address more significant outstanding issues with 2H, DW, weapon and shield aggro setups. In short (giggle), I expect to see Warrior Advancement addressed by AA's, not previously existing unresolved issues nor icing on the cake when the cake hasn't been baked yet.<br />
<br />
BTW, I hope you realize I'm not assaulting your thinking about this, but I am raising &quot;issues&quot;. I realize EQ is a game and AA Abilites are merely toys, but at the same time I have Swiss watchmaker sensibilities and these two AA abilities seem to me to be frivolous in the overall 2H, DW, weapon and shield aggro setup advantage/disadvantage context.<br />

<br />
What does it have to do with anything? If a caster got agro on a mob that can nail him down (talking about 5k+hp) in 2 hits, there is a problem with agro, its either the caster fault or the tank, but doesnt have anything to do with everyone getting the same mitigation and avoidance bonuses.<br />
<br />
By giving everyone the same bonuses, you are not widening the mitigation/avoidance gap between a tank and the rest of the classes, which would be logical. Im not saying you shouldnt give em mitigation/avoidance bonuses, but let them get 3 out of the 5 levels of it (taking ID/LR as example), cause that's logical, I dont see we are &quot;sharing&quot; any of the casters Archtypes AAs, but they do get our tanking AAs with their full levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it keeps them alive, fine, less death, less CR, less downtime. If it doesn't then its a waste of time for them. I don't understand, to be honest of what the complaint about having silk classes get mitigation and avoidence. I mean, its not OUR AA they are spending, right? Having your best Enc buddy stay alive for another 2 seconds isn't that much of a crime, right? Geez. <br />
<br />
If your talking about uniquness, then it should be innate instead of having to spend AA on it. As for knights getting it, I don't see a problem either. Its slightly annoying, but quite frankly, without those AA's they'll get splattered on most high end xp mobs, and THEN we'll really hear complaints. Again, its not my AA they are spending.</div></div><hr />
