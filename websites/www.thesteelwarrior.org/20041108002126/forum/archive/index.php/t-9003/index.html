The answer is a definite &quot;maybe&quot;.  If you plan to twink your warrior with top of the line bazaar gear, then yes ... it would be real easy to spend 1M plat or more for top of the line bazaar gear.  If you plan to farm all the gear yourself then it won't really be that expensive, just time consuming.<br />
<br />
Do you have a regular group/guild that you play with?  If so, then as long as your equipment/AA's are suitable for the level of content that your group is doing then you'll be ok.  If you plan to start a warrior tomorrow and be tanking GoD content in a month then you will be in for one helluva surprise, no matter how much money you spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And you can get by with some money and work in LDoN. The droga pair + 2 anger augs will probably hold agro well enough for a while to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sommy25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to sol a clean the goblins sell to druid ring and reapeat. because the ice giants are  camped 24/7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, warrior is a gear dependant and therefore plat or time dependant class.  A DPS caster (wizard) can get by with a mediocre mana pool and some mod-rods/KEI, a warrior however is known by his ability to hold aggro and to take damage, both of which take $$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gundahar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't suggest you to make a warr and I'm playing one for nearly 5 years. If you become maintank in a raidguild and get all the gear it's fine. You have a key-role, people will prefer you in groups and stuff. But if you are not that lucky or rather playing casual, not willing to dedicate a huge amount of time to the game - you are screwed. This class is all about gear /stats and you're more dependent than everyone else on it for being considered useful.<br />
<br />
Not to get me wrong, I like my warr and wouldn't play anything else but it's a hard way and I saw many good guys giving up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, to echo others... the warrior class is extraordinarily gear dependent which means it's expensive one way or another (lots of plat and/or lots of gear drops needed to be effective).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Warriors are definitely high maintenance when it comes to gear requirements.  To remain a viable tank with people at whatever level you're playing you need constant gear upgrades either through buyable loot or getting drops from xp groups or raids.  That requires either lots of money or lots of time invested.</div></div><hr />
