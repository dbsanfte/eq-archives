What really pisses me off is lvl 60+ people who dont understand such simple concepts such as:<br />
If your not the tank or pulling dont &quot;explore&quot;<br />
Dont sit near doorways to other rooms we havent cleared yet<br />
AE mez is a spell you should have gotten ages ago <br />
If you can, SNARE<br />
It seams like for a lot of people once ya hit that instanced dungeon the brain goes on a holiday.<br />
Now these are mostly complaints Ive heard from friends,but I have had a couple of newb chanters myself.</div></div><hr />

I've had some really good pickup groups lately, and some that made me wonder why anyone would let a mentally deficient 8 year old play an online roleplaying game targeted for teenagers and adults.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah Yes...and as of late chanters seam to be frequently ebayed.<br />
When I get asked during an adventure &quot;will i still get regular exp when i have my exp slider set to 100% AA&quot; scares me for the rest of the crawl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a group the other night that some of my friends and I put together. The only person we sent out a true &quot;cold call&quot; to was the chanter. After going through a whole dungeon with her slowing at 60% health and using only her AE mezz, we finally said to her &quot;You know you have single target mezzes, too, right?&quot; The following silence was deafening...</div></div><hr />

 etc to see what chanters are on the market.When the come off I know to watch out for &quot;ebayers&quot; lfg soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fattank</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm new to the board, but i might as well jump right in =)<br />
<br />
main is a 65 mage and i solo'd 8-53 then mostly did pickup groups all the way.<br />
ALL of the pickup groups i've been in have won with a ton of time left (NRo, EC, EF w/ mage, EF w/ war) but with my guild we won with about 12 seconds left on an assasinate mission. one reason was our bard was pulling singles but chain pulling (which is fine) then waited on AFK cleric. Ranger (guild leader) got sick of waiting, went into next room, pulled 5 mobs. me and shammy lived, everyone else died. me and shammy cleared most of the dungeon duo while cleric ran from _Temple of Veeshan_ to rez everyone...<br />
<br />
mage has a 30 sec mez vs summoned only, and i was the whole crowd control team, since the bard couldnt mez the mobs.<br />
<br />
i sorta did a bad thing with my warrior (Fattank TruffelShuffel). In everfrost 1 of the flying monkeys sorta charmed me and i killed half my group =P took em a while to kill the monkey without me, considering im fairly well twinked i sorta owned em =P<br />
<br />
most of the time LDON is cake, but when its bad... its BAD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I love is some dildo that gets a low collection mission (21-23) after specifically being told not to, cause &quot;it's a low number so it'll be easier!&quot;<br />
<br />
High collections I like. 28-30 items are fun to do, since it's basically a slaughter on steroids, with an item dropping off every 2nd or 3rd mob, but the low ones... they're a pain. Like 1 in 7 drop rate sometimes, especially with the larger dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Collections just suck period...Assasinate and Slaughter are the way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did my first rescue mission last night, we won with a half hour remaining.  Maybe we were lucky but based on that one experience, I'd put rescue right up there with slaughter and assassinate.<br />
<br />
I have yet to win collections.  We have completed it in overtime but never in the first 90 minutes.  We killed almost 100 mobs one time and still didn't get enough drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rescue really depend of the dongeon you are in. <br />
<br />
There is one in miragul that is a loooooong hallway... and after a full hour of killing you have two directions IN THE SAME WAY. If you dont have a rogue to scout and choose the wrong way, you lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took 25 collection last night.<br />
<br />
Killed about 100 mobs in 90 minutes.<br />
<br />
Was still 2 short.<br />
<br />
The collection quests need freaking TUNING!<br />
<br />
God dam that is sloppy coding.<br />
<br />
Considering you can kill about half that many mobs and win a slaughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buford</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Collections just suck I'm 1/4 atm, I'll never do one again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Collections have &quot;funny math&quot;.  Depending on the theme you may have too many monsters and not enough drops for Collection to work right.<br />
<br />
I assumed problems like this would crop up and SOE would have to tweak them.  Right now I'm lery of Collections because of this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warram</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still like the time I cleared an entire dungeon sans 2 mobs and lost on a collection. <br />
<br />
When you tell the group, &quot;Track for more mobs, we only got 1 more capsule.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then the druid tells the group, &quot;I don't see any on track&quot;<br />
<br />
You say, &quot;Don't see any...what&quot;<br />
<br />
Druid tells group, &quot;Anything. At all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something is wrong.</div></div><hr />
