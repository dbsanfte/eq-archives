<br />
I have a litle problem with the particle effects of some weapons. I cannot see them anymore.<br />
<br />
I cannot see effect on: war epic, bard epic, druid epic, cleric epic for example<br />
I can see effect on:  Ranger epic, those blinking shields etc.<br />
<br />
I just cannot find out what is wrong. I have all effects for players turned on in the options window. I have 2 computers with 2 different Graphic cards (ATI radeon 9600 / NVidia Geforce XY) and both machines have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone has an idea what the reason is and can give me a hint.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Elfried</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly...once upon a time I had a similar problem...&quot;/showspelleffects on&quot; worked for me.  This is independent of the interface options...<br />

Give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Googlywoogly</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the exact same problem.  Also can't see some eviromental effects, such as the  lights in the lamp posts in PoK, fires in LDoN's, those summoned flaming swords for pets, waterfall you see when running to BoT, epic effects,  et. al..<br />
<br />
To fix it I turn off enviromental effects and player effects in the display options, zone, turn them back to high, then zone again.  This fixes it for the current session, but I have to do this everytime I log into the game.<br />
<br />
Have no clue what causes this, and wish I had a perm fix, but the above works for me.</div></div><hr />
