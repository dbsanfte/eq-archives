<br />
I dual wield Bloodfrenzy//SEM and I've been giving LDoN augments a thought lately. Sadly I'm not blessed with the elusive Blade of War. ;)<br />
<br />
I feel that my aggro and dps are good enough so instead of going with the much praised Ykesha for my Bloodfrenzy I've been leaning towards using Guard III but I'd like to know someone's experience of this proc. <br />
<br />
As for my SEM I've thought to get Ykesha.<br />
<br />
I'm leaning towards these 2 proc augments I just can't decide<br />
in which hand to put Guard III and which to put Ykesha.<br />
<br />
I don't know how much damage Guard III mitigates up to nor the general proc rate offhand but I'd like it to go off enough to stay up decently at least in exp groups. <br />
<br />
So I wondered whether putting it in the offhand would be enough and therefore I could put Ykesha in mainhand for more aggro and damage which is nothing to complain about but I consider neither an issue.<br />
<br />
I'd like feedback from someone with experience of the Guard III proc and not just &quot;YKESHA YKESHA YKESHA&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Guard 3 eliminates 5% of all dmg take up to 150 dmg.  This is basically 1 round of any elemental + mob.  I had mirror 1 on my blade of war just to play with it in pvp a bit but it was so damn annoying taking up a buff slot ( and fucked me tanking time tz once) that i took it off and added ykesha.  Since they all add 4ish dps max from the parses assuming they all land for full i would just as soon add an aggro proc.  Keeping aggro instead of mob aggroing shm or ench is probably &gt; than the 4% dps you gain from a dmg proc and the 150 dmg you save with guard 3+ loss of one controlable buff slot.</div></div><hr />

And damn that bunny on your magelo reminded me of that movie Donnie Darko now that was a weird movie.</div></div><hr />

You can never have enough!  *lust*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solotheus</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't the concept of maybe just MAYBE some extra utility for our simple class allure you at all? :p<br />
<br />
And just for the record I definitly would want more utility from something other than procs, but if procs can supply some and are attainable, great!</div></div><hr />
