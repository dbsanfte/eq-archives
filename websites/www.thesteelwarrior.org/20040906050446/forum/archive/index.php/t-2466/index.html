<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">An excerpt from Rich Waters during the recent Live Chat:<br />
<br />
&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt; *Polymer* Are there new disciplines for non casters coming out with LDoN?<br />
&lt;Hartsman-SOE&gt;  (Rich is grabbing this one...)<br />
&lt;Rwaters-SOE&gt; New features that cover class balance (like disciplines) are the kind of things we try not to tie to expansions. We definitely feel that disciplines need some updates and improvements, and it's something we'll be doing as a free live update instead of expecting you to buy a box to balance your class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess that would mean no upgrades with LDoN, so it will not be before LDoN is out and patched up to a fair degree of stability.<br />
I just hope SOE has not planned another expansion in the next year, because then we might have to wait even longer.</div></div><hr />

I'm a long term player, I can wait.  At least it sounds like something is in the works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as in, We will be doing....<br />
<br />
as in, <br />
We are planning in planning to look into the plan of looking into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
But unlinking the different disciplines and tweaking the reuse times on each could help us a LOT....<br />
<br />
And they better add in some 60-65 disciplines gdi!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It comes across to me, in my current cynical frame of mind, as an excuse for not including balance improvements in the expansion.  If they were going to introduce these fixes prior to LDoN, then that would be a plus.  But it appears fairly obvious that they intend on doing them some unknown time after the release of LDoN, which might mean soon after, or a long time after, or never but they keep us hoping.<br />
<br />
I am not reassured.</div></div><hr />

Warriors and Druids will be deleted in the next patch, SOE has deemed them worthless...Pallys and SK's will get all warrior abilities..oh NM they have them already and wizzys will get all druid abilits...um NM...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">and Druids <br />
<br />
Uh, I don't see much wrong with the druid class.  They are second only to clerics in healing.  Have a fairly powerful charm, though it only works on animals (but allows them to solo PoS, Tactics, or just add great dps to groups in those zones).  Nuke as good as a mage.  Druids in my guild have no problem with where they are at as a class, and I've seen no reasons why they should, at least at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the way Druids and Clerics are, should be taken as an example of how Specialist/non specialist classes should relate.<br />
<br />
The cleric is by far the prefered class for groups.<br />
Yet it doesnt stop druids from getting groups.<br />
<br />
I guess druids just know how to play their class....<br />
whereas knights need that incredibly overpowered advantage to get groups....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess druids just know how to play their class....<br />
If you look at the path of heal spell upgrades for druids they really arent capable of filling that main healer role at all till they hit 58.  To me this suggests that the druid CH spell was added to give them more of a raid role than to take the healer spot from clerics in XP groups.<br />
<br />
So what you end up with is clerics who have sat on their arse in groups as main healers for 60+ levels vs druids who have mostly kited / quadded their way from level 35ish when thier heals spells no longer really cut it till 58 when they get their CH.<br />
<br />
I think its fair to say that spell selection aside most clerics are going to have alot more experience when it comes to timing heals and stuff than most druids.  Ofcourse by the number of successful boxed clerics out there we all know that this isnt the hardest job to do well and as such most druids get the hang of it pretty well pretty quickly, but you can't expect to be able to grab a 58 druid for your PoV group and have them be an expect on CH timing while a 56 cleric may do the job just fine.  I don't think you can just sum it up as &quot;druids just know how to play their class&quot; because until level 58 being main healer isn't a part of their class.<br />
<br />
Off topic rant over. :p</div></div><hr />

I was discussing this with a friend recently when we had a Druid for our healer at PoV Inner the other day. Quite frankly he sucked, multiple deaths, 30% total HP heals, etc. The group had a collective sigh of relief when he was called to a raid and found us a cleric replacement.<br />
<br />
58 Levels of kiting, nuking, dotting, buffing etc. does not a cleric make. Most clerics learn at level 40 how to make the most mana effecient use of CH, and most warriors for that matter too, since so many bot a cleric. <br />
<br />
When a PoV mob resists the slow, the poor shammy is getting beaten on at full tilt, and the druid begins casting his CH when the shammy is at 30%.... you know something is wrong.<br />
<br />
Granted, there are several druids in my guild that I trust implicitly to be my main healer in an exp group. It's gonna vary from person to person, and a Druid is a better choice than a dr00d. :p <br />
<br />
But yes,<br />
<br />
DRUIDS ARE FINE THE WAY THEY ARE! :D</div></div><hr />
