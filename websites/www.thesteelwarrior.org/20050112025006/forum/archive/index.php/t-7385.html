Just discovered he can't wear Cultural Armor.   Wondering if I should scrap working on the smithing skills.  Wondering if I even need to start a new Dwarf warrior.  Is it just a penalty to be Agnostic as a dwarven warrior?   I see no benefit at all.<br />

I'm still running around with the Newbie warrior armor.  I refuse to accept gifts, and have no other toons with which to twink.  Not a member of a guild, yet, but I think I'm ready to join one, if they can advise me.  I'd worked on Blacksmithing so I could make myself some armor that's slightly better than the newbie armor, but now it appears my future potential is quite limited.<br />

Am interested in hearing from anyone who can help a newb pull himself up by the bootstraps....</div></div><hr />

Repeat cycle untill you start raiding things and have access to the no-drop stuff.<br />

<br />
You don't need cultural armor, it is only a step, that you can bypass, until you get better armor.</div></div><hr />

Personaly I wouldn't start over because of a suit of armour. I play a lizard warrior and it has given me some trouple, armour wise. I haven't considered picking another race because that.<br />
<br />
It looks like you're struggling with your first character? Consider collecting some plat and make a trip to the bazaar. You should be able to find yourself a suit of budget armour there. You realy shouldn't be wearing your newbie armour at level 30.</div></div><hr />

The problem with fighting: everyone expects a warrior at lvl 30 to have a decent AC so they can weather attacks.  With my current AC = 505, I tax the mana of the Clerics.  I've been down to &lt;5% health on many a mission already, and it's not just because my healers are a bit slow sometimes- it's also because of pitiful armor.     I'd rather not put a group into danger by being an MT that can't handle some melee.  So I'll end up running around, killing green enemies in low-level soloing just to get the cash to buy armor?  Is that really my best option at this point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Selling tradeskill drops is by far the quickest way to make money at low levels, and as mentioned above you will be able to make armour for yourself once your skill gets higher up with the non-imbued versions of dorf plate.<br />
<br />
The armour you are looking at smithing at the moment is good for your level, but you could probably come by equivilent or even better in the bazaar for very reasonable prices.<br />
<br />
You could also try questing some, take a look at http://everquest.allakhazam.com and read up about the crafted armour quests.<br />
<br />
In the Bazaar have a look for Crustacean armour, crafted armour and Ry`gor armour.  Also do a search on dwarf warrior gear with hit points, put in the price you can afford and see what is available for each slot, gear with high +hp is good to get.<br />
<br />
Another thing to do is head over to http://www.magelo.com and create a profile for your character.  Post it here and Im sure you'll get lots of advice on where to make the best improvements to your gear.<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier smithed armour is a stepping stone to you as you gear up and there are several other paths you can take, as long as you are having fun with your character thats whats important.  Level 30 isn't too far along to re-roll your character if thats what you want to do, but in the long run you wont see any big advantage from being a brell worshiping dwarf vs an agnostic one.  (if you reroll as something that can worship Rallos Zek its a different story though...)</div></div><hr />

When they first introduced the newbie armours, I said what the heck and made a human warrior in freeport. I did all the quests (took a while) and was the proud owner of a full suit of Steel Warrior armour. I bashed wisp for a while and then proceeded to Paludal Caverns at level 16. I had little problems tanking here and when the xp became trivial I moved on. It was here things began getting hard. All the sudden I bacame a papertank and a manaspunge and I ended up deleting the character (it was an experiment after all).<br />
<br />
The best you can make with smithing would be banded armour. Banded armour is much like newbie armour: it will take you to your early 20, but after that it will start to hurt. People expect higher standards with regards to hp and ac today, because they're used to twinks and because the market is flooded with cheap items. The problem with your smithing approach is that smithing takes alot and I mean alot of plat to get even near worthwhile. The trivials on culture armour are very high. My advice to you, is forgetting smithing for now and buy some budget armour in bazaar. When you get into higher levels, more plat will find its way to your pockets and you will start being able to afford hobbies, which is what tradeskills basicly are.</div></div><hr />
