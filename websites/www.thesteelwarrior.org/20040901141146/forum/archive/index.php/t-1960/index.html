<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to offer a solution to a small part of the warriors vs knights class balancing issue:  knight aggro lock.  Reading the other threads everyone agrees that aggro lock at the high level game is unbalanced, lame, and trivializes (or contributes to the trivialization of) exp groups.  <br />
<br />
Paladin Solution:   <br />
<br />
- Lower level stuns landing on mobs that are immune to them cause zero aggro.  If its a DD / stun combo the aggro is based only on the DD portion.<br />
<br />
- Take away the flash of light crutch. Not sure if higher level mobs are immune to blind, if so &quot;immunity = zero aggro&quot; should fix.<br />
<br />
- up Force of Akilae to 150 mana cost or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowknight Solution: <br />
<br />
- Cut the aggro from Sk's casting darkness spells to be DOT based only.  Have the mobs ignore the snare-component aggro.<br />
<br />
- Maybe up the mana cost of Terror of Thule a bit.<br />
<br />
I think these few simple changes would mitigate the aggro lock problem in exp groups.   My solution would make aggro lock still possible, but would cause downtime for the knight to med up after.  To attain similar levels of performance they currently have knights would have to mix self-buff procs, weapon procs, taunts, and aggro spells.  It would open up knight weapon selection to situationally favor high aggro procs on weapons instead of just doing the dmg/dly math.  Members of that group would have to pay attention to what spells are cast or wait a fixed time before unleashing all types of hell on the mob.<br />
<br />
Note I am not trying to address whats wrong with warriors in this thread.  Im just trying to address what I see is wrong with exp groups at the moment.  Casters have been dumbed down by the aggro lock knights give to the point where they dont even think before chain mashing buttons.   Bring back aggro management to every class.<br />

Maybe this would bring the stun and slow procs down to a level where a warrior could choose other proc types without losing important agro.<br />
Stun and slow might be considered a bit overpowered as agro proc in its current form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly!<br />
<br />
Why should Warriors, the masters of all forms of combat melee NEED to use ghetto shaman/pally spells off of weapons to demand the attention of a mob?<br />
<br />
Should they not FEAR our melee ability instead?<br />
<br />
Should not the mere presence of a highly skilled and capable warrior attacking them in hand to hand combat be enough to warrant attention?<br />
<br />
Why of course not, we need to use weapons that proc spells that they are immune to, in order to draw attention...<br />

It's very hard now to change anyhting along the lines of the Pally/SK because without it they'd be near useless except for buff_bots or what we, the Warriors are now, just some extra damage but nothing that isn't missed if not there.<br />
<br />
Warriors need fixing back to the first days of level 1 full newbiedom all the way up to level 65/400+aa's/top-notch gear by the ways of &quot;how exactly taunt works&quot; and a reasonable increase in their DPS ( yeah, warr DPS is situational at best ) ... and further non-disciplined damage absorbtion by the ways of natural AC; AC increases; and even further increases in the statistics between plate hybrids and us pure tanks.<br />
<br />
Leave the Pallys/SK's where they are now. Make the Warriors just a tad bit bigger, stronger, and more reliable in their roles and things'll even out just fine and no one will have the nerf bat stuffed up their...you know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not quite right.  There is a difference between &quot;stun&quot; and &quot;interrupt&quot;.  Stuns stops what ever the monster is doing.  Interrupt stops casting.  All stuns will interrupt but not all interrupts will stun.  Stuns and interrupts exist outside of spells too.<br />
<br />
Although a monster is immune to stuns there is still a possibility of interrupting it.  Kick and Bash are examples fo this effect that can be used against any monster reguardless of whether they can be stunned.  Even if a monster is immune to stuns, if the stun is strong enough it will still force a &quot;channel check&quot; on the monster.  Even if the monster is immune to stuns its still worth trying to interupt.  It may not stop its action but forcing a check is still desirable.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately do to grand SOE designs, anything that is hard to stun will also channel like mad.<br />
<br />
But this brings me back to the point.  Tinkering with mana costs only punishes less afluent Paladins.  If a L65 Paladin faces a L60 casting monster, the first stun they will be inclined to use is FOA.  A &quot;fix&quot; that applies to only &quot;the little people&quot; is a flawed fix.<br />
<br />
(And as the broken record skips...) This still doens't fix Warriors.  Do people really believe that if Paladins and SKs are nerfed into oblivion that they'll run back into the arms of Warriors?  /shrug By every indication I've seen every caster (except Clerics) can make exp without tanking.  So why put up with shoddy tanking at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I been thinking kind of the same as the original post. I hear the arguments that it takes so much mana to hold aggro but I just can't believe that 3-4 stuns take that much mana. If it did I would hear a lot more oom from the Pali when we're chain pulling but it's an endless supply it appears to me. I hear the shammies from time to time oom and the clerics a little more often but never heard a palli say oom when he has been MT. I don't want it nerfed real far down but I do believe they have trivialized to much with the 3-4 stun (sometimes less but never seen it more)=complete mob attention for the duration of the fight. Just seems wrong to me, the mob should atleast glance at another player from time to time but hey........./shrug</div></div><hr />

Yes we do but actually that one does not gegerate aggro like the rest of the stuns at least SoE got that one right. it's great for interuptin casters though.</div></div><hr />

The only problem with your reasoning is that if they made warriors a tad bigger, stronger, and more reliable, we might actually be able to solo something light blue to us, or at minimum do our job effectivelyand reliably, and we can't have that now can we? :p<br />
But seriously, warriors have been screwed up from the beginning; we're &quot;masters of combat&quot; but we cant function without a full support team backing us up.  A lot of us can't even farm anything worthwhile to sell for cash (which we desperately need to buy the gear we so desperately depend on, the droppable pieces anyway) unless we have a support team backing us up.  The class needs an overhaul, it's that simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As for the FT15 knight being able to do this better:  more power to them.  At least it requires SOME thought to balance your gear with FT vs just AC / HP.   You could say the same thing about having a bard in the group making them still achieve aggro lock.   Its still all good.  Bard groups should be implicitly faster paced.  Balance it so that a non-mind-buffed 61+ knight can aggro LOCK 2 or 3 mobs then be oom and the rest will fall in place.

<br />
Do you really think people would choose to have a knight tank if this was the case? How would you balance this taking into consideration that some groups do have good mana regen buffs and some don't? If I have C5, my mana regen rate is tripled compared to when I don't, since almost all of my mana comes from standing mana regen. <br />
<br />
Knights might even *gasp* use their AA mounts for better mana regen.<br />
How? You gain no benefit for being on a horse while attacking or moving. If the mob is dead and I'm not pulling, I just sit down to med. I'm not sure how a mount would improve my mana regen. <br />

Ever tried to melee on a horse? <br />

Excellent suggestion Graal, one I firmly agree with.  Yet at every turn whenever we come up with a suggestion we believe might in some way address the issue to our satisfaction, someone comes out of the woodwork and claims that it will either A) Trivialize the game or B) Make Knights obsolete!<br />
<br />
It seems that Warriors can't in anyway be improved upon or changed without it either completely destroying the game or two other classes.  At least not in any way that might actually mean that using a Warrior tank was just as desireable as using a Knight.</div></div><hr />

You should quickly inspect items coming out of elementals and even a little from VT.  Its really not that hard especially when items have FT and HP and Mana.  Toss in C5 and a little more AA to expand WIS beyond the 255 restriction and there is a ton of mana to be had.<br />
<br />
Divine Stun has as much agro as any other 1 second stun.  Its mana free.  No amount of mana monkeying will &quot;fix&quot; this great skill.<br />
<br />
Making FOA cost 150 hurts the little guy which isn't a worthwhile thing to chase.  Beats me why you want to beat them down.<br />
<br />
(Once again with the broken record...) If you were really concerned about the rate at which Paladins were casting stuns you would double the reset/cool down time.  But this is all a red herring.  It will never fix Warriors...not even in the least.<br />
<br />
But okay, so lets go with this.  Lets say that agro lock completely drains mana.  I still say Knights &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Warriors.  This is important so read carefully: There is nothing a Warrior can do now can even come close to this.  Monkey with mana all you want.  Knights are still more useful even if mana was nerfed to hell.<br />
<br />
Finally, I really hate how people think they are doing groups a favor by FORCING downtime onto them for normal operation.  I don't see how this makes the game better at all.  I honestly want to know what the challenge is in making people bored or frustrated.<br />
<br />
Of course you don't realize what you really are doing with this in the end.  By making groups &quot;have fun&quot; with downtime, this just makes those that can solo that much more powerful.<br />
<br />
Yay!  What a stellar idea! ^_^<br />
<br />
ps. I do think Graal is a little too hard.  There is plenty of room for improvement that doesn't even step on SK/Paladin toes.  There are some great suggestions out there now that would work well.  Its time to make Warriors far more group friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aeka the point I was making was that aggro LOCK (note this is way different than normal aggro generation) should imply downtime.

<br />
Obviously with mana regen you could use your lock ability more frequently.   My whole point is that it should be a choice that requires skill to know when to use it and when not to.  When you're not locking you're using mana sparingly to maintain JUST enough aggro to keep everything moving.   You would only experience downtime if you overused the lock ability.<br />
<br />
Trivialized aggro lock just makes exp groups a snoozefest.  Im not trying to step on knights.   I am pointing out what i see as broken and how to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
The problem is this... <br />
<br />
A.) With a warrior slow exp, downtime is expected, people must accomodate them...<br />
<br />
B.) Without a warrior, chain pull rack up exp faster, do whatever you want, no worry about aggro..<br />
<br />
now which is more fun?<br />
<br />
Why B of course, none of us deny this, except it makes it very hard for normal warriors to get groups and do anything. There is no 'BALANCE'<br />
<br />
The second proble is, that Casters have become soooo overpowered in the game its not even laughable anymore. Why should it be possible for a caster to solo or even quad Dark blue mobs, endlessly, yet a melee class gets killed by light blue/green mobs?<br />
<br />
They need to ad more casting mobs, that cast on these casters spells that land, that are not resisted completely. <br />
<br />
Hell I want to resist that mob smacking me for 200pts every tick, sure its not a lot, but after a few rounds I am easilly gonna take 4-5k in damage, while the druid quads the same mobs, and doesnt even get hit... There is no risk for casters soloing... There should be. <br />
<br />
Remember the cries of panic and outrage when HoH mobs summoned? I just wish melee could get ANY change done as fast to benefit us.<br />
<br />
IMO, every mob level 51+ should summon... Then maybe the soloers would know what its like to have to melee for a living.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was just going to pass this bye, I was not even going to reply.  Honest, I tried really hard.<br />
<br />
Aeka the point I was making was that aggro LOCK (note this is way different than normal aggro generation) should imply downtime. It should be an ability of knights but should be used sparingly (kind of like AE Taunt). <br />
<br />
Think of it this way, agro lock should be knights 'Oh shit!' mechanism.  When something goes wrong, they should have that ability, the same as when something goes wrong, warriors have AE taunt.  The knight version is better than the warrior version(nothing like the joy of AE taunting, having the mob turn to face you for a split second, then turn right back to turning the caster to paste as he does something new).  During the regular course of events tho, knights should not be able to agro lock every mob(or nearly agro lock, yes, there are limits).  <br />
<br />
I know, because I do it, that a group with only warrior agro(and I am pre EB, so it is fairly limited) can chain pull with no real significant downtime.  Trust me, I hit a point where I am praying for something to happen to interupt the flow of mobs, just so I don't feel so bad saying that I need to afk a minute, I got's to P.  Not every group goes that well, but enough do.  To suggest that needing to agro lock every mob is false.  The suggestion made at the start of this thread was in essence to expect knights to use warrior agro generation tools under normal circumstances, with extra agro generation there as needed.  Knights still will be able to generate more agro faster, but to actually 'lock' agro would be expensive.<br />
<br />
Yet at every turn whenever we come up with a suggestion we believe might in some way address the issue to our satisfaction, someone comes out of the woodwork and claims that it will either A) Trivialize the game or B) Make Knights obsolete! <br />
<br />
I think this statement is slightly unfair.  Most of us here argue about how best to fix warriors, as we are broken in relation to knights.  We do not all agree on the best way to do it, but it is not we vs them.  All but a very small number of people here are on the same basic side, we just have different ideas on how best to get where we all want to be.  Note also that no one posting here on this board will actually make a decision about how to actually fix warriors, SoE developrs will(I pray that they will anyway, and soon).  All we are actually doing here is debating points, mostly for our own entertainement, and maybe with the slight hope that SoE will read and maybe take some suggestion made here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree with Aeka.  Downtime is not the answer IMO.  The way to balance the situation is by looking at the 2 primary requirements of tanking.  Aggro control and healing efficiency.  The two should be proportional.  If a knight has 90% of the healing efficiency that a warrior has then a warrior should have 90% of the aggro control that a knight has.  If the knight has 50% of the healing efficiency then the warrior should have 50% of the aggro control.  <br />
<br />
All other abilities and any effects given by spells other than aggro control are things that boost utility but not tanking ability.  They should be balanced against each other separately.  So while LoH, root, FD, etc all contribute to the overall desireability and usefulness of a class they have nothing to do with tanking.  They should be balanced against things like /shield, increased DPS, defensive, differences in available equipment, etc.<br />
<br />
So leaving out concerns about heals, defensive, etc, and just focusing on XP group tanking we have knights with nearly identical healing efficiency and vastly superior aggro control.  For both to be desired as XP group tanks 1 of 2 things need to happen.  Either both need to be roughly equivalent at healing efficiency AND at aggro control, or one needs to be CLEARLY superior at tanking and the other needs to be CLEARLY superior at aggro control.  That addresses the desireability of warriors vs knights as TANKS.<br />
<br />
Once that is resolved then you compare the other differences between teh two classes and add or subtract from abilities and spells until they balance out.  So if spells give a clear advantage to knights after tanking is considered balanced then add skills, DPS, etc to warriors to compensate.  If warrior DPS gives warriors a clear advantage then add spells, DPS, etc to the knights to compensate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">/em winds up the broken record<br />
<br />
I would never wish downtime during the normal course of exp group events.  There is enough downtime grouping to begin with.  Im just saying if a knight abuses his ability to aggro lock by super-over-aggroing every mob so the casters dont have to think, then downtime is in order.<br />
<br />
If they partly manage aggro via solo time, procs, and taunts then they should incur no downtime.<br />
<br />
Knight aggro is at the moment rather akin to a cleric that gets a 2000 point heal for 12 mana with a 1.2 second cast time but zero aggro.  All he would have to do is stand there, target, button mash and no one would ever die.  Similar skill is currently required for knight aggro lock.    Do I, as a warrior, want that ability?  No.  It would make the game trivial.<br />
<br />
Its funny when I started this thread I thought it was a common conclusion that trivially aggro locking a mob was a bad thing for the game in general and utterly removed aggro management (a core part of the everquest experience) from the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Its funny when I started this thread I thought it was a common conclusion that trivially aggro locking a mob was a bad thing for the game in general and utterly removed aggro management (a core part of the everquest experience) from the game.<br />
<br />
Sure, aggro control should probably be a significant part of the game.  But there are extremes that aren't good.  The Necro shouldn't be slaughtered just because he dropped a DoT on the mob a tad bit too soon, yet with a Warrior that's entirely possible particularly if taunt get's screwy.  On the other hand, he shouldn't be able to pretty much stack his DoTs one on top of the other with little or no risk, which with a Paladin or Shadow Knight is also entirely possible (well maybe not every DoT, but you know what I mean).<br />
<br />
Regardless of how powerful the Knights aggro generation is, and I agree it's pretty powerful indeed, I still believe that Warrior aggro generation is too weak.  Check that, not too weak, too completely unreliable.  Yes people can work with it as it is, if they're careful and intelligent.  But it isn't particularly fun and they are pretty well hamstringed, and even having EB weapons doesn't completely make this go away.<br />
<br />
Riddle me this batman, why does SoE increase caster DPS potential expansion after expansion if in fact the idea is that they not be able to use it in a group?  What good are the improvements if Warriors in general have a aggro generation cap, in effect, and they can't utilize that increased DPS without becoming a splatter on the ground?  Why bother with all the work and effort for all the upgrades unless you plan on spending the majority of your time soloing or raiding?<br />
<br />
The truth is SoE hasn't considered the fact that there is a point where the ability for Warriors to generate aggro drops so significantly behind the Caster's ability to generate aggro that the Casters are basically fighting with one hand tied behind their backs to group with them.  And why should this be?  Just as they shouldn't be able to completely unload their mana bar without concern when a Knight tanks, they also shouldn't be afraid to do much until the mob is almost dead for fear that they'll get the beat down.<br />
<br />
There is a big big middle ground here people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Its funny when I started this thread I thought it was a common conclusion that trivially aggro locking a mob was a bad thing for the game in general and utterly removed aggro management (a core part of the everquest experience) from the game. <br />
<br />
Actually, no, it is not a common conclusion, and is part of an argument that a number of us have regularly.  Aeka, Glatius, Val, Ian, Apothes and myself have argued this point more than once.  I agree, trivial agro generation is...well, trivial.  Note that every person that I mentioned, and many others who have argued over that topic, all agree that there is a definate balance issue in relative agro controll, and our only area of disagreement is really on just that point.<br />
<br />
Edit:  and Glatius hits the same quote I do, but he must be able to type faster.  He also makes a good point about warrior agro generation falling behind(sorta).  While we do I think generate more agro now than we did pre-PoP(better weapons, leading to more DPS, and DPS does add agro), I do feel that it is time to tune up taunt success rates.  I think just that would do us a world of good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well some of us may have these better weapons, me, I'm using stuff from NToV still.  And I don't think the majority of Warriors have a windblade or better from PoP, do you?  Perhaps you might make a case that the increased damage AAXPs have upped our DPS, which has increased our aggro generation marginally.  But that's after cranking out a lot of experience, while the Casters can get that from just the right spell.  I think most people would agree that overall we haven't gotten near as much from PoP as the caster classes have, and I think it's a pretty easy conclusion to arrive at that this limits our potential substantially.  Basically, we're just not keeping up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Windblades, War Marshall's Bladed staff, GSoT are fairly common these days.  While I do not think that the majority have them, they are not outrageous to get.<br />
<br />
while the Casters can get that from just the right spell <br />
<br />
61 and 62 spells are fairly cheap to buy, but after that, SP roullette is a pain, and prices are not cheap.  Level 65 spells and runes...not pretty.  My mage(61 now, YAY!), after 30 some EP turnins, still lacks 2 level 61 spells(and had to buy a couple others), and about half my 62 spells.  I do feel that drops in PoP heavily favor casters(tho I rarely see exp groups where melee do not roll on SP's and runes, at least providing income for melee), getting the spells you need is by no means easy or cheap.<br />
<br />
Basically, we're just not keeping up. <br />
<br />
Which is why I said, right after the part you quoted, that I think taunt needs to be tuned up.  If taunt worked beter than 40 % of the time, alot of our problems would be lessened.  Loosing agro would not be as severe if we could more reliable regain it fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is how I aggro (as a SK) in an exp group.<br />
<br />
Ideally I have the mob targeted as the puller brings it in, I cast festering dark on it which 90% of the time switches aggro to me with enough hate that it can even be pre-slowed.<br />
<br />
To keep aggro during the fight I rely on my terror spell, which is basically a castable EB proc (and seems to have no aggro at a distance unlike paladin stuns, so please dont compare them). In fact a warrior with an EB weapon is now in a better position than me as they dont have to worry about the mana cost of their EB proc and they probably hold aggro better than me while the fight is on (it's just the initial aggro grab and + hate from darkness that I have over them).<br />
<br />
Because I'm doing other stuff with my mana, I generally only cast the terror spell when I've lost aggro to snatch it back (a warrior can't choose to proc EB like this on demand but generally they will have proced allot more than I cast so wont have lost aggro).<br />
<br />
In &quot;oh crap&quot; situations where mobs are in the camp where I haven't been able to pre aggro with the darkness spell I rely on taunt (yes taunt) and then when I can channel it (mob is probably not slowed so its hard) a terror proc to give me abit of +hate.<br />
<br />
I don't &quot;aggro lock&quot;... other ppl in my group do get hit from time to time. I'm not the perfect tank by any means. Yes I could go crazy and chain cast terror or a darkness dot, but I don't want to... I want to be casting my group + mana/health spell, my attack buff, my self ac buff (because my ac lags a fair way behind a warriors) maybe a nuke or too... I want to keep some mana for taps in case a heal is late comming etc.<br />
<br />
Overall I would say that a paladin's stuns are the only thing that acheives this so called &quot;aggro lock&quot;... shadowknight's don't have it, not anymore. Maybe when we had disease cloud we did. That spell was amazing, but it is no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Most warriors do not have an EB weapon.  All SKs do have a terror spell and all Pallies have a stun spell  What we are saying here is that we need to have something readily accessible to all warriors that will provide us with the same opportunities to grab aggro that the knight classes have.  <br />
<br />
The other difference is in the amount of nuking a caster can do when a knight class tanks and when a warrior tanks.  On average, casters can starting cast earlier and for bigger hits when a knight class tanks compared to the warrior.  This is true whether aggro lock is in place or not.  Why? because the knight class has a more reliable means of regaining aggro through spells.<br />
<br />
Warriors must rely on taunt (RNG) and proc (RNG).  Warriors have no control over regaining aggro.</div></div><hr />

Just ask Gunsn (sk in my guild) about the time when he had a contest in CoD with constableplod (my guilds MA) who can hold agro better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thats not quite right. There is a difference between &quot;stun&quot; and &quot;interrupt&quot;. Stuns stops what ever the monster is doing. Interrupt stops casting. All stuns will interrupt but not all interrupts will stun. Stuns and interrupts exist outside of spells too.<br />
<br />
Although a monster is immune to stuns there is still a possibility of interrupting it. Kick and Bash are examples fo this effect that can be used against any monster reguardless of whether they can be stunned. Even if a monster is immune to stuns, if the stun is strong enough it will still force a &quot;channel check&quot; on the monster. Even if the monster is immune to stuns its still worth trying to interupt. It may not stop its action but forcing a check is still desirable.<br />
<br />
A mob that is immune to stuns will not be interrupted from stun spells or kick/bash. In the game will not even make little check for it.<br />
The interrupts you see is from pushbacks from melee.<br />
The only exception I know of to this rule is the crippling blow exception, which seems to allow interrupts and stuns to land on immune mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Im coming in kinda late to this thread, and I've gotta admit I skimmed over alot of it, but felt the need to put my 2cp in anyway...<br />
<br />
First off I think this is one of the best ideas to come out yet :p and is what I have considered to be the best solution to balancing knights and warriors for a while now. <br />
<br />
I think that there needs to be a trade off for warriors vs knights and much of the problem lately comes from there being a cost in having a warrior tank (poor agro control / more heals required on the non tanking classes / more mana for enchanters having to recast rune and boggle) and no cost in having a knight (knights tanking is so close to warriors that there is no noticeable disadvantage in having a knight tank, and you get the advantage of early slows).<br />
<br />
Increasing the cost of knight agro spells would put a cost on having a knight tank.  With a warrior tanking the cost is higher risk - the occasional splattered chanter etc, with a knight tanking the cost is downtime, agro lock makes XP safer and 'trivial' but it comes in a little slower.<br />
Paladins with 4k+ mana and FT15 will just shrug this off.<br />
- Aeka<br />
<br />
And to warriors with 9khps and a blade of war agro control isnt an issue and they can tank most tier 2/3 XP mobs unslowed for 30 secs if need be anyway.  This balancing doesnt need to happen at the elemental flagged and above level.  <br />
<br />
Its not the warriors with VT lewts and EB weapons who are here frustrated at not being able to get groups.  When I XP my guild will take warriors or knights depending who is available at the time and if anything warriors are the preferred tank in guild groups and its not uncommon to hear guild knights unhappy about having to take pickup groups.  <br />
<br />
(this is another part of the problem ofcourse that your Velious era geared warriors are often competing with VT geared knights for pickup groups because (from what I have seen) warriors are the prefered tanks in 'uber guild' guild groups)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You know I am really starting to hate the words &quot;agro lock&quot;.  Not because its used against Paladins so much as it doesn't describe the situation well at all.  Its getting cliche.<br />
<br />
So here we have players, believing that somehow this is trivializing the game and its all Knight's fault.  When a Warrior holds agro through the entire fight it isn't evil agro lock.  But when a Paladin holds agro though the entire fight it is all wrong and trivializing the game.<br />
<br />
So what is the difference?  When a Warrior does this its all luck.  When a Paladin or SK does this its not?  I suppose that is a good point.  But I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the 5 other people in my group would be mad if I played &quot;dice&quot; with their exp time.<br />
<br />
So Warriors out there feel they are in the right asking for nerfage on Knights because of what?  Because when they succeed in groups its because of a shared skill (which fails a little too much) and the whim of the RNG?  Somehow that is more skillful (more skillful without skills??) or more &quot;right&quot;?<br />
<br />
Some how people have it in their head that its perfectly fine to be told do their job with ONE SKILL that only works 60% of the time and a set of random events.  I can't find another class in the game that does this let alone thinks its perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
Thinking like this turns the blame on others.  Its not my fault that the Shaman drew agro because he had to cast twice due to a resist.  Its not my fault the Cleric had to do a fast heal on that Shaman because they were being up and drew agro too.  Its not my fault that Taunt failed to turn the monster back on to me...twice.  Its not my fault the game didn't give me a proc.  But hey its that Beastlord's fault because he can hold agro better than and the group wants him to tank!<br />
<br />
Is this really what Warriors think when they play the game?  No wonder why some advocate bad faith nerfs.<br />
<br />
When the day ever arrives that Warriors get one maybe two good skills to hold agro then we can start to talk if this or that costs too much compared to another class.  Untill then its just class envy and nerfing.<br />
<br />
As for the scope of the problem you are quite correct Eoden.  It isn't the high end guilds that see this problem on their Warriors.  Decked out in higher end gear Warriors are this level do what Knights can do from day one: marginalize the poor performance of Taunt.  But if Warriors do &quot;agro lock&quot; it isn't bad right?  Thats only a nasty Knight thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Warrior aggro lock happens MAYBE one out of 20 fights, and its usually a result of having 2 or 3 lucky procs in the first 5 seconds of combat.  The rest of the time having the mob stay on the warrior is a team effort of everyone watching their aggro and careful attention by the warrior if the mob turns.  <br />
<br />
Compare that to mashing your stun / darkness button a few times and the mob NEVER looking the other way EVERY fight no matter WHAT the casters do.<br />
<br />
This is not class envy.   Its simply pointing out that a large portion of the game (aggro management) is completely sidestepped with almost no downside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">But if Warriors do &quot;agro lock&quot; it isn't bad right? Thats only a nasty Knight thing.<br />
Nasty nasty Knights and their nasty nasty agro lock!<br />
<br />
Actually I dont see Knights having agro lock as a bad thing at all, and Im certainly not advocating taking it away from them.  <br />
<br />
At the moment though my narrow visioned view of the game looking at tanking in tier 1-3 of PoP (where most people will level from 61-65) I see a cost to the group in having a warrior tank and none for having a knight tank.  I could be wrong but as I understand it we (that being the warrior community and the knight community) both see this as unbalanced, the disagreement is simply how we balance this out.  <br />
<br />
Aeka, your view is that to balance the classes the cost of having a warrior tank needs to be removed.  You play a paladin and when you play in XP groups you have your stuns and agro spells or whatever you get your high level of hate at the beginning of each mob encounter that keeps the mob on you as the debuffers land their spells and the cleric heals you.  To you this is good and how XPing should be and its balanced.<br />
<br />
When I join a group as a warrior however its different.  There a risk to the debuffers if they cast a bit early, theres a risk to the cleric from healing to early.  A mob comes in, I beat on it, it gets debuffed and if it agros a debuffer I taunt it back on to me and then once its debuffed we kill it.  This is good, its a little challenging, but its how XPing in the planes of power should be to me.  So my view is that to balance the tanking classes there needs to be a cost added to having a knight tank.<br />
<br />
So... assuming Im correct there its fair to say we both want to balance the tanking classes, we simply disagree as to how it should be done.  <br />
<br />
The options presented so far are as follows:<br />
Improved warrior mitigation / HP advantage<br />
Well hell, Im all for more HPs, but the implications of doing this extend beyond the XP grind part of the game into raiding.  Perhaps warriors in their raid role arent balanced and need more HP or something, but personally I dont think so.  Also seeing as knight mitigation is sufficient there is no need for warriors to tank better than they do.<br />
<br />
Improve warrior taunt<br />
This one is pretty popular, and would be my 2nd choice of solution, but my concern is that any chance they make here would fundamentally change how warriors have been played.  I dont want to have a &lt;bigger taunt&gt; button next to my taunt button.  Improving warrior taunt also has some implications to the raiding level of the game which at this stage is pretty much as VI or whoever want it to be as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
nerf knight mitigation<br />
Warriors and knights go back onto seperate tanking tables.  Personally I wish they had stayed on seperate tables in the first place, but whats done is done and at this stage knights have a role in tank mezzing on raids that would be effected by a change here.<br />
<br />
Nerf knight agro<br />
Why? You don't think agro lock is a bad thing.  Its been discussed already how its something knights have always had and it was never a problem before, so why take it away from them now?  Nasty knights and nasty agro lock... :p<br />
<br />
I don't think any of those options makes a very good fix for balancing knights and warriors, however I still see a need to do something to balance that cost of having a warrior tanking.  I think that removing that cost would make the EQ raiding game easier than it is and hence have a result and implications beyond the goal of balancing warriors / knights in the XP game, so the solution is to add a cost to having a knight tank.  Removing their agro lock or their tankability also has implications beyond the XP game, so the best way I can see to resolve this is to increase the cost of these spells so that a knight needs some downtime in XP groups.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt hit the uber knights hard at all, might force a few choices between HP and mana gear for a few, but really thats just adding a little more challenge to playing your class well and making it easier for the good players to stand out from the bad.  <br />
<br />
Most importantly it would give an XP group a reason to choose a level 65 5.5khp warrior with Ssra + NToV gear over a level 62 paladin with 3.5khp in bazaar bought gear.  At the moment the paladin would get the group 8 times out of 10 which doesnt suggest class balance to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">its all Knight's fault <br />
<br />
Simply, no.  If you are given the tools, you would be foolish(and a bad player) not to use them.  The current imbalance is not  caused by knights, but by the game designers, who did not realize the whole implication of the changes to the game they where making(and to be fair, I can see how that could happen).<br />
<br />
 But I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the 5 other people in my group would be mad if I played &quot;dice&quot; with their exp time. <br />
<br />
Again, you would be foolish to not use the tools you have, no one is saying otherwise.<br />
<br />
Thinking like this turns the blame on others. Its not my fault that the Shaman drew agro because he had to cast twice due to a resist. Its not my fault the Cleric had to do a fast heal on that Shaman because they were being up and drew agro too. Its not my fault that Taunt failed to turn the monster back on to me...twice. Its not my fault the game didn't give me a proc. <br />
<br />
Who is blaming anyone?  In EXP groups, occasionaly shit happens, but I rarely see people pointing fingers.  Once you get to a certain point, people know the shit happens, and they accept it.<br />
<br />
But hey its that Beastlord's fault because he can hold agro better than and the group wants him to tank! <br />
<br />
I honestly believe it will be a long time till this happens with any regularity.  Only very high end BL's can tank with any kind of efficiency, and only against some stuff.<br />
<br />
Is this really what Warriors think when they play the game? No wonder why some advocate bad faith nerfs. <br />
<br />
First, you make up a bunch of fingerpointing, then you draw a false conclusion from it.  No, that is not what I think when I play the game.  No, I am not operating in bad faith, I am merely suggesting at what place I would like to see the game balanced.<br />
<br />
Untill then its just class envy and nerfing. <br />
<br />
No, it is a serious discussion about where we want to see EQ balanced at.  You want to see any concept of agro management thrown out the window outside of raids, you want as little possible risk in anything you do.  I think that agro management is a key part of EQ, and think that a little risk is acceptable.<br />
<br />
Decked out in higher end gear Warriors are this level do what Knights can do from day one: marginalize the poor performance of Taunt. But if Warriors do &quot;agro lock&quot; it isn't bad right? Thats only a nasty Knight thing. <br />
<br />
There should be a reward for people decked out in high end gear.  Again, no one is saying that it is a bad thing.  Making 'agro lock' more mana intensive would have little effect on high end knights, with there larger mana pools and higher FT.  That is their reward.<br />
<br />
Eodin takes a good look at how various changes to achieve balance would affect raiding.  As far as exp groups, I feel that knight agro generation(to avoid the phrase you are growing to hate) removes a key balance feature of EQ, namely agro managment.  It also seriously reduces the risk part of risk vs reward, making it unbalanced.<br />
<br />
When the day ever arrives that Warriors get one maybe two good skills to hold agro then we can start to talk if this or that costs too much compared to another class. <br />
<br />
Again, simply no.  I enjoy EQ, alot, and I want to see the game balanced in the best possible way.  I love my warrior, and want to see warrior balancing done in the best possible way.  I am not going to sit quietly by and let you(or anyone) tell me what and when I can discuss it.  It is not 'class envy', it is trying to make the game better.  I do not suggest my views are the 'right' ones, but it is my feeling that it would make EQ better.  You feel that your vision is what would make EQ better.  We both hold that same goal in mind tho, making EQ better.  Let's not get carried away with the drama.<br />
<br />
The whole premise of this thread is worthless, or are you going to recommend removing knight's ability to root? Aggro control is almost completely irrelevant when the mob is rooted. <br />
<br />
So, if the spells you used for agro became more expensive to use, you would just root the mob evey time?  If root was the ultimate agro answer, then why does some one not simply root every mob on inc, and warriors would never again have any difficulties?  In fact, why do paladins not root mobs now instead of stunning them?  Root is only 30 mana, cheaper than most stuns.<br />
<br />
You are trying to fix the symptoms, not the problem. <br />
<br />
The problem is that the three tank classes are out of balance.  Changing something that causes those classes to be out of balance does fix the problem.  Whether this is the best solution is open to debate, but it is one possible solution to the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">are you going to recommend removing knight's ability to root? Aggro control is almost completely irrelevant when the mob is rooted.<br />
If it were as simple as that we wouldn't be having this discussion, however its pretty clear to me anyway that root isn't the answer to tank class balance otherwise every group would be using it and LFG wouldn't be a special warrior's guild.</div></div><hr />

Actually I dont see Knights having agro lock as a bad thing at all, and Im certainly not advocating taking it away from them.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is bad about aggro lock is this. <br />
Aggro is a very complex system designed into the game. The basis of this system was to make the group work together. The classes that have huge damage/aggro abilities also have very low ability to take the damage from a mob. This created a balance in the game where people needed to use some skill/tactics so that they do not get aggro, and that the tanks hold it instead. Sure knights have always had aggro-lock, but then so does a shaman, a wizard, a rogue, a ranger, a monk... Except they arent designed to take the damage like a tank. They nerfed the monk mitigation FOR ALMOST EXACTLY the same reason we are having this discussion about paladins... Monks could mitigate almost as well as warriors, yet were locking the mob on them with their higher dps, so there was no need for tanks. <br />
<br />
Gainning aggro thru spells was and always should be bad (for any spell NOT SPECIFICALLY designed to increase aggro, ie EB/Terror), Stuns do not say in their description, use this spell to gain incredible aggro generation... Stun Aggro was boosted because people were, gasp, using stuns ALOT, and it was determined that stun was overly powerful in breaking spellcasting and limiting melee damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
The options presented so far are as follows:<br />
Improved warrior mitigation / HP advantage<br />
Well hell, Im all for more HPs, but the implications of doing this extend beyond the XP grind part of the game into raiding.  Perhaps warriors in their raid role arent balanced and need more HP or something, but personally I dont think so.  Also seeing as knight mitigation is sufficient there is no need for warriors to tank better than they do.<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as a warrior can be still one-rounded, warrior HP's are not too high. Highest End we see what 9k unbuffed? When mobs hit in the 3k range and proc, and double/quad or flurry... well 10k or 11k hps only means that you still need 2 sec CH chains with patch healing... <br />
<br />
<br />
Improve warrior taunt<br />
This one is pretty popular, and would be my 2nd choice of solution, but my concern is that any chance they make here would fundamentally change how warriors have been played.  I dont want to have a &lt;bigger taunt&gt; button next to my taunt button.  Improving warrior taunt also has some implications to the raiding level of the game which at this stage is pretty much as VI or whoever want it to be as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I think most of us want, is a TAUNT that works on par with other skills. I have a 230 skill, and I am 65 yet I fail on taunt 40% of the time against a level 25 mob? NO OTHER class deals with that kind of failure rate and calls it acceptable. <br />
<br />
If my skill is maxxed for my level, and the mob is blue, taunt should be TRIVIAL...<br />
<br />
Second, give me a message from every mobs, that means pass/fail on taunt.  <br />
<br />
<br />
nerf knight mitigation<br />
Warriors and knights go back onto seperate tanking tables.  Personally I wish they had stayed on seperate tables in the first place, but whats done is done and at this stage knights have a role in tank mezzing on raids that would be effected by a change here.<br />
<br />
<br />
No need to nerf them, just give us back our own mitigation table. We SHOULD be better. Of course that would be considered a nerf by them, and they would whine until they were back on the same table as we are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nerf knight agro<br />
Why? You don't think agro lock is a bad thing.  Its been discussed already how its something knights have always had and it was never a problem before, so why take it away from them now?  Nasty knights and nasty agro lock... :p<br />
<br />
<br />
It should be nerfed. It is unbalancing for a tank class to gain aggro faster than any caster or dps class. They want to tank, they need to gain aggro like warriors. If they want to cast, they need to tank like rangers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldnt hit the uber knights hard at all, might force a few choices between HP and mana gear for a few, but really thats just adding a little more challenge to playing your class well and making it easier for the good players to stand out from the bad.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Except, itemization is so messed up, tanks get the same AC, same HP's, +Wis, +Int, Same effects, and MANA on gear. There is no need to make any choices...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Most importantly it would give an XP group a reason to choose a level 65 5.5khp warrior with Ssra + NToV gear over a level 62 paladin with 3.5khp in bazaar bought gear.  At the moment the paladin would get the group 8 times out of 10 which doesnt suggest class balance to me.  <br />
<br />
Not sure exactly what you think will change this, increasing mana cost alone will have no effect at all, or if any a very limited effect. Instead of chain casting, they will just do 2-3  stuns per mob. and stun IF, however unlikely, they lose aggro. With the mana regen available, 3 stuns aggro is easy to get back. Unless you made mana so high that they couldnt, at which point, normal average paladins become almost ineffective. In my opinion, spells mobs are IMMUNE to should never give aggro. Start by fixxing that and tweak away. <br />
<br />
I feel that Knight aggro is way out of proportion,  However I also feel that warriors are a long neglected class. Fixxing the war/knight aggro balance will help, but there are still many gaps in the warrior class, these need fixxed also. Getting aggro fixxed without addressing the rest, will just leave us covered in more EB/Shield/etc. bandages...</div></div><hr />

No, the game doesn't work like that nor should it work like that.  A Paladin tanks like a Paladin.  A SK tanks like an SK.  You can figure out the 3rd.  <br />

You've seen me describe what I do in an exp group.  You've read how an SK does their thing.  Note they aren't very similar.  The spells aren't similar.  The cast rates and consumptions aren't similar.  <br />

<br />
And why is not the reverse true?  You are right, there are 3 ways to tank, and as your fix to agro disparity, you want to make us more knightlike(special abilities are very like spells).  Why is that inherently better, more out of the box, than making knights more warriorlike?  Let me pick another quote:<br />
<br />
Aggro is a very complex system designed into the game. The basis of this system was to make the group work together. The classes that have huge damage/aggro abilities also have very low ability to take the damage from a mob. This created a balance in the game where people needed to use some skill/tactics so that they do not get aggro, and that the tanks hold it instead. Sure knights have always had aggro-lock, but then so does a shaman, a wizard, a rogue, a ranger, a monk... Except they arent designed to take the damage like a tank. They nerfed the monk mitigation FOR ALMOST EXACTLY the same reason we are having this discussion about paladins... Monks could mitigate almost as well as warriors, yet were locking the mob on them with their higher dps, so there was no need for tanks.  <br />
<br />
What is untrue about this statement?  To me it sounds like Ian hit the nail on the head.  If 'agro lock' is a bad thing, then should it not be removed?</div></div><hr />

I will say it again! There is no such thing as aggro lock, yes pally's can stun lock if needed, but against a necro (and probably other classes, but I don't play other than a necro) putting out 1200+ dmg per tic in dots there is a limit to how much agro I can hold.<br />
<br />
Now nerfing knight's aggro would overall be a bad thing (just my opinion with how I play the game btw) as it greatly reduces the groups dps, plus if knight's lost some of their aggro ability, up would step the next best ac'd aggro holder to take their place, be it a bard, BL or even cleric! But one thing it won't do is put warriors back on top of the pile. The only option to make warriors more desirable in exp groups is some form of fix to warriors.<br />
<br />
In regular pop EXP groups my ench can and does tank if we are doing an all caster/pet group because that is the easiest way to do them, since the new no pet aggro rules were introduced. It works great, just so long as the mobs are rooted/mezed first so that they can be slowed before the ench starts tanking.<br />
<br />
Increasing the mana cost of stuns won't really fix anything either, you may make it harder or impossible for the mid 50's pally to stun lock without massive med time in order to slow down the 60 pus crowd, but you also make it so that your ideal group makeup is severely restricted in choice, because with higher mana costs you are going to have to include a necro (to twitch/mana tap) and an ench for c3/4/5, unless you want a 15 min holdup after every mana users death while they go hunt a refresh of c3. So instead of improving the game you are actually making it worse.</div></div><hr />

And a warrior could hold aggro agains what? MAYBE 600 damage per tic? I know in SolRo with a BoC/JSoFF the necro pulled aggro off of me EVERY time she got close to 100 dps.. <br />
<br />
So this is acceptable?</div></div><hr />

Perfectly! But then it depends which side of the fence your sitting!<br />
<br />
However it would be kind of dumb to give necros 1200 dmg a tic capability and only be able to use 600 don't you think? Not that that is really the case, as liberal use of FD allows her to still do far in excess of 600 with even a warrior tanking!<br />
<br />
The fact is that just about every (caster) class in the game has had huge power increases from when 60 was the level cap, and increased power generally = increased taunt. <br />
<br />
Warrior's problems stem from the fact that without some really hard to get gear they have had a minimal increase in power. Reducing other classes to balance warriors will not work, unless you reduce every class, and that, frankly, ain't gonna happen, any fix has to be to warriors!<br />
<br />
[edit] Apologies. On re-reading your post, no not acceptable on warriors being able to hold half the aggro of knights. Not that I agree that that is the case, the difference is the guaranteed aggro (barring fizzles) knights hold over warriors.</div></div><hr />

Why is this a crime if it happens to Paladins and SK's but not when it happenned to warriors?    <br />
<br />
I love this reasoning with all my heart because it illustrates the hypocracy of those who attempt to justify the unreasonable and unfair aggro advantage that Knights have over warriors in relation to their durability advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Agreed.  Its bad logic also to say that if a Warrior can hold agro its okay but if a Knight does it is agro lock likewise. ^_^<br />
<br />
I said before that /disc defensive was going to haunt Warriors till the end of the game.  Statements like these, justifying stuff over Warriors because of near non-existent differences, are part of it.  Its because of this preconceived notion that Warriors are too strong in melee to get any melee improvements that has really screwed things up.<br />
<br />
Either Warriors get the tools necessary to be called tanks or we need to stop calling them tanks.  There is no justification for it stringing along a class with skills that &quot;kind of&quot; helps them do their tasks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
False.  For a warrior to hold agro takes far more than for a knight to hold agro.  It is not holding agro so much that is the issue, it is the ease that knights have holding agro.<br />
<br />
Either Warriors get the tools necessary to be called tanks or we need to stop calling them tanks <br />
<br />
Blatently false.  Every day, I group and do hold agro.  4 AA's yesterday, no deaths, and the nukers had to med thru some due to be lom.  We have the tools to do our job.  I have the tools to tank, and I am so far from high end you might as well call my gear gimp.<br />
<br />
The basic question comes down to one thing:  is agro lock good for the overall game balance?  If so, then all tanks should have it, if not, none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Red,<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure Aeka is saying the same thing.   I don't see him saying &quot;It's ok for Paladins but not for warriors&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Aggro &quot;lock&quot; is somthing warriors simply don't have.    We have a taunt button that is 10% more effective than yours Aeka.   That means, if we have a 60%ish chance to taunt, then you have about a 54% chance using the taunt button alone.   Nothing else, JUST the taunt button.   You don't JUST rely on the taunt button, as you well know.   You rely primarily on spells, BUT the reality is, you don't use your spells to make up for the 10% difference at all, the spells are the primary source of your aggro generation.  <br />
<br />
This makes the disparity ENORMOUS, you know it, I know it, we all know it, and most of all, groups know it.     I'm sorry but I don't see how balancing aggro by reducing the aggro on spells which have no effect and then raising those which produce aggro to the extent that you actually would have to conserve mana and play smart to avoid downtime is that big of a problem.   There used to be a time when you had to consider these things, and it was much more balanced.   Just because in today's EQ, people have consequence free and downtime-free playing without worry thanks to the most overpowered aspect of this game EVER, incresed mana regen, doesn't mean that it's right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I know and agree with a lot of what you have said Frod.  If I was told to tank with just Taunt I couldn't wrap my mind around it.  How do you tank with just Taunt?  The failure rate would drive me to stop attempting.  I can't do it reliably so I shouldn't mess with trying.  That is I would do it but I would claim that there would be upfront stating that there would be problems.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how or why this would be the best for groups.  Very few attempt anything thinking &quot;odds are I'll screw this up&quot; unless the reward is worth it.  Is there an exp group that will take any noticable amount of risk?  I think the answer is &quot;no&quot; otherwise why are there Warriors complaining about this issue.  There is no regular exp group that is worth any appreciable amount of risk.<br />
<br />
We can debate whether or not &quot;the good old days&quot; where more balanced than they are now but that doesn't present a solution.  To go back to the way it was you have throw out all of the POP style monsters.  I don't see that happening any day soon.<br />
<br />
So untill they put into the game monsters that are more friendly to Warrior's strengths and limitations, the Warrior class is going to be stuck.  Pin deficiencies to other classes if you want but if the game moves on and keeps leaving these monsters out then Warriors will feel the pinch.<br />
<br />
(This also brings up the question on why there aren't more Knight unfriendly monsters in the game.  Chalk up another flaw in the environment.)<br />
<br />
Lastly, until Warriors get a compariable skill I can't see how to compare either SK or Paladin agro skills.  Seriously, what about Warriors shows that any agro skills are too cheap?  The lack of those skills?  Does that sound right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Rather than go back and do the quote thing, I will just kind of answer your general comments Aeka.  Should be a little shorter.<br />
<br />
First, you have still not offered a good explanation of why 'agro lock' is a good thing.  Yes, we know why groups prefer it, but that does not make it neccessarily a good thing for the game.  Charm classes preferred things before the charm nerf, but that did not make it a good thing either.  This is the basic argument, the fundamental one.  Is agro lock good for the game?<br />
<br />
You ask how we tank with taunt failure rates as they are.  The answer is that taunt alone is not enough.  DPS, agro procs, crowding the mob are all needed to try and hold agro.  In addition, high agro casters need to watch when they cast their spells(this mostly refers to nukers, shaman can take a few hits, as can chanters with their rune).  I group most frequently with a shaman friend, who Mal's and slows right away, get's agro, and waits for me to taunt it off.  If it takes more than 2 taunts, I hit /shield, and he casts Q on himself.  He has not died to slow agro grouped with me for some time.<br />
<br />
You mention changing the environment to be more warrior friendly.  I wonder why.  I tank in PoP most every day(been slacking a bit lately, mage is 61 now and a lot of fun playing with the new spells), and with success.  The only issue is with the relative desirability of tank classes, ie, if I LFG, I best not be in any hurry, expecially if some 65 knights are lfg as well.<br />
<br />
And ok, one quote:<br />
<br />
However it would be kind of dumb to give necros 1200 dmg a tic capability and only be able to use 600 don't you think? Not that that is really the case, as liberal use of FD allows her to still do far in excess of 600 with even a warrior tanking! <br />
<br />
Why are there agro reducing abilities in most classes if SoE does not think that agro managment is important?  Necro's grab agro I swear every pull, but then they FD, get up, lifetap back any damage taken, and have plenty of mana usually to twich casters as need be.  Think of agro as a limit, it keeps classes from being able to do too much.  This is a good thing, not a bad thing.  Limits are needed.</div></div><hr />

Really guys this topic is covering much of the same content you can find in &quot;case against agro lock&quot; that 36 page beast a page back on the board.  SW has done a good job of taking the opinions and suggestions here and getting a consensus on what needs to be changed and I'm sure this board with voice the opinions of the warriors here to SOE to help get some changes made.  So why continue to run your heads into the walls on the the same topics that have been covered on SW and PoN to the point of nausea? <br />
<br />
But since it's here I suppose I can throw my two cents in. (again :) ) I see what your getting at Scrab but a few things to consider:<br />
<br />
Before the recent patch I was less willing to consider lower stuns shouldn't create agro on 55 plus mobs because there was a hole in our stun line and because I personally have always disliked the stun limit and in the past most of our stun line was only good for agro, which was gimp and detracted from what I liked the stun line for, stopping attacks and interrupts.  Now though, that hole is filled by the new stun and with a line of stuns that can stun above 55 that nerf doesn't look so aweful or unreasonable.  But I still don't feel it fixes the problem that a level 9 stun makes as much hate as my top stuns, they need to scale hate generation on the stun line, that would be a better fix than just a cap that people could work around. <br />
<br />
Nerf Flash of light?  Your stretching a bit and just looking to find ways to nerf knight agro, in general it's not a good spell to use anyways, if the mobs gets outside of melee range it runs all over the place.  Aeka has already covered this, nerfing knight agro is not the ultimate solution to all the warrior's troubles, it's going to take a few changes. <br />
<br />
As for raising the mana cost on stuns, stuns are actually balanced in the absence of mana regeneration.  I tested this when I was 62 in PoS, without any KEI, just normal regen and 1FT, I tried to use QWoT and FoA once each to control the mob.  I ran out of mana in about 8 pulls, now if I had dropped QWoT and just used FoA I could have gone through more mobs but a few things would happen: 1.  I no longer had secure agro 2. I couldn't really keep the mob stunned until after slow hit so I took more damage and the gap between warrior hp and knight started to hurt (Didn't have nd3 at that time and gear was pretty weak then.)  That seems to be the effect you were shooting for in your post, higher mana cost for agro so either downtime happens or agro control loses the dependability.  Now with KEI all of the above is mute, I can stun two or three times without worry much about mana.  It gets tricky from there, do you balance mana cost in terms of mana regen with KEI or better?  It's a crutch as is, with higher stun costs would be a necessity, you'd run into the question &quot;Why stun this mob to stop that nuke when it's more cost efficent just to heal the damage?&quot;  The whole point of the clarity line is to cut down on time needed to get mana back, if you start to balance spells so you get the same effect that you would without clarity why have clarity in the first place? <br />
<br />
So I guess I partially agree with you on this Scrab it's just a difference in how I think paladin spells should be changed.  Scaling the hate from level 9 up instead then maybe capping agro on 55 plus mobs wouldn't even be necessary, using cease for agro would be like wizard using their level 9 nuke to do damage.  Trying to tamper with spell costs would just force a bigger reliance on KEI even if there was a 55 cap now paladins without KEI would be hard pressed to keep mana up and agro in control without downtime, any raises in mana just makes it nearly impossible.   <br />
<br />
Anyways, wish you warriors the best of luck again and I hope Sony comes up with some changes to fix the problems that are hampering your class.  I know how much it sucks when the class you love isn't playing as it should.  <br />

<br />
So, from what you are saying, in the absense of KEI, you had less agro than normal, but still more than a warrior, and there was a noticable difference in your ability to take a beating.  Why is this bad?  It sounds to a certain extent like class balance as intended.  More agro but less durability.  In fact, it sounds like a good place to strive for.  Knights:  somewhat faster agro generation, somewhat less durability.  Warriors:  Somewhat less agro, somewhat more durability.  Now to figure out a working system to get to that point.<br />

You mean watch the casters go elsewhere for exp.  It's not like you can't level to 65 in the current zone setup.  It will be a bunch of warriors and monks and rogues begging clerics to go there and heal them.  That sounds unlike the current way things are in a way which will soon occur to me.<br />

It's bad because the solutions proposed here are going to balance against a knight with KEI/VoQ - why? because without KEI/VoQ it's already balanced.  That means the knights that don't currently buy or bot KEI (I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one) are pretty much screwed.  They'll either turn into junkies or go begging for groups.  <br />
<br />
Conversely, if you make KEI a requirement for grouping it's back to a different leg of the holy trinity.<br />
<br />
KEI really, really, really needs to be smacked again. Worst spell ever. It's digusting to see how it has warped the game. Think you'd have DPS problems as bad if every caster didn't have KEI? How about all that knight aggro - I use my taunt button a fair amount because I can't afford the mana to aggro over extended periods with no mana regen (aside from my FT earring and mana procs).<br />
<br />
Yet the warriors want to balance against a KEIed knight.  Blargh.</div></div><hr />

Cease is 15 mana.  Desist is 25.  Even without any form of mana regen you could still cast 3 or 4 each fight assuming you dont get ANY med time in between mobs.  Chances are with un-kei'd casters thats still twice the aggro they will be throwing around.</div></div><hr />

How do you figure that? You balancing this against someone with a lot of FT? And you'd be suprised how much aggro casters can generate if they try.<br />

Trouble is, we need to balance against somewhere, and since KEI knights are the reality, we have to change the balance from non KEI knights, to ones with.  Either that or change KEI(and listen to the casters scream bloody murder).  Would making all mana regen buffs have half effect for Hybrids work maybe?</div></div><hr />

Sat did Seru 50 people... 20 minute kill, only 2 bane melee.. no oom/lom<br />
<br />
What I see as a huge problem is the disparity of KeI, C2 lasts what 20 minutes? I see C3 with 4 hr duration? What is the logic behind that progression. Melee haste/regen last no where near that. Heck thet stat buffs Focus/Brells/Boar/Wrulan last half as long....<br />
<br />
KEI was created by a crack-head dev obviously, It makes no logical sense in the progression of that spell line...</div></div><hr />

Not sure I agree with your comment.  You are comparing a Luclin mob with PoP geared / AAed people--it only stands to reason that *older* encounters would be easier.  I specifically mentioned &quot;PoP encounters.&quot;  Luclin encounters and prior *should* be easier nowadays with all characters significantly improved via PoP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>raznor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Cease is 15 mana.  Desist is 25.  Even without any form of mana regen you could still cast 3 or 4 each fight assuming you don't get ANY med time in between mobs.  Chances are with un-kei'd casters  thats still twice the agro they will be throwing around.  <br />
<br />
Yes, this is right and the main problem with the stun line atm is that from level 9 and up they all generate the same amount of hate.  So if low stun agro it was capped at 55, this would partially fix the problem or if the hate number was scaled on stuns then trying to use low level stuns to control agro would be like a high level wizard trying to use their level 9 nuke to do damage, it would be useless. <br />
<br />
Now the part I'm trying to point out is that the stuns that do work above 55 have an appropriate mana cost for an average paladin and that upping them will just make using them without some kind of clarity even harder, causing even more dependancy on KEI and such.  Not to mention that tampering with our spells costs does little to fix the problems warriors are having in PoP: reduced hp/ac/mitigation advantage, lack of snap agro, an unreliable taunt, itemization issues, problems with heavy riposte damage using dual wield, inability to put other disciplines to use etc. etc. <br />

Trouble is, we need to balance against somewhere, and since KEI knights are the reality, we have to change the balance from non KEI knights, to ones with.  Either that or change KEI(and listen to the casters scream bloody murder).  Would making all mana regen buffs have half effect for Hybrids work maybe?  <br />
<br />
Let the casters scream.  Aren't they overbalanced anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Seeing as slowers make XP groups so much more efficient these days anyway and enchanters are the 2nd best at performing this role out of a potential 4 classes (Shaman, Enc, Bst, Bard) you will more than likely have an enchanter in 50% of your PoP groups anyway, so nerfing the duration of KEI isnt going to do much other than make it harder for Shamans and Bards to get groups, and groups without enchanters are even less likely to want to travel to remote XP locations where it isnt trivial to PoP off to visit your nearest crack dealer.<br />
<br />
If the duration of KEI is reduced below the amount of time it is likely to take to complete a LDoN quest then all we achieve is giving enchanters back their god status in the holy trinity considering the next expansion will be planned around not being able to scoot back to the nexus for a KEI every time it wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I was thinking more a regen rate change than a duration change.<br />
<br />
Either that or change the stacking since most classes have a self only mana regen buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Hordur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Here is my recent experience with, and new fuel for my dislike of, stun and SK stat taps.<br />
<br />
First scenario is I (65 warrior) am helping to PL a 52 palidan by grouping with him and beating crap up in tier one PoP.<br />
<br />
Friend recently started playing again, he is a 52 palidan who I just got a new weapon and his skill in it is horrid, so he does about 25- 35 DPS a fight. <br />
<br />
I am a 65 warrior, I have flurry 3, raging flurry 1, punishing blade 1 and use a windblade, I averaged about 90 DPS on these mobs with the buffs I had on. So thats about 3x the damage he is doing. <br />
<br />
I get up to get a drink, and since we were in the same room he hops over to control my warrior so the exp doesn't stop, and I come back in and jump in with the palidan. Now by the time I got back the mob was at about 60 % health with 30 % of that done by the warrior, he was taunting and disarming it the whole fight. I sit down at the Pali's controls and jump in to melee, and just for a laugh I cast the 2 stuns he has loaded ( Holy might and force I believe) and pull agro :eek: . Only for about a second, but STILL I pulled agro after half a fights worth of taunt, and more damage done to it by the warrior than you would usually do to a BoT mob, because nearly all the damage on these kills was being done by the warrior. <br />
<br />
Anyone who says that stun does not have to much taunt is blind. I continued to play the pali for a few more fights ( held agro the whole fight one time, just to see ) while my friend was trying his hardest to mantain agro with my warrior. Taunting, disarming, and beating the heck out of it. I was able, pressing taunt for a change, to hold agro from my warrior by casting 8 stuns throughout the fight at a total defecit to the paladin's mana of about 5 % ( he has some decent gear =P ). Yes, he had KEI, but I had haste, and was doing 3x the damage he was.<br />
<br />
My friend who hasn't been playing since before PoP came out, hasn't seen the problem the average warrior has with agro in tier 3 zones, who's main is a pally now, made the comment &quot;This is messed up&quot; .  He was frustrated with it just playing my warrior for about 20 minutes trying to hold agro against stun.<br />
<br />
I am not saying warrior's agro sucks, far from it. If my group gives me 8 seconds ( enough for 2 taunts ) I can nearly assure that I will have agro for the rest of the fight without the mob  twitching for another character. I am saying Palidans can draw to much agro with stun, and its unbalancing. The fact that a 52 palidan can out aggro a 65 warrior who is trying to get agro with 8 stuns throughout a 2 minute fight is absurd. <br />
<br />
Its hard to get across how I feel, and I'm sure other warriors feel about palidan's tanking in exp groups. I'm not saying palidans should not be able to tank, but they should at least have to try, and not attain instant agro for the whole fight. When a mob is pulled in BoT, I have to rush out and start spamming my taunt,disarm, and kick keys to get agro at all. As since the rest of the group are used to palidan's ability to grab enough agro to slow and debuff before the mob even enters the camp. My gripe is as much with the shamans and enchanters of my server as palidans and shadowknights. ( I just know that will end up quoted) As they don't give me enough time to get agro, as they are used to the instant agro knights can get.<br />
<br />
As it stands warriors in a tier 3 zone means more down time than a paladin because you only have 2 options as a healer/slower with a warrior: 1) You let the unslowed mob beat on the warrior tripling for high 600's for 10 seconds ( need a CH or at least an elixir and quick heal for sure) or so while he gets agro OR 2) Slow quickly and almost surely pull agro as a slower and need a heal, thus negateing the benefit of slowing early in the first place.<br />
<br />
A Palidan in a tier 3 zone ( I have been in groups with paladins tanking for DPS because there was no one else LFG , BAH. So don't say I wouldn't know ) A mob comes in, pali's cast 1 stun before it is even in camp, engage in melee. Now 2 things can happen, if the palidan has some AA and is using a good 2hander and has at least 60 DPS, he is set for the rest of the fight OR if the pali is using a 1hander or a lower end 2hander and is only managing about 30 DPS he has to stun maybe 3 more times throughout the fight to maintain agro. The slower casts as soon as the mob is in range, doesn't have to worry about agro, and the cleric isn't stressed cause he knows all he has to worry about is healing the palidan.<br />
<br />
So who are you going to pick ? the palidan or the warrior ? heck, I know which one I would pick if I was on an alt, go for the pali ! ( No, I am sadly not being sarcastic here)<br />
<br />
Now on to shadowknights. . . .  .<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a 62 shadowknight in PoV, she had roughly 2/3 of my DPS , and was not taunting or trying to get agro. If she cast even one, ONE blasted spell she got agro. She was pissed, I was pissed, and the cleric was pissed cause he was having to heal both of us.<br />
<br />
So we decide to let the SK tank since I can't, simply cannot hold agro and haver her cast :o . And unfortunately for the cleric :D the SK had about 3k less HP and about 200 less AC than I did buffed. So he was spamming those heals and was still losing mana at a tragic rate. So in the end, the SK ended up being hampered severely cause she could not cast any spells, and our group's kill rate was hampered because alot of an SK's damage is done by spells. <br />
<br />
Now I will explain why palis are getting the big end of the stick as opposed to SKs. <br />
<br />
1) More paladins than SKs, so you run into em more often.<br />
<br />
2) Palidans don't use stun to increase their DPS or to help the group ( other than interrupting casts and attaining agro) like SKs do with their spells.<br />
<br />
3) Palidans tend to be a good deal more arrogant about their aggro abilities than SKs, because they put even SKs to shame. A palidan bragging about how much better he gets agro than a warrior is like a slap in the face every time, because in a raid situation they hide behind you and let you take a beating cause they can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for those saying that just about any class can pull agro, this is true. BUT , not just about any class can pull more agro than a warrior every fight if you are chain pulling, you run OOM. That and the fact that most caster classes and other melee classes don't want agro, because unlike palidans and SKs they cannot take the hits.<br />
<br />
My opinion is spell agro in general needs to be toned down a bit somehow, debuffs and slows and stuns have gotten bigger and bigger over time, but taunt is still the same old thing. They are still using the old agro formula, it needs an overhaul that pays an equal amount of attention to melee damage  compared to spells.<br />
<br />
And for those of you saying just go get an EB weapon, or go get in a guild that can get one. Small problem, at least on quellious. I am in a guild that can easily beat down the AoW, and can more than likely tear through the majority of Ssra without much incident, IF the mobs were up. I would have had an EB weapon months ago if not every single other warrior that doesn't have one wants one on my server, making those spawns in particular very contested.<br />
<br />
And even if it was available, its still warped. Pali and SK spells ( the ones you need for agro, you don't need 65 spells) are easily attainable compared to an EB weapon.<br />
<br />
I'm done ranting, enjoy the hideously long post.</div></div><hr />

Maybe this would bring the stun and slow procs down to a level where a warrior could choose other proc types without losing important agro.<br />
Stun and slow might be considered a bit overpowered as agro proc in its current form.  <br />

back to hate weapons only ?<br />
