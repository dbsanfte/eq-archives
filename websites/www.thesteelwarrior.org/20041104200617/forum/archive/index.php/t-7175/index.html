<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finished off my VT key the other night.  (And what an unmitigated suck of a time sink it was... Getting that damn key nearly drove me out of the game.  And now to wait for two months until our rotation time comes up. Instanced zone! Instanced zone!) <br />
<br />
Had a question that I suppose I should have asked when I was starting as opposed to when just done:  Does anyone know of any patterns to the shard drops?  It really seemed streaky... You either got a bunch of shards in one session or you were there beating away on low xp mobs for hours at a time with no luck.  <br />
<br />
Some time of day?  Some mob up that prevents shard drops? Lower drop rates on weekends?  Just plain random and it only seems like you hit streaks?   <br />
<br />
Just trying to make this less of a complete pain in the butt for the next guy to come along.  Tho really I suppose I shouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is really just random. Certain mob names are more likely (sometimes the only) droppers. Some places, the deeper you go the more they drop. It's just a crappy set of camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like anything that relies on a random number generator, you are going to get some streaks either way (very fast, very slow) drop rates.<br />
<br />
If you play any dice orientated games will see this, like Risk or D&amp;D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the spirit of makin it better for those who haven't done it yet....I wish i would have gotten my shards when I was the appropriate levels for the camp and spaced em out over 20 levels instead of waiting till I was 65 and do em all in a couple weeks. Lot of those places can be solid spots to exp in if you do em at the right level. At 65 its just a grind. Grats on key :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can see what you mean about nearly driving you out of the game, camping those shards is pretty bad.  The Emp key parts actualy pulled our guild closer together but shards... Uggg, glad it's over and done with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once you start reaping in the rewards that is the candyland of Vex Thal, however, you will be glad you spent the time to camp the shards.</div></div><hr />
