<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All<br />
<br />
I am in an Elemental Guild, and am looking thru the 2 Handers available.<br />
<br />
Our Guild has not had Luck with BoW's or SeWS , only have 1 BoW and 2 SeWS's (1 Pally and 1 Warrior).<br />
<br />
So I am looking at other Alternatives for a 2 hander to use when Tanking some Elemental Mobs, Of Course will be adding Anger 3 to it for Agro, but wanna see if yall consider the one I am looking at as a Viable Weapon to use when Tanking PoP.<br />
<br />
I am looking to get ---Ornate Greatblade (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17740) <br />
<br />
With Anger 3, wouild it be a good weapon to use for Tanking in Elementals if cant get a BoW or SeWS ( this is pre-time of course)<br />
<br />
Or is there another option out there I should look for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grav you momo change your sig and guild link.  Your in RESILIENCE now goober :p <br />
<br />
Actually I am intrested in what you guys have to say also.  Most of our knights are using Ornate Greatblades now.  Those that arent have SEWS(1), BBB(1), or Emp sword.  Seeing as how all three classes are looking to be or using 2HS, what have your guilds done in the passing otu of these weapons?<br />
<br />
We are not a DKP guild and all loot is decided by Officers (sometimes non officers are invited to the discussion), and goes to the person that it would most benifit.</div></div><hr />

The whole point of a 2hs is to have a slightly higher delay to cut down on ripostes. 35/20 is incredibly fast and has the feel of a one-hander.<br />
<br />
Personally, with a bloodfrenzy, I'd get a BoC to offhand and not even bother with a 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The prot of dresolisk in sol ro has a 45/35 sword with a dot proc, 40 ac, 145hp and stats. I use it a lot with anger 3 and hold agro on all mobs I have tanked in elemental up to now. As a bonus it puts out a good amount of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wudgurorm</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if the plankton sword, from water. with agner 3 would be a viable option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's incredibly slow even when you are max hasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not get Ornate Gayblade. Ever. Riposte is no big deal on elemental mobs, its almost a non issue until elemental gods.... So dual wield, or get BoW / SEWS. Don't cheat yourself and get any asstastic 2hers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minet</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">about that plankton , i used to use it as my weapon of choice when i didnt want to take aggro from the MT,thinking of the slowness and lack of proc. but i often did indee take some aggro with it by accident. anyone else notice a wierd aggro generation with it in relation to its delay?. <br />
<br />
and on topic ,, dont get any 2h under 28 delay due to the damage bonus ect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made the misstake of trying Anger 3 on Ornate Greatblade, even with Call of Fire from AHR gloves it's crap agro compared to my Basalt Greatsword of the Protector. OG is crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate that sword.  I threatened to boot warriors who looted it.  Mostly because of the DoT proc.  There's always some yahoo who hits the wrong target and DoTs a mob we need to have mezzed.  Joy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Randomly DoTed mobs help keep Enc's on thier toes and OTers busy 8D.  I have already told my guild enc's that I will do this from time to time just to help alevite thier boredom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Randomly DoTed mobs get people /guildremoved :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your no fun =\.  I have onyl threated to do it so far, though MA did call wrong target once and I proced on it first swing.  I had to stand there nad take the beating but it was amusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate Greatblade is a fine weapon for non aggro DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
It drops like candy and if you equip enough melee with it ,you might even overrun a mobs 30 debuff slots with Boil blood~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate GB is a terrible tanking weapon, putting anger3 on it would be such a waste.  Just wait for a BoW or SEWs.  If you want more aggro, get a Orb of Sky of AHR gloves from VT.  If you just want less ripostes, toss on a shield, like the one from BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Budget</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">test</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use OG for my non-aggro weapon.  It does good DPS, and it doesn't pull aggro unintentionally.  I popped a 125 poison based DD on it for a little extra DPS.<br />
<br />
Based on the complete lack of aggro generation I've experienced with it, I would think that it would be a poor choice to try to augment and use as an aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />
