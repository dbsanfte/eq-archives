<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mightyberge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was wondering what startegy your guilds use to spawn  avatar of dust(spider spawn one). we did the other three avatars np but this one is giving us a problem. we can clear all the spiders  but we run into the probelm is dealing with the 3 red spawns after we kill first the big red one. just curious what other guilds are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few months back was a big thread on this event over on the Safehouse spoiler forum. Lotta strats posted. <br />
<br />
Here it is (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13611.topic)<br />
<br />
 Personally I think it's not nearly as hard as people say. Just annoying. As in any thread I'll tell you to just try it some and get your own strat blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
 My only advice is do not play a chanter for this event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The hardest part is trying to figure out which of the 3 spiders that all spawn in the same area you're actualyl on for purposes of split tanking.<br />
<br />
You could try to kite them too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did it the hard way every time :)<br />
<br />
DI + AE slow + PRAY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigrr7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We have a bard kite them all up to the island and gate them back one by one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nowadays with the amount of guilds in the EP's Dust ring is about the only thing you can count on being up on any given day,so when time is cleared and all the EP gods are dead we find ourselves doing this alot.<br />
<br />
We just Kill the big one and take out the 3 minis at the same time but this is all time geared and such...<br />
<br />
<br />
Previously what we did was this.We would camp the event at the intersection before the tunnel leading up to the island.One camp would set up on left,and the chanter ons right where the little oens would be dragged and taken care of.<br />
<br />
We would pull the First big spider in and tnak it down to 5% at which point an SK would take aggro form the war and run the mob back up into the tunnel a bit,A wizard would accompony the SK and take the big one out,then Monks bards whatever would pull one of the three off and bring it back down to the raid and we would kill them one at a time.If you have a low amount of people on or are short on tanks(as we often were) this strategy works very well.<br />
<br />
If you can field a sizaeable force and have tanks that like a bit of a challenge then the event is far more enjoyable just spawning the 3 splits in the raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
The spinning stun thing is the gayest thing ever though,and no matter how good we get at this I still despise the event.Its a good waste of time though I suppose.The 125 hp caster item that drps off the boss spider is exceptionally lame loot for the amount of pain and suffering one has to go through to get it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We have 1 warrior AE taunt + fortitude to give us time to split them up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">kite spiderlings on isle 3, everyone run away at 2% while the warrior finishes off the split mob. sow is your friend.<br />
<br />
as with most air mobs though, paladins make better tanks clearing the trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just keep hammering away at it and you'll get it eventually.  Took us 4 attempts to nail it.  When we finally did it seemed somewhat easy.  Annoying mind you, but not all that difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bring lots of people and you'll get it )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i dont think its a matter of lots of ppl, u need about 4-5 clerics, 2-3 well geared paladins, 1-2 warriors and the rest dps/buffers.<br />
<br />
other key is good puller, sk/bard should be able to bring the spiders in 1-2 at a time no problem. paladins stun on inc and hold agro just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think what Chatja meant was: zerg it and you don't need a strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Zerging works, but having enough people to there, so you can afford having people die and make mistakes, while you refine your strategy, was what I was refering to. Of course, that's zerging I guess p</div></div><hr />
