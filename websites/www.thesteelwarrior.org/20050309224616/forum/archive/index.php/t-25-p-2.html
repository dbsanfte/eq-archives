<br />
For the record, I don't wear dresses.  That is what shorts look like soakingfuckingwet.   When we signed up to &quot;climb a waterfall&quot; we didn't realize we'd actually be climbing the waterfall INSIDE the waterfall.  My army-surplas combat boots actually fell apart on the ride back from that climb (did you know they have a really sharp razor-like metal thing in the heel?)<br />
<br />
Shik, the picture was taken during a vacation to Jamaica on a cruise.  Cruise dudes follow people around and try to snap fun pictures so people can later prove they had a fun time.  I was usually annoyed by that but happened to get just such a pic taken during the waterfall climb and was astonished at how it turned out.  I guess I shouldn't have been so bitchy to the cruise dudes everywhere else!<br />
<br />
*edit* Damn, Kras!  You look like you are ready to pick up a blade of carnage irl and kick the shit outta all the bad guys */edit*</div></div><hr />

Your boots have what is called a &quot;Metal Shank&quot;...they were placed inside the sole of the boot to protect the wearer from objects puncturing our feet.  Everything from Caltrops (still used) to Punji Stakes, lol.  Pain in the ass in the Airport too...sets that sucker off faster than a M16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-17-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My mistake on the dress.  All wet like that it looks like you just came from the prom lol.  Anyhow, climbing a waterfall sounds like fun.  And if you want to know who took the picture, just zoom in on the guy's sunglasses :).</div></div><hr />

I thought it was so that military dudes could go all go go gadget MacGyver on bad guys in pesky situations.  All I now for certain is that it is definitely NOT for those who want to flounce about in water for about 3 hours.</div></div><hr />

even knowing you got the combat boots and shorts on climbing a rock waterfall makes you more kickass now :D</div></div><hr />

Hehehee...they actually work very well.  Ive never had any problems, anyway.  Im sorry they fell apart during your day of frollicking in the waterfalls.   :D   Were they old or in poor condition?  Oh well, you like you survived, hehee...<br />
