It is irresponsible NOT to teach our children about sex and prevention. To say that the parent should teach a child about sex is folly. Some parents DO NOT know all there is to know about sex, and as parents, will be somewhat biased, &quot;Do not have sex&quot;, is the best sexual education you would probably receive growing up a Christian as I did.</div></div><hr />

I was lucky and got this lesson at school even before I thought about it. It hs never forced me to get practical lesson, neither the willing of it (at least not before I got some hairs elsewhere than my top head;)), and when I found the girl I still love I wasn't nervous at all because we both knew what we wanted, what to do, and what not to do.<br />

lol that's a horific view :)<br />
<br />
BTW, it's harder to speak about it to our own child than to a friend's child. That's the main purpuse of a godfather (as the priest says during the fisrt benediction of a child) : &quot;he must lead the child, and give him anwser and advise, when the child has grown up and refuse his parent's lead.&quot; Unfortunatly those words are either not lissen or not understand by the whom that should have lissen and understand.<br />
I am a very religious person, however I am smart enougth to understand what is hidden in between rather than just apply to civilisations words as swords.<br />
<br />
 there is no difference between a right wing religious conservative and Al Kaida !<br />
they both have their own religious vision of the world, and want everybody to follow their mind. <br />
If Bush is really on war against terror, for freedom, he should clean his land too.</div></div><hr />

<br />

 <br />
<br />
The problem with the conservative view is that there is a large percentage of the population who simply choose to ignore the issue altogether.  I never got a fucking talk from my dad (Of course, my dad is a fucking asshole, even by my standards), and I'm assuming that there are quite a few other people who, if they wouldn't have learned it in some required (or parentally optional) course in high school, wouldn't know what the hell is going on either.  Educated &gt; Uninformed EVERY single time.  Being ignorant only leads to problems.  <br />
<br />
The other problem is simple nature.  Sex is a primal need for every species on this planet.  Telling kids who all of a sudden have gone just completely nuts from the new hormones flooding their bodies that &quot;abstinence is the only safe sex&quot; is just assinine.  Yeah, that worked real well in generations past huh.  I'm 25, my mom is 43.  Do the math here.  Telling kids not to do things hasn't worked ever, at any point in history.  What the hell makes you think it's going to work now?  Don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs...yes, all of our teenagers in this country are walking the straight and narrow aren't they?<br />
<br />
Teach kids what's happening to their bodies, why it's happening, and how not to be a fucking dumbass and get themselves or someone else pregnant, and how to avoid being one of the STD statistics, and you might actually have yourself an effective situation for dealing with nature.<br />
<br />
I understand that some people may want to not have someone else teaching their children about certain subjects, but if you feel the need to regulate how other people spend their time (Abortion, Pornography, hello?), then you best get ready to take your punishment when it comes back to you.  We can't be propogating an ignorant species, and if I can't spend my time watching 3 women, some whipped cream and a midget, then your dipshit kids are gonna learn the reality of how life is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is actually a misrepresentation of the conservative and liberal view.  It could more accuratly be summed up as follows:<br />
<br />
conservative view -&gt; teaching abstinance and nothing but abstinance.<br />
<br />
liberal view -&gt; teaching abstinance as a primary and best way to go, but do include info on birth control.<br />
<br />
It is generally understood that something has to be said in school on the subject, the debate is much more on what is presented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets face it...Abstinance as a policy/education program is ineffective. Both Nature and youth curiosity are working against you. These are too powerful for words/preaching alone to overcome.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with you, I'm just going off on a bit of a tangent here.  First off, if people want to teach their children at home that abstinance is the correct moral path, then by all means I believe they should do so.  But doesn't it make sense that the child should be allowed to have access to enough information so that if for some reason they decide, god forbid, that mom and dad aren't necessarily correct in their beliefs, that the results are the least harmful as can be arranged?<br />
<br />
Which is worse, a kid that rejects their parent's teaching about abstinance and because no one ever taught them about birth control, gets pregnant or gets someone else pregnant and the result is an abortion?  Or a kid that rejects their parent's teaching, but because they've been exposed to what birth control is and does, doesn't get pregnant or get someone else pregnant?  Personally, while I believe in a woman's right to choose, I also firmly believe that abortion really should not be used as a birth control method.  But that requires that we expose our children to OTHER birth control methods.   If we don't do that, all we do is increase the likelihood that premarital sex will end in an unwanted pregnancy and potentially an abortion to go with it.<br />
<br />
So, logically speaking sex education might lead to a higher percentage of teenagers experimenting with sex before they're ready.  But it should also lead to fewer of those experiments ending up in pregnancy and abortions.  So which would the parents of America prefer, teenagers having a bit more sex but doing so safely and with fewer pregnancies?  Or teenagers having a bit less sex (because abstinance will never be a universal cure, it never has been and never will be)  but those that do have sex have more unwanted pregnancies and abortions? <br />
<br />
Keeping teenagers ignorant does not benefit them or society.  The decision to have or not have sex is one that many teenagers are exposed to on weekly or even sometimes a daily basis.  The truly moral path would be to accept that which is not completely within our control and to take steps to minimize the damage that will result.   Most people just can't monitor their teens 24/7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What did you think was going to happen?<br />
<br />
Speaking as one of the 48% in the reality based community, I hope they get just what they wanted. Of course, I get really offensive delinating exactly what they wanted, because I define what they wanted as what Bush is doing, so I go to great lengths to point out the following.<br />
<br />
 If you voted for Bush, and you read the obituary of a current soldier who died in Iraq, you wanted him there.<br />
<br />
 If you voted for Bush, and you found out your company is either relocating your job overseas at worst or dropping your health care at best, you wanted it to happen.<br />
<br />
 If you voted for Bush, and some fundie comes along and lobbies to get rid of something you enjoyed, you wanted that to happen as well.<br />
<br />
 If you're a Dubya lover, I could care less if I offend you. Everything the man does now is on YOUR head. Not mine. If the dollar goes into the toilet because you couldn't elect a man with even a shred of fiscal discipline and economic good sense, you deserve to be poor and miserable. If five soldiers a day die in Iraq for no good reason because Bush put them there because of misguided neo-Trotskyite foreign policy, you asked for it. If you find your civil liberties being unduly restricted because his new Attorney General calls them 'quaint', don't come crying to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">speaking on the sex issue...<br />
<br />
I feel it's far better for kids to have sex, knowing ( by being taught by those who know)what it's all about, the risks, and so on, than by the often erroneous information supplied by their friends, easily accessible porn, and the like. They WILL learn about it, it's just a question of from whom they learn it from.<br />
<br />
I don't have an issue with kids having sex, as long as they walk into it of their own free will, as a conscious decision they make, and that they're safe about it... in short, that they're not stupid about it. Paternal &quot;I'm gonna kill that kid if he has sex with my daughter&quot; feelings aside, I believe it's far better to discourage sex, but to also tell them that IF they choose to do it, they choose the right time, with the right person, don't get pushed into it, and damn well be smart about it.... use protection. And oh, by the way, this is what you can use for protection, and here's where you can get it, and if you're too embarassed, I will help you obtain it.<br />
<br />
I believe there's far more problems caused with two kids bungling about not really knowing what they're doing or what it's about (pregnancy and the like) than if they walk into it with eyes wide open, knowing what it's about, and how to be safe about it IF they choose to do it.<br />
<br />
In short... yes, preach abstinence, but provide them with everything they need to know, and encourage them to be safe about it IF they do not choose abstinence. not the ultimatum, &quot;Sex? Don't do it, that's all you need to know, and all you are going to find out about it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
religion is based on unalteration (typo :P). your view is THE VIEW of world<br />

and in their view, our body is inpure. and any pleasure coming from body is a sin. sex is a sin, desire is a sin. so you hide it, you controll it, you DONT TALK about it.<br />
<br />
ignore it, and it wont touch you<br />
<br />
look to what women have suffered from 2000 years. castitity belts, hundreds of socials convention to hide their body, brainwashing sermons about how woman caused the original sin (and for this they have to suffer for it, yeah sure  :rolleyes: ) the myth of virginity (if you are not a virgin, you are impure) etc etc<br />
<br />
fuck that. fuck religion and your castrating view of life. what this caused? millions of women (and men too) with their mind destroyed due to their bad relationship with sex. women who avoid any phisical contact, who humiliate themself believing there's a god up there who gives a shit about them. Women who cant have an orgasm because their mind doesnt allow it (unlike us, for a woman mind is what controll sex. for you why women dont give a shit about porn movies?)<br />

do you believe frigidity is a phisical problem? HA!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without a doubt, I think by the time kids are dealing with &quot;sex issues&quot; you cannot watch them 24/7.  By this time you have to just stay involved and hope you did the right job when raising.  Trust them to make the right decision, all the while cultivating that atmosphere of intelligent conversation.  Dont get me wrong, Im a hell of a disciplinarian in my home...but I temper this with a wee bit of intelligence, hehee, and love.  My kids make some dumbass decisions from time to time, but overall, Im proud of them.<br />

OMG, my daughter is 14 this month and Im shitting bricks.  Every night I hope Ive done the right thing.<br />

<br />
So when it came to the time when I felt ready for sex, I knew the basics, and I knew the risks...mum was none to pleased when she found out, but I was at that point an adult so nothing she could do except try to chastise me. Still makes me and my girlfriend sleep in separate rooms whenever i go visit home...*sigh*<br />
<br />
So i guess I'm trying to say education is the way to go, teenagers will be teenagers, and there's nothing you can say or do (bar locking them away) that will stop them trying things if they want...so best to let them go into situations fully prepared and ready for the possible outcomes.</div></div><hr />

Again, ignorant as hell. Just because someone votes for someone, does not mean that they want EVERYTHING that elected official is held responsible for does; and just because a soldier dies, does not mean that the voter, or even Bush, WANTED that. Voting for any candidate only means that they expect that official to do a better job at his position than the other candidate(s) would have, and that they have enough concern about their country that they will vote to make sure their voice is heard (whether it be republican, democrat, or other). And keep in mind, BOTH sides have lobbies.<br />

You may not want it, but since you didn't vote AGAINST him, anyone can conclude that you did want it.  Welcome to the world of politics.  Senators sometimes vote against spending bills because of riders attached to the bill, not because of the bill itself, but that doesn't stop anyone from saying you were against spending (because that's what your vote said).<br />
<br />
Take the example of the Medicaid Bill...that was a HUGE bill, but less than half of the bill was actually medicaid (probably around 1/3, I need to check).  The rest were riders attached to it because that bill was guaranteed to pass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Voting for any candidate only means that they expect that official to do a better job at his position than the other candidate(s) would have, and that they have enough concern about their country that they will vote to make sure their voice is heard (whether it be republican, democrat, or other). <br />
<br />
The problem is that you don't get any way to say you only wanted one part of what you voted for.  You vote for something because you like one part, well your vote is actually saying you wanted all of it.<br />

You're right.  But if I'm not mistaken I believe that the President has line item veto authority on spending bills.  So if there are items contained in the bill which really should not be there, the proper thing to do would be for the President to individually veto them.  Of course, this being a world of politics, he's not going to do that since it was his Republican croonies that passed it in the first place.</div></div><hr />

My guess is the vast majority of teenage pregnancies and STD's simply boils down to carelessness, stupidity, and haste.  I, and all those around me had sex education in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades (yes I went do a different school for each ... was a navy kid).  <br />
<br />
Those that I knew who got pregnant and/or STD's were either being very careless or were simply straight up loose whores ... it was never that they didn't know what condoms or birth control pills were.  Last time i checked pills are prescription only.  They're kids trying to get away with something they know they aren't supposed to do ... they're not about to go and ask mom or dad if they can have some pills so they can fuck all they want.<br />
<br />
Condoms break and/or malfunction, not to mention the fact that even if they work correctly they never make you 100% safe from STD's.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  Increasing education above and beyond what is currently in place really won't help with jack shit.  Abstinence IS the answer ... but i realize not everyone wants to keep that the primary approach.  We already have sex education in all public schools across the nation ... and it covers everything from pregnancy, condoms, STDs to puberty ... you name it.

<br />
I was in Ireland last week. Sitting around watching rugby, and a commercial comes on. Some ad for something er other, but the guy in the ad is wearing no clothes, and runs away from the camera and through his house at one point. Some guy's ass broadcasted right into the livingroom of Dubliners!<br />
Living in the states as I do and knowing what a threat to civil and moral society any form of nudity is when it occurs in conjunction with American football programming on broadcast TV, I naturally assumed that civil order in Dublin would collapse before I could get out of the country. Boy, was I sweating bullets.<br />
Days went by. The ad, presumably, was on again. Still no riots, still no fornicators on the steps of 800-year-old churches. Just people lining up at the DART train to go into work under cloudy skies. In the evenings, the pubs no more or less crowded, and the bartenders were still pouring Guiness pints mostly full, letting them settle, then topping them off. In no hurry, really. Rugby on again, the Aussies beat the Ireland side at the end, so bad news there. Yet, unbelievably, still there were no fornicators on the steps of 800-year-old churchs. <br />
I wasn't fooled by the mere surface calm, though. Complete social collapse was just a matter of time.<br />
My plane left on schedule. Taking the taxi to the airport early in the morning, I looked down the nearly empty and very damp streets of an old city starting to come to life in a workaday half-light, the grey of the north Atlantic crowding the dawn, newspaper trucks picking up their bundles, traffic lights fully operational in the quiet intersections.<br />
No doubt it was the hush before the storm.<br />
I still can't believe I made it out of there in time and alive.<br />
Close one, huh?</div></div><hr />

Some schools have banned sex ed except for the promotion of abstinence Apo.<br />
<br />
Edit:  For your enlightenment:<br />
<br />
http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about/president/020416_yale.html<br />
<br />
You know, if the priorities of the Bush administration are enacted, you might all have raised your hands. Some 500-million tax dollars have been spent so far to fund abstinence-only sex education - about $100 million a year since 1996. President Bush is asking for an increase — to $133 million for &quot;abstinence-only&quot; programs in his 2003 budget. <br />
<br />
Let's be clear about what this means, and what our tax dollars are funding. Abstinence only means just that abstinence only. It means banning access to real sex education. According to the federal definition, the exclusive purpose of abstinence-only education is to &quot;teach the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity.&quot;4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Education is something which is largely monitored and controlled by the State.

<br />
Even so, by the time kids are having sex they know what safe sex is and what a condom is.  If they get around enough at young ages and are permitted to get away with it, chances are they've been 'educated' long before sex ed even comes into the picture.<br />
<br />
STD's and teenage pregnancies are the result of stupidity and carelessness.  The more you do it and the more people you do it with ... the worse it is.  Abstinence is the real answer ... birth control and 'safe' sex are alternate temporary solutions.  I seriously doubt you can provide me with many cases of STD's and unwanted pregnancies where the kids honestly didn't know what sex or the safe practices therein were.  The only possible case that comes to my mind is the myth that you cannot impregnate if you pull out before blowing your load ... and they never taught me that in Sex Ed.</div></div><hr />

After all ... if our kids choose to smoke pot (do something they shouldn't do) then we damn well better make sure they have a safe way to bypass/dodge the law (the rules of the parents) and not get caught.<br />

A slight stretch but the same principle.  It's not something that kids should be doing in the first place *unless* they are ready to accept the consequences.  If they, fully understanding that the primary biological goal in having sex is to make babies ... and are ready to deal with the child and accept the consequences ... then they should go for it.  Kids don't see it this way though ... it's all about the fun .. all about the pleasure.<br />
<br />
No, i don't think sex should only be for makin babies .. but i do realize that every time i choose to do it that i run the risk of making one.  Therefore caution is always used and it's never done randomly with folks i couldnt see myself raising a child with.<br />

Teen sex is the leading cause of highschool dropout and abortions.  I won't get into the politics of abortions suffice to say that I find them on the whole (there are exceptions) morally detestable when used as a form of birth control (yes this includes &quot;oopsies&quot;).  I do, however, respect the laws and opinions of others.</div></div><hr />

My point is not saying Dem or Rep is better. IMO what the Republican party is supposed to stand for is what I believe to be best. I know that GW does not represent that, as most Reps nowadays do not. <br />
<br />
And no, voting for a candidate DOES NOT state that you believe and WANT everything that candidate stands for. It IS a choice of who you agree with moreso overall, not entirely, and it is still better to vote than to remain silent and bitch about where things are headed. I vote and bitch about it, because I do feel that there is little that can actually be done to force our government to change and actually represent our interests again... and that applies to both parties. I do not believe there has ever been a candidate who I agreed with 100%... hell, probably not even more than 50%. Both parties have some good ideas that I agree with, but neither encompasses the whole of my beliefs. I tend to vote Republican because of what they are 'suppposed' to stand for, and while they do not follow said precepts any more, the Democratic party does believe that the government should be responsible for every aspect of our lives. I consider myself Republican insomuch as what they purport to stand for; I am not a Republican, though, by today's 'standard.</div></div><hr />

Are you actually trying to say that is the only things that have changed in that time?  Or are you trying to suggest that all the other changes have had zero effect on STD's and abortion?  Or are you just quoting the party line, without thinking about what you are saying?<br />
<br />
<br />
sex ed is taught in schools with the main purpose of teaching the &quot;right way to be promiscuous without getting stds.<br />
<br />
Actually, at the very least the far majority(worded so as to be safe, there are probably some program somewhere where this is not true) of sex ed programs teach abstinance as the only safe, sure method to avoid unwanted pregnancy, STD's, and as emotionally more healthy.  The whole conflict is whether to teach about things like birth controll, and masturbation, and so on.  Knowledge is power, and part of schooling is there to prepare people for life after school.  Denying people information that will be useful for them, simply because you do not like it, is simply foul.<br />

<br />
Most rape is not about sex, but is about power.  The rest is people who lack the social skills to know that 'no' means no.  All the sex education in the world, or lack of same, will not effect rape rates.  Part of(tho not in total) the reason rape cases have gone up over the past 40 years is that rape is actually reported more often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would rather be exposed to the inconveniencies attending too much liberty than those attending too small a degree of it. <br />
<br />
Thomas Jefferson, letter to Archibald Stewart, Dec 23, 1791<br />
<br />
If, then, the control of the people over the organs of their government be the measure of its republicanism, and I confess I know no other measure, it must be agreed that our governments have much less of republicanism than ought to have been expected; in other words, that the people have less regular control over their agents, than their rights and their interests require. <br />
<br />
Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Taylor, May 28, 1816<br />
<br />
My construction of the constitution is very different from that you quote. It is that each department is truly independent of the others, and has an equal right to decide for itself what is the meaning of the constitution in the cases submitted to its action; and especially, where it is to act ultimately and without appeal. <br />
<br />
Thomas Jefferson, letter to Samuel Adams Wells, May 12, 1819<br />
<br />
On every unauthoritative exercise of power by the legislature must the people rise in rebellion or their silence be construed into a surrender of that power to them? If so, how many rebellions should we have had already? <br />
<br />

<br />
The boisterous sea of liberty is never without a wave. <br />

The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government. <br />
<br />
Thomas Jefferson, letter to The Republican Citizens of Washington County, Maryland, March 31, 1809<br />
<br />
And here is a quote straight out of the Federalist Papers (Federalist 51), the series of articles publish in support of ratification of the new Constitution when the Articles of Confederation failed miserably (how many of you even know what the Articles of Confederation were? Not many I'd wager).<br />
<br />
But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.<br />
<br />
So checks and balances built into our system of government specifically to allow &quot;ambition to counteract ambition&quot;.  The founding fathers greatly feared an authoritarian government that would dictate to them all the rights and wrongs of life and require they adhere strickly to the government's list of things that could be done.  Would the founding fathers have smiled upon a woman's right to choose?  No, they probably wouldn't have.  But it is very likely that given their pragmatism they would have realized that it was an area where the Federal government should not become involved.  They would have realized that it, like many other things of importance, should be left up to the individual states to decide as their conscience dictated.<br />
<br />
In Roe v. Wade the decision was not that abortion was an inalienable civil right.  But rather that a woman has a civil right to privacy with regards to what she does with her body and the state has an interest in her unborn offspring.  These two interests  are expected to both be honored.  The state has a right to regulate how and when abortions are given.  It does not have the right to completely remove abortion as an option.  Below is a fairly key and significant paragraph from the decision.  Basically they are saying that the interests of women to do what they believe is correct with their body can be regulated to a reasonable extent by the state.  That means a reasonable extent.    <br />
<br />
On the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some amici argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive. The Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905) (vaccination); Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927) (sterilization). <br />
<br />
<br />
We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.</div></div><hr />

That's why you teach them about contraception, and make it readily available, just in case. Much better and less risky to have the contraception available, just in case, then to say, no, don't do it, and have no contraception available at all. That puts the risk of pregnancy way up if they do choose to have sex. And face it, some will.<br />
<br />
No, i don't think sex should only be for makin babies .. but i do realize that every time i choose to do it that i run the risk of making one.  Therefore caution is always used and it's never done randomly with folks i couldnt see myself raising a child with.<br />

That's where you pass on those very mores and morals to your children.<br />

Teen sex is the leading cause of highschool dropout and abortions. <br />
<br />
Teen sex isn't. Teen PREGNANCY is. Teens can have all the safe sex they want, it's not going to cause people to drop out. It's only the pregnancy that does. Hence the education and borth control.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather have a son of mine have to carry a condom in his wallet, and go out and have safe sex, than to tlel my son, &quot;if you have sex I'll kick your ass, you're too young&quot;, and have that son come to me one day, saying, &quot;Dad... I got my girlfriend pregnant&quot; because he had unprotected sex because no protection was available. But that's just me.</div></div><hr />

yep, I would prefer tell him &quot;if you have sex I'll kick your ass, you're too young&quot; but that school teach him &quot;safe sex&quot; so that he doesn't tell me &quot;Dad... I got my girlfriend pregnant&quot;<br />
<br />
 =&gt; giving sex education at school permit parents to command their children to not have sex, and to protect the children that don't follows their parents orders/advise. thus it's a double protection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once upon a time most teenagers made it through to adulthood without promiscuous sex ... most of them actually made it with no premarital sex.<br />
<br />
A pretty bold statement.  On what do you base it? Lets go back to that speech I linked that you apparently have refused to even bother to read, shall we?<br />
<br />
As a result, teen pregnancy rates, birthrates and abortion rates have dropped dramatically over the last few decades. In fact, teen pregnancy rates were at their highest in the 1950s. They decreased a lot from 1960 to until the mid-80s, when the &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; brought deep cuts to family planning and other social programs. Then, in the last decade, they've dropped 20 percent more.<br />
 <br />
I'd like to see the factual basis on which you have concluded that more teens are having premarital sex today than they were 10 or 20 years ago.  You're stating very broad speculation as absolute fact.  Back that up with something more than &quot;Apo says&quot;.  Which is it?  People are having less premarital sex now which causes the reduced numbers in teen pregnancy, birthrates and abortion rates or are they using birth control more effectively thereby causing the reductions in these numbers?  Something MUST be working, and it isn't abstinence only, since that has only been in effect over the last 4 years and would hardly be the primary cause of the drop in those areas in the 1990s.<br />
<br />
But maybe you doubt those figures, so here's a second source.  I've copied the summary of the report below:<br />
<br />
http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/state_pregnancy_trends.pdf<br />
<br />
Rates of pregnancy, birth and abortion among U.S. teenagers continued their downward trend in 2000 (Table 1). Nationwide, the teenage pregnancy rate declined by 2% between 1999 and 2000 (from 85.7 to 83.6 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15–19). From 1986 to 2000, the rate dropped by 22% and, more importantly, fell by 28% since peaking in 1990.<br />
<br />
The birthrate for teenagers also declined by 2% between 1999 and 2000 (from 48.8 to 47.7 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19). The 2000 rate was 5% lower than the 1986 rate and 23% lower than the peak rate of 61.8 births per 1,000 women reached in 1991.<br />
<br />
Teenagers’ abortion rate in 2000 was 24.0 per 1,000 women aged 15–19—some 3% lower than the 1999 rate of 24.7 per 1,000. From 1986 to 2000, the abortion rate dropped by 43%; during the same period, the proportion of teenage pregnancies ending in abortion fell from 46% to 33%—a decline of more than one-quarter (27%).<br />
<br />
White, black and Hispanic adolescents have experienced declines in pregnancy rates, although to different extents (Table 1). Among black women aged 15–19, the nationwide pregnancy rate fell by 32% between 1990 and 2000 (from 224 to 153 per 1,000); among white teenagers, it declined by 28% during that time (from 24 to 71 per 1,000). The pregnancy rate among Hispanic teenagers, who may be of any race, increased from 162 to 170 per 1,000 women aged 15–19 between 1990 and 1992, but then fell to 138 per 1,000 by 2000—15% below the 1990 rate.<br />
<br />
Teenage pregnancy rates in 2000 varied widely by state, ranging from 42 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in North Dakota to 113 per 1,000 in Nevada and 128 per 1,000 in the District of Columbia (Table 2). The highest state adolescent pregnancy rates after Nevada’s were in Arizona, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas. Vermont, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Maine had the  lowest rates after North Dakota’s.<br />
<br />
Teenage birthrates for 2000 also varied considerably by state (Table 2). The highest rates (66–71 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19) were in Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, Arkansas and New Mexico; in the District of Columbia, 56 births occurred per 1,000 teenage women. New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, North Dakota and Maine had the lowest rates (23–29 per 1,000).<br />
<br />
Statewide teenage abortion rates were highest (36–47 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–19) in New Jersey, New York, Maryland, California and Nevada (Table 2); the rate in the District of Columbia was 55 per 1,000. Teenagers in Utah, South Dakota, Kentucky and North Dakota had the lowest abortion rates (6–8 per 1,000).<br />
<br />
Overall in 2000, one-third of pregnancies among 15–19-year-olds ended in abortion (Table 2). However, in New Jersey, 60% of teenage pregnancies ended in abortion, as did at least 50% in New York, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. By contrast, only 13% of pregnancies among teenagers in Kentucky and Utah ended in abortion; the proportion was also relatively low (15–16%) in Louisiana, Arkansas and South Dakota.<br />
<br />
Between 1988 and 2000, teenage pregnancy rates declined in every state and in the District of Columbia (Table 3). Teenage birthrates increased between 1988 and 1992 in all but four states (Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire and New Jersey); birthrates then fell in all states between 1992 and 2000. By 2000, they were lower than the 1998 rates in all states except Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska and Texas. Teenage abortion rates between 1988 and 2000 declined in every state except Mississippi and Wyoming.<br />
<br />
Of the states with available 2000 pregnancy data by race and Hispanic ethnicity (Table 4), Arkansas had the highest the pregnancy rate per 1,000 non-Hispanic white teenagers (77 per 1,000). Pregnancy rates among this group were also high in other southern states: Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky and South Carolina (71–73 per 1,000). North Dakota had the lowest pregnancy rate among non-Hispanic white teenagers (33 per 1,000).<br />
<br />
Pregnancy rates per 1,000 black women aged 15–19 were highest in New Jersey (209 per 1,000), and next highest in Wisconsin, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Oregon (161–177 per 1,000). They were lowest in Utah, New Mexico, West Virginia, Rhode Island and Colorado (71–114 per 1,000).<br />
<br />
Georgia, Arizona, Tennessee, Colorado and Delaware had the highest pregnancy rates among Hispanic women aged 15–19 (154–169 per 1,000). In contrast, pregnancy rates among Hispanic teenagers were lowest in Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota and Ohio (71–115 per 1,000).<br />
<br />
Overall, approximately 822,000 pregnancies occurred among women aged 15–19 in 2000; roughly two-thirds of these pregnancies were among 18–19-year-olds (Table 5). In general, states with the largest numbers of teenagers also had the greatest number of teenage pregnancies. California reported the highest number of adolescent pregnancies (113,000), followed by Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois (with about 37,000–80,000 each). The smallest numbers of teenage pregnancies were in Vermont, North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota and Alaska, all of which reported fewer than 2,000 pregnancies among women aged 15–19.<br />
<br />
This report concludes with a series of tables that were used to calculate rates of<br />
pregnancy, birth and abortion in 2000, including numbers of teenage pregnancies, births, abortions and miscarriages, as well as population counts (Tables 5–9). A parallel set of tables of 1999 data (Tables 10–16) follows the 2000 set.<br />
<br />
So it's time to prove up Apo.   You say lots of stuff.  You prove or substantiate almost none of it.   Lay out the factual basis on which you are forming your conclusions, or admit that you really are just voicing your opinion.  An opinion not really supported by the facts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no problem with schools teaching sex ed.  I had it in highschool, too.  Where I have a problem with it is when they teach that sex is perfectly natural and nothing is wrong with it.  It may be natural, but like all things, there are consequences.  They should also be taught that by choosing to have sex, they put themselves at risk for pregnancy and disease that may have detrimental effects on the rest of thier lives.  I don't like the idea that someone else is teaching this based on the premice that they are going to do it anyway, so teach them to do it right.  That's not true.  Some kids will actually listen when you say not to do something because it may have severe consequences.  I was one of those kids.  And I guarantee you that my kids will know that, too.  In the end, it's the parents who will make the difference, whether we like it or not.  Schools are there to teach the facts.  Parents are the one who must teach the morals.  At least, I hope that's what will happen and does happen.  I know I for one don't want my kids learning morals from a teacher or politician.<br />
<br />
As for porn, I look at it like smoking.  What I do in my own place is my own business.  I do think that internet porn is way out of hand and needs some controls put on it (pop ups of a naked woman riding 3 guys when I'm looking at a news site is just ridiculous).  You should have to actually go get the porn, not have it thrown in your face all the time.  Once again, Bush's morals or anyone elses for that matter do not apply to me or everyone else.  It's a personal choice and nobody has the right to make it for me.  Making it illegal is wrong, but I do think some controls are necessary.  Not controls on the people, controls on the companies putting it out where it doesn't belong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;&lt;Schools are there to teach the facts. Parents are the one who must teach the morals.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
this of course assumes that morals are some relative thing that differs from one person to another. many people believe and teach this. i do not. can a moral ever be elevated to the status of &quot;fact&quot;? if God exists then yes. if he does not then no. if we do not believe he exists but he does in fact exist then yes. if we believe he exists but in fact does not then no. in other words it does not depend on what we believe, only on whether he exists and gave these morals to us.<br />
<br />
suppose a school were to teach you that smoking is not bad for you. though many believe that smoking should be legal even though it is bad for us very few of us would actually agree that the schools should teach that it is not bad for us. we would say &quot;they shouldnt teach that because it is a lie&quot;.<br />
<br />
ok understood so far. along comes the subject of morals. some of us believe that doing immoral things damages our (or others') relationship with God. we believe that if we warn people of this fact then we will save them a lot of grief. there are many many who disagree with me about certain acts damaging our relationship with God. so as i would warn a child - yes even someone else's child - that running out into the street without looking is a good way to get run over so i will also warn others who are not my children that certain acts of immorality are going to cause them great harm.<br />
<br />
now i smoke because many years ago i showed a lack of good sense and a lack of self control. i then got myself in a very bad health habit that is amazingly hard to break. nevertheless i would never teach others simply because i have this habit that smoking is 'not bad for me&quot;. similarly if a school taught explicitly or by neglect that sex outside of marriage is not bad for the soul then i would say they are simply deceiving the population to their harm.<br />
<br />
but what about the government? should they legislate morality? but of couse they already do! when the government says &quot;though shalt not commit murder or else we will throw you in prison perhaps for life&quot; they are legislating against one form of bad morals to be sure. but what if we take this example and extend it to the extreme, for example by making chocalate illegal since it is &quot;bad for us&quot;. we get into the very real problem that the government is simply ineffectual to legislate upright behaviour down to the nit-picking extremes. the price we would pay for giving the government such control over our every action is an utter lack of freedom and a police state that gives the goverment so much power that they become (by virtue of the fact that they are run by fallible and corrupt men just as we are) a very real threat to our safety.<br />
<br />
so obviously there is a line we have to set over the topic of &quot;just how much power should the government be given to legislate matters of right and wrong&quot;. and yes i believe the government should not regulate chocolate consumption but parents can. but matters of pornography? to me it is a severe enough matter that the government should enforce the illegality of it. others, even among those who say its wrong would say &quot;its not bad enough to be policed&quot;. what such people and i disagree on is what side of the line it's on, not whether it is wrong per se.<br />
<br />
but among those who say it isnt wrong at all ill say this. its a democracy. i have a vote, you have a vote. i respect your vote in the sense that if your side of the issue wins i will not try to unilaterally punish someone who violates the principle that was made legal even though i voted the other way. but i will vote my conscience all the same and if my side of the issue wins a particular vote i would hope you who disagree with it would also respect that the majority has spoken and this time you lost.<br />
<br />
well the record shows that i am very often on the losing side of these morality votes. and it makes me angry that some things like abortion which i consider an abomination are not only not prosecutable but those who head the industry like planned parenthood are even allowed to come to schools as guest speakers to teach the kids. a recent poll showed the pro-abortionists outnumbering the anti-abortionists almost 2-1. im so much in the minority that i will frankly tell people i believe it will always be legal in my lifetime, notwithstanding any supreme court rulings that might come.<br />
<br />
and you know what really galls me? this same government who wont legislate issues of serious morality will tell me that if i dont return a glass bottle to the store i bought it from i will be fined a dollar! i lose my one dollar deposit because i threw away a bottle! im punished worse for throwing a bottle away than i would be for any of the issues we are discussing here. yes i can install porn pop-up adds on YOUR computer without your permission and i will get less punishment than i will get for throwing a bottle away. (tangent ... if you are getting porn pop-up adds you really really need to get ad-aware and stop using that trashy microsoft browser).<br />
<br />
if we cant get the abortion and pornography issues bumped to the other side of 'the fine line' can we at least get the bottle deposit law bumped back to the &quot;let the government stay out of it&quot; side?<br />
<br />
but i digress.<br />
<br />
i grew up in a very &quot;religious&quot; church denomination. we had all kinds of rules of worship and procedure, all kinds of rituals that if we didnt follow them we were given major guilt-trips. and many of these rules as far as i could ever tell were absolutely arbitrary and pointless. violating such rules hurt nobody. when i got older i left this church. so although i am a christian i do not consider myself &quot;religious&quot; if &quot;religious&quot; is defined by the colloquial definition of &quot;follower of rituals&quot;. the only document i consider an authority anymore is the bible. do i always follow it? no. if i said yes you wouldnt believe me. but like i said about smoking i can do something wrong and know its wrong yet i will not try to justify myself by telling everyone it is right. and if i did i would be lying and that's one more vice i would have to add to all my others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately as people age, a sex=sin upbringing turns too often into massive hang ups. The most distrssing is a reliance on alcohol to break down deeply ingrained inhibitions. I'm afraid I can't abide a partner that &quot;needs&quot; a couple of drinks to get into the mood.<br />
<br />
The Bible may be many things, but it's absolutely NOT a manual on safe, responsible, and healthy sex. It isn't a physics text nor a biology text with chapters on evolution. When knowledge is at odds with the Bible, it exposes the ignorance of people at the time it was written (and in some cases the ignorance of those reading it). Not necessarily an ignorance about theology, but an ignorance about darned near everthing else.<br />

<br />
As an outside observer, that is what truly horrified me.  Not that some priests turn out the be pedophiles, every group is going to have a bad apple from time to time.  But how the church dealt with it, that just left me floored.   It's one thing to find that you have someone acting as a priest that has absolutely no business being a priest.  It's another to cover up that fact and rather than taking corrective action to ensure they don't have the opportunity to abuse their trust again you instead move them on to a different post where they can repeat the same behavoir.  What if rather than a priest we were talking about a school teacher or a doctor?  What would be people's reaction if the school superintendent or the hospital administrator just moved someone strongly suspected or out right proven to be a pedophile to a different facility?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">regarding what church it was i left it out so as not to focus the discussion on who we are going to slam today (though yes some of you will point out im not above criticizing individuals). it could have been any of a number of organized religious institutions.<br />
<br />
christianity in its roots was based on the teachings of Christ and uses the bible as its primary text. but we all know that in many religions there are droves of people often high high up in the establishment who discount great portions of teachings of the scriptures. my explanation of this fact is that where power is to be had the power hungry will be dredged up to fill many of those positions. we see it in religion government business and everywhere else where positions of authority are to be had. who did Jesus criticize above everyone else? the prostitutes? the wicked secular rulers? the murderers? none of them. the ones he criticized most harshly were the religious leaders of the day. he said &quot;they tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. everything they do is done for men to see.&quot; he went on to say &quot;you shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. you yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.&quot; if the religious elite were like that back then should we be surprised if they are the same today?<br />
<br />
so then do not assume that when a person extols the greatness of Christ and of the scriptures that he is necessarily aligning himself most of the established religious institutions and churches. they do not necessarily go together. furthermore if any of you is disillusioned with christianity over a bad experience with a church or a university perhaps it is time to give the simplicity of the bible apart from these institutions a chance.<br />
<br />
let me point out another thing with an analogy. suppose you were some ordinary guy and you noticed a lovely woman whom to you was perfect .. ideal in every way. suppose she were in love with you. perfect situation right? and suppose you told everyone you knew how wonderful this woman was. but now suppose your friends said to you &quot;hypocrit! how dare you tell us how wonderful she is when you yourself are just an ordinary guy like us with all the faults and sins that we have. come to think of it you arent even very good looking!' are you really wrong in this instance to tell people how wonderful she is? are you lying by saying so? the same goes for Jesus. i do not have to even be a good person for me to speak of his wonders truthfully. the beauty of it all is he says all we have to do to be saved is come to him and find refuge in him. and we can do so even if we are &quot;bad people&quot;. this is evidenced in Jesus's statement that &quot;the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of rightousness [jesus] and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did.&quot; the analogy is realistic. just as in the example of the girl in love with you and the only thing you have to do to get her for yourself is believe her and accept her and the same is true of jesus.<br />

<br />
All you whiners and bitchers complaining about bush's re-election saying &quot;thanks RED STATERS&quot; etc are fairly amusing when you consider all of the &quot;count every vote&quot; (which i completely agree with) crowd on the left in the US.  Those people all have a vote, and they have different issues and views of this country.  And from what I can tell they outnumbered the folks bitching and whining. So whats your message? Count every vote except for the ones I don't agree with? I'm sure you'll make a joke of it but hey thats essentially whats being said.<br />
<br />
Fact is there are a metric F-ton of views in this country and the people who agreed with bush outnumbered the people who agreed with kerry. Plain and simple, thats our method, and if ya don't like it then F'ing leave.<br />
<br />
I by no means like either one of the F***sticks we had to choose from and loosely call myself an &quot;anti-kerry bush supporter&quot;.  Which is sad to say when in this country more people cast there vote in spite then in support.<br />
<br />
But the thing that sets us apart from the other teaming masses of this world is the dignif....once dignified way in which presidential administrations were handed over.  But sore losers and whiny politics ruined that and now the people who are on the losing side republican or democrat are far to quick to jump on the &quot;sore loser&quot; band wagon and bitch about this and that.<br />
<br />
Ya know what, they picked up seats in the house &amp; the senate as well as the presidency.  I don't agree with a large portion of the Rep. policies but good god do you know how rare it is for control to rest on one party? You know what that means? They are doing something right.<br />
<br />
And before you conspiracy theorist jump in and start saying this and that about which senator stole which seat and all that crap, see my point about &quot;SORE LOSERS&quot;.<br />
<br />
Time for some folks in this country to grow some balls and let the other guy have his go, cause if you really truly think he is gonna F it up then you should be all to happy to let him trip over himself.<br />
<br />
my 2cents~</div></div><hr />

If you looked at real history you'd find this stays pretty much constant. Some people in care of children have always abused that trust... it's how we deal with it that's changed.<br />
<br />
On violent sexual crime, on the other hand, you could well have a point. <br />
<br />
And to come back to the original post. I don't like pornography but I  read that maybe 10% it's just people doing this because it's what they want to do (it's part of their sexuality)... another 10% it's a job... and maybe 80% it's the continuation of some kind of abuse. It's this 80% that genuinely upsets me.</div></div><hr />

Conspiracy theories rock!<br />
<br />
We should conduct a recount.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, it's time to stop the complaining and accusations.  Even if (and a big if) a few people across the nation were responsible for tampering with the election, they would have had to tamper with millions of votes to change the outcome of the election.  You can't really tamper with millions without people smelling foul play, especially with as much publicity and scrutiny as this election received.<br />
<br />
Bush won fair and square.  I'll agree he's not a good president.  Yes he did get my vote, but that's only because i disliked Kerry even more.  As to him using religion to get elected, I can guarantee you Kerry and every other politician that ever was uses such things to their advantage.  I don't like it any more than the next person, but you're blind if you don't think an equivalent amount of this horse shit happens on all sides of the fence.  IMO the democratic party uses such leverage far more than the republican part ... but that's just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Republicans believe in smaller government that spends less. Republicans believe in less government intrusion into your private life. Republicans believe in free trade. Republicans believe in a strong American economy. GW believes in none of these.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if, after all the information that was posted out there, both by the administration and by others couldn't inform you as to the appalling lack of fiscal policy besides 'voodoo economics redux', the expansionistic Neo-Trotskyite policy of his defense advisers, and the clear degradation of civil liberties and protections that four previous years brought you and another four will bring more of, then you're either blind, braindead, or in on the graft. Which are you?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi, you just defined the Libertarian party. <br />
The Republican party abandoned these principles a long time ago.<br />
I don't believe in the fight between dem/rep anymore, they are the same party playing out a drama which is entirely false but which keeps the American people voting for one of the other with a sportsman-like &quot;team spirit&quot;. It fits in remarkably well with our pop culture mediocrity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Sorry, chuckles, the Libertarian party is Anarchy with a side dish of extra bullshit. Too many of the ideas sound good in a TV ad, but fail to withstand the light of public scrutiny. (Legalizing drugs? Uh-huh. Flat tax? Stupidly regressive)<br />
<br />
 My reading of the Libertarian party platform is that they're all perpetually 15 year olds, mad at mom and dad for enforcing some kind of rules and regulations on their fun. Oh, and if this is offensive, I'm sorry, and I'll break out in some kind of orgy of crying for my destructive and dismissive thinking. Got a hanky?</div></div><hr />

<br />

you don't believe in that parental relationship extending to things like providing decent health care or a reasonable minimum wage<br />
<br />
This is what we don't understand about the new 'so called' conservatives in america. You seem full of self contradictions and we conclude that you must be either stupid, or deliberately self-deceving (i.e. basically mad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">12-05-2004, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really the way the right thinks now in america seems quite frightening and I think (whatever you may think of him) Michael Moore likening of it to 1984 seems very perceptive.<br />
<br />
My own analysis would be this:<br />
<br />
They believe that naturally human beings exist in a state of complete anarchy where might is right and it's just one man (always a man btw, this is the route of the chauvanism in right-wing american ideology) taking what he wants as his feeling take him (and naturally these feelings are bad... rape, murder etc). <br />
<br />
On top of this you can have mutual agreements to trade. This is the ONLY real level of human relationships... everything is reducible to some kind of trade or deal. <br />
<br />
This is the basic world view. This is why americans are so fond (when the rest of the world has left them far behind) of social darwinist ideas. <br />
<br />
Ok, now we come to religion. <br />
The sole purpose of religion is to provide a set of rules to regulate people so that the deal making level doesn't disintegrate into the natural state of total anarchy. These rules are arbitrary... this is why they cannot (in fact will not) argue for them or even discuss them. They just cannot think critically about them at all.<br />
To most of the rest of the world (tho funnily not the islamic extremists who pit themselves against america) this doen't seem like religion at all.<br />
<br />
Overall it seems like a particularily horrid kind of trap. From the outside it's obviously mistaken at all levels but you can see how, were you brought up inside it, you would be very hard pressed to ever find your way out. Very much like in 1984.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, try reading, I said there are a metric F-ton of VIEWS in the country. Which has nothing to do with something being 'done' or &quot;did&quot; as you said. <br />
<br />
Second, I don't get your point about the ballots...are you saying that in fact Kerry lost by more then is shown? Pretty obivous that would support what I said, and thus make sense.....so what am I missing?<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Also all the gay right votes were set on the same day, basically bush USED the religious people of america to tip things in his favor, he was also using mental pressure (stopping short of claiming he was gods alter boy for morals)... sad to say but they are to blind to see that this man is not even a religious person or a republican... <br />
<br />
So because bush got his BASE to agree with him ( omg how hard is that ), he &quot;USED&quot; them?? Way to twist it, but as long as we are looking through the lense, bush used his base the same amount kerry used his. <br />
<br />
I also have to say I am glad that you can inform us on the true G Bush.  Because without your close personal and intimate knowledge of him we would not of known he is not religous.....oh wait....nm.... your nobody and know jack and shit about him. The same amount most people know about their politicians true personality.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
If he was part of religion like he so claims he would not be clapping his hands to scare away demons to impress the leaders of nations that are JUST as bad as iraq at times.... he is not a republican because of how he spends and how he grows government power.<br />
<br />
I am not EVEN getting into a policy discussion, since they are mostly fundamental disagreements anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you trust this man to define a direction for america when he can not define himself is beyond me. <br />
<br />
As far as his direction, you once again assume that you know him.  You should seek help this is called obsession and is NOT healthy.<br />
<br />
Am I saying your wrong abotu bush? nope, I am saying you have know way of knowing, for all I know he could run around the white house nakid screaming and biting diplomats cause he likes the taste.  But until you or I can put some proof forward to support speculation maybe we should just keep our mouth shut, and by &quot;we&quot; I mean you.<br />
<br />
As a side note, your post was in general a cluttered mess of scattered thoughts and fairly difficult to sort through. I'm not asking for perfection, just that if your gonna post your thoughts you could at least do it in a somewhat structured manner.  With paragraphs being one topic etc....<br />
<br />
In closing, I regret having posted here in the first place as it is usually pointless anyways.  This case being no exception.  So post away your responce freely, I for one have determined the minute amount of damage my keyboard possibly suffers from me typing these messages is a sufficient detterent, and by far not worth the effort for the impossible chance of making a point that actually changes someone's view.</div></div><hr />

 You have, like most, completely misread my post. I forgive, you, however.<br />
<br />
 When I liken Libertarians to 15 year olds, think back. a 15 year old who's grounded for bad behavior spits, screams at the walls, feels (unjustly, of course) persecuted, and has an overriding belief that they should be able to live their life how they see fit. That's Libertarianism at it's worst, in believing that virtually all sectors of life should be left untouched by government, no matter how pervasive the effects among society.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It's my life, man, let ME live it!&quot; Which is a great philosophy as long as you don't give a damn about anyone else. Once you have to take care of someone else - an elderly relative, a child, a girlfriend, a wife - that attitude goes away quickly if you're a responsible adult.<br />
<br />
 And I've never said that the government should regulate my private morals. I'm a firm believer that the government has little business telling me who I should sleep with, as long as they're consenting adults. They also shouldn't be in the business of promoting religious values to intrude on people's private lives. Bush is all about making sure that folks who don't believe JUST LIKE HIM get screwed by the law of the land. Once again, not very Republican. He's just a used car salesman.</div></div><hr />

But I do get the feeling that the idealogues who get their support from this part of america actually do think how I have described. Just like communist parties received support from ordinary people because the things they say resonate with part of how we think and feel... these new idealogues of the 'right' work in the same way (and are just as terrifying).</div></div><hr />
